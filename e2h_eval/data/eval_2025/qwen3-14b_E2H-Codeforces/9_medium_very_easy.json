Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm. So the standard knapsack approach would be too slow here because with n=1e5 and m=3e5, a DP approach with O(nm) time is impossible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3. That's a key point. So maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFor items of weight 1: I can take as many as possible, but since they have different costs, I should take the ones with highest cost first. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But when combining them, there's a problem of choosing between different combinations. For example, taking one item of weight 3 vs two items of weight 2 (if their total cost is higher).\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Sort all items of each weight by their cost in descending order.\n- For each weight group, create a prefix sum array so that for any number of items taken, we can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nThen, the problem becomes selecting how many items from each weight group to take, such that the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute the best combination?\n\nLet me think. Let's say I have:\n\n- For weight 1: sorted list, prefix sums.\n- For weight 2: same.\n- For weight 3: same.\n\nLet me denote the count of weight 1 items as a, weight 2 as b, weight 3 as c. But since each item is unique, the counts are determined by the number of items in each group.\n\nSo for example, for weight 1, if there are k items, then taking x items (x ≤k) gives a total weight of x*1 and cost of prefix_sum_1[x].\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding x, y, z such that x + 2y + 3z ≤ m, and the sum of prefix_sum_1[x] + prefix_sum_2[y] + prefix_sum_3[z] is maximized.\n\nBut how do I iterate through all possible x, y, z? Since m can be up to 3e5, and x can be up to m (if all items are weight 1), this seems computationally heavy if done naively.\n\nAlternative idea: for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), and for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), compute the maximum x that can be taken given the remaining weight. But even that might be O(m^2) in worst case, which is not feasible.\n\nAnother approach: since the weight is small (only 1,2,3), perhaps we can find for each possible total weight, the maximum value by considering combinations of the three groups.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 3 items, say z, and for each possible number of weight 2 items, y, then the remaining weight is m - (3z + 2y). Then, we can take as many weight 1 items as possible, which is min(remaining_weight, count_1). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the top min(...) items gives the max cost.\n\nBut even with that, iterating over all possible z and y could be expensive. For example, if there are up to m/3 possible z values, and m/2 possible y values, then it's O(m^2/6) which for m=3e5 would be 3e5^2 / 6 = way too big (like 1.5e11 operations). Not feasible.\n\nSo that approach isn't going to work.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of weight 3 items, compute the optimal combination of weight 2 and weight 1 items. How?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I fix z (number of weight 3 items). Then, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*z. Now, I need to choose y (number of weight 2 items) and x (number of weight 1 items) such that 2y + x ≤ rem. And maximize prefix_sum_2[y] + prefix_sum_1[x].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for a given rem?\n\nThis is similar to the original problem but with weight 1 and 2 items. How can I compute the maximum for this subproblem?\n\nLet me think about the subproblem: given a capacity W (rem), and items of weight 1 and 2, with sorted prefix sums, find the maximum sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For each possible number of weight 2 items (say y), the maximum x is W - 2y. But since x can't exceed the number of weight 1 items available (let's call it cnt1). So for each y, the x is min( (W - 2y), cnt1 ), and then the total is prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(...)].\n\nBut again, iterating over all possible y here is O(W) per z. If z can be up to m/3, then this would be O(m^2) again.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's consider that for the subproblem of weight 1 and 2 items, given capacity W, what's the optimal way to select y and x?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), we can compute the maximum x as min(W - 2y, cnt1). However, since y can be up to min( (W) // 2, cnt2 ), perhaps we can find the optimal y in a smart way.\n\nBut even that, for each z, it's O(W) steps. Which for W up to m (3e5), and z up to m/3, would be O(m^2) again. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. Let me think. Since the items are sorted, for weight 1, we can take as many as possible. For weight 2, same. So for a given capacity W, the optimal choice is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. But how to find the best y (number of weight 2 items) for each W.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have for weight 2 items, a prefix sum array s2, where s2[y] is the total cost of taking the top y items. Similarly for weight 1, s1[x].\n\nFor a given W, the maximum value is max over all possible y (0 ≤ y ≤ min( cnt2, W//2 )) of (s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, cnt1 ) ] )\n\nNow, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: For each W, we can consider that the optimal y is either floor(W/2) or something close. But how to find the best y quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for the subproblem of weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible W up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nBut with W up to 3e5, and for each W, we can compute the max in O(1) time using preprocessed information.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 2 items, we can take up to k items, where k is the number of weight 2 items. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the corresponding weight is 2*y. The remaining weight is W - 2*y, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, the maximum x is min( (W - 2*y), cnt1 ). So for each possible y, we can compute the value.\n\nBut how to find the best y quickly.\n\nBut for a given W, the maximum possible y is min( (W // 2), cnt2 ). Let's say that's Y_max.\n\nSo the maximum value is max_{y=0}^{Y_max} [ s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2*y, cnt1 ) ] ]\n\nNow, for this, the function is a bit tricky. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking more of them is better (since they are sorted in descending order), but when you take more weight 2 items, you have less weight left for weight 1 items.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal y is around (W - x)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can consider two possibilities:\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill with weight 1.\n\nOR\n\n- Take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then fill with weight 2.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case. For example, maybe taking one less weight 2 item allows for more weight 1 items, which could give a better total.\n\nBut perhaps for each W, the optimal y is either floor( (W - x)/2 ), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible W the best combination. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nFor each possible number of weight 2 items taken, y, the maximum possible x is (W - 2y). But since x can't exceed the number of weight 1 items, cnt1.\n\nSo for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (up to Y_max) of s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, cnt1 ) ].\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently for all possible W?\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal y can be found in O(1) time if we precompute some data structures. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we need to process this for different W values (for each z, the rem is m - 3*z). So maybe for each possible W, we can compute the maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum x that can be taken for a given W. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each W, the optimal y is either the maximum possible y (i.e., take as many weight 2 as possible), or the maximum possible y minus one, etc. But this is not necessarily true.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that the optimal y is in the vicinity of (W) / 2. Let's think of an example. Suppose W is 100, and we have a lot of weight 2 items. Taking 50 weight 2 items uses 100 weight, leaving 0 for weight 1. Or, taking 49 weight 2 items (using 98 weight), leaving 2 for weight 1. But if the weight 1 items are very valuable, maybe taking 49 weight 2 items plus 2 weight 1 items is better than 50 weight 2 items.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nWell, perhaps for a given W, the optimal y is in the range of max(0, Y_max - k) to Y_max, where k is a small number like 100. But this depends on the data.\n\nBut given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can find that the optimal y is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus 1, etc., up to some small number. Because for the weight 2 items, taking more may not be optimal if the weight 1 items are more valuable.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is a feasible approach. For example, for each W, we can check y in the range of max(0, Y_max - 100) to Y_max, and pick the best one. But what if the optimal y is outside that range?\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the best possible for any W by considering all possible y up to min(Y_max, some limit). But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, the prefix sum for weight 1 is non-decreasing. Similarly for weight 2. So for each W, the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, cnt1) ] can be considered as a function that may have a single peak, allowing binary search. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for a fixed W, when y increases by 1, the 2y increases by 2, so the available weight for x decreases by 2. So the term s1[...] decreases by the value of the x-th item (if possible). However, the s2[y] increases by the value of the y-th item. So the trade-off between these two.\n\nBut again, how to find the maximum quickly.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items taken, and for each possible number, compute the maximum x that can be taken. Then, for each possible W, we can find the best combination.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = min(W, cnt1)), and no weight 2.\n\nOR\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible (y = min(W//2, cnt2)), and then take x = W - 2y.\n\nBut also, perhaps there's a better combination where you take y = (W//2) -1, etc. But if we check a few possibilities around the maximum possible y, perhaps we can find the optimal value.\n\nBut how many possibilities do I need to check?\n\nFor example, for each W, check the maximum possible y, and also y-1, y-2, ..., down to max(0, y - k), where k is like 100. Because if the weight 2 items are not too expensive, then taking fewer of them allows more weight 1 items, which may be better.\n\nBut how to choose k? Well, given that the weight 1 items can have high values, but since we're dealing with up to 3e5, even checking 300 possibilities per W would be acceptable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\nFor the main problem:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Precompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example, for weight 1, prefix1[i] = sum of the first i items (sorted descendingly). Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z) that can be taken (from 0 to min( (m//3), len(weight3)) ), compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*z. Then, for this rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items as described above.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum value efficiently.\n\nSo, for the rem, we can do the following:\n\nCompute the maximum between:\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill with weight 1.\n\n- Take as many weight 1 items as possible, then fill with weight 2.\n\nBut also check a few other possibilities around the maximum possible y.\n\nAlternatively, for the rem, compute the maximum y that can be taken (max_y = min( (rem // 2), len(weight2) )). Then, check y in the range max(0, max_y - 200) to max_y. For each y in this range, compute the corresponding x (min( rem - 2*y, len(weight1) )) and calculate the total value. Take the maximum among these.\n\nWhy 200? Well, because the maximum possible difference between the optimal y and max_y is not too big. For example, if the weight 1 items are very valuable, then taking fewer weight 2 items (but more weight 1) may be better. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, the first few items are the most valuable. So, even if we check up to 200 possibilities around max_y, we can cover the optimal case.\n\nBut how to choose this number? Well, considering that the weight of the items is small (1, 2, 3), and that for each check, the cost is O(1), even checking 300 possibilities per z would be acceptable.\n\nSo, for example, for each z, we compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip. Otherwise, for this rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items by checking all possible y in the range max(0, max_y - 200) to max_y. Then, take the maximum of those possibilities.\n\nBut why would this work? Because for the optimal y, it's either near the max possible y or near the min possible y. But perhaps not. However, given that the time constraints are tight, this might be the only feasible way.\n\nBut how to determine the correct number of possibilities to check. Let's think of a scenario where the optimal y is far away from max_y. For example, suppose the weight 2 items are very cheap, and the weight 1 items are very expensive. Then, the optimal is to take as many weight 1 items as possible. So, y = 0. But if the max_y is large, then checking up to 200 possibilities would include y=0 if the max_y is 200 or more. However, if the max_y is 1e5, then checking from max_y - 200 to max_y would miss the optimal y=0. Thus, this approach is not sufficient.\n\nSo, that approach is not correct. Therefore, I need another idea.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, given a capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- All possible y (number of weight 2 items taken) such that 2y <= W. But how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal y by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items, the corresponding x is W - 2y, but limited by the number of weight 1 items. So the total value is s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, cnt1 ) ].\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, cnt1 ) ].\n\nWe need to find the maximum of this function for y in [0, Y_max], where Y_max = min( cnt2, W // 2 )\n\nNow, since s2 is non-decreasing (as we add more items), and s1 is non-decreasing, but the term min(W - 2y, cnt1) is non-increasing as y increases. So the function f(y) is a combination of increasing and decreasing parts. It may have a single maximum point, but how to find it.\n\nAlternatively, since the function f(y) is unimodal (first increases, then decreases), we can use ternary search to find the maximum. But is this function unimodal?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for y increasing, initially adding a weight 2 item gives a larger gain than the loss of weight 1 items. But after some point, adding more weight 2 items causes the loss of weight 1 items to outweigh the gain. So the function may have a single peak.\n\nIf this is true, then ternary search can be applied to find the optimal y in O(log Y_max) time.\n\nBut how to confirm if this is the case.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose W is 5, and weight 1 items are [10, 9, 8, ...], weight 2 items are [5, 4, 3, ...]. So for y=0: x=5, value is 10+9+8+7+6 = 40. For y=1: 2*1=2, x=3 → 5 + (10+9+8) = 5+27=32. For y=2: 2*2=4, x=1 → 5+4 + 10 = 19. So the function decreases as y increases. Hence, maximum at y=0.\n\nAnother example: W=5, weight 2 items are [10, 9], weight 1 items are [5]. Then for y=0: x=5 → but only one item available. So 5. For y=1: 2*1=2, x=3 → 10 +5=15. For y=2: 2*2=4, x=1 → 10+9 +5 = 24. So the function increases with y. Hence, maximum at y=2.\n\nAnother example: W=5. Weight 2 items are [5, 5], weight 1 items are [5,5,5]. For y=0: x=5 → 3*5=15. For y=1: 2*1=2, x=3 → 5 + 3*5=20. For y=2: 2*2=4, x=1 → 5+5 +5 = 15. So the function increases to y=1, then decreases. Hence, unimodal.\n\nSo in this case, the function is unimodal. So perhaps it's safe to assume that the function is unimodal and apply ternary search.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, Y_max], and find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think.\n\nFor a given W, the function f(y) can be evaluated for any y in 0 ≤ y ≤ Y_max. We can perform ternary search between low=0 and high=Y_max. However, since the function may not be strictly unimodal (there may be plateaus), but for the purposes of finding the maximum, ternary search can still work.\n\nSo, for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y to find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nBut then, for each z (number of weight 3 items), we have to perform a ternary search on y for the corresponding W. Given that z can be up to m//3 (which is up to 1e5 for m=3e5), and each ternary search takes O(log Y_max) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nThe overall approach is:\n\n- Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items into sorted lists and their prefix sums.\n\n- For each possible number of weight 3 items (z) from 0 to min( (m // 3), len(weight3) ), compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*z.\n\n- For this rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items by performing a ternary search on y (number of weight 2 items taken), and for each candidate y, compute x as min( (rem - 2y), len(weight1) ), and get the value from prefix sums.\n\n- Keep track of the maximum total value across all z and their corresponding best y and x.\n\nNow, the question is how to handle the ternary search correctly.\n\nBut wait, what if the optimal y is not found via ternary search due to the function not being perfectly unimodal? Well, perhaps the function is not strictly unimodal, but in practice, ternary search will find a good enough approximation. Alternatively, we can check all possible candidates in the ternary search's final range.\n\nAlternatively, since the ternary search is applied on a small range, perhaps we can just iterate all possible y in the range of the ternary search's final low and high.\n\nBut regardless, for the sake of solving this problem, let's proceed with the ternary search approach.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, separate the items into three lists based on their weight. For example, w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost. Then, compute prefix sums for each list.\n\nFor example, for w1:\n\nprefix1[0] = 0\n\nprefix1[1] = w1[0]\n\nprefix1[2] = w1[0] + w1[1], etc.\n\nSimilarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nOnce we have these, then for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken):\n\n- The maximum possible z is min( len(w3), m // 3 )\n\n- For each z in 0 to that maximum:\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   if rem < 0: continue\n\n   Now, compute the best value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem.\n\n   To compute this, perform a ternary search on y (number of weight 2 items taken) in the range [0, Y_max], where Y_max = min( len(w2), rem // 2 )\n\n   The best value for this rem is then added to prefix3[z], and compared with the global maximum.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\nmax_total = 0\n\nfor z in 0 ... max_z:\n\n    rem = m - 3*z\n\n    if rem < 0:\n\n        continue\n\n    # compute best value for rem from weight 1 and 2 items\n\n    best_sub = compute_best(rem)\n\n    current_total = prefix3[z] + best_sub\n\n    if current_total > max_total:\n\n        max_total = current_total\n\nreturn max_total\n\nNow, the compute_best function would perform the ternary search.\n\nBut how to implement the ternary search.\n\nLet me think. The function f(y) is the value for a particular y. The ternary search would find the y that maximizes this function.\n\nBut since the function may not be strictly unimodal, perhaps it's better to check all possible y in the vicinity of the found maximum. However, for the sake of time, let's proceed with the ternary search approach.\n\nImplementing the ternary search for a given W (rem):\n\ndef compute_best(W):\n\n    Y_max = min( len(w2), W // 2 )\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = Y_max\n\n    best_val = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = get_value(mid1, W)\n\n        val2 = get_value(mid2, W)\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best_val = max(best_val, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best_val = max(best_val, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # After the loop, check the remaining candidates in [low, high]\n\n    for y in range(max(0, low - 200), min(Y_max, high + 200) + 1):\n\n        current_val = get_value(y, W)\n\n        if current_val > best_val:\n\n            best_val = current_val\n\n    return best_val\n\nWait, but this is a mix of ternary search and checking nearby values. Alternatively, after the ternary search, check all possible y in the range [low, high] (which might be small) to ensure that we find the maximum.\n\nBut for the purposes of this code, perhaps the ternary search can be implemented with a loop that runs for a fixed number of steps (like 100 times), which would be sufficient to converge to the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach for the compute_best function:\n\ndef compute_best(W):\n\n    Y_max = min(len(w2), W // 2)\n\n    # the maximum y can be up to Y_max\n\n    # for each possible y in 0 to Y_max, compute the value.\n\n    # but since Y_max can be up to 1.5e5 (if W is 3e5), this would be O(1.5e5) per compute_best, which multiplied by z (up to 1e5) would be O(1.5e10) operations. Not feasible.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nThus, back to the ternary search idea. But how to implement it correctly.\n\nAnother way to think: For each possible W, the optimal y is such that the marginal gain of adding one more weight 2 item is less than the marginal loss of removing two weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the best x for a given y is min( (W - 2y), cnt1 ), and the value is s1[x]. So, for each y, the value is s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, cnt1 ) ].\n\nLet me think of this as a function of y. For each increase in y by 1, the 2y increases by 2, so the available weight for x decreases by 2. Thus, the x decreases by 2, unless the available weight is already zero.\n\nBut since the weight 1 items are sorted, the loss in x's value is the sum of the next two items (if they exist). However, the gain in y's value is the value of the next weight 2 item.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible W, the optimal y is such that the next weight 2 item is more valuable than the two weight 1 items that would be lost by taking it. But again, how to find this.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can find the optimal y by comparing the next weight 2 item with the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut this seems like a greedy approach, which may not always work.\n\nFor example, suppose the weight 2 items are [10, 5], and the weight 1 items are [9, 9, 9]. For W=4.\n\nIf I take y=0: x=4, but there are only 3 items. So sum is 9+9+9=27.\n\nIf I take y=1: 2*1=2, x=2 → sum is 10 + 9+9 = 28.\n\nIf I take y=2: 2*2=4, x=0 → sum is 10+5=15.\n\nSo the optimal is y=1. Here, the next weight 2 item (10) is more valuable than the two weight 1 items (9+9=18?), no. Wait, 10 is less than 18. So why is taking it better?\n\nBecause the loss is 9 (since x was 3, now x is 1 (because 4-2*1=2, but 2 items can be taken. Wait, original x was min(4, 3) =3. After taking y=1, x is min(4-2*1=2, 3) =2. So the loss is 9 (the third item) and gain is 10. So net gain is +1.\n\nAh, so the comparison is between the value of the weight 2 item and the value of the weight 1 items that are displaced. In this case, the weight 2 item is worth 10, and the displaced weight 1 items are the 9 that would have been taken (since x decreased by 1). So the gain is 10 -9 = +1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nThis suggests that the optimal y is the maximum number of weight 2 items such that the next weight 2 item is more valuable than the next two weight 1 items (or whatever is needed to fill the weight).\n\nBut this is getting complex.\n\nPerhaps the ternary search approach is still the way to go, even if it's not perfect. Let's proceed with implementing it.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nLet's proceed with writing the code.\n\nFirst, separate the items into three groups.\n\nThen, sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example:\n\nw1 = sorted list of weight 1 items in descending order.\n\nprefix1 = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n\n    prefix1.append( prefix1[-1] + w1[i] )\n\nSimilarly for w2 and w3.\n\nThen, for each possible z in 0 to len(w3), but ensuring 3*z <= m.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can compute the maximum possible z as min( len(w3), m // 3 )\n\nThen, for each z in 0 to max_z:\n\nrem = m - 3*z\n\nif rem < 0: continue\n\nthen compute the best value from weight 1 and 2 items for rem.\n\nNow, the compute_best function.\n\nImplementing the ternary search:\n\ndef get_value(y, W):\n\n    # returns the value of taking y weight 2 items and as much weight 1 as possible.\n\n    available = W - 2 * y\n\n    x = min(available, len(w1))\n\n    return prefix2[y] + prefix1[x]\n\nThen, for a given W, perform ternary search on y between 0 and Y_max.\n\nBut how to implement the ternary search.\n\nLet me think of the following code for the compute_best function:\n\ndef compute_best(W):\n\n    Y_max = min( len(w2), W // 2 )\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = Y_max\n\n    best = 0\n\n    # perform ternary search for about 100 iterations\n\n    for _ in range(100):\n\n        if high - low <= 3:\n\n            # check all possible y in this range\n\n            for y in range(low, high + 1):\n\n                current = get_value(y, W)\n\n                if current > best:\n\n                    best = current\n\n            break\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        v1 = get_value(mid1, W)\n\n        v2 = get_value(mid2, W)\n\n        if v1 < v2:\n\n            best = max(best, v2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, v1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    return best\n\nThis way, after some iterations of ternary search, we check all possible y in the small range. This should find the maximum.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['1 1\\n2 1']\n\nWhich is n=1, m=1. The item has weight 2, cost 1. Since the total weight is 1, which is less than 2, Petya can't take it. Output is 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n['2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2']\n\nn=2, m=2. Items: (1,3) and (2,2). The best is to take the first item (weight 1, cost 3). Output is 3.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n['4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nn=4, m=3. The items are:\n\nweight 3: cost 10.\n\nweight 2: cost 7 and 8.\n\nweight 1: cost 1.\n\nSo, the best is to take the weight 3 item (cost 10), which uses 3 weight. Total is 10.\n\nNow, let's see how the code would handle this.\n\nFor z=1 (taking one weight 3 item), rem = 3 - 3*1 = 0. So for rem=0, the compute_best(0) would return 0. So total is 10 + 0 = 10.\n\nOther possibilities: z=0. rem=3. Now, compute best from weight 1 and 2.\n\nY_max is min( len(w2)=2, 3//2=1). So Y_max=1.\n\nCheck y=0 and y=1.\n\nFor y=0: available is 3 → x= min(3, len(w1)=1) → 1. Value is prefix2[0] + prefix1[1] = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nFor y=1: available is 3-2=1 → x=1. Value is prefix2[1] (which is 7) + prefix1[1] (1) → 8. So best is 8. So total is prefix3[0] (0) + 8 = 8. So overall maximum is 10.\n\nSo code would return 10, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nNow, what about cases where there are multiple items in each group.\n\nBut the code seems to handle it.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut handling large n (up to 1e5) and m up to 3e5.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each with wi and ci.\n\nSeparate into w1, w2, w3 lists.\n\nSort each list in",
