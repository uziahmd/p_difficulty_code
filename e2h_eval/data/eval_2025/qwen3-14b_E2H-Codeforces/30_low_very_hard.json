Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that Homer and Marge are playing a game where they take turns picking digits from the front of a number A. Each player takes exactly n moves, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of moves (H for Homer and M for Marge) that achieves this maximum sum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The key here is that each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number. Then that digit is removed from A. So for example, if A is 1234 and n is 2, then each player takes two digits. The order of taking determines which digits each gets.\n\nThe challenge is to choose the order of H and M such that the sum of their numbers is maximized. But since the numbers are formed by appending digits, the order of digits in each player's number matters. For example, if Homer takes digits 1 then 2, his number is 12, but if he takes 2 then 1, it's 21, which is bigger. So the order in which they take digits directly affects their values.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since the problem requires choosing between H and M at each step, with the constraint that each has exactly n moves, this seems like a dynamic programming problem. However, the state space might be too large for n up to 18. Let's think about the possible states.\n\nLet me consider the state as (number of H moves taken so far, number of M moves taken so far, current position in the string A). Wait, but the current position in A can be determined by the number of digits taken so far. Since each move takes one digit, the number of digits taken so far is equal to the number of H and M moves made. For example, after k moves, the first k digits have been taken, so the remaining digits are the substring starting at index k.\n\nSo, the state could be represented by the number of H moves and M moves made so far. Let's denote h as the number of H moves and m as the number of M moves. Since each player must make exactly n moves, we have h + m = current step. Also, the total steps is 2n, so for each state, the number of digits taken so far is h + m.\n\nAt each step, the next player can be either H or M, but subject to the constraints that h < n and m < n. So for each state (h, m), we can decide whether to take H or M next, provided that the counts are not exceeded.\n\nBut the problem is that the choice of taking H or M now affects the future possibilities. The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2. How do we compute the sum based on the choices made?\n\nWait, the sum depends on the digits each player has collected. However, when building S1 and S2, the order of digits matters. For example, if Homer takes digits d1, d2, ..., dn, then his number is d1d2...dn. Similarly for Marge. So the value of S1 is the integer formed by those digits, same for S2. The sum is S1 + S2.\n\nBut how do we compute this during the DP transitions? Because the digits are added in order, the value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which the digits are added. However, for the purposes of maximizing the sum, perhaps we can model the contribution of each digit based on its position in the final number.\n\nFor example, the first digit taken by Homer contributes to the highest place value (like 10^(n-1)), the second digit contributes 10^(n-2), etc. Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo, for each digit that is taken by a player, its contribution to the total sum depends on when it was taken. For instance, if Homer takes a digit at step i (where i is the step in the overall process), but that's not directly the position in his own number. Let's think:\n\nEach player takes exactly n digits. Suppose Homer takes his first digit at step k, then his next at step l, etc. The first digit he takes will be the first digit of his number, contributing digit * 10^{n-1}, the second digit he takes will contribute digit * 10^{n-2}, and so on until the nth digit, which contributes digit * 10^0.\n\nSo, for each digit that a player takes, the contribution depends on the order in which the player took the digits. However, this seems complicated to track because the DP state would need to know the order of digits taken by each player. That's impossible for n=18, as the state space",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total sum of their numbers is maximized. The solution involves dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently explore all possible move sequences while keeping track of the contributions of each digit based on its position in the players' numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where each state is represented by the number of moves made by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`). The state transitions depend on whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit.\n2. **Digit Contribution Calculation**: Each digit's contribution to the total sum depends on its position in the respective player's number. For example, the first digit taken by a player contributes more than subsequent digits due to higher place value.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating states, we use memoization to store results of subproblems.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        current_digit = A[h + m]\n        # Current position is h + m, and the remaining digits are A[h+m:]\n        # We can choose H or M, but subject to h < n and m < n\n        best_val = -1\n        best_str = \"\"\n        if h < n:\n            # Choose H\n            new_h = h + 1\n            val = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - new_h))\n            next_val, next_str = dp(new_h, m)\n            total_val = val + next_val\n            if total_val > best_val or (total_val == best_val and (best_str == \"\" or next_str < best_str)):\n                best_val = total_val\n                best_str = \"H\" + next_str\n        if m < n:\n            # Choose M\n            new_m = m + 1\n            val = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - new_m))\n            next_val, next_str = dp(h, new_m)\n            total_val = val + next_val\n            if total_val > best_val or (total_val == best_val and (best_str == \"\" or next_str < best_str)):\n                best_val = total_val\n                best_str = \"M\" + next_str\n        return (best_val, best_str)\n\n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined with parameters `h` (number of moves Homer has made) and `m` (number of moves Marge has made). It returns the maximum total value and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n2. **Base Case**: When all digits have been taken (`h + m == 2 * n`), the function returns a value of 0 and an empty string.\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each state, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit). The contribution of the current digit is calculated based on its position in the player's number, which affects the place value (power of 10).\n4. **Memoization**: Using `lru_cache`, we store results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible move sequences efficiently while maximizing the sum of the players' numbers, considering the constraints and digit positions.",
