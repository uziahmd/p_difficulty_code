The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me understand the construction rules again.\n\nSo, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. And this process is done at least once. Wait, so the second step must happen at least once. So the minimal case would be when we have the initial vertex, then add k children, and then each of those children adds k more. But the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nLet me rephrase the construction:\n\nThe initial vertex is the root. Then, in the first expansion, we add k children to it. Now, each of these children is a leaf (since they have only one connection). Then, each such leaf must be connected to k new vertices. This step is done at least once. So after this second expansion, the total number of nodes would be 1 (root) + k (first level) + k * k (second level) = 1 + k + k². But wait, the problem says that each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. So each time you do this step, you take all the current leaves (those with degree 1), and add k children to them. And this step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two expansions: the initial step (adding k children), then expanding each of those once. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. But maybe there are more steps. For example, after that, you could do another expansion where each of the leaves (the ones added in the second step) get k children each. So the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do it once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. However, there might be other possibilities where you do multiple expansions. For example, maybe the snowflake is constructed by doing the expansion step m times. Let's think about that.\n\nLet me model the total number of nodes. Let's suppose that the expansion is done m times. How does that affect the total?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Initially, there's 1 node.\n- After the first expansion (adding k children to the root), there are 1 + k nodes. Then, each of the k leaves gets k children. So the next expansion adds k * k nodes. Then, each of those leaves would get k children, adding k^3, etc.\n\nWait, but the expansion steps are done as follows: Each time you perform an expansion, you take all the current leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous expansion step) and add k children to each of them. So the number of nodes added in each expansion step is equal to the number of leaves multiplied by k. Let's model the total number of nodes after m expansion steps.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitially, the root is a single node. The first expansion (step 1) adds k nodes. So after step 1, the number of nodes is 1 + k. Then, step 2 adds k * k nodes (since there are k leaves, each adding k children). Now total is 1 + k + k^2. Then step 3 adds k^2 * k = k^3 nodes, total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on. So after m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Wait, but the initial step is the first expansion (adding k nodes). Then the next expansion is the second step, which adds k^2 nodes. So for m expansion steps, the sum is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i. Wait, no. Because the first expansion (step 1) adds k^1 nodes, the second adds k^2, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m >= 1. Therefore, the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 1 and k > 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the initial step (adding k children) is part of the construction. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf must be done at least once. So the initial expansion (adding the first k children) is required. Then, the next step (adding k children to each of those) is done once. So the minimal case is m=2, leading to S = 1 + k + k^2. Or maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step is adding k children to the root. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of the leaves (the ones added in the first step). This step must be done at least once. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But what if there are more steps? For example, after that, we can again do the step: take all leaves (those added in the second step) and add k children to each. Then the total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes can be written as 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, because the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i = 1 + [k^{m+1} -k]/(k-1). Wait, let me compute that sum.\n\nThe sum from i=1 to m of k^i is S = k + k^2 + ... +k^m = k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). So the total number of nodes is 1 + S = 1 + [k*(k^m -1)]/(k-1).\n\nBut since m must be at least 1. So for any valid snowflake, there exists some integer m ≥ 1 and integer k ≥ 2 such that n equals 1 + [k*(k^m -1)]/(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, we can rewrite that formula. Let me compute:\n\nLet me denote the sum as:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 and k ≥ 2.\n\nBut this sum is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Because the sum of a geometric series from 0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But our sum starts from 0 (the initial 1) plus the sum from 1 to m. Wait, no. The initial sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So yes. So n must be equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. Which in terms of the formula, corresponds to m ≥ 1. Because the sum for m=1 would be 1 +k. But according to the problem's rules, the step of adding k children to each leaf (the first expansion) must be done at least once. So when m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem's construction, the step of adding k children to each leaf (the initial step) is done once. Wait, the initial step is adding k children. Then, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. But in that case, m would be 1? Or perhaps I need to re-express the parameters.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k children (so the first expansion). Then, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. That would be adding k^2 nodes, making the total 1 +k +k^2. So in this case, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m+1 is 3, meaning m=2. So perhaps the formula is n = (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2 (since m ≥1 implies d = m+1 ≥ 2). Because for d=2, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would correspond to the case where we have the initial node and then added k children. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. But in that case, the initial step (adding k children) is the first expansion. Then, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done once. So for d=2, the sum is k+1. But that would imply that the expansion step was done once? No, that seems conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the construction steps again. Let's think of the steps:\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step is done once. Which means that each leaf (the k children) is connected to k new vertices. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So d=3 here. So for this case, the formula is n = (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2. Because d=2 would be (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k + 1. Which would be the case where we have only the initial node and the first expansion (adding k children). But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. Which in this case, the initial expansion (adding k children) is not considered an expansion step. Wait, perhaps the problem's construction requires that after the initial step (adding k children), the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. So the initial step is required, and then the expansion step must be done once. So the minimal case is 1 +k +k^2. Therefore, the formula for n is (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 3? No, that doesn't fit. Because for d=2, the formula gives (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k + 1, which is 1 +k. Which would be the case where the initial step is done (adding k children) and the expansion step is not done. Which is invalid. So that suggests that the expansion step must be done at least once, which requires that the formula for n is (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 3. Because for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case where the expansion step is done once. So the problem requires that the expansion step is done at least once. Thus, the possible values of n are numbers that can be expressed as (k^d -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2, d ≥ 3. Wait, but what about when d=2? For example, if d=2, then (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k + 1. So n =k +1. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step must be done once. So in this case, the initial step (adding k children) is done, but the expansion step is not done. Which is invalid. Therefore, for the problem's constraints, the formula is n = (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d ≥ 2, but with the additional condition that d ≥ 2 and the expansion step is done at least once. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The problem's construction steps:\n\nStart with one node.\n\nAdd k children to it. Now, the root has degree k. Each of the k children has degree 1. Then, each of those k children must be connected to k new vertices. This step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So this step is done once. So after that, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k². Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So d=3. So the formula for n is (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d ≥ 3. But what if we do the expansion step more than once? Like, after adding k² nodes, we again add k children to each of those leaves. So then the total is 1 +k +k² +k³ = (k^4 -1)/(k-1). So d=4. So the general formula is n = (k^d -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2 and d ≥ 3. Wait, but what if d=2? Then the formula would be (k²-1)/(k-1) = k + 1. Which would be the case where the expansion step was not done. So for n to be valid, it must be expressible as (k^d -1)/(k-1) with k ≥ 2 and d ≥ 3.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children) is part of the construction. Then the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. So the minimal case is d=3. So the allowed values of n are those that can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for integers k ≥2 and d ≥ 3. However, there's also the possibility that the expansion step is done multiple times. So for example, d=3 (once), d=4 (twice), etc.\n\nBut there's another possibility: perhaps the expansion step is done once, but with different k. For example, maybe the snowflake is built with k=2 and d=3, or with k=3 and d=3, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in the form (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and d ≥3.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. For each test case n, we need to check whether there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nNote that (k^d -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for example, for d=3, it's 1 +k +k² = n.\n\nFor d=4, 1 +k +k² +k³ =n.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check whether it can be represented in such a way.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check all possible k and d.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of d. Since for fixed d, the value of k can be found via binary search. But since d can be up to log_2(n), because for d=3, the minimal value is 1+2+4=7. For larger d, the minimal value increases. Wait, for example, for d=3, the minimal value is 7 (k=2). For d=4, minimal is 1+2+4+8=15. For d=5, 31, etc. So for a given n, the maximum possible d is log_2(n). For example, if n is 1e18, then the maximum possible d is around 60 (since 2^60 is ~1e18).\n\nSo for each possible d (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)), we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1} =n.\n\nSo for each d from 3 up to say 60, we can perform a binary search for k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], where upper_bound can be determined based on n and d.\n\nLet's formalize this. For a given d, the equation is sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n. Let's denote this as S(k,d) =n.\n\nWe can compute S(k,d) for varying k and d. For each d, find if there exists a k such that S(k,d) =n.\n\nNow, for a given d, S(k,d) is a strictly increasing function of k. So for each d, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. The upper bound can be determined as follows: since S(k,d) = (k^d -1)/(k-1) ≥k^{d-1} (since for k≥2, the sum is at least k^{d-1} + ... +k^0 ≥k^{d-1}).\n\nSo for S(k,d) =n, we have k^{d-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, for each d, the maximum possible k is about n^{1/(d-1)}. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper], where upper is floor(n^{1/(d-1)}).\n\nBut how do we compute this upper bound efficiently? Well, for binary search, even if we set the upper bound as n, the binary search will still work because for higher k, S(k,d) will quickly exceed n.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can calculate the upper limit as n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is less than the minimal possible value (which is 7, since for d=3 and k=2, 1+2+4=7), then return NO.\n\n- Else, iterate over d from 3 up to log_2(n) +1 (since for d=3, the minimal is 7, and for higher d, the minimal increases). For each d, perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k ≥2 such that S(k,d)=n.\n\nIf any of these checks returns true, then answer YES, else NO.\n\nBut how do we handle d? Let's think about the maximum possible d. For example, for n=1e18, the maximum d would be such that when k=2, the sum is 2^d -1 (since sum_{i=0}^{d-1} 2^i = 2^d -1). So for 2^d -1 <=1e18 →d ≤log2(1e18 +1) ≈60. So for d up to 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can loop d from 3 up to 60 (or until the sum for k=2 is larger than n).\n\nNow, for each d, perform a binary search on k.\n\nLet me think about how to compute S(k,d) for given k and d. For large d and k, this could be a big number. However, since n is up to 1e18, and d is up to 60, even for k=2 and d=60, the sum is 2^60 -1 which is about 1e18. So for each k and d, we can compute the sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo the steps for a given d and k:\n\nCompute s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nBut for large exponents, we can compute this as follows:\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nFor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n   total +=k^i\n\nBut for large exponents, this could be time-consuming. However, since d is up to 60, and t is 1e4, this is manageable.\n\nBut even better, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^d -1)/(k-1). However, for large exponents, calculating k^d may be problematic due to overflow. But since n is up to 1e18, and k is up to n^(1/(d-1)), which for d=3 is up to n^(1/2) (sqrt(1e18) is 1e9), but computing k^d for d=60 and k=1e9 would be 1e540, which is way beyond what can be stored in Python's integers. However, during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if the sum exceeds n. So for example, during the calculation of the sum, if at any step the total exceeds n, we can break and return that the sum is larger than n.\n\nSo for a given k and d, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   if sum >n:\n\n       return sum\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nreturn sum\n\nThis way, we can avoid dealing with very large numbers, and also detect when the sum exceeds n early.\n\nSo during binary search for k, for a given d, we can compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nNow, the algorithm steps for each test case:\n\nCheck if n is 1: then no (since for d≥3, the minimal is 7). For n=2,3, etc., same.\n\nElse:\n\n   For d from 3 up to max_d (like 60):\n\n      low = 2\n\n      high = some upper bound (like n^(1/(d-1)) )\n\n      perform binary search for k in [low, high] to find if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\n      If found, return YES.\n\n   Also, check for d=2? Wait, no. Because according to the problem's rules, the expansion step must be done at least once. So for d=2, the sum is 1 +k, which would be the case where the initial step is done (adding k children) but the expansion step is not done. Which is invalid. So d must be ≥3.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Suppose that d=2. Then the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. For example, if k=2, then sum is 3. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step must be done at least once. However, in this case, the expansion step wasn't done. So for d=2, the sum is invalid. Therefore, we must not consider d=2.\n\nSo, the code must check d starting from 3.\n\nNow, what about the case where n is 7 (which is 1+2+4). That would be d=3, k=2. So for that case, the code would find it.\n\nAnother example: n=13. Let's see. For d=3, solving 1 +k +k^2 =13 →k^2 +k +1 =13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48 )) /2 →sqrt(49)=7 →k=( -1 +7)/2=3. So k=3. So sum is 1+3+9=13. So answer is YES. Which matches the sample input where n=13 outputs YES.\n\nAnother example: n=6. For d=3, 1 +k +k² =6 →k² +k -5=0. The roots are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2. Not integer. So no solution. For d=4, 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =6. Trying k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no. So answer is NO. Which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n < 7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to max_d:\n\n      compute the possible k via binary search.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\n   also, check for d=1 or d=2? No, since d starts from 3.\n\nBut what about other possibilities where the snowflake is built with different steps. For example, maybe there's a case where the expansion steps are done multiple times but with varying k? No, because the formula is fixed once k and d are chosen.\n\nBut what about cases where the snowflake is built with different expansion steps. For example, maybe the expansion steps are done once, but with varying k. But the formula already covers that.\n\nNow, how to compute max_d. For a given n, the maximum possible d is when k=2. Because for larger d, the sum grows exponentially. So for example, for d_max, 2^d_max -1 <=n →d_max is log2(n+1). So for n up to 1e18, d_max can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can loop d from 3 to 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\nNow, for each d in 3 to 60:\n\n   perform binary search on k.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k in binary search. For a given d, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} <=n. Since each term is positive, the sum is at least k^{d-1} (since 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1}).\n\nSo k^{d-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nBut calculating this in Python can be done with integer exponentiation. However, for binary search, even if we set high to n, it's manageable. Because for each d, the binary search would have O(log n) steps, and for each step, the sum calculation is O(d) steps. Since d is up to 60, and t is 1e4, the total steps are acceptable.\n\nSo for each d, perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper], where upper can be set as n.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can compute upper as something like n^(1/(d-1)) +1. But for the purposes of binary search, even if we set upper to n, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code for each d:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = n\n\nfound = False\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   compute sum for mid and d.\n\n   if sum ==n → return YES.\n\n   elif sum <n → need to increase k →low = mid +1\n\n   else → high = mid -1\n\nBut how to compute the sum. Let's write a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for d steps. Because for d terms (from 0 to d-1 exponents). For example, d=3, the loop runs 3 times, adding 1, k, k^2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each k and d, compute_sum returns the sum. If during the computation it exceeds n, returns early.\n\nSo in the binary search, for each mid, we compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=7 →d=3, k=2. compute_sum(2,3) →1+2+4=7. So returns YES.\n\nCase 2: n=15 →d=3, k=3 →1+3+9=13 <15. d=4, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=255. Let's see. For d=3: 1 +k +k² =255 →k² +k -254=0 →k=(-1 + sqrt(1 + 1016 )) /2 →sqrt(1017) is approx 31.89 →k=(30.89)/2 ~15.4. So trying k=15: 1+15+225=241 <255. k=16: 1+16+256= 273>255. So no solution for d=3. What about d=4? 1 +k +k² +k^3 =255. Let's try k=4: 1+4+16+64= 85. k=5: 1+5+25+125= 156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259. Close. 259>255. So no. What about d=8? For example, k=2: sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. So (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. So d=8, k=2. So yes. So for n=255, answer is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's think why. For example, if there's a k and d such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =1e18. Let's see. For d=3, solving 1 +k +k² =1e18. Let's approximate k² ≈1e18 →k≈1e9. Let's compute for k=1e9: 1e9^2 +1e9 +1 ≈1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So maybe k is around 1e9 - something. But perhaps there's no integer solution. Also, for d=2, which is invalid. For d=4, trying k=... Well, but the code would check for all d up to 60. However, the sample says that for n=1e18, the answer is NO. So the code must not find any k and d.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n <7 → print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   flag = False\n\n   for d in 3 to 60:\n\n      low =2\n\n      high = n\n\n      while low <=high:\n\n         mid = (low + high) //2\n\n         s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n         if s ==n:\n\n             flag = True\n\n             break\n\n         elif s <n:\n\n             low = mid +1\n\n         else:\n\n             high = mid -1\n\n      if flag:\n\n          break\n\n   if flag:\n\n      print(\"YES\")\n\n   else:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, for the compute_sum function, we need to pass n as a parameter. Also, in Python, for very large numbers, the compute_sum function may take O(d) steps, which for d up to 60 is manageable.\n\nBut for each test case, the code loops d from 3 to 60 (say, up to 60), and for each d, performs a binary search. For each binary search step, compute_sum is O(d) steps. So for t=1e4, and each test case having 60 d's, and each binary search having up to log2(n) steps (say 60 steps), and each compute_sum being 60 steps, the total steps are 1e4 * 60 * 60 *60 = 1e4 * 2.16e5 = 2.16e9 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because 2.16e9 operations would take way longer than the allowed time. So this approach is not feasible for the given constraints.\n\nSo we need to optimize this.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible d (up to 60), the binary search for k can be optimized.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute the maximum d for which (k^d -1)/(k-1) can be up to 1e18.\n\nBut even then, the problem remains. How can we reduce the time complexity?\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible d (from 3 to 60), compute the possible k's in a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the equation:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nk^d -1 = (k-1)*n →k^d - (k-1)*n -1 =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is not straightforward.\n\nBut for a given d, and for a given n, we can find k via binary search. However, the binary search for each d is O(log n) steps, and for each step, the compute_sum is O(d) steps. For d up to 60, and t=1e4, this would be O(1e4 * 60 * log(1e18) * 60) → 1e4 * 60 * 60 * 60 → which is about 1e4 * 2.16e5 = 2.16e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible d, the maximum possible value of d is small. For example, for d=3, the minimal n is 7. For d=60, the minimal n is 2^60 -1 / (2-1) = 2^60 -1 ≈ 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to 60.\n\nBut for each d, the binary search can be optimized. Let's think about how many possible d's there are. For example, for d from 3 to 60, that's 58 possible d's. For each of them, we need to check whether there exists a k.\n\nBut for each d, the binary search for k can be optimized by finding the upper bound for k.\n\nAs earlier, for a given d, the minimal k is 2, and the maximal possible k is such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i ≤n. Since sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i ≥k^{d-1}, then k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nSo for each d, the upper bound for k is n^{1/(d-1)}. We can compute this as int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2.\n\nBut in Python, we can compute this with pow(n, 1/(d-1)), but since we need to handle large exponents, perhaps using integer binary search is better.\n\nBut even so, for each d, the upper bound for k is small. For example, for d=3, n=1e18, the upper bound is 1e9. For d=60, the upper bound is n^(1/59) which is about 1e18^(1/59) ≈ e^( (ln(1e18))/59 ) → ln(1e18) is 41.5 → divided by 59 is about 0.7 → e^0.7 is about 2. So upper bound is 2.\n\nSo for larger d, the upper bound is small, and binary search for k is fast.\n\nThus, for each d, the binary search for k can be optimized by setting the high to n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nBut how to compute this upper bound?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as follows:\n\nupper_k = int(n **",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints.
