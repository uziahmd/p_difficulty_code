The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is iterative. Let me think about the structure. Each time we add layers. Let's model the number of vertices after each step.\n\nLet me consider the construction steps. Let's think of the snowflake as a tree. Because each step adds new nodes connected to existing ones. Also, since each new node added is connected to exactly one parent, the graph is a tree. But the snowflake is an undirected graph, but the construction implies it's a tree.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's take k as a fixed integer greater than 1. The construction process starts with a root node. Then, the first step adds k children to the root. Then, each of those children (which are leaves) must have k children added. This process continues for some number of steps.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new vertices to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do that once. For example, for k=4: initial node (1), then add 4 children (total 5). Then each of those 4 leaves gets 4 new children. So the total is 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21? Wait, but the example given says that the smallest snowflake for k=4 is shown, and the example input includes n=13 which outputs YES. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait, the example input has n=13 as a yes. Let's see. How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think again. Let's model the possible numbers of vertices.\n\nThe snowflake construction must start with 1 node. Then, the first expansion adds k nodes. Then, each leaf (which are the nodes added in the first expansion) must be expanded by adding k nodes each. So, for example, if we do this once:\n\nInitial: 1 node.\n\nAfter first step (adding k nodes): 1 + k.\n\nAfter second step (each of the k leaves gets k new nodes): 1 + k + k * k = 1 + k + k².\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new vertices to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal steps are two steps: the initial step (adding k nodes) and then the second step (adding k nodes to each of the initial leaves). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, what if we do more steps? For example, after the second step, the leaves are the ones added in the second step. Then, each of them can be expanded again. So the total would be 1 + k + k² + k³, etc.\n\nSo for any number of steps m ≥ 1 (where m is the number of times we do the expansion steps beyond the initial step?), or maybe m is the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the construction can be thought of as follows:\n\nThe snowflake is built in layers. The root is layer 0. Then, layer 1 consists of the k children of the root. Then, each node in layer 1 has k children in layer 2. And so on. However, the process must have at least one expansion beyond the initial step. So the minimum number of layers is 2. For example, layer 0 (1 node), layer 1 (k nodes), layer 2 (k² nodes). Total nodes is 1 + k + k². But if you do another expansion, then layer 3 adds k³ nodes, making total 1 + k + k² + k³, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes n can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the second step is required at least once). Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes (so layer 1). Then, the next step is adding k nodes to each of the layer 1 nodes. That's layer 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But if you do another step, adding k nodes to each of the layer 2 nodes, then the total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nSo for a given k and m ≥ 1, the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But m can be any integer ≥ 1. However, note that the initial step is adding k nodes (so m=1 gives S = 1 +k, but according to the problem statement, the step of adding new vertices to leaves must be done at least once. Wait, perhaps the initial step is not counted as a step. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding new vertices to leaves (the ones that are connected to only one other vertex) must be done at least once. So that step is done once or more.\n\nSo for example, the minimal case is:\n\nAfter initial step: 1 + k nodes. Then, the step is done once: each leaf (the k nodes from the initial step) is connected to k new nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k + k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nIf the initial step is adding k nodes (so m=1?), then the step of adding to leaves is done once, leading to m=2. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So the general formula is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) - (k^0) ? Wait, no. Wait, the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for our case, the minimal m is 2? No, let's think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k². Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the number of terms is m+1 where m is the exponent. So for the snowflake, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nNo, because if m is 1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first step. Then, the step of adding to leaves is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k². Which would be sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So m is 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 1 (the depth). But for d=1, the sum is 1 +k. However, in that case, the step of adding to leaves (the initial step) was done zero times. Wait, the problem says that the step must be done at least once. So for example, when d=1, the initial step is adding k nodes. But then the step of adding to leaves (the leaves are the k nodes added in the initial step) must be done at least once. So in that case, the sum would be 1 +k +k². So the minimal d is 2. So the sum is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2. Therefore, for the snowflake to exist, n must be equal to such a sum for some k>1 and d≥2.\n\nWait, but what if we have multiple steps? For example, after adding the initial k nodes (d=1), then adding once (d=2), and then adding again (d=3). So the sum would be 1 +k +k² +k³. So the general form is that n must be equal to sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2, and k ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but what about d=1? That would be sum_{i=0}^1 k^i = 1 +k. However, in that case, the step of adding to leaves (the initial step's leaves) must be done at least once. So the sum 1 +k would not be allowed, because that would require that the step is done zero times. Hence, the allowed values for n are sums of the form (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2, and k ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step of adding new vertices to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when that step is done once, which would correspond to d=2. So the allowed n is sum_{i=0}^d k^i for d ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2. However, there's another possibility. What if we have a snowflake where the step is done once, but then some of the leaves are not expanded further? For example, suppose after adding the second layer (k² nodes), we stop. Then the total is 1 +k +k². But if we have more layers, like 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, for m ≥ 2. So for any m ≥ 2, the sum is allowed. So the possible n is any number that can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some m ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2. Wait, no. Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m ≥ 2, since the step must be done at least once. Wait, m is the number of terms minus one. Let me think again.\n\nFor example, when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which requires that the step of adding to leaves was done once. Because the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first step, then adding once (the step of adding to leaves). So m is the exponent. So the formula is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, if m is the maximum exponent, then for the sum 1 +k +k^2, the exponents are up to 2, which is m=2. So the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the sum for exponents up to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So the condition is that m ≥ 2. So for the sum to be valid, the number of terms is m+1, and m ≥ 2. So m can be 2,3,... So for example, for m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2. However, there's another possibility: what if the expansion is done for some layers, but not all? Like, for example, if after expanding once (adding the second layer), we don't expand some of the leaves. Wait, but according to the problem's construction rules, each time you add new vertices to the leaves. So the process is that after each expansion step, all the leaves (those that are connected to only one other node) are expanded. So the construction is such that each layer is fully expanded. Hence, the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series with m+1 terms, where m ≥ 2.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to checking if there exists integers k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2 such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem includes n=13. Let's check that. For example, 13 can be written as 1 +k +k². Let's see:\n\nk=3: 1 +3 +9 =13. Yes. So m=2, k=3. So the answer is yes. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The output is NO. Let's see. Let's check possible k and m.\n\nFor m=2: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. For k=2, that's 4+2+1=7. For k=3, 9+3+1=13. So 6 is not achievable here. What about m=3? Then the sum is (k^4-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² +k³. For k=2, that's 1+2+4+8=15. For k=2 and m=3, sum is 15. So n=6 can't be expressed as such. So the output is NO, which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for given n, whether there exists integers k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2 such that n equals (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for a given n, if such k and m exist.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient algorithm.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m ≥ 2, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nSo for each possible m, we can compute the possible k.\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n), because for m=2, the minimal value is (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7, and for larger m, the minimal value increases. So for example, for m=2, the minimal possible n is 7 (k=2), for m=3, it's 15 (k=2), etc. So for a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n) (but since for m=2, the minimal is 7, and for higher m, the minimal is larger, but perhaps for some m, even if m is large, there could be a k that makes the equation hold.)\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, trying all possible m up to say 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18) is feasible.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if n can be written in the form (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) for some m ≥ 2 and k ≥2.\n\nHow to check this?\n\nWe can iterate over possible m values (from 2 up to log_2(n)), and for each m, check if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nFor each m, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n\nWhich is equal to (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for a given m, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed m, the function f(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^m is strictly increasing with k. So for each m, we can binary search for k in [2, ... ] such that f(k) = n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) for large exponents without overflow? Well, since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, even for k=2 and m=60, the sum is 2^61-1 which is about 2e18, which is manageable in Python with big integers.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1: output NO (since k>1 and m≥2 would require sum >= 1+2 + 2^2 = 7, which is larger than 1).\n\nElse, for each possible m from 2 up to max_m (say 60), do:\n\nCompute the minimal possible value of the sum for this m, which is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. If this is larger than n, then skip this m.\n\nOtherwise, perform a binary search on k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], where upper_bound can be determined as follows: for m, the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^m. For k=2, sum is 2^{m+1} -1. For k=upper, the sum must be <=n. Since the sum increases with k, we can find the upper bound for k as something like n^(1/m) + 1. But for binary search, perhaps we can use a high upper limit, like n (since for k >=2, the sum is at least 1 +k, which for k >=2 is 3, but for larger m, the sum grows quickly. However, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². For this to be equal to n, k can be up to sqrt(n). So for binary search, for each m, the upper bound for k can be set to n^(1/m) + 1, but perhaps in practice, setting it to n is acceptable, as the binary search would be logarithmic in n.\n\nBut for m up to 60, and for each m, binary search up to say 1e9 (for n up to 1e18), but even that would be manageable.\n\nOnce we find for a particular m, a k such that the sum equals n, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all possible m, no such k is found, return NO.\n\nBut there's also another case: when m=1. Wait, no. Because m is supposed to be ≥2. Because the problem requires that the step of adding to leaves is done at least once. Which corresponds to m being 2 (sum up to m=2: 1 +k +k²).\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the earlier analysis.\n\nThe sum is 1 +k + ... +k^m. For m ≥ 2, since the step is done once. So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². For m=3, it's 1 +k +k² +k³. So for each m ≥2, we need to check.\n\nBut what if the snowflake is constructed with more layers than required? For example, if after adding the second layer (m=2), we add more layers. But the problem allows that.\n\nSo the approach is to check for all possible m ≥2, and for each, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, the question is: how to find all possible m for a given n.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible m for which the sum could be n?\n\nFor example, for m=60, the minimal sum is 2^61 -1. For n up to 1e18, 2^60 is ~1e18. So for m up to 60, we can check.\n\nSo for each n, the possible m ranges from 2 up to log_2(n) (since for m=log_2(n), the minimal sum is 2^{log_2(n)+1} -1, which is about 2n, which may be larger than n. So perhaps m can be up to 60 for n up to 1e18.\n\nSo the steps for each test case:\n\nCheck for each m from 2 to 60:\n\n   compute the minimal possible sum for this m (when k=2). If that's larger than n, break (since for higher m, the minimal sum will be even larger).\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to find if sum equals n.\n\nSo, for example, for m=2:\n\nsum = 1 +k +k² = n.\n\nWe can solve for k. For example, for n=13, k=3: 1+3+9=13.\n\nBut for n=6, solving 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k -5=0 → roots are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2. Not integer. So no solution.\n\nSo the binary search approach for each m would work.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum for given m and k?\n\nWe can compute it as (k^{m+1} - 1) // (k-1). But for large exponents, how to compute this without overflow?\n\nIn Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. However, for large m and k, this computation could be slow. But given that m is up to 60 and t is 1e4, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute the sum incrementally, to avoid calculating large exponents. For example, for a given k and m, compute the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. We can compute it as follows:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1\n\nfor i in 0 to m:\n\n    sum += current_term\n\n    current_term *=k\n\nBut for m up to 60, this is trivial.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can compute the sum as (k^{m+1} -1) // (k-1). But for k=1, this would be undefined, but since k ≥2, no problem.\n\nBut in code, perhaps using the incremental method is better, because for some cases, when the sum exceeds n, we can break early. For example, during the calculation of the sum, if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can stop and return that it's too big.\n\nSo during the binary search, for a given k and m, compute the sum incrementally, and if it exceeds n, return early.\n\nThis is important because for large k and m, the sum could be very big, but for binary search, we need to check if it's equal to n.\n\nSo, for the binary search part:\n\nGiven m and a target n, find if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nSo, the steps for binary search:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nWe can set high to be something like n. Because for m ≥2, the sum is at least 1 + 2 + 2² = 7. For k ≥2, the sum for m=2 is 1 +k +k², which for k= sqrt(n) would be around n. So the upper bound can be set as n^(1/m) + 1, but perhaps for simplicity, we can set high to n, and during the binary search, compute the sum and check if it's equal to n.\n\nBut for large m and k, the sum could be very big, but in Python, even for m=60 and k=1e5, the sum would be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^60, which is way bigger than 1e18, but since n is up to 1e18, we can break early during the sum calculation.\n\nSo here's the plan for the binary search:\n\nFor a given m and n, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (like n) to find if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to find the upper_bound for k?\n\nWell, for the sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = n.\n\nWe can note that S ≥ 1 +k +k^2. For m ≥2, so 1 +k +k² ≤n → k² +k +1 ≤n → k² ≤n → k ≤ sqrt(n). So for m ≥2, the upper bound for k can be set to sqrt(n) + 1. But this is only for m=2. For larger m, the upper bound for k is smaller. For example, for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. For k ≥2, this is ≥1 +k +k² +k² = 1 +k + 2k². Which for larger k would be larger than n. So perhaps for m ≥2, the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/m) + 1. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, during binary search, we can start with low=2, high=2, and double high until the sum is larger than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach avoids having to compute the upper bound upfront, and is efficient.\n\nSo, for example, for a given m and n:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile the sum for k=high and m is less than n, multiply high by 2.\n\nOnce high is such that sum(high) ≥n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis way, we can find the upper bound dynamically.\n\nOnce we have the binary search range, we can proceed.\n\nSo, putting this together, for each m in 2..max_m:\n\n   compute the minimal sum for k=2. If this is larger than n, break (since for larger m, the minimal sum will be even larger).\n\n   else:\n\n      perform the above binary search steps to find if there's a k such that sum equals n.\n\nNow, what about the case where n is 1? According to the problem statement, the minimal snowflake is when n is 1 +k +k². For k=2, that's 1+2+4=7. So for n=1, output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=7. For m=2, k=2: 1+2+4=7 → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=15. For m=3, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 → YES.\n\nSo the code needs to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = input.\n\nif n < 7 → output NO (since the minimal is 7).\n\nelse:\n\n   check for all m from 2 up to max_m (like 60):\n\n      compute the minimal sum for m, which is when k=2. sum_min = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1.\n\n      if sum_min > n → break (since for larger m, sum_min increases, so no need to check further).\n\n      else:\n\n         perform the binary search for k in this m.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n   after checking all m, if none found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute sum_min for m? Well, sum_min is 2^{m+1} -1. For example, m=2: 2^3 -1 =7.\n\nBut for m up to 60, 2^61 is 2e18, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for each m starting from 2:\n\nsum_min = 2^{m+1} -1. If sum_min >n → break.\n\nElse, proceed to check for possible k.\n\nBut for m up to 60, this loop is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute sum_min for each m? Well, in code, for m in range(2, 60+1):\n\nsum_min = 2^(m+1) -1.\n\nBut for m=60, 2^61 is 2, 2e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, when m reaches 60, sum_min is 2^61 -1 = 2, 2e18 which is larger than 1e18. So for m up to 59, sum_min for m=59 is 2^60 -1 ≈ 1.1e18. So for n=1e18, m can be up to 59.\n\nSo the code can loop m from 2 up to 60, and for each, check if sum_min is <=n.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut first, handle the case where n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → all output NO.\n\nWait, for example, n=7 is allowed. What about n=15?\n\nYes, as discussed.\n\nBut what about n=3? Let's see. For m=2, sum_min is 7. So no. So output is NO.\n\nSo the code can first check if n is less than 7 → output NO.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplement a function that, given m and n, checks whether there exists a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\nImplementing this function:\n\ndef check_m(m, n):\n\n    # find if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n    # compute the sum as (k^(m+1) -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n    # but compute it incrementally.\n\n    # find the lower and upper bounds for k.\n\n    # find low and high.\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    # find high such that sum for high is >=n.\n\n    while True:\n\n        s = compute_sum(high, m)\n\n        if s >= n:\n\n            break\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m)\n\n        if s == n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum(k, m)?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    # compute 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf') # or some value larger than n.\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in code, for Python, it's better to compute this and check for overflow during the computation. For example, during the sum, if at any step the total exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nSo the code for compute_sum would be:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n +1 # some value larger than n.\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in code, for each call to compute_sum, we need to pass n, which is the target.\n\nBut in the code, during the binary search for a particular m and n, the function compute_sum is called with k and m, and returns the sum, but breaks early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo, integrating all this into the code.\n\nNow, the code steps for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n <7 → print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 2 to 60:\n\n       sum_min = 2^(m+1) -1.\n\n       if sum_min >n → break.\n\n       else:\n\n           perform the binary search for k as described.\n\n           if found → return YES.\n\n   after all m, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute sum_min for m?\n\nsum_min can be calculated as (2^(m+1) -1). For m up to 60, 2^61 is manageable.\n\nBut in code, for m in 2 to 60:\n\nsum_min = (2 ** (m+1)) -1.\n\nBut for m=60, 2^61 is 2251799813685248, which is about 2.2e18. So for n up to 1e18, sum_min for m=59 is 2^60 -1 = 1152921504606846975, which is about 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, m can go up to 59.\n\nBut in code, for each m, we can calculate sum_min as (2 ** (m+1)) -1. However, for m up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nBut for m up to 60, the loop is manageable.\n\nNow, let's test some examples.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case n=13.\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nsum_min = 2^3 -1 =7. 7 <=13.\n\nbinary search for k in m=2.\n\nlow=2, high=2.\n\ncompute_sum(2, 2, 13) is 1 +2 +4=7 <13 → high *=2 → high=4.\n\ncompute_sum(4, 2, 13) is 1+4+16=21>13 → binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nmid =3. compute_sum(3, 2, 13) is 1+3+9=13 → found. return True. So overall answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=15.\n\nCheck m=2: sum_min=7. Check if there's a k. For m=2, 1 +k +k²=15 → k² +k -14=0. Discriminant 1 +56=57. sqrt(57) is ~7.5. So k=( -1 +7.5)/2 ~ 3.25. Not integer. So no solution. Then check m=3.\n\nsum_min for m=3 is 2^4 -1=15. Which equals n=15. So for m=3, k=2. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=6. Which is less than 7 → output NO.\n\nSample input n=255: output is YES. Let's see. 255 = 2^8 -1. Which is sum for m=7, k=2: 1 +2 + ... + 2^7 = 2^8 -1 =255. So m=7, which is allowed. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=10101. Output is YES. Let's see.\n\nFor example, 10101 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^m ?\n\nLet me compute for m=5: sum is (3^6 -1)/(3-1) = (729-1)/2 = 728/2=364. No. For m=8, k=3: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2=9841. Still less than 10101. For m=8, k=4: sum is (4^9 -1)/3 → 262144-1 /3 = 262143/3= 87381. Still less than 10101? No, 87381 is bigger than 10101. Wait, perhaps another k and m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for m=2, 1 +k +k² =10101 → k² +k +1 =10101 →k² +k -10100=0 → discriminant 1 + 40400 = 40401. sqrt(40401) is 201. So k = (-1 + 201)/2 = 200/2=100. So k=100. So yes. So for m=2, k=100. So the answer is YES. So the code would find this.\n\nThus, the code would check for m=2. sum_min is 7 (for k=2).",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding iteratively. The key insight is that the number of vertices must be expressible in the form of a geometric series sum for some integers $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ m \\geq 2 $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series sum $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m $ where $ m \\geq 2 $ and $ k \\geq 2 $. This sum can be computed using the formula $ S = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} $.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each test case, check if $ n $ is less than 7 (the minimum possible value for a valid snowflake). If so, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers $ m $ (from 2 up to a reasonable upper bound like 60), compute the minimum possible sum for $ k = 2 $ and check if it is within the range of $ n $.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each valid $ m $, use binary search to check if there exists an integer $ k \\geq 2 $ such that the sum equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > target:\n            return target + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60\n    for m in range(2, max_m + 1):\n        # Calculate minimal sum for k=2\n        sum_min = (2 ** (m + 1)) - 1\n        if sum_min > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for high\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n            if s >= n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n            if s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if check_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series up to $ m $ terms for a given $ k $, and returns early if the sum exceeds the target $ n $.\n- **check_possible**: This function checks if $ n $ can be expressed as a valid geometric series sum for any $ m \\geq 2 $ and $ k \\geq 2 $. It uses binary search to efficiently find possible values of $ k $ for each $ m $.\n- **main**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether a valid snowflake can be formed with the given number of vertices.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph without exceeding computational limits, even for very large values of $ n $.",
