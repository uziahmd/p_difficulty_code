And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day window, I need to compute the sum of those days, then take the average of all those sums. Then output that average with enough decimal places.\n\nHmm. The constraints are up to 2e5 for n, so a naive approach of checking each window and summing each time would be O(n*k), which would be way too slow for n=2e5. Like, 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10 operations. That's definitely not going to work. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right! Sliding window technique. Because each consecutive window overlaps with the previous one by k-1 elements. So if I can compute the sum for the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving and add the new element that's entering. That way, each step is O(1), leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nSo first, compute the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each next window, subtract a[i] and add a[i + k], and so on.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the initial sum? Let's think. For example, if n=3 and k=2, the first window is a[0]+a[1], then the next is a[1]+a[2]. So the initial sum is sum of a[0..k-1], then for each i from 1 to (n -k) steps, the next sum is previous sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1].\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial window sum.\n2. Add it to a total sum.\n3. Then, for each next window (from 1 to (n -k) times), compute the new sum by subtracting the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new right element.\n4. Add each of these sums to the total.\n5. Finally, divide the total by the number of weeks (which is n -k + 1) to get the average.\n\nSo the key is to compute the sum of all the windows efficiently.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the list of a's.\n\nThen, compute the initial sum. Let's say, sum of a[0...k-1]. Then, the total is initialized with this sum. Then, for each i in 1 to (n -k) steps:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nAdd this current_sum to the total.\n\nWait, but the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So for example, when n=3 and k=2, there are 2 weeks. The initial sum is for week 0, then for week 1, we compute the next sum. So the loop would run (n -k) times, adding each new sum. So the total is the sum of all the window sums.\n\nOnce I have the total, divide by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python, we can read the input, process each test case. Wait, looking at the sample input, it seems that the input might have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows something like:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines: first line has n and k, second line has the array. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the actual problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the input. But looking back at the problem statement, the input is supposed to be for a single test case. Wait, no. Wait the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the original problem is expecting that the code can process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. Or maybe the problem is from Codeforces, where sometimes multiple test cases are given. Wait, but the problem statement says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as two lines. But the sample input shows three different inputs, each with their own outputs. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's note:\n\nIn the third example there are n -k +1 weeks. So the problem is to process one test case. But the sample input shows three separate test cases. So perhaps the user provided multiple test cases in the sample input, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nWait, but the user's code needs to read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the original problem statement says that the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases. But that's unclear. However, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k. The second line contains n integers. So the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So maybe the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. But perhaps in the actual problem, there are multiple test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nSo each of the input strings is a separate test case. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process them all. However, the problem statement may not mention that. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces, and the user is showing that the code needs to handle multiple test cases. But the original problem statement says that the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So maybe the original problem has multiple test cases. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives the problem statement. The input is described as first line with n and k, second line with the array. So the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which suggests that perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires handling multiple test cases. But how can I know?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the first example, input is 3 2 followed by 3 4 7. Output is 9.0000000000. Which is (3+4 + 4+7)/2 = (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2=9. So yes.\n\nIn the second example, input is 1 1 and array [10], output is 10.0.\n\nThird example input is 8 2 and array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The number of weeks is 8-2+1=7. The sum of each week is:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = let's see:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3+6=9\n\n9 + 100004 = 100013\n\n+100123 = 200136\n\n+579 = 200715\n\n+1245 = 201,960?\n\nWait 200715 + 1245 is 201,960?\n\nThen +790 is 202,750?\n\nThen the average is 202750 / 7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 202750 divided by 7. Let's see:\n\n7 * 28964 = 202748. So 202750 - 202748 = 2. So 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code needs to process each test case.\n\nBut how many test cases are there? The problem says that the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows three. So perhaps the original problem is from a contest where multiple test cases are allowed. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. But the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the original problem, perhaps the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. But how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut in the original problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which may be a mistake. But given that the user's sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into test cases, and process each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the user's sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. However, the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as three separate test cases, each with their own input lines. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not explicitly say so. However, in this case, the problem's input description says that the first line contains two integers, etc. So that implies that each test case is given as two lines. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given as the first line. However, in this problem's sample input, there is no such line. So perhaps the code should read until EOF.\n\nIn Python, that can be done by reading all lines from stdin and processing them in pairs. For example, the code can read all lines, and process them two lines at a time.\n\nBut how does that work? Let's think. For example, the first line is n and k. The second line is the array. Then the third line is another n and k, fourth line is the array, etc.\n\nSo the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs. So for each pair of lines, process as a test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as three test cases. So for example, the first test case is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSecond test case:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nThird test case:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the code needs to read each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nThus, the code will process multiple test cases. But how to read them in Python?\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read from stdin. So perhaps the code can read all input lines, split into a list, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut for that, the code can do something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\nprocess lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? Well, the problem probably ensures that each test case has two lines. So the code can assume that.\n\nSo in the code, the approach is to read all lines, then process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case, but the sample input shows multiple. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. However, given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nFor each pair of lines (first line is n and k, second line is the array):\n\nProcess the test case.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nCompute the average as per the problem.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum of all the windows.\n\nNow, the code for the sliding window.\n\nLet's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, for the initial sum:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nThen, for i in 1 to (n -k) times:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nadd to total_sum.\n\nThen, average = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nBut for large n and k, this is O(n) time.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, and multiple test cases, this should be manageable.\n\nNow, in Python, for each test case, we can process this.\n\nBut for the case when k = n, then there is only one week. So the code will compute sum(a) once, and divide by 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=1. Then each day is a week. So the average is the average of all the elements. But since each week is one day, the total sum is sum(a), divided by n.\n\nBut the code will handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, for each test case:\n\nRead n, k from the first line.\n\nThen read the array as a list of integers.\n\nThen, compute the initial sum.\n\nBut for the initial sum, if k is 0? No, since constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFor example, in code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nn, k = map(int, first_line.split())\n\na = list(map(int, second_line.split()))\n\nThen compute the sum of the first k elements.\n\nBut if n is 1, then k is 1, and the sum is a[0].\n\nThen, the total_sum is initialized as this sum.\n\nThen, for each i in range(1, (n -k +1)):\n\nWait, the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So the number of times we need to slide the window is (n -k) times. Because the first window is already counted once, and each slide adds one more.\n\nSo for i in 1 to (n -k) times:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nAdd to total_sum.\n\nWait, for example, in the first test case:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\nnumber of weeks is 3-2+1 = 2.\n\nso initial sum is 3+4=7.\n\nthen, for i=1 (since n-k=1), we compute the next sum:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7-3 + a[2] = 4 +7=11. So total_sum is 7 + 11 = 18. Average is 18/2 = 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nnumber_of_weeks = n -k +1\n\nif number_of_weeks == 0: but since k <=n, n-k+1 >=1.\n\nSo code:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / number_of_weeks\n\nThen, output the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, you need to format it properly.\n\nBut how to handle the precision?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the average is 9.0, and output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo in Python, the code can format the output as a float with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. However, when the numbers are big, floating point precision could be an issue. But the problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is within 1e-6, so using floating points should be okay.\n\nBut for very large numbers, perhaps using floating points may lose some precision. However, since the problem allows for a relative or absolute error up to 1e-6, using double-precision (Python's float is double) should be sufficient.\n\nSo, the code can compute the average as a float, then format it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to format it?\n\nIn Python, using the format string: \"{:.10f}\".format(average).\n\nBut wait, for example, in the third sample input, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after decimal. However, when using the format string with .10f, it would round the number to 10 decimal digits. But the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So even if the output is rounded to 10 decimal digits, it's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer must be printed with at least 6 digits after the decimal point. So using 10 digits is sufficient.\n\nSo, in code, for each test case, after computing the average, print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nBut in Python, for the case when n is large, say 2e5, and k is 1, then the code would compute sum of all elements (each element is a window of size 1), and the average is sum / n. But the code would compute the initial sum as sum of a[0:1] = a[0], then for each i from 1 to (n-1) steps, add a[i] to the total. So total_sum would be sum of all elements. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the sum of a slice a[:k] can be computed as sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for large k, say 2e5, this would take O(k) time. Which would be O(n) time for each test case. But since the code is O(n) per test case, and the total sum across all test cases is acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, each with O(n) processing, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        line1 = input_lines[idx]\n        if not line1.strip():\n            idx +=1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line1.strip().split())\n        idx +=1\n        line2 = input_lines[idx].strip()\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n        idx +=1\n        # Process this test case\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        number_of_weeks = n - k +1\n        for i in range(1, number_of_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / number_of_weeks\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nBut wait, in the sample input, the third test case's output is 28964.2857142857. Let's check with the code.\n\nFor the third test case:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\na is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nnumber_of_weeks is 8-2+1=7.\n\ncurrent_sum is sum of first two elements: 1+2=3. total_sum is 3.\n\nThen for i from 1 to 6 (since number_of_weeks is 7, range(1,7) is 6 iterations).\n\ni=1: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 3 -1 + a[2] = 2 +4=6. total_sum becomes 3+6=9.\n\ni=2: current_sum = 6 -a[1] + a[2+2-1] =6-2 +a[3] =4 +100000 = 100004. total_sum is 9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\ni=3: current_sum = 100004 - a[2] + a[3+2-1] = 100004 -4 +a[4] = 100000 + 123 = 100123. total_sum is 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=4: current_sum = 100123 - a[3] + a[4+2-1] = 100123 - 100000 + a[5] = 123 + 456 = 579. total_sum becomes 200136 + 579 = 200715.\n\ni=5: current_sum = 579 - a[4] + a[5+2-1] = 579 -123 + a[6] = 456 +789 = 1245. total_sum becomes 200715 + 1245 = 201960.\n\ni=6: current_sum = 1245 - a[5] + a[6+2-1] = 1245 -456 + a[7] = 789 +1 = 790. total_sum is 201960 +790 = 202750.\n\nThen average is 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714... which is printed as 28964.2857142857 when using .10f format.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about when k equals n?\n\nFor example, n=2, k=2. The array is [5, 6]. Then the sum is 11. The average is 11/1 = 11.0. The code would compute current_sum = sum(a[:2]) = 11. Then, number_of_weeks is 1. The loop for i in range(1, 1) does not run. So total_sum is 11. average is 11.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, k=1. The average is a[0]/1 = a[0].\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1. Then the number of weeks is 2. Each week is one day. The average is (a[0] + a[1])/2.\n\nThe code would compute current_sum = a[0], total_sum = a[0]. Then for i=1 (range(1, 2)), which is one iteration. current_sum = current_sum - a[0] + a[1] = a[1]. total_sum becomes a[0] + a[1]. average is (a[0]+a[1])/2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when n is 2e5 and k is 1. The code would compute sum of a[0], then for each i from 1 to 2e5 -1, which is O(n) steps. But the code is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, in Python, for very large n and k, the code may be slow. But given that the code is O(n) per test case, and with n up to 2e5, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to read input lines correctly. However, sometimes, the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces, but the code uses strip() when splitting, so that should be handled.\n\nBut in the code above, for line1, it's split into n and k. For line2, it's split into the array. So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\n10.0000000000\n\n28964.2857142857\n\nSo the code would process each of these.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses the format string with .10f. However, in Python, when you format a float with .10f, it rounds to 10 decimal places. For example, if the average is exactly 9, then it will print 9.0000000000.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So the code's output is correct.\n\nBut what about numbers that require more than 10 decimal digits? For example, if the exact value is 0.12345678901234, then printing with 10 decimal digits would be 0.1234567890, which is within 1e-6 of the correct value. Because the error is 0.00000000001234, which is less than 1e-6.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Python, read from stdin, and output the answers.\n\nNow, considering that in some cases, the sum could be very large. However, since Python uses arbitrary precision integers, the sum is handled correctly. When divided by number_of_weeks (an integer), the average is a float, which is handled with double-precision.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThe code is as follows. Also, note that the code must not have any print statements other than the required outputs. Also, the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nBut in the code, the while loop processes all the lines. However, in some cases, the input may have empty lines. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So perhaps the code can process each pair of lines.\n\nBut in the code, when reading line1, if it's empty, it skips. But perhaps that's unnecessary. However, in practice, the code may have to handle leading or trailing empty lines. But the problem says that the input is as per the problem's input description.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as written.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, for the case where the input is read as a list of lines, and the code processes them in pairs.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        line1 = input_lines[idx].strip()\n        if not line1:\n            idx +=1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line1.split())\n        idx +=1\n        # Read the array line\n        line2 = input_lines[idx].strip()\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n        idx +=1\n        # Process\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n        for i in range(1, number_of_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / number_of_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nBut in Python, when using the format string, numbers like 10.0 are printed as 10.0000000000, which matches the sample.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFor the second test case, n=1, k=1. The code computes current_sum = sum(a[:1]) = 10. number_of_weeks is 1. The loop does not run. average is 10.0. Printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut for the case where n is 2e5 and k is 1, the code will process it quickly.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days from a given list of n days. The solution must efficiently handle large input sizes, up to 200,000 days, using an optimized approach to avoid excessive computation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use the sliding window technique to maintain the sum of the current window by adjusting the previous window's sum. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the first k days is computed once. For each subsequent window, we subtract the element that is left behind and add the new element that comes into the window.\n3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The input may contain multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line with integers n and k, and the second line with the list of sleep times for n days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        line1 = input_lines[idx].strip()\n        if not line1:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line1.split())\n        idx += 1\n        line2 = input_lines[idx].strip()\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n        \n        for i in range(1, number_of_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        \n        average = total_sum / number_of_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. Each pair of lines represents a test case.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is calculated once to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This maintains an efficient O(n) time complexity.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of weeks (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time, which is then formatted to 10 decimal places for output.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both time-efficient and handles large input sizes effectively, adhering to the constraints and precision requirements specified in the problem.",
