The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the movement. For example, if she is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at a_i, how much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the road is a ring, moving clockwise. So the distance between current_pos and a_i can be calculated as (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, but since movement is only clockwise, maybe not. Let's think: if current_pos is 1 and a_i is 3, and n is 4, then moving clockwise takes 2 steps (1→2→3). If current is 3 and a_i is 1, then moving clockwise would be (n - current_pos + a_i) steps? Like for n=4, current is 3, target is 1: 3→4→1 is 2 steps. Which is (1 - 3 + 4) = 2. So yes, the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n if the movement is allowed only clockwise. Wait, no. Because if target is less than current, then (target - current) is negative. But adding n would make it positive. For example, target is 1, current is 3, n=4: (1-3) = -2, mod 4 is 2. Which is correct. So the distance is (target - current) mod n? But wait, if target is 3 and current is 1, then (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) mod n. But wait, when target is equal to current, the mod gives zero. Which is correct, no movement needed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, she doesn't need to move. So for each task, we need to compute the time from her current position to the next task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in order, compute the distance from current position to a_i, add that to total time, then update current position to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current and a_i?\n\nYes, as (a_i - current) mod n. But wait, no. Because if current is 3 and a_i is 1, then moving clockwise would take (n - current + a_i) steps. For example, n=4: 3 → 4 → 1 is 2 steps. Which is (1 -3) mod 4 is (-2 mod 4) = 2. So yes, the formula (a_i - current) mod n gives the correct number of steps. So for each step, the time added is (a_i - current) mod n. Then current becomes a_i.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3, 2, 3]\n\nSo initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. So add 2. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance is (2 -3) mod 4 = (-1 mod 4) = 3. So add 3. Now current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is (3-2) mod 4 = 1. Add 1. Total is 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother sample input is ['4 3\\n2 3 3']. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Distance is (2-1) mod 4 = 1. Add 1. Current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. Distance (3-2) mod 4 = 1. Add 1. Current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is 0. Add 0. Total is 1+1+0=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nReturn total_time.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because the movement is always clockwise, and the modulo gives the minimal steps required.\n\nYes. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, for the input:\n\nRead n and m. Then read m integers as a list.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input given in the example is:\n\nThe first input line is ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']? Or perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided an example where the input is given as two lines. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains m integers a1...am.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as two separate cases? Like the first example input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nand the output is 6. Then another input is 4 3 and 2 3 3, output 2.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. But in the problem statement, the input is for one test case. So the code should read one n and m, then read m numbers.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the user provided two test cases. However, in the actual problem, the code should process one test case per run. So the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be one test case.\n\nSo the code should read n and m, then read m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the total time as per the algorithm.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because the constraints say m ≥ 1? Let me check:\n\nNo, the input constraints for m are 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So m can be 1. So the code can process that.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read a list of m integers.\n\nThen, initialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each a_i in the list:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause for each task, Xenia must go from her current position to the next task's position, and the minimal time is the distance as computed.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test with the first sample:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a_i is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a_i is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3].\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 2: (2-1) mod4=1 → total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond a_i is 3: (3-2) mod4=1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird a_i is 3: (3-3) mod4=0 → total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if Xenia is already at the target. Like, if a_i is 1, then distance is 0.\n\nWhat if the list is [1,1,1], n=5. Then total time is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then time is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Then first step is 0, then (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Total is 1. Which is correct: 1→2.\n\nBut what if the a_i is [2,1] for n=2. Then first step is (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Then (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. Total 2. Which is correct: 1→2→1. Which takes 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nWe need to read from stdin. So:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, for reading inputs, sometimes there are issues with leading/trailing spaces. So using split() is safe.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the list a is empty? But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut let me check the constraints again. The problem says m is between 1 and 1e5. So the code is okay.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code returns 1 + 1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[1,5,1]. The steps:\n\ncurrent starts at 1. First a_i is 1 → 0. current is 1.\n\nSecond a_i is 5. (5-1) mod5=4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nThird a_i is 1. (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 = 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct. 5→1 is 1 step (since moving clockwise, 5→1 is 1 step).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she can only move clockwise around the ringroad.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses on a circular road can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. For any two houses `current` and `target`, the distance is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula ensures that the movement is always considered in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, iterate through each task, compute the distance to the next task's house, accumulate the total time, and update the current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of house numbers where tasks need to be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. Accumulate this distance into the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, ensuring an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
