The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task ai must be done in order, and she can only do task i after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i) are done. The challenge is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nSo the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of m a_i's. The output is the total time taken.\n\nLet me think about how to model her movement. She starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a certain house. But since the tasks have to be done in order, she can't jump around. For example, if the first task is at house 3, she has to move from 1 to 3, which takes 2 steps (since moving clockwise). Then for the next task, say house 2, she needs to move from 3 to 2. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, that would take (n - 3 + 2) steps? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe houses are arranged in a circle. Moving clockwise, the distance between current position and target can be calculated as (target - current) mod n. But since movement is only allowed clockwise, if the target is ahead, then it's target - current steps. If it's behind, then it's (n - current + target) steps. But wait, for example, if current is 3 and target is 2, in a 4-house setup: moving clockwise from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Or (target - current + n) % n? Because (2-3) is -1, adding 4 gives 3. So yes, the formula would be (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n if we take modulo n. Wait, but in Python, negative mod is handled differently. Let me think: (target - current) can be negative. So for example, target is 2, current is 3, n=4. (2-3) = -1. mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the distance between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, if target is same as current, then it's zero. So that seems right.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the example: first test case is n=4, m=3, tasks [3, 2, 3]. Let's walk through that.\n\nStart at 1. First task is 3. So distance from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2 steps. Then she's at 3. Next task is 2. So distance is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3 steps. So that's 3 steps. Now she's at 2. Then next task is 3 again. Distance is (3-2) = 1 step. So total steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is: track her current position, and for each task, compute the distance from current to the target, add that to the total time, and then update the current position to the target.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order, and she must complete them in order. So for each task ai, we need to process them in sequence. So the steps are:\n\nInitialize current position as 1. Total time is 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   compute the distance from current to ai, add to total time.\n\n   set current to ai.\n\nBut how do we compute the distance? As (ai - current) mod n? Wait, no. Because if ai is equal to current, then the distance is zero. So yes. But for example, when current is 3 and ai is 2, (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between current and ai is (ai - current) % n if the movement is clockwise. But wait, in the case where ai is less than current, like current is 3 and ai is 2, then (ai - current) is negative. So mod n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (2-3) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and ai is (ai - current) % n. But wait, what if the current is 1 and ai is 1? Then the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: for each task in order, compute the distance from the current position to the target, add that to the total time, and update the current position.\n\nBut wait, let's check the second example. Input is 4 3, and tasks [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1. First task is 2. Distance is (2-1) mod 4 = 1. Time is 1. Current is 2. Next task is 3: distance (3-2) = 1. Time total 2. Current is 3. Next task is 3: distance 0. Total time remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then the list of a_i's. Then process each a_i in order, accumulating the time.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial position? The initial position is 1. So for the first task, the distance is (a_1 - 1) mod n?\n\nWait, for example, if a_1 is 1, then the distance is zero. So yes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = a\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, why does this work?\n\nBecause each time, we compute the minimal steps needed to get from current to a, moving clockwise. Since the problem says that the movement is only allowed clockwise, and that the ringroad is arranged in a circle.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test the first example. Input is 4 3, and a's are [3,2,3].\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total_time is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. total becomes 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total becomes 6. Which matches the example.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when the a's are [1,1,1]. Then the total time is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a's [2,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1. First a is 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total is 1. current is 2. Next a is 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. total is 2. So output is 2. Which makes sense: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers. So, for example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich is read as n=4, m=3, a list [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, for reading input, sometimes there are issues with leading/trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace should handle that.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead from stdin. For example, using input().split().\n\nBut for cases where there may be multiple lines, perhaps using sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, current = 1, total = 0.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    distance = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += distance\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nWait, the constraints say 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5. So n is at least 2.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me check the second example. Input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. The code would process:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod 4 = 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code gives (2-1) mod 2 = 1, then (1-2) mod 2 = 1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[1,5]. So initial current is 1. First task is 1: distance is 0. Then current is 1. Next task is 5: (5-1) mod 5 is 4. So total is 4. Which is correct: moving from 1 to 5 clockwise is 4 steps (1→2→3→4→5).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the a list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because in the input, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's write it.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive result. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m, then the list a.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    total += (num - current) % n\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → total is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which is correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → total is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and Xenia starts at house number 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia can only move clockwise around the ringroad. The time taken to move from one house to another is calculated based on the clockwise distance between them.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses `current` and `target` on a ringroad with `n` houses is given by `(target - current) % n`. This formula ensures that we correctly handle both cases where the target is ahead or behind the current position in a clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Processing**: For each task in the sequence, compute the distance from Xenia's current position to the target house of the task, accumulate this distance into the total time, and update her current position to the target house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        distance = (num - current) % n\n        total += distance\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1, and the total time is initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Accumulate this distance into the total time and update the current position.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraints, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
