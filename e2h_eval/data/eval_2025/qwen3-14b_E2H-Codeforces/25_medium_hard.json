При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending without overlapping isn't considered an error.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists some string s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s. If yes, output YES and any possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nFirst, let's think about the conditions for a valid s.\n\nLet me think about the structure of t. Suppose the original two messages were s and s. When merged with an overlap, the resulting string would be s + s[overlap_length:]. But how to find this overlap?\n\nAlternatively, the merged string t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping part. So, the length of t would be len(s) * 2 - overlap_length. Since the overlap length is between 1 and len(s)-1, the length of t must be between len(s) + 1 (when overlap is len(s)-1) and 2*len(s) -1 (when overlap is 1).\n\nBut since we don't know s, perhaps we can approach it by trying possible lengths of s.\n\nLet me think: Let's denote that the original s has length L. Then the merged string t must have length equal to 2L - k, where k is the overlap length (1 ≤ k < L). So, 2L -k = len(t). Therefore, rearranged, L = (len(t) + k)/2. But since k is between 1 and L-1, substituting L gives us some constraints.\n\nBut since k is between 1 and L-1, substituting L = (len(t) + k)/2 into that inequality:\n\n1 ≤ k < ( (len(t) +k)/2 ) - 1 ?\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, for each possible candidate length L of s, we can check whether there exists a possible k (overlap length) that satisfies the conditions.\n\nBut how to find possible L? Let's think: the length of t must be equal to 2L -k. Since k is between 1 and L-1, then:\n\nLet me express len(t) as T. So T = 2L -k → k = 2L - T.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - T ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L - T ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ T +1 → L ≥ (T+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L - T ≤ L-1 → 2L - T ≤ L-1 → L ≤ T -1.\n\nSo combining these two, L must satisfy (T+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ T-1.\n\nBut L is also the length of s. Also, since the original two messages are merged with an overlap, the length of t must be at least L + 1 (since k is at least 1). Because 2L -k = T → k = 2L - T. For k ≥ 1, 2L - T ≥ 1 → T ≤ 2L -1. But since L can be up to T-1, let's see for example:\n\nIf L is T-1, then k = 2*(T-1) - T = T - 2. Which must be between 1 and L-1 = T-2. So yes, T-2 is equal to L-1. So that's allowed.\n\nSo for possible L values, they must be in the range from ceil( (T+1)/2 ) to T-1.\n\nWait, but T is the length of the input string. Let's take an example. Let's say T is 6. Then possible L values are:\n\n(T+1)/2 = (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → L ≥ 4 (since L must be integer). And L ≤ T-1 =5.\n\nSo possible L's are 4 and 5.\n\nFor each possible L in that range, we can check if there exists an overlap of k = 2L - T. Since k must be between 1 and L-1. Let's check for L=4, T=6: k = 2*4 -6 = 2. Which is between 1 and 3 (since L-1 is 3). So valid. For L=5, k = 2*5 -6 = 4. Which is between 1 and 4 (since L-1 is 4). So yes.\n\nSo for each L in that range, compute k = 2L - T. Then check if the first L -k characters of t match the last L -k characters of t. Wait, no. Wait, the overlapping part is of length k. So when two s's are merged, the first s's last k characters must match the second s's first k characters. So the merged string would be s concatenated with s[k:], which would be of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k = T. So the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\nBut since t is the merged string, then the first L characters of t must be s, and the next part is s[k:]. Also, the overlapping part is that the last k characters of s (the first s) must equal the first k characters of s (the second s). So, for the entire t to be s + s[k:], the first L characters of t must be s, and the last L characters of t must be s[k:] (but since the total length is T = 2L -k, the last L characters would be from position T-L to end. Let me think:\n\nt is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = T. So the entire string is s followed by s[k:]. Therefore, the first L characters are s. The next part is s[k:].\n\nBut also, the overlapping part requires that the last k characters of s (i.e., s[L -k:]) must be equal to the first k characters of s (s[0:k]).\n\nSo, for a given L, we can check if the first L characters (s_candidate) can be such that the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Also, the entire t must be equal to s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [(T+1)//2, T-1], compute k = 2L - T. Then check:\n\n1. k must be between 1 and L-1. Well, since we derived L from that condition, but perhaps due to integer division, we need to check again. For example, when T is even, etc. But according to our earlier calculation, L is chosen so that k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nBut perhaps better to compute k, and check if 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1. If not, skip this L.\n\nOnce we have L and k, then:\n\nCheck if the first L characters of t (s_candidate) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of s_candidate. Also, check that the entire t is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\nWait, but how to check that? Because the entire t should be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, the length of t is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which equals T. So, the concatenation is correct. But we need to check that the t is exactly that.\n\nSo for example, the first L characters of t is s_candidate. Then, the rest of the string (from position L onwards) should be s_candidate[k:]. So, the substring of t starting at L should equal s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut since s_candidate is the first L characters of t, then:\n\nt[L:] should be equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut s_candidate is t[0:L], so:\n\nt[L:] == t[0:L][k:] ?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each L in the possible range, compute k = 2L - T. Check if k is between 1 and L-1. Then check if t[0:L] ends with the same k characters as it starts with. Also, check that t[L:] is equal to t[0:L][k:].\n\nIf any such L satisfies these conditions, then return YES and the s_candidate (t[0:L]).\n\nIf none of the possible L's work, then output NO.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute T as len(t)\n\n- For each possible L in the range from (T+1)//2 to T-1 inclusive:\n\n   - compute k = 2L - T\n\n   - check if 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1. If not, skip.\n\n   - then check if the first L characters (s_candidate) has the last k characters equal to the first k characters.\n\n   - also check that the rest of t (from L onwards) is equal to s_candidate[k:]\n\n   - if both conditions are met, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf after checking all possible L's, none satisfy, then return NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where there are multiple possible L's? For example, maybe for some T, there are multiple L's that meet the conditions. We can return the first one found.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (let's see the sample output says YES and s is abrakadabra. Let's see the length of t here. Let me count:\n\nOriginal sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — but the output says that the correct s is 'abrakadabra', which is length 11. Let's check:\n\nOriginal t is the merged string. So the original two s's are merged with some overlap.\n\nLet me compute T = len(t). Let me count the letters. The first example's input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — but the output is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. Let me check the length of the input string.\n\nOriginal input for first example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let me count:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then the input is that string twice merged with some overlap. Let me check the input string's length. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\". Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\n\"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters. Then the input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" — which is 21 letters. Wait, because if you have two copies of \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters each), merged with an overlap of 1 character. Then the total length is 11 + 11 -1 = 21. So T is 21. Then for L, possible values are (T+1)/2 = (21+1)/2 = 11. So L starts at 11 and up to T-1=20.\n\nSo for L=11, k = 2*11 - 21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (L-1 is 10). So valid.\n\nCheck if the first 11 characters (s_candidate) is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck that the last k=1 character of s_candidate is 'a' (the last character of s_candidate). The first k=1 character of s_candidate is 'a' (the first character). So they match. Then check that t[L:] is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nt[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (since the input is 'abrakadabra' + 'abrakadabra' with 1 character overlap. So the merged string would be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next letters are 'brakadabra'? Wait, no. Let me think. The merged string is s + s[k:], where s is 'abrakadabra', and k is 1. So s[k:] is 'brakadabra'. So the merged string is s + s[k:] which is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 11 + 10 = 21). Which matches the input. So t[L:] is 'abrakadabra' (from position 11 onwards). But s_candidate[k:] is 'brakadabra' (since s_candidate is 'abrakadabra', k=1, so from index 1 onwards). Wait, that would be 'brakadabra' (length 10). So t[L:] is 'abrakadabra' (the input's t[11:] is 'abrakadabra'? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the input for the first example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let me split it into parts. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input is 'abrakadabra' + 'abrakadabra' with an overlap of 1. So the first s is 'abrakadabra', the second s is 'abrakadabra'. The overlapping is the last 1 character of the first s (which is 'a') and the first 1 character of the second s (also 'a'). So the merged string would be the first s (11 letters) plus the second s without the first 1 character (so 10 letters). So the merged string is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. The first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next 10 letters are 'brakadabra' (from the second s, starting from index 1). So the entire merged string is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' = 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the input). Now, t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'brakadabra', which is the same as s_candidate[k:] (s_candidate is 'abrakadabra', k=1, so s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'). So yes, the check passes. So the code would find this case and return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 'acacacaca', output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nLet me compute T = len('acacacaca') = 9.\n\nPossible L ranges from (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8.\n\nSo L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nLet's try L=5. Then k = 2*5 -9 = 10-9=1. Check if 1<=1 <=5-1=4 → yes.\n\nCheck if the first 5 characters (s_candidate = 'acaca').\n\nCheck that the last 1 character of s_candidate is 'a', and the first 1 character is 'a' → same. Then check if the rest of the string (t[5:] is 'cacaca') equals s_candidate[k:] which is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nWait, t[5:] is 'cacaca' (original input is 'acacacaca', indexes 0-8. t[5:] is positions 5-8: 'caca'? Wait, len(t) is 9. t[5:] is from index 5 to end, which is 4 characters: positions 5,6,7,8. Let me write the string:\n\nIndices 0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a, 5:c, 6:a, 7:c, 8:a → t[5:] is 'caca' (positions 5-8: c a c a). s_candidate is 'acaca' (positions 0-4). s_candidate[k:] where k=1 is positions 1-4: 'caca'. So yes, t[5:] is 'caca' which equals s_candidate[k:]. So this is valid. So the code would return YES and 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' → output is 'NO'.\n\nLet's see. T=6. Possible L is (6+1)/2= 3.5 → 4, up to 5.\n\nSo L can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4 -6= 8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes.\n\nCheck s_candidate is first 4 characters: 'abca'.\n\nCheck last 2 characters of s_candidate: 'ca' and first 2 characters 'ab' → not same. So invalid.\n\nNext, check L=5. k= 2*5 -6= 10-6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 (since L-1=4). So yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 characters: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck last 4 characters of s_candidate: 'bcab' and first 4 characters 'abca' → not same. So invalid. So no possible L. Hence output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample is 'abababab' → output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nLet's see. T is 8. Possible L ranges from (8+1)/2 = 4.5 → 5 to 7.\n\nSo L=5,6,7.\n\nFor L=5: k= 2*5 -8 = 2. Check 1<=2 <=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 characters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck last 2 chars of s_candidate: 'ba' and first 2 chars 'ab' → not same. So invalid.\n\nNext L=6. k= 2*6 -8 = 4. Check 1<=4 <=5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 characters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars of s_candidate: 'baba' and first 4 chars 'abab' → not same. So invalid.\n\nNext L=7. k= 2*7 -8 = 6. Check 1<=6 <=6 (since L-1=6). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 characters: 'abababa'.\n\nCheck last 6 characters of s_candidate: 'bababa' and first 6 characters 'ababab' → not same. So invalid.\n\nWait, but the sample output says 'ababab' which is length 6. How does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the possible L's. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, T is 8. For L in [(8+1)/2=4.5 → 5 up to 7].\n\nBut maybe there is another L that works. Let me think.\n\nWait, the sample output says that the correct s is 'ababab' (length 6). Let's see. Then T = 8 = 2L -k. L is 6. So 8 = 2*6 -k → k = 12 -8 =4. So k=4. Which is between 1 and 5 (L-1=5). So yes.\n\nSo for L=6, k=4. Let's check:\n\ns_candidate is first 6 characters of t, which is 'ababab'.\n\nCheck if the last 4 characters of s_candidate equals the first 4 characters of s_candidate.\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). Last 4 characters are 'abab' (positions 2-5: 'abab')? Wait:\n\ns_candidate is indexes 0-5: a b a b a b.\n\nLast 4 characters are indexes 2-5: a b a b → 'abab'.\n\nFirst 4 characters are indexes 0-3: a b a b → 'abab'. So they are equal. So yes.\n\nThen check if t[L:] (t[6:]) is equal to s_candidate[k:] (s_candidate[4:] is 'ab').\n\nt[6:] is the substring starting at index 6. Original t is 'abababab' (length 8). So t[6:] is 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] which is 'ab' (since s_candidate is 'ababab', indexes 4 and 5 are 'ab'). So yes. Therefore, this is valid. So why didn't my previous analysis catch this?\n\nAh, because earlier when I checked for L=6, I thought that the s_candidate is 'ababab' and the last 4 characters of s_candidate is 'baba'? No, that was my mistake. Let me recheck:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). The last k=4 characters are positions 2,3,4,5: a, b, a, b → 'abab'. The first 4 characters are positions 0-3: a, b, a, b → 'abab'. So they match. Then t[6:] is 'ab' and s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → yes. So this is valid. So why did I think earlier that for L=6, the last 4 characters were 'baba'? That was a mistake. So in this case, the code would find L=6 and return YES. Hence the sample output is correct.\n\nSo my approach is correct. Now, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nCompute T = len(t).\n\nIf T is less than 2, then it's impossible. Because for two messages, each of length L, the merged string must be at least L +1 (since overlap is at least 1). But for example, if T is 1, then no. But the input says that t is non-empty. But for T=1, the possible L would be in [(1+1)/2=1 to 0], which is invalid. So no.\n\nSo proceed:\n\nfor L in range( (T+1)//2 , T ):\n\n   (since T-1 is the upper bound, but in Python, range is exclusive on upper bound. So need to loop from (T+1)//2 to T, inclusive? Wait, the possible L's are from ceil( (T+1)/2 ) to T-1. So for example, T=8, then L ranges from 5 to 7. So in code:\n\nfor L in range( (T+1)//2, T ):\n\n   because T-1 is the upper limit. So for T=8, range( (8+1)//2=4.5 → 5, 8) → 5,6,7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each L in that range:\n\n   k = 2*L - T\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L: continue (since k must be between 1 and L-1 inclusive)\n\n   else:\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n          print YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo, once any such L is found, output and exit.\n\nIf none found, output NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nT = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (T+1)//2, T ):\n\n   k = 2*L - T\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L:\n\n       continue\n\n   # check if the overlap is valid\n\n   s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n       print(s_candidate)\n\n       exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about when T is 2L -k, but for example, when L is such that 2L -k = T. But since k is computed as 2L - T, that's always true. So the code checks that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input 'abababab' (T=8). For L=6, which is in the range ( (8+1)//2 = 4.5 → 5, up to T-1=7. So L=5,6,7.\n\nFor L=6, k=2*6 -8=4. Check if 1<=4 <6 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[:6] → 'ababab'.\n\nCheck s_candidate[-4:] → 'abab' (positions 2-5). s_candidate[:4] is 'abab' → same.\n\nt[L:] is t[6:] → 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab' → same. So condition holds. So returns YES.\n\nThus, code would output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' (T=9). For L=5, k=1. s_candidate is 'acaca'. Check s_candidate[-1:] is 'a', and s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → same. t[L:] is t[5:] → 'cacaca' (positions 5-8: 'caca')? Wait, original t is 'acacacaca' (indices 0-8):\n\n0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a, 5:c, 6:a, 7:c, 8:a → t[5:] is 'c a c a' → 'caca' (length 4). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca' (since s_candidate is 'acaca', indexes 0-4. [1:] is 'caca'). So yes. So code returns YES.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where T is 2. For example, input is 'aa'. Possible L is (2+1)//2 = 1.5 → 2. But the upper bound is T-1=1. So the loop runs from 2 to 1, which is invalid. So no iterations. Output is NO. But wait, what's the actual case?\n\nThe input is 'aa'. Could it be formed by overlapping two same messages? Let's see. The original two messages would be s and s. The merged string is s + s[k:], where k is between 1 and L-1. Let's see possible L. For T=2, possible L must be between (2+1)/2=1.5 → 2 and T-1=1. Which is impossible. So no possible L. So output is NO. Which is correct. Because the input 'aa' could be formed by two 'a's sent normally (without error) or with error? Wait, according to the note, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. For example, if the input is 'abcd', it's considered as no error. Similarly, if input is 'aa', it could be two 'a's sent normally (so no error) or with an error? But according to the problem statement, the error is when two messages are merged with an overlap. However, the problem says that the full overlap (i.e., the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. So for example, if two messages 'a' are sent, and merged with full overlap (so the result is 'a'), but the problem says that this is not considered an error. However, the input here is 'aa' which is two 'a's sent without error. But according to the problem, the error is only when two messages are merged with an overlap. But the input 'aa' could be formed by two messages 'a' sent without error (so no error) or by two messages 'aa' sent with an error? No, because the error requires that two messages are merged with an overlap. For example, if the original messages were 'aa', then merging with overlap would require that the overlap is between 1 and len(s)-1 = 1. So len(s) is 2, overlap must be between 1 and 1. So k=1. Then merged string is s + s[1:] → 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa' which is longer than T=2. So no. So for input 'aa', the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 'aaaaa'. Let's see possible L.\n\nT=5. Possible L is (5+1)/2 = 3 to 4.\n\nFor L=3: k = 2*3 -5 = 1. Check 1<=1 <3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 3 characters: 'aaa'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char (a) equals first 1 char (a). Yes. Then check t[3:] is 'aa' and s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'aa'. So yes. So returns YES and 'aaa'.\n\nSo the input 'aaaaa' would be considered as possible. Because two 'aaa's merged with overlap of 1. So the merged string is 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa'.\n\nSo code would output YES.\n\nAnother case: input is 'ababab' (T=6). Let's see.\n\nPossible L ranges from (6+1)//2=3.5 → 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4 -6 = 2. Check 1<=2 <4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'abab'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars of s_candidate is 'ab' and first 2 chars is 'ab' → yes. Then check t[4:] is 'ab' and s_candidate[2:] is 'ab' → yes. So returns YES. So the answer would be 'abab'.\n\nBut the original two messages would be 'abab' and 'abab' merged with overlap of 2. The merged string is 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab' which is the input. So correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead t from input. Then process as per above.\n\nBut note that in Python, for strings, slicing is t[:L], and for negative indices, but in this case, for s_candidate[-k:], which is the last k characters.\n\nSo code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nT = len(t)\n\nfound = False\n\nfor L in range( (T + 1) // 2, T ):\n\n    k = 2 * L - T\n\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n\n        continue\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    # check if the last k chars of s_candidate == first k chars of s_candidate\n\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n        # check if the rest of t matches s_candidate[k:]\n\n        if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\nif not found:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but for L in range(...). Let me check in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. For example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1, ..., b-1. So for T=8, the upper bound is T, which is 8. So the loop runs for L in 5,6,7 (since range( (8+1)//2=4.5 → 5, 8) → 5,6,7. Correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs:\n\nSample input 2: 'acacacaca' → output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nIn code, for L=5, which is in the loop. k=1. s_candidate is 'acaca' → last 1 char is 'a', first 1 is 'a'. t[L:] is t[5:] → 'caca' (as discussed). s_candidate[k:] is 'caca' → matches. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input: 'tatbt' → output is NO. Let's see.\n\nT=5. Possible L is (5+1)//2 =3, up to 4.\n\nFor L=3: k=2*3 -5=1. Check 1<=1 <3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nCheck last 1 char is 't', first 1 is 't' → yes. Then check t[3:] is 'bt' and s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'at'. So 'bt' vs 'at' → no. So invalid.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -5 =3. Check 1<=3 <4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatb'.\n\nCheck last 3 chars: 'atb' and first 3 chars 'tat' → not same. So invalid. So no. Output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'abcabc' → output NO. As discussed.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where multiple possible L's exist? For example, the sample input 'acacacaca' could have L=5 (as discussed) and also perhaps other L's? Let's see. For T=9, L can be 5,6,7,8?\n\nWait, T=9. The loop runs for L in (9+1)//2 =5 to T-1=8. So L=5,6,7,8.\n\nFor L=5: k=1 → valid.\n\nFor L=6: k=2*6-9=3. Check 1<=3 <6 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 characters: 'acacac'.\n\nCheck last 3 chars of s_candidate: 'cac' and first 3 chars 'aca' → not same. So invalid.\n\nFor L=7: k=2*7 -9=5. Check 1<=5 <7 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 chars: 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck last 5 chars: 'cacaca' (positions 2-6?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is length 7. last 5 chars: positions 2 to 6 (inclusive). s_candidate[-5:] is 'cacaca' (assuming the string is 'acacaca').\n\nFirst 5 chars: 'acaca' → compare to 'cacaca'? No. So invalid.\n\nFor L=8: k=2*8-9=7. Check 1<=7 <8 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 8 characters: 'acacacac'.\n\nCheck last 7 chars: 'cacacac' and first 7 chars 'acacaca' → not same. So invalid. Thus, only L=5 is valid.\n\nSo code returns correct answer.\n\nAnother case: input 'aaaaa' (T=5). Possible L=3 and 4.\n\nFor L=3: k=1. s_candidate is 'aaa'. Check last 1 == first 1. Yes. t[L:] is 'aa' and s_candidate[k:] is 'aa'. So valid. So returns YES.\n\nAnother possible L=4: k= 2*4-5=3. Check 1<=3 <4 → yes. s_candidate is 'aaaa'. Check last 3 chars 'aaa' and first 3 'aaa' → same. Then t[L:] is t[4:] → 'a'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[3:] → 'a'. So valid. So returns YES. So code would return the first possible L (3) and output 'aaa'.\n\nBut the problem says that any possible s is acceptable. So code is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input, process as per above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nt = input().strip()\nT = len(t)\nfound = False\nfor L in range( (T + 1) // 2, T ):\n    k = 2 * L - T\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n        found = True\n        break\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len is 21. For L=11, which is in the loop. k=2*11 -21=1. Check. The code returns YES and the correct s_candidate.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → returns YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSample Input 3: 'abcabc' → returns NO.\n\nSample Input 4: 'abababab' → returns YES and 'ababab'.\n\nSample Input 5: 'tatbt' → returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aaaaa' → returns YES and 'aaa'.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aaa' → len is 3. Possible L ranges from (3+1)//2 = 2 to 2 (since T-1 is 2). So L=2. k= 2*2 -3 = 1. Check 1<=1 <2 → yes. s_candidate is 'aa'. Check last 1 char is 'a', first 1 is 'a'. t[L:] is t[2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message, and the overlap length must be between 1 and the length of `s` minus 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Overlap**: The merged string `t` can be formed by overlapping two identical strings `s`. If `s` has length `L`, then the length of `t` should be `2L - k`, where `k` is the overlap length (1 ≤ k < L).\n2. **Range Calculation**: For a given length `T` of string `t`, possible values of `L` (length of `s`) range from `(T + 1) // 2` to `T - 1`.\n3. **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `L`, calculate the overlap `k` as `2L - T`. Check if the overlap is valid and if the string `t` can be split into two parts that match the required overlap conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nT = len(t)\nfound = False\n\nfor L in range((T + 1) // 2, T):\n    k = 2 * L - T\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `T` is determined.\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: We iterate over possible lengths `L` for the original message `s` from `(T + 1) // 2` to `T - 1`.\n3. **Calculating Overlap**: For each `L`, compute the overlap `k` using the formula `2L - T`.\n4. **Validation Checks**: Check if the overlap `k` is within valid bounds (1 ≤ k < L). Then verify if the substring `t[:L]` (candidate `s`) can form `t` when overlapped correctly.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`. If no valid `s` is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for `s` and ensures the correct overlap conditions are met, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
