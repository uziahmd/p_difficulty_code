Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of valid sequences after each modification to a string S. The key points are:\n\n- Each English letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1-4, made up of 0s and 1s. However, four specific strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So any substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of those four) contributes to the count.\n\nThe task is, after each character is appended to S, to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. And since the numbers can be huge, we need to output them modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each step, after appending a character, we need to consider all possible substrings of the current S and check if they are valid Morse code strings. But since S can be up to m characters long (m up to 3000), checking all substrings each time would be O(n^2) per step, which for m=3000 would be O(3000^3) operations. That's 27 billion operations, which is way too slow. So we need a more efficient way.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a dynamic programming approach here. Let me think.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For each position in the string S, we can track the number of valid Morse code sequences that end at that position. Then, the total number of valid sequences is the sum over all positions of these counts.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each new character added to S, we can look back at all possible positions where a valid Morse code could end. Let me explain.\n\nSuppose S is built incrementally. After adding the i-th character, the new string is S[0..i]. For each position j in 0..i, we can check if the substring ending at j is a valid Morse code. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, the valid Morse code strings are of lengths 1-4. So for each new character added, we can check the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters (depending on the length of the string) to see if they form a valid code. For each such valid code, we can add 1 to the count. However, this would only account for single-letter sequences. But the problem requires counting all possible sequences of letters. For example, if the string is \"111\", then the substrings \"1\", \"11\", \"111\" are valid, and also combinations like \"1\" followed by \"1\" (i.e., two letters), etc.\n\nWait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into Morse code letters. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" (two letters) or as \"11\" (one letter). Each of these splits contributes to the count. So the total number of sequences is the number of ways to split all possible substrings of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to break a string into valid words, which is typically solved with dynamic programming.\n\nSo here's an idea: For the current string S, let dp[i] be the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total number of sequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i from 1 to len(S).\n\nWait, but the problem is not just about the entire string. It's about all possible substrings. Wait no. Wait, the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring of S. So for example, if the entire string S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings can be split into valid Morse code letters. For each such substring, we need to count the number of ways to split it into valid codes, and sum all those numbers across all possible substrings.\n\nBut that seems computationally heavy. Because for each substring, we have to compute the number of splits. How can we do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: For each position i in the string S, we want to find the number of valid splits for all substrings that end at position i. Then, accumulate these numbers.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a dynamic programming array, say, dp[i], which represents the number of valid sequences for the substring ending at position i. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For each position i in the string (the current length of S after m steps), we can consider all possible substrings that end at i. For each such substring, we can calculate the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters. The total answer is the sum of all these numbers for all substrings.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the total number of valid sequences. Let's denote the current string as s. For each possible substring t of s, we need to compute the number of ways to split t into valid Morse code letters. The sum of all these numbers is the answer.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this sum after each step.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this sum efficiently. Let's consider that when we add a new character to the end of the string, we can process the new possible substrings that end at this new character.\n\nFor example, when the string is length n, adding a new character makes it length n+1. The new substrings that end at position n+1 are the substrings of length 1, 2, ..., up to n+1. However, for each of these substrings, we need to compute the number of ways to split them into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me think of using a dynamic programming approach for each possible substring. Let's define for each position i in the string, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i into valid codes. For example, for the current string s of length l, for each position j from 1 to l, let dp[j] be the number of ways to split the first j characters of s into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total number of sequences is the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[l].\n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Because dp[j] represents the number of ways to split the first j characters into valid codes. So the total number of sequences for all substrings that end at position j would be dp[j], but wait no. Because the dp[j] counts the number of ways to split the entire first j characters. However, the problem wants all possible substrings. So for example, for the string \"abc\", the substrings are \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"b\", \"bc\", \"c\". Each of these substrings contributes their own number of splits. But if we use the dp approach for the entire string, how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: For each position i in the string, we can compute the number of ways to split the substring ending at i into valid codes. Let's call this value f[i]. Then, the total answer is the sum of f[1] + f[2] + ... + f[n], where n is the current length of S.\n\nBut how to compute f[i]. Let's think of f[i] as the number of ways to split the substring s[0..i] (assuming 0-based or 1-based) into valid codes. But that's not exactly the case. Because f[i] would be the number of ways to split the entire substring up to i. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings. So for example, for the substring s[0..i], the number of ways to split it is f[i], but also for the substring s[1..i], s[2..i], etc. So this approach may not directly help.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: For each position i in the string, and for each possible starting position j (j ≤ i), compute the number of ways to split the substring s[j..i] into valid codes. Summing all these numbers over all i and j gives the answer.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming for the entire string. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of the string into valid codes. Then, for the entire string of length n, the total number of sequences for all substrings is the sum over all k from 1 to n of dp[k], but that's not correct. Because dp[k] represents the number of ways to split the entire first k characters. However, the problem wants to count all possible substrings. For example, for the substring s[1..k], which is not the first k characters, but a substring starting at position 1 and ending at k.\n\nSo maybe the dp approach needs to be modified. Let me think of another way.\n\nSuppose we have a dynamic programming array, say, dp[i], which represents the number of valid sequences for the substring ending at position i. For example, dp[i] is the total number of ways to split all substrings that end at position i. Then, the total answer is the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[n].\n\nHow can we compute dp[i]?\n\nFor each position i, we can look back at the previous positions and see if the substring ending at i can be split into valid codes. For example, for each possible length l (1 to 4), if the substring s[i-l+1..i] is a valid Morse code, then we can add to dp[i] the value dp[i-l] + 1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of dp[i] as the number of ways to split the substring s[0..i] (assuming 0-based) into valid codes. Then, dp[i] = sum_{l=1}^4 (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then dp[i-l] + 1?), but I'm not sure.\n\nActually, the standard way to compute the number of ways to split a string into valid words is:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split)\nfor i from 1 to n:\n    dp[i] = sum over l in 1..4 where s[i-l..i] is valid, then dp[i - l]\n\nSo dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid codes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of sequences for all substrings would be the sum of dp[i] for all i from 1 to n. Wait, no. Because dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the entire first i characters into valid codes. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings. For example, if the entire string is of length 3, then the substrings are of lengths 1, 2, 3, and their respective splits. But the standard dp approach would give us for each length i, the number of splits for the entire first i characters. So the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[n] would be the total number of sequences for all substrings. Because for each i, the dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid codes. Which is exactly the number of sequences for the substring s[0..i-1] (assuming 0-based), but that's just one substring. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings. So this approach doesn't capture that.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the string is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (counted in dp[1])\nLength 2: \"11\" (counted in dp[2])\nLength 3: \"111\" (counted in dp[3])\nBut also, substrings that start in the middle. Like \"1\" (from position 1), \"1\" (position 2), \"11\" (positions 1-2), etc. But in the standard dp approach, dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters. So for the entire string of length 3, dp[3] counts the number of ways to split the entire string into valid codes, but the other substrings (like the first two characters, etc.) are accounted for in their respective dp values.\n\nWait, but the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[n] would be the total number of ways to split all prefixes of the string into valid codes. However, the problem requires considering all substrings, not just prefixes. So this approach is not sufficient.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each new character added, we can consider all possible substrings that end at the current position. For each such substring, we can compute the number of valid splits. Then, the total answer is the sum of all these numbers for all positions up to current.\n\nSo, for example, when the string is \"111\", after adding each character:\n\nAfter first '1', the answer is 1 (only \"1\").\n\nAfter second '1', the substrings ending at position 2 are \"1\" (new) and \"11\". Each of these can be split in some ways. The total is 1 (from \"1\") + 2 (from \"11\" which can be split as \"1\"+\"1\" or \"11\") → total 3. But according to the sample input, after two '1's, the answer is 3. Which matches.\n\nThen after third '1', the substrings ending at position 3 are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these contributes:\n\n- \"1\": 1 way.\n- \"11\": 2 ways.\n- \"111\": 3 ways (split as \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\", \"1\"+\"11\", \"11\"+\"1\"). But according to the sample explanation, the total is 7. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sample after 3 '1's: the answer is 7. Which comes from the sum of all possible substrings. The substrings are:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings (each \"1\") → 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nLength 2: 2 substrings (\"11\", \"11\") → each contributes 2 → 2*2=4.\n\nLength 3: 1 substring (\"111\") → contributes 3 → 3.\n\nTotal 3+4+3=10? But sample output is 7. Wait, no. Wait the sample input says that after 3 steps, the output is 7. So clearly my reasoning is wrong here. What's the problem?\n\nAh! Oh right, the problem counts the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S. Each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring into valid Morse code letters. However, each split is considered as a unique sequence. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split into two letters (two 'T's) or one letter (M), so two different sequences. But in the sample explanation, when S is \"111\", the answer is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe sample explanation says that there are 7 sequences. Let me recount:\n\nThe valid substrings and their splits:\n\n- All possible substrings:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" → 1 way (sequence of 1 letter).\n\nLength 2: \"11\" → 2 ways (split into two letters or one letter).\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → 3 ways (split into three letters, or first two and then one, or first one and then two).\n\nBut also, substrings that are not the entire string. For example, the first two characters (positions 0 and 1) form \"11\" which contributes 2 ways. The last two characters (positions 1 and 2) also form \"11\", contributing 2 ways. The first character (position 0) contributes 1 way. The second character (position 1) contributes 1 way. The third character (position 2) contributes 1 way. Then the substrings of length 2: two of them, each contributing 2. The substrings of length 3: one, contributing 3. The substrings of length 1: three, each contributing 1. So total is 3*1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 3 +4 +3 = 10. But the sample says the answer is 7. Wait, this discrepancy suggests that my understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait looking back at the sample explanation:\n\nSample input is 3 steps, appending '1' each time. So S is \"111\".\n\nThe explanation says that the valid sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (1+1), \"TM\" (1+11), \"MT\" (11+1), \"TTT\" (1+1+1). Total of 7 sequences.\n\nAh, so the problem counts all sequences of letters, but each sequence is counted once per occurrence in the substrings. However, the way the splits are counted is that each split corresponds to a unique sequence of letters. So for example, the substring \"11\" can be split into two letters (TT) or one letter (M). Thus, two different sequences. However, the problem counts all such possibilities across all substrings.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, for the string \"111\", the answer is 7. But according to the previous calculation, there are 10 sequences. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation lists the following sequences:\n\n- T (from 1)\n- M (from 11)\n- O (from 111)\n- TT (from 11)\n- TM (from 111)\n- MT (from 111)\n- TTT (from 111)\n\nThat's 7 sequences. But why isn't the other split of the \"11\" (as two Ts) counted as another sequence? Or is it?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the sequences are all possible sequences represented by some substring. So for example, the substring \"11\" can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" (TT) or as \"11\" (M). Both are valid. So why is the sample answer 7 instead of 3 (from length 1) + 2 (from length 2) + 3 (from length 3) = 8? Wait the sample explanation lists 7. Where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me recheck the sample explanation. The sample says:\n\nAfter appending all three 1s, S is \"111\". The valid sequences are:\n\n\"1\" (T), \"11\" (M), \"111\" (O), \"TT\" (split of \"11\"), \"TM\" (split of \"111\"), \"MT\" (split of \"111\"), \"TTT\" (split of \"111\").\n\nSo the total is 7.\n\nBut why isn't the split of \"11\" as two letters counted as another sequence? Because that's \"TT\", which is counted as one of the sequences. So in the sample explanation, the split of \"11\" into two letters is counted as \"TT\", which is one sequence. So why does the sample explanation not include the split of \"11\" into one letter (M)? Because that's already counted as one of the sequences (the M). So the total sequences are:\n\nEach substring contributes the number of ways to split it into valid codes. The sum of all those numbers is the answer.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 7. Let's compute the sum:\n\nFor all substrings:\n\nSubstrings of length 1: there are 3 of them. Each contributes 1 way (split into one letter). So 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: there are two of them (positions 0-1 and 1-2). Each contributes 2 ways. So 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSubstrings of length 3: one substring, contributing 3 ways. So 3.\n\nTotal sum: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10. But sample says 7. So clearly, my understanding of the problem is wrong.\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding of the problem statement. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, what's a \"sequence of English letters\"? For example, the sequence \"TT\" is a sequence of two letters. Each of these letters must be represented by their Morse code. So the entire sequence's Morse code is the concatenation of the individual codes. So the problem is counting all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting some substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut each such sequence is counted once for each way it can be formed by splitting a substring. However, the same sequence can be formed by multiple substrings. For example, the sequence \"T\" can be formed by any of the three single '1's in the string. But according to the sample explanation, the answer counts all such possibilities as separate sequences? Or is it that each sequence is counted once regardless of how many times it appears in the substrings?\n\nNo, the sample explanation counts the different splits as different sequences. For example, the sample explanation includes \"TT\" as a sequence. But how many times does \"TT\" appear? It appears once for the substring \"11\" (split into two letters), and also for the substring \"11\" in positions 1-2. But according to the sample explanation, it's counted once. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 7, which includes \"TT\" once.\n\nWait this suggests that the problem counts the number of distinct sequences of letters, not the number of ways to split substrings. But that contradicts the sample explanation. For example, in the first sample, after three '1's, the answer is 7. The sample explanation lists 7 different sequences. However, according to the earlier calculation, there are more than 7 possible sequences. For example, the sequence \"T\" appears three times (from each of the three single '1's). But the sample explanation counts it once. So this suggests that the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences of letters, not the number of ways to split substrings.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem statement. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nAh, the key is that each sequence is counted once if it exists as a way to split any substring. For example, if the same sequence can be formed by multiple substrings, it's still counted once. But the sample explanation shows that the answer is 7, which includes sequences like \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". So each unique sequence is counted once. However, the initial analysis of the sample suggests that there are more than 7 sequences.\n\nThis indicates that my initial understanding of the problem was incorrect. Instead of counting the number of ways to split substrings, the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any possible way of splitting any substring of S into Morse code letters.\n\nBut how does that align with the sample?\n\nIn the sample, the sequences are:\n\n- T (from any single '1')\n- M (from any '11' substring)\n- O (from the '111' substring)\n- TT (from any '11' substring)\n- TM (from the '111' substring)\n- MT (from the '111' substring)\n- TTT (from the '111' substring)\n\nSo even though there are multiple occurrences of the same sequence (like T appearing three times), it's counted once. Hence, the answer is 7.\n\nBut this changes the problem entirely. Now, the problem is to find the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a completely different problem. For example, for the sample input, the answer is the number of distinct sequences generated by all possible splits of all substrings.\n\nBut this seems very challenging, especially given the constraints. For m up to 3000, and each step potentially adding new substrings and sequences, it's unclear how to track all possible sequences without excessive computation.\n\nBut the sample explanation suggests that the problem is not about counting the number of ways to split, but the number of distinct sequences. However, the note in the problem says that the first sample's answer is 7, which matches the count of distinct sequences. However, the problem statement says:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWhich implies that each such sequence is counted once, regardless of how many substrings it comes from.\n\nBut then, how can we compute this? For example, when a new character is added to S, we need to find all new sequences that can be formed by splitting new substrings into valid codes, and add them to the set of existing sequences.\n\nBut for m=3000, and each step possibly adding up to O(4*3000) new sequences, this might be manageable if we can represent the sequences in a way that allows efficient checking of existence.\n\nHowever, the problem's note says that the first sample's answer after three steps is 7, which is the count of distinct sequences. So this seems to be the correct interpretation.\n\nBut this raises the question: how to track all possible sequences that can be formed by any split of any substring of S.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, especially for large m. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, keeping track of all possible sequences that can be formed up to each step.\n\nBut even then, for m=3000, and each step adding O(4) new possibilities, the total number of sequences could be exponential, which is not feasible.\n\nThis suggests that my initial understanding of the problem was incorrect, and that the original problem statement must have meant something else. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's note:\n\n\"In the first sample after all characters have been appended to S, so S is \"111\". As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows. \"T\" (translates into \"1\") \"M\" (translates into \"11\") \"O\" (translates into \"111\") \"TT\" (translates into \"11\") \"TM\" (translates into \"111\") \"MT\" (translates into \"111\") \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\"\n\nAh, this is the key. The problem is not about counting the number of distinct sequences, but about counting the number of ways to split substrings into valid codes. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split into \"1\" and \"1\" (TT), or into \"11\" (M). These are two different sequences. Hence, the total count for the sample is 7.\n\nWait, the sample explanation lists seven sequences, but according to the earlier calculation, the total should be:\n\nFor each substring:\n\n- Substrings of length 1: 3 substrings, each contributes 1 way → 3.\n\n- Substrings of length 2: 2 substrings, each contributes 2 ways → 4.\n\n- Substrings of length 3: 1 substring, contributes 3 ways → 3.\n\nTotal: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10. But the sample says 7. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait the sample explanation lists seven sequences, but the actual count should be 7. Why is there a discrepancy?\n\nLet me re-calculate the sample:\n\nThe sample says that after three '1's, the answer is 7. According to the explanation, the sequences are:\n\n1. T (from \"1\")\n\n2. M (from \"11\")\n\n3. O (from \"111\")\n\n4. TT (from \"11\")\n\n5. TM (from \"111\")\n\n6. MT (from \"111\")\n\n7. TTT (from \"111\")\n\nSo that's 7 sequences. But according to the earlier breakdown, the total number of ways should be:\n\nFor each substring:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings → each has 1 way → 3.\n\nLength 2: 2 substrings → each has 2 ways → 4.\n\nLength 3: 1 substring → 3 ways → 3.\n\nTotal 3+4+3=10. So why is the sample answer 7?\n\nAh, I think I now understand the confusion. The problem is not counting the number of ways to split substrings, but the number of distinct sequences of letters. For example, the sequence \"T\" appears in three different substrings, but it's counted once. Similarly, \"TT\" appears in two substrings but is counted once. However, the sample explanation lists \"TT\" once, and \"T\" once. So the sample answer is counting distinct sequences, not the total number of splits.\n\nBut this contradicts the sample explanation. Let me re-read the sample explanation:\n\nThe sample explanation says that all non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code are as follows. The list includes \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". So that's 7 distinct sequences. This suggests that the problem is indeed counting the number of distinct sequences, not the number of ways to split.\n\nBut then, how to explain the sample input's output being 7? It seems that the problem statement is ambiguous, but the sample indicates that it's about distinct sequences.\n\nBut this would make the problem much harder, as we need to track all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nHowever, the initial problem statement's note says that the answer for the first sample is 7, which matches the count of distinct sequences. This suggests that the problem is indeed about counting the number of distinct sequences.\n\nBut this seems very challenging for m up to 3000. How to efficiently track all possible sequences?\n\nAn alternative idea: Perhaps the problem is not about distinct sequences, but about the number of ways to split substrings into valid codes, and the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement:\n\nYour task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nThe wording suggests that each sequence is counted once for each occurrence in any substring. For example, if a sequence can be formed in multiple ways, it's counted multiple times. But the sample explanation suggests otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of distinct substrings of S that are valid Morse code strings. But that would be different. For example, in the first sample, the valid substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", and \"11\" (appearing twice), but the count would be 3 (distinct substrings). But the sample output is 7, so that's not it.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nFirst sample input is 3 steps, appending '1' each time. Output is 1, 3, 7.\n\nAfter first step, S is \"1\". The number of non-empty sequences is 1 (just \"T\").\n\nAfter second step, S is \"11\". The possible substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" → T\n\n- \"1\" → T\n\n- \"11\" → M or TT\n\nSo the sequences are T, M, TT. Total 3, which matches the second line of the output.\n\nAfter third step, the substrings are:\n\nAll substrings of \"111\":\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (T), \"1\" (T), \"1\" (T) → but each contributes T once.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (M or TT), \"11\" (M or TT).\n\nLength 3: \"111\" (O, TM, MT, TTT).\n\nSo the distinct sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT → 7, which matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the problem is indeed about counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe challenge is to track all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters, and count how many distinct ones there are.\n\nBut for m up to 3000, this could be computationally intensive unless we find a way to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think: For each new character added to S, we can consider all possible substrings ending at this character. For each such substring, we can generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse code letters. We then add these sequences to a global set, and the size of the set is the answer.\n\nHowever, generating all possible sequences for each substring is going to be expensive, especially for longer substrings. For example, a substring of length 4 could have multiple splits, leading to many sequences.\n\nBut given that m is 3000, and each step adds one character, and for each step, the number of substrings ending at that character is O(n), and for each such substring, the number of splits could be O(2^k) where k is the length, this approach would be too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Use dynamic programming to track all possible sequences that can be formed up to each position.\n\nLet me think: For each position i in the string, maintain a set of sequences that can be formed by splitting substrings ending at i. Then, the total number of sequences is the union of all these sets.\n\nBut how to build this.\n\nFor example, when processing the i-th character, we can look back at the previous positions and see if the substring ending at i of length l (1-4) is valid. If it is, then we can take the sequences from the previous position (i-l) and append the corresponding letter to each of them, and also add the sequence consisting of just this new letter.\n\nWait, but this seems like a way to track all possible sequences that end at position i.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet's define dp[i] as the set of all sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting some substring ending at position i. Then, for each i, we can look back at positions i-1, i-2, i-3, i-4 (if they exist), and for each valid Morse code string of length l (1-4) ending at i, we can take the sequences in dp[i-l] and append the corresponding letter to them, and also add the sequence containing just the new letter.\n\nBut how to map the Morse code strings to their corresponding letters? Well, the problem says that each valid Morse code string (except the four invalid ones) corresponds to a unique letter. However, the problem does not require knowing what the letters are, only that each valid string represents a unique letter. Thus, for our purposes, we can treat each valid Morse code string as representing a unique \"letter\" (though it's actually a letter, but the exact mapping is not needed). So for the purpose of tracking sequences, each valid Morse code string is treated as a unique symbol, and sequences are formed by concatenating these symbols.\n\nBut this is not accurate. For example, the Morse code \"1\" corresponds to a single letter (say T), and \"11\" corresponds to another letter (say M). So the sequence \"T\" (from \"1\") and \"M\" (from \"11\") are distinct. Also, the sequence \"TT\" is formed by splitting \"11\" into two \"1\"s.\n\nThus, the sequences are built by combining the letters represented by the valid Morse code strings.\n\nBut since the problem states that each valid Morse code string corresponds to a unique letter, we can treat each valid string as a unique letter for the purpose of forming sequences.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct sequences formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code strings, where each valid string represents a unique letter.\n\nNow, the challenge is to track all such sequences as the string S grows.\n\nLet me think about how to model this with dynamic programming. Let's define for each position i, a set of sequences that can be formed by splitting substrings ending at i. Then, the total number of sequences is the union of all these sets across all positions.\n\nTo compute this, for each new character added to S, we can look back at the previous positions and check for valid Morse code strings of lengths 1-4 ending at i. For each such valid string, we can generate new sequences by appending this string's letter to all sequences in dp[i-l], plus the sequence consisting of this single letter.\n\nFor example, if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a string S in Morse code after each modification. The key challenge is efficiently tracking these sequences as the string S evolves with each character addition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, we identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. We exclude the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Sets**: Use dynamic programming to track all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting substrings ending at each position in the string. For each new character added to the string, check all valid Morse code substrings ending at that position and update the set of sequences accordingly.\n3. **Efficient Set Operations**: Maintain a global set to keep track of all unique sequences encountered.
