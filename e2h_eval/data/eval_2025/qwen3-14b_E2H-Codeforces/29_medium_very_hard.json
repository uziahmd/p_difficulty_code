Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nSo, the problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits. Each query replaces all occurrences of a certain digit with another string. After all queries, I have to compute the number represented by the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But there's a catch: leading zeros are ignored when considering the number, but the actual string might have leading zeros. However, if the string is empty, it's considered as zero.\n\nThe challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the number of queries and the length of the string can be up to 1e5. If I naively process each substitution by replacing every occurrence in the string, that would be O(n * len(s)) time, which might be too slow for large inputs. For example, if each query replaces a digit that appears many times, and there are many queries, this approach could be O(1e10) operations, which is definitely not feasible.\n\nHmm. So, what's the alternative? Maybe we can model the substitutions in a way that avoids actually building the entire string. Since substitutions are done in sequence, and each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can track for each digit what it gets replaced with, and then compute the final value using some dynamic programming or mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that each substitution is applied in order. Suppose we have a mapping from digits to their replacement strings. However, when a substitution is done, say, replacing '2' with '00', then any subsequent substitution that refers to '0' will affect those replacements. So, the order of processing the queries is important. Therefore, we need to track for each digit, what it's currently mapped to, considering all previous substitutions.\n\nBut how do we compute the final value efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: since each substitution replaces a digit with a string, perhaps we can model the effect of substitutions as transformations on the digits. For example, if we have a digit d, and after some substitutions, it's replaced by a string t. Then, when we process the substitutions, we can track for each digit d, the value of the string it represents modulo MOD (1e9+7), along with the length of that string (since when digits are concatenated, the length affects the modulus calculation).\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think about the problem in terms of the contribution of each original digit in the initial string. Each substitution can be seen as a replacement of a digit with another string. But since substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution may replace digits that were previously substituted, we need to track for each digit, what is the current expansion.\n\nFor example, suppose the initial string is '123'. Then, if we first replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with 'a', then the original '2' would be replaced by 'aa' (since '0' is replaced by 'a').\n\nBut how can we model this without building the entire string?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for each digit d, we can track the \"expansion\" of d, which is the string that d would be replaced with after all substitutions. But since substitutions can change the expansion of digits over time, we need to track this dynamically.\n\nHowever, if we can represent for each digit, the expansion as a function that can be composed with other expansions, maybe we can compute the final value by processing the substitutions in reverse order or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as building a tree of substitutions. Each substitution replaces a digit with a string, which may contain other digits. So, for example, if we replace '2' with 'ab', and then replace 'a' with 'cd', but wait, no, the substitutions are only on single digits. So each substitution replaces a digit (like '2') with a string (like 'ab'), which may contain other digits (like 'a' and 'b'). But during substitution, when you replace a digit, you replace all instances of that digit in the current string with the new string. However, the substitutions are processed in order. So, for example, if we first replace '2' with 'ab', then later replace 'a' with 'c', then the original '2's would become 'cb'.\n\nBut how can we track this for all possible digits?\n\nWait, but the substitution queries are applied to the current string. So, for example, if the initial string is '123', and the first query is '2->00', then the string becomes '1003'. Then, if the next query is '0->7', then all 0s in the current string (which are the ones from the substitution) are replaced with '7's, so the string becomes '1773'.\n\nSo, the problem is that substitutions can affect the digits that were generated by prior substitutions. Therefore, if we want to model this, we need to track for each digit, what it expands to, considering all previous substitutions. However, when a substitution is made, it may overwrite the expansion of a digit. For example, if initially, digit '2' is expanded to 'ab', and then a substitution replaces 'a' with 'c', but 'a' isn't a digit. Wait, no. The substitution queries are always for a single digit. So, the substitution queries are of the form di → ti, where di is a single digit. So, ti can contain any digits, but the substitution replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. So, for example, if we have a substitution '2->3', then all '2's in the current string are replaced with '3's. Then, if there is a substitution '3->4', then all '3's (including those generated by the previous substitution) are replaced with '4's.\n\nSo, the key is that substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces all instances of a certain digit in the current string. But directly applying these substitutions to the string is not feasible for large input sizes. Hence, we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model for each digit, the current expansion. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each substitution query, we update the mapping for the digit di. However, when we replace di with ti, we need to consider that ti may contain digits that have their own expansions. So, for example, if we replace '2' with 'ab', and 'a' is a digit that has been replaced by some string, then the expansion of '2' would be the expansion of 'a' followed by the expansion of 'b'.\n\nWait, but ti can be any string of digits. So, when we process a substitution di → ti, we need to replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. However, ti may contain other digits. But if we track for each digit, what it expands to, then when a substitution is processed, we can update the expansion of di to be ti, but with the understanding that ti's digits may themselves expand.\n\nWait, but how do we track the expansion of ti's digits? Because when we process a substitution, say, di → ti, then any future substitution that affects digits in ti will affect the expansion of di. Therefore, we can't precompute the expansion of di once and for all. Instead, we need to track for each digit, what its expansion is, but the expansion is dynamic and depends on the substitutions that happen after it.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we compute the final value of the string after all substitutions, given that substitutions can affect each other?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the substitutions as a series of operations that modify the replacement rules. For example, for each digit, we can keep track of the current replacement string. When a substitution is applied, say, di → ti, then we update the replacement for di to be ti. However, when we later process ti, the replacement for di would be ti, but the ti may contain other digits which have their own replacements. Therefore, when we need to compute the value of the original string, we can process each character in the original string, and for each character, recursively expand it according to the current replacement rules.\n\nBut this recursive expansion could be expensive if done naively. However, since the substitutions are processed in order, and the replacement for a digit can be updated multiple times, perhaps we can memoize or cache the expansion of each digit, but in a way that accounts for the latest substitutions.\n\nBut even that might not be efficient. Let's think about the example where the original string is s = '222', and the substitutions are 2→0, then 0→7. So, the original '2's would first be replaced by '0's, then the '0's would be replaced by '7's. So the final string is '777'.\n\nIf we process the original string, each '2' is replaced by '0', and then each '0' is replaced by '7'. So, the expansion of '2' is first '0', then '7'. So, when the substitution for 0 is done, the expansion of 2 would be replaced by the expansion of '0's, which is '7's.\n\nBut how can we model this in code? Let's think about maintaining for each digit, a function that returns the current expansion. However, since the expansion can be a string, which can be very long, we can't store the entire string. Instead, we can track for each digit, the value of the expansion modulo MOD, and the length of the expansion (since when concatenating, the length affects the modulus). Because when you have two numbers A and B, the concatenation of A and B is equal to A * 10^len(B) + B. So, if we track for each digit, the value mod MOD and the length of the expansion, we can compute the concatenation of two expansions.\n\nThis seems promising. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet's define for each digit d, two values:\n\n- val[d]: the numeric value of the expansion of d, mod MOD.\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d.\n\nInitially, for each digit d, val[d] = d (mod MOD), and len[d] = 1.\n\nWhen a substitution is performed, say, replacing digit 'di' with the string ti, we need to compute the new val[di] and len[di] based on ti's characters.\n\nBut ti is a string of digits. Each character in ti is a digit, which can be expanded into their own val and len. So, the expansion of ti is the concatenation of the expansions of each of its digits. Therefore, the val of ti's expansion is computed as follows:\n\nSuppose ti is t_1 t_2 ... t_k, then the value of ti's expansion is:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nfor each character c in ti:\n\n    value = value * 10^len[c] + val[c]\n\nBut since we need to compute this mod MOD, we can compute it step by step.\n\nSimilarly, the length of ti's expansion is the sum of len[c] for each c in ti.\n\nTherefore, when we process a substitution di → ti, we need to compute the val and len of ti's expansion, and set val[di] and len[di] to these computed values.\n\nBut how do we compute the expansion of ti's string? Because each character in ti is a digit, which may have their own val and len. So, for example, if ti is 'ab', then the expansion of ti is the expansion of 'a' followed by the expansion of 'b'.\n\nTherefore, for each substitution, we can compute the new val and len for di by processing each character in ti, and combining their val and len accordingly.\n\nThis approach would allow us to process each substitution in O(len(ti)) time, which is acceptable because the sum of len(ti) across all queries is up to 1e5.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we can compute the value of the original string s by processing each character in s, and combining their val and len. For example, if the original s is 'abc', then the value is (val[a] * 10^{len[b] + len[c]} + val[b] * 10^{len[c]} + val[c]) mod MOD.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For the original string s, we can process each character in order, keeping track of the current value and the current length. For each character c in s:\n\ncurrent_value = current_value * (10^len[c]) + val[c]\n\ncurrent_length = current_length + len[c]\n\nBut since the exponents can be large, we need to precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD, up to the maximum possible length. However, the maximum possible length can be up to (sum of len(ti) for all substitutions). But since each substitution can be up to 1e5 in total, the maximum possible length is O(1e5). However, since we are processing the original string s, which can be up to 1e5 in length, and for each character in s, we need to compute 10^len[c], which depends on the len of the current character's expansion.\n\nBut how can we compute 10^len[c] mod MOD quickly?\n\nWell, for each substitution, when we compute the len for a digit, we can precompute the powers of 10 up to the maximum possible len. However, since len can be up to 1e5 (since each substitution can add to the length), but for each individual step, we can compute the power as needed using modular exponentiation.\n\nWait, but for each character in the original string, when we process it, we need to multiply the current value by 10^len[c], then add val[c]. However, calculating 10^len[c] mod MOD can be done with pow(10, len[c], MOD). However, computing this for each character could be expensive if done naively, but since len[c] can be up to O(1e5), and we have O(1e5) characters, this would be O(1e10) operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a way to compute 10^len[c] mod MOD quickly. How?\n\nWe can precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD for all possible len. But since len can be up to (say) 1e5 * 1e5? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nEach substitution replaces a digit with a string. The len for a digit is the sum of the len of the digits in the replacement string. For example, if a substitution replaces 'd' with a string of length L, then len[d] becomes L. However, since each substitution can be applied multiple times, but the len for a digit can be updated as per the substitution.\n\nBut during the substitution processing, when we compute the new len for a digit, we can compute it as the sum of the len of the digits in the replacement string. So, for example, when processing a substitution di → ti, the new len[di] is sum(len[c] for c in ti). Similarly, the new val[di] is computed as the concatenation of the val of each c in ti.\n\nBut for the original string processing, when we process each character, we need to compute 10^len[c], where len[c] is the current len of that digit. However, if we can precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD up to the maximum possible len, then we can use them.\n\nBut the maximum possible len for any digit is the sum of all the lengths of the ti's. Since each ti can be up to 1e5 in total sum, then the maximum len for a digit can be up to 1e5. So, precomputing 10^k mod MOD for k up to 1e5 would suffice.\n\nBut how do we know the maximum possible len before processing the substitutions? Well, during the substitution processing, the len of each digit can be tracked, and we can compute the maximum len required. Alternatively, since the maximum possible len is the sum of all ti's lengths, which is up to 1e5, we can precompute up to 1e5 + 1.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, each substitution replaces a digit with a string that is longer than the previous. For example, each substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 1, then 2, then 4, etc. However, given that the sum of all ti's lengths is 1e5, the maximum possible len for any digit is up to 1e5.\n\nTherefore, during the substitution processing, we can precompute an array of powers of 10 mod MOD, up to say 1e5 + 1. Then, when we need to compute 10^L mod MOD for some L, we can use this array.\n\nBut how do we precompute this array?\n\nYes. Let's precompute pow10 where pow10[k] = 10^k mod MOD, for k from 0 up to say 1e5 + 1. Since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and 10 is coprime with MOD (since MOD is 1e9+7 which is 10^9+7, which is not divisible by 2 or 5, so 10 and MOD are coprime). So, the pow10 array can be precomputed as:\n\npow10[0] = 1\n\npow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD for i >= 1.\n\nBut the problem is that during the substitution processing, the len of a digit can be up to 1e5, and during the original string processing, each character's len can be up to 1e5. So, the maximum exponent we need is up to 1e5.\n\nBut how can we know the maximum possible len in advance? Well, during substitution processing, we can track the maximum len encountered, and precompute pow10 up to that maximum. However, since the sum of ti lengths is up to 1e5, the maximum len for any digit can't exceed that sum. So, during substitution processing, the maximum len can be up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 + 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, during the processing of the original string, when we compute the value, we need to compute 10^len[c] for each digit c. However, the len[c] can be up to 1e5. Therefore, the pow10 array must be precomputed up to 1e5.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute pow10 array up to 1e5 + 1 (or more if needed).\n\nBut wait, how do we know the maximum needed len? Well, during substitution processing, the len for each digit can be up to the sum of the lengths of all ti's. Since the sum of ti's lengths is up to 1e5, we can precompute pow10 up to 1e5.\n\nBut during the original string processing, when we compute the value, each time we need to compute 10^len[c], where len[c] is the len of the current expansion of the digit. So, if len[c] can be up to 1e5, then precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut how do we compute pow10?\n\nLet me proceed with the steps:\n\nInitialize val and len for each digit. Initially, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1 for each digit d.\n\nThen, for each substitution query:\n\n- For the query di -> ti:\n\n   - Compute the new_val and new_len for di based on ti's digits.\n\n   - To compute new_val: process each character in ti, and for each character c in ti, we take their val and len, and compute the concatenation.\n\n   - For example, if ti is \"abc\", then the new_val is ( ( (val[a] * 10^len[b] + val[b]) * 10^len[c] + val[c] ) ) mod MOD.\n\n   - Similarly, new_len is len[a] + len[b] + len[c].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for ti?\n\nWe can process each character in ti in order, and for each step, keep track of the current value and current length. For example:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor c in ti:\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow10[len[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    current_len += len[c]\n\nSo, this way, for the string ti, we compute the value and length of its expansion.\n\nBut wait, the pow10 array is precomputed. However, during the substitution processing, len[c] can be up to 1e5, so we need pow10 up to that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nPrecompute pow10 up to say 1e5 + 1. However, since during substitution processing, the len[c] can be up to the sum of the ti's lengths, which is up to 1e5. Therefore, the pow10 array needs to be precomputed up to 1e5.\n\nBut how do we know the maximum len during substitution processing? Well, during substitution processing, the len can be up to the sum of all ti's lengths, which is given as up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, during substitution processing, when we compute the new_val for a substitution, we need to compute pow10[len[c]] for each c in ti. However, len[c] can be up to 1e5. Therefore, the pow10 array must be precomputed up to 1e5.\n\nBut how do we precompute that? Well, the maximum possible len is up to 1e5. So, precompute pow10 up to 1e5.\n\nBut wait, the original string can have up to 1e5 characters. So, during the processing of the original string, when we compute the value, for each character, we need to multiply the current value by 10^len[c], which is pow10[len[c]].\n\nBut the problem is that len[c] can be up to 1e5, and during the substitution processing, the len for each digit can be up to 1e5.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute pow10 up to 1e5 + 1 (since len can be up to 1e5, and 10^len can be up to 1e5).\n\nBut how do I know the maximum len needed in advance? Well, during substitution processing, the len for each digit can be up to the sum of the ti's lengths, which is given as up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut during substitution processing, when we compute the new_val for a substitution, we need to calculate pow10[len[c]] for each c in ti. However, len[c] can be up to 1e5. Therefore, the pow10 array must be precomputed up to 1e5.\n\nBut in Python, how do I precompute that?\n\nFirst, let's note that MOD is 1e9+7, which is 10^9+7. So, the pow10 array can be precomputed as follows:\n\nmax_pow = 1e5 + 10 (to be safe)\n\npow10 = [1] * (max_pow)\n\nfor i in 1 to max_pow-1:\n\n    pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD\n\nBut how do I determine the max_pow needed?\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5. So, the maximum possible len for any digit is up to that sum, which is up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut during substitution processing, when we process a query, we may need to compute pow10[len[c]] where len[c] is up to 1e5. So, precomputing up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut in practice, during substitution processing, the len of digits can be up to 1e5, so during substitution processing, when we compute the new_val for a substitution, we need to use pow10 up to that len.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\nRead the initial string s.\n\nRead n queries.\n\nProcess each query, updating the val and len for the corresponding digits.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, compute the value of the original string s by processing each character in s, and combining their val and len.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the pow10 array. However, the maximum len during substitution processing can be up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut how do I know the maximum possible len during substitution processing? Well, during substitution processing, the len can be up to the sum of the lengths of all ti's, which is given as up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is enough.\n\nBut in practice, when processing the substitution, for each ti, the len of ti is sum(len[c] for c in ti). So, during substitution processing, the len for a digit can be up to 1e5. Therefore, the pow10 array must be precomputed up to 1e5.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute pow10 up to say 1e5 + 1 (but how to determine the maximum needed? Well, perhaps during substitution processing, we can track the maximum len encountered and precompute up to that. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, since the sum of ti's lengths is up to 1e5, the maximum len for any digit can be up to 1e5, so precompute pow10 up to 1e5.)\n\nBut what if the sum of ti's lengths is less than 1e5? Well, precomputing up to 1e5 is safe.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nmax_len = 1e5 + 10 ?\n\nBut in Python, for the initial pow10 array, perhaps we can compute it on the fly. However, the problem is that the pow10 array can be up to 1e5 elements. So, for example, if the maximum len is 1e5, then pow10 array size is 1e5 + 1.\n\nBut during substitution processing, we need to compute pow10[len[c]] where len[c] can be up to 1e5. Therefore, the pow10 array must be precomputed up to 1e5.\n\nBut how can I compute that in Python? Well, the initial code can compute the pow10 array as follows:\n\nmax_pow = 10**5 + 10\n\npow10 = [1] * (max_pow)\n\nfor i in range(1, max_pow):\n\n    pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD\n\nBut what if the sum of ti's lengths is larger than 1e5? Well, the problem statement says that the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 1e5. Therefore, the maximum len for any digit is up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the next part is to process the substitution queries. For each query, we need to process the ti string and compute the new_val and new_len for the digit di.\n\nFor example, when a query is '2->00', we need to process the ti string '00', which consists of two '0's. For each '0' in ti, we look up val[0] and len[0], and compute the concatenation.\n\nSo, during substitution processing, for each query, we:\n\n- Get di (the digit to replace), and ti (the replacement string).\n\n- Compute the new_val and new_len for di as follows:\n\n   new_val = 0\n\n   new_len = 0\n\n   for each c in ti:\n\n       new_val = (new_val * pow10[len[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n\n       new_len += len[c]\n\n   Then, set val[di] = new_val, len[di] = new_len.\n\nBut wait, the pow10 array is precomputed. However, len[c] can be up to 1e5, which is covered by the pow10 array.\n\nBut how do we handle the pow10 array? Because during substitution processing, len[c] can be up to 1e5. So, the pow10 array must have indices up to 1e5. So, for example, if len[c] is 1e5, then pow10[len[c]] is pow10[1e5], which is precomputed.\n\nThus, this approach works.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, the original string s is processed character by character. For each character in s, we take its current val and len, and compute the overall value.\n\nFor example, the initial value is 0, and for each character c in s:\n\ncurrent_value = (current_value * pow10[len[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n\nSo, this is similar to the way we computed new_val for the substitution processing.\n\nBut again, len[c] can be up to 1e5, which is covered by the pow10 array.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nInitialize val and len arrays for digits 0-9.\n\nval = [i for i in 0..9]\n\nlen = [1 for _ in 0..9]\n\nprecompute pow10 up to 1e5.\n\nprocess each query:\n\n   for each query:\n\n       di, ti = parse the query.\n\n       compute new_val and new_len for di based on ti.\n\n       update val[di] and len[di]\n\nOnce all queries are done, process the original string s:\n\ncurrent_value = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    current_value = (current_value * pow10[len[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n\nreturn current_value\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? According to the problem statement, leading zeros are ignored when considering the number. However, the problem says that the string s may have leading zeros, but when converted to a number, leading zeros are ignored. However, the problem says that if the string is empty, it's considered as zero.\n\nBut how does this affect our calculation?\n\nFor example, if the resulting string is \"000\", then the number is zero. However, according to our code, the value computed would be 0, which is correct.\n\nBut what if the string is \"0123\"? Then, the number is 123, but our code would compute (0 * 10^len[1] + val[1]) etc. Wait, no. The code processes the original string s, which after all substitutions may have leading zeros. But according to the problem statement, when converting the string to a number, leading zeros are ignored. However, the code as written computes the value of the entire string, including leading zeros. For example, the string \"0123\" would be treated as 0123, which is 123. However, our code would compute (0 * 10^len[1] + val[1]) etc., but that's not correct. Wait, no. Because the code is processing the original string s, which after substitutions may have leading zeros. But how is that handled in the code?\n\nWait, the code is processing the original string s, and for each character in s, it's expanding it according to the substitutions. For example, if the original s is '0', and there are no substitutions, then the code would return 0 mod MOD, which is correct. If the original s is '0123', then the code would compute the value of the string '0123', which is 0123, which is 123. However, the code would compute it as 0 * 10^3 + 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0 = 0 + 100 + 20 +3 = 123. Which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the code is processing the original string s, which after substitution is a string of digits. But the code is not building that string, but instead, for each character in the original string, it's expanding it into its current val and len. But when the original string is processed, the code is effectively building the numeric value of the entire string, which includes leading zeros. However, according to the problem statement, leading zeros are ignored. But in reality, the numeric value of the string with leading zeros is equal to the numeric value of the string without leading zeros. For example, the string \"00123\" is 123, which is the same as the numeric value computed by the code.\n\nWait, but the code's calculation is exactly the numeric value of the string, regardless of leading zeros. Because for example, the code computes the value as if the string is parsed as a decimal number, which automatically ignores leading zeros. For example, the code's calculation for the string \"00123\" would be 0 * 10^... etc. But the code's calculation is correct, because the code is effectively treating the entire string as a number, which is the same as the number formed by the digits, ignoring leading zeros. Because leading zeros contribute nothing to the numeric value. Therefore, the code's approach is correct.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose the string is \"00\". The code would compute 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0, which is correct. Another example: \"0123\" is 123. The code computes 0 * 10^3 + 1 * 10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3 = 123, which is correct. So the code's approach is correct, because the way it combines the val and len is equivalent to the numeric value of the entire string. Therefore, leading zeros are handled automatically by the code.\n\nBut what if the string is empty? According to the problem statement, the number is considered as zero. However, the original string s is given with length at least 1. But after substitutions, the string could become empty. For example, if the original string is '3', and there is a substitution '3->', then the string becomes empty. In this case, the code would process the original string s, which is '3', and during substitution processing, the val for '3' would be 0 (since ti is empty string). Then, when processing the original string, the code would compute current_value = 0, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, how is the val for ti computed when ti is empty?\n\nIn the substitution processing, for ti being empty, the new_val is 0, and new_len is 0. Because:\n\nfor each c in ti (which is none), the loop doesn't run. So new_val remains 0, new_len remains 0.\n\nBut when processing the original string, if a character in s is replaced with an empty string, then during the processing of the original string, that character contributes val[c] which is 0, and len[c] is 0. So, for example, if the original string is '3', and substitution is '3->', then during processing the original string, the code would process '3', which has val=0, len=0. Then, current_value is 0 * pow10[0] + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the pow10[0] is 1. So, the formula is:\n\ncurrent_value = (current_value * pow10[len[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n\nIf len[c] is 0, then pow10[0] is 1. So, for the first character, current_value is 0 * 1 + 0 = 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So, the code handles the empty string correctly.\n\nAnother example: original string is empty. But according to the problem statement, the initial string s has length at least 1. So, the code doesn't need to handle that case.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', ... ]\n\nSample Output: 10031003.\n\nLet's see.\n\nOriginal s is '123123', n=1, query is 2->00.\n\nProcessing substitution:\n\ndigit '2' is replaced with '00'.\n\nSo, during substitution processing:\n\nti is '00'.\n\nFor each character in ti:\n\nfirst '0', val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1.\n\nnew_val starts as 0. Then, new_val = 0 * pow10[1] + 0 = 0. new_len is 1.\n\nNext character is '0', new_val = 0 * pow10[1] + 0 = 0. new_len is 2.\n\nSo, val['2'] is 0, len['2'] is 2.\n\nThen, processing original string '123123':\n\neach character is processed:\n\noriginal string is '1','2','3','1','2','3'.\n\nProcessing each:\n\ncurrent_value starts at 0.\n\nFor '1': val is 1, len is 1.\n\ncurrent_value = 0 * pow10[1] + 1 = 1.\n\nFor",
