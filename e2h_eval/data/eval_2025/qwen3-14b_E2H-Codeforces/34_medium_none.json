And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k days, I have to compute their average and then find the average of all those averages.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Polycarp is considering each week as k consecutive days, and there are n - k + 1 such weeks. Then, the answer is the average of all those weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks. Or wait, the example shows that for the first input, the output is 9.0000... Let me check that example again.\n\nIn the first example, n=3, k=2. The days are [3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. The average of those two is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the output. So the problem requires that we compute the sum of each consecutive k-day window, then take the average of all those sums. But since the average of the sums is the same as the sum of all elements divided by (n - k + 1) multiplied by k? No, wait. Wait, the average of the sums is (sum of all window sums) divided by the number of windows. But each window sum is the sum of k elements. So the total sum of all window sums would be the sum of each element multiplied by the number of windows it appears in. For example, in the first example, the first element (3) appears in one window, the second (4) appears in two windows, and the third (7) appears in one window. So total sum of window sums is 3*1 +4*2 +7*1 = 3 +8 +7 = 18. Divided by 2 windows gives 9, which matches.\n\nBut calculating that directly for each element would be O(n) time, but how?\n\nAlternatively, if I can compute the sum of all window sums efficiently, then divide by the number of windows (which is n -k +1), and then output that as the average.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the sum of all the window sums, then dividing by (n -k +1).\n\nBut how to compute the sum of all window sums efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach would be to compute each window sum, add them up. However, for n up to 2e5, and k up to n, that would be O(nk) time, which is way too slow for n=2e5. So we need a better approach.\n\nLet me think about the sum of all window sums. Each element a_i contributes to exactly (number of windows that include a_i) times a_i. So the total sum is sum_{i=1}^n (a_i * (number of windows that include a_i)).\n\nSo how many windows include a_i?\n\nWell, for a given position i, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions such that the window includes i.\n\nLet me think about the window's starting positions. A window starts at position s (1-based?), and ends at s + k -1. So for a_i, the earliest window that includes it is when the window starts at s = max(1, i - k + 1) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the index.\n\nLet me consider the array indices from 0 to n-1. For a given index i (0-based), the number of windows that include a_i is equal to the number of starting positions s such that s <= i <= s + k -1. Which can be rewritten as s <= i and s >= i - (k-1) + 0? Wait, solving for s:\n\ns ≤ i ≤ s + k -1 → s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k-1) → s ranges from max(0, i -k +1) to min(i, n -k). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe window starts at position s (0-based), and spans s to s + k -1. So for a_i to be in the window, we need s ≤ i ≤ s + k -1 → s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k-1). Also, s must be ≥ 0 and s +k -1 < n → s ≤ n -k.\n\nSo the valid range of s is from max(0, i - (k-1)) to min(n -k, i). Wait, but for s to be a valid start, it has to be between 0 and n -k.\n\nSo the number of windows that include a_i is the number of valid s values in that range. Let's compute that.\n\nThe lower bound for s is s_low = max(0, i - (k-1)).\n\nThe upper bound for s is s_high = min(n -k, i).\n\nBut wait, for example, if i is in the first k-1 positions, then s can be 0 up to i. Because for example, if i is 0, then s can only be 0. If i is 1, then s can be 0 or 1 (assuming k is 2). So the number of windows that include a_i is (i - s_low + 1) ?\n\nWait, the number of integers between s_low and s_high inclusive is s_high - s_low + 1. So for each a_i, the number of windows that include it is (s_high - s_low + 1).\n\nBut how to compute s_low and s_high?\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the number of windows that include a_i. Let me think.\n\nThe first window that includes a_i is the one that starts at s = max(0, i -k +1) ? Or wait, the earliest window that includes a_i is the one that starts at s = max(0, i -k +1) ?\n\nWait, suppose the window starts at s. The window includes a_i if s ≤ i ≤ s +k-1. Rearranged, s can be as low as i - (k-1) (but not less than 0), and as high as i (but not more than n -k). So the number of possible s is min(i, n -k) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a simpler way. For each element a_i, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of positions where the window starts at s such that s ≤ i and s +k -1 ≥ i. Which simplifies to s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. But also, s must be ≥0 and ≤ n -k.\n\nSo the number of valid s is the number of integers between s_start and s_end, where s_start = max(0, i -k +1), and s_end = min(n -k, i). And the count is s_end - s_start + 1, provided s_end >= s_start. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how to compute this for each i?\n\nAlternatively, for a_i, the number of windows that include it is:\n\nif i is in the first (k-1) positions, then the number of windows is i + 1. Wait, no. Let me take an example.\n\nTake n=3, k=2. For i=0 (the first element), the windows that include it are the window starting at 0. So count is 1. For i=1, the windows that include it are starting at 0 and 1. So count is 2. For i=2, the windows that include it are starting at 1. So count is 1.\n\nSo for i-th element (0-based), the number of windows that include it is min(i +1, n -k +1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of another example. Suppose n=5, k=2. Then the number of windows is 4 (n -k +1 = 4). For i=0, the number of windows including it is 1 (only window starting at 0). For i=1, windows starting at 0 and 1. So 2. For i=2, windows starting at 1, 2. So 2. For i=3, windows starting at 2,3. So 2. For i=4, windows starting at 3. So 1. So the count for each i is min(i +1, n -k +1) ?\n\nWait for i=0, min(0+1, 5-2 +1) = min(1,4) =1. Correct. For i=1: min(2,4) =2. Correct. For i=2: min(3,4)=3? But earlier analysis says 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So that formula is wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct formula? Let me think again.\n\nThe number of windows that include a_i is the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. Also, s must be between 0 and n -k.\n\nSo the number of valid s is the number of s in the interval [max(0, i -k +1), min(n -k, i)].\n\nThe length of that interval is min(n -k, i) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1.\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nLet me think of the general case. For each i, the number of windows that include it is:\n\nif the window starts anywhere from s = max(0, i -k +1) to s = min(n -k, i). So the number is (min(n -k, i) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the number of windows that include it is:\n\nnumber of possible windows that start before or at i, and end after or at i.\n\nAnother approach: the number of windows that include a_i is equal to the number of windows that start at s such that s ≤ i and s + k -1 ≥ i. Which is equivalent to s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k-1). So the number of s is the number of integers between i - (k-1) and i, but adjusted to the valid s range (0 ≤ s ≤ n -k).\n\nSo for each i, the number of windows is:\n\nstart = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\nend = min(n -k, i)\n\ncount = end - start + 1\n\nBut how to compute this for each i?\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), we can compute this for each element in O(1) time, leading to O(n) total time.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the total sum of all window sums as sum_total = sum( a_i * count_i for each i )\n\nWhere count_i is the number of windows that include a_i.\n\nOnce we have sum_total, the average is sum_total / (number_of_weeks), where number_of_weeks is (n -k +1).\n\nBut how to compute count_i for each i?\n\nLet me code that.\n\nFor each i (0-based?), let's assume the array is 0-based.\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\nstart = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\nend = min(n -k, i)\n\ncount_i = end - start + 1\n\nBut wait, for example, in the first example, n=3, k=2. So n -k =1. So for i=0:\n\nstart = max(0, 0 -2 +1) = max(0, -1) =0\n\nend = min(1, 0) =0\n\ncount_i =0-0+1=1. Correct.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nstart = max(0, 1 -2 +1) = max(0,0) =0\n\nend = min(1,1) =1\n\ncount_i =1-0 +1 =2. Correct.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nstart = max(0, 2-2+1) = max(0,1) =1\n\nend = min(1,2) =1\n\ncount_i =1-1 +1=1. Correct.\n\nYes. So that works.\n\nSo for each element, we can compute count_i as above, multiply by a_i, and sum all of them.\n\nOnce we have sum_total, then the average is sum_total / (n -k +1).\n\nSo this approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute sum_total as sum( a[i] * count_i for each i )\n\nThen divide by (n -k +1) and output with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for very large n (like 2e5), this approach is O(n) and manageable.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\narray [3,4,7]\n\nsum_total:\n\nfor i=0: count_i=1 → 3*1=3\n\ni=1: count_i=2 →4*2=8\n\ni=2: count_i=1 →7*1=7\n\nsum_total =3+8+7=18.\n\nnumber_of_weeks =3-2+1=2 → average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=1, k=1.\n\narray [10].\n\nsum_total is 10 * count_i.\n\ni=0: start = max(0, 0-1+1)=0, end=min(0, 0) →0. count is 1. sum_total is 10*1=10. number_of_weeks is 1. average 10/1=10.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nnumber_of_weeks is 8-2+1=7.\n\nsum_total is sum for each element:\n\nLet's compute for each i from 0 to 7.\n\nk=2, so for each i:\n\nstart = max(0, i -2 +1) = max(0, i-1)\n\nend = min(8-2=6, i) → min(6, i)\n\ncount_i is end - start +1.\n\nLet me compute for each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nstart = max(0, 0-1) →0\n\nend = min(6, 0) →0\n\ncount_i=0-0+1=1 → a[0] *1 =1*1=1\n\ni=1:\n\nstart = max(0, 1-1)=0\n\nend = min(6,1) →1\n\ncount_i=1-0+1=2 → a[1] *2 =2*2=4\n\ni=2:\n\nstart = max(0,2-1)=1\n\nend = min(6,2) →2\n\ncount_i=2-1+1=2 → a[2] *2 →4*2=8\n\ni=3:\n\nstart = max(0,3-1)=2\n\nend = min(6,3) →3\n\ncount_i=3-2+1=2 →a[3]=100000 *2=200000\n\ni=4:\n\nstart = max(0,4-1)=3\n\nend = min(6,4)=4\n\ncount_i=4-3+1=2 →a[4]=123 *2=246\n\ni=5:\n\nstart = max(0,5-1)=4\n\nend = min(6,5)=5\n\ncount_i=5-4+1=2 →a[5]=456 *2=912\n\ni=6:\n\nstart = max(0,6-1)=5\n\nend = min(6,6)=6\n\ncount_i=6-5+1=2 →a[6]=789 *2=1578\n\ni=7:\n\nstart = max(0,7-1)=6\n\nend = min(6,7)=6\n\ncount_i=6-6+1=1 →a[7]=1 *1=1\n\nSo sum_total = 1 +4 +8 +200000 +246 +912 +1578 +1 = let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 1 +4 =5; +8=13; +200000=200013; +246=200259; +912=201171; +1578=202749; +1=202750.\n\nThen average is 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 202750 ÷7.\n\n7 × 28964 = 202748. Then 202750 -202748 = 2 → 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the third sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nNow, note that in Python, the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nBut in the sample input, there are multiple lines. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three separate test cases. So the code needs to read multiple test cases. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input format. Let me check the original problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the sample input seems to be three different test cases. But the original problem probably expects that the code reads one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just a formatting error. Wait, the original problem's sample input and output are:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem description seems to be three different test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. However, the sample input in the problem description is not clear. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k...\n\nSo the code should process one test case. However, in the sample input given here, the user has given three test cases. But that's probably an error in the problem description. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user intended to present multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput:\n\n10.0000000000\n\nThird sample input is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nOutput:\n\n28964.2857142857\n\nSo perhaps the user is providing three test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. Therefore, the code should read one test case. But the sample input given in the problem is written as a list of multiple test cases. However, that's likely a mistake in the problem description, and the actual code should read one test case.\n\nBut the problem's input is as per the first line being n and k, second line being the array.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one test case. However, in the sample input given, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement says nothing about multiple test cases. Therefore, I need to check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\n\nSo it's one test case. Therefore, the sample input in the problem is probably a mistake. However, in the sample input given in the problem, the user shows three separate test cases, and outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, that's not mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user is presenting three examples, each with their own input and output. But the actual code should read one test case. However, the problem's original statement may have multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says nothing about that.\n\nThis is confusing. However, the code that the user wants is supposed to read from stdin and output the correct answer. For example, in the sample input, perhaps the user is showing three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input description, the code should process one test case. Therefore, the sample input given in the problem is perhaps a mistake. However, the user's code should process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the user has provided three test cases, but the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement does not mention that. This is a problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should process one test case. But in the sample input, the user shows three test cases. That's likely a mistake in the problem's formatting. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, but the code should read one test case. However, perhaps the user intended that the code should handle multiple test cases. But the problem statement says nothing about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. But how to know?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich outputs 9.0000000000.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nWhich outputs 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWhich outputs 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line n and k, second line the array.\n\nThus, the code will read one test case. But in the problem's sample input, they have multiple test cases. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and the actual code should read one test case.\n\nSo proceeding under the assumption that the code should process one test case.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_total as sum( a[i] * count_i for each i )\n\nCompute number_of_weeks = n -k +1.\n\nresult = sum_total / number_of_weeks.\n\nPrint result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read input? For example, the input may be read via input().split().\n\nBut for large n, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for code submission, the code can read via input().\n\nBut for handling multiple test cases, but the problem says nothing about that. But the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement's input section, it says that the first line contains n and k, the second line contains the array. So it's one test case.\n\nSo the code should read one test case.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nRead the next line as the array.\n\nCompute the sum_total.\n\nThen compute the average and print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nNow, in Python, for each element in the array, we need to compute count_i.\n\nLet me code this.\n\nFor each i in range(n):\n\nstart = max(0, i -k +1)\n\nend = min(n -k, i)\n\ncount_i = end - start +1\n\nBut wait, n -k is the maximum possible s (since s can be up to n -k, because s +k -1 = n -k +k -1 = n-1, which is the last index).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for i in 0-based index.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_total = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    start = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\n    end = min(n - k, i)\n\n    count = end - start + 1\n\n    sum_total += a[i] * count\n\nnum_weeks = n - k + 1\n\naverage = sum_total / num_weeks\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third example outputs 28964.2857142857. Let's see:\n\nsum_total was 202750, num_weeks=7. 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714...\n\nWhich when printed with 10 decimal digits would be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut when using Python's formatting, how to ensure that it prints enough digits?\n\nThe code uses .10f, which would print 10 digits after the decimal point.\n\nBut in the sample output, the third example is printed with 10 digits. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds the number. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nsum_total = 3*1 +4*2 +7*1 = 3+8+7=18. num_weeks=2. average=9.0. printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=1, k=1. a=[10]. sum_total is 10*1=10. num_weeks=1. average=10.0. printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample: sum_total is 202750, num_weeks=7. 202750/7 = 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimals is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where k =n. Then, there is only one week. The sum_total is sum(a) *1. average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1. Then, each element is counted once. sum_total = a[0] *1 + a[1] *1. num_weeks =2. average is (a[0]+a[1])/2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, k=3. So weeks are [0,1,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,4]. So sum_total for each element:\n\nelement 0: included in 1 window (week 0).\n\nelement 1: included in 2 windows (weeks 0 and 1).\n\nelement 2: included in 3 windows (weeks 0,1,2).\n\nelement 3: included in 2 windows (weeks 1, 2).\n\nelement 4: included in 1 window (week 2).\n\nSo sum_total is a[0]*1 +a[1]*2 +a[2]*3 +a[3]*2 +a[4]*1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, for the code, the variables are:\n\nBut in Python, for large n (2e5), the code will run in O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing for n=2e5, but the code will handle it.\n\nNow, the code uses input().split(), which for very large n may be slow. But in practice, for Python, it's manageable. Alternatively, using sys.stdin.read() and splitting once may be faster, but for the purposes of code submission, the code as written is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the input is read as:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut in some cases, the second line may have more or less than n elements. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nNow, the code is written.\n\nBut what about when k=0? No, the constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days from a given list of n days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of all possible k-day window sums and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to consider each consecutive sequence of k days (a week) from the list of n days and compute the average sleep time for each week. Finally, we find the average of these weekly averages.\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window, we use an optimized approach where each element's contribution to the total sum of all windows is determined based on how many windows include that element.\n3. **Contribution Calculation**: For each element in the list, determine how many windows include it. This count is derived based on the element's position and the window size k.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Multiply each element by the number of windows it contributes to and sum these values to get the total sum of all window sums.\n5. **Final Average**: Divide the total sum by the number of valid windows (n - k + 1) to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    sum_total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        start = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        end = min(n - k, i)\n        count = end - start + 1\n        sum_total += a[i] * count\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    average = sum_total / num_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially with large input sizes.\n- **Window Contribution Calculation**: For each element in the list, we determine the range of starting positions of windows that include the element. This range is calculated using `max` and `min` functions to ensure valid indices.\n- **Summing Contributions**: Each element's contribution to the total sum of all windows is calculated by multiplying the element by the number of windows it appears in.\n- **Final Calculation**: The total sum of all window contributions is divided by the number of valid windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with 10 decimal places to meet the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average in linear time, O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
