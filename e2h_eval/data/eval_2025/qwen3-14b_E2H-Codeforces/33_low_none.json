You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number a with digits from a sequence s to make the maximum possible number. The constraints are that each element in s can be used at most once, and I can choose to use any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number after replacements.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach. The key here is to replace the digits in a with the largest possible digits from s, but in the optimal positions. Since we want the maximum number, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits first with the largest possible digits available.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think. For example, if the original number is 1024 and s is 010. Then the digits in s are ['0','1','0']. So the maximum we can do is replace the first '1' with '1' (but that's same), but maybe replace the second digit (which is 0) with 1? Wait, the example given in the input says for the first case, the output is 1124. Let me check that. Oh right, the input for the first case is a=1024 and s=010. So the digits in s are 0,1,0. So the best way is to replace the second digit (0) with 1. Then the number becomes 1124. That's better than replacing other positions.\n\nSo the strategy is: sort the s digits in descending order. Then, for each position in a from left to right, if the current digit is less than the largest available digit in s, replace it with that digit and remove that digit from s. Otherwise, leave it as is. But wait, we need to process the digits in a from left to right, replacing each with the largest possible available digit. Because changing a left digit has more impact on the overall value than a right digit.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order. So that we can take the largest possible digits first.\n2. Iterate through each digit in a from left to right.\n3. For each digit in a, check if there is a digit in s (starting from the first element of the sorted s) that is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace it with that digit, and remove that digit from s. Then proceed to the next digit in a. If not, leave it as is.\n4. Once we have processed all digits in a, the result is the maximum possible number.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple digits in s that are larger than the current digit? We should pick the largest possible one, which is why sorting s in descending order first makes sense. Because when we process each digit in a, we can check the first available digit in s (which is the largest possible remaining) and if it's bigger than current, replace.\n\nSo for example, let's say a is 1024 and s is [0,1,0]. After sorting s in descending order, it's [1,0,0]. Now, process each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is 1. The first element in s is 1. Since it's equal, we don't replace. Because replacing with 1 would not improve the number. So we leave it. Then move to the next digit in a.\n\nSecond digit is 0. The first element in s is 1. Which is larger. So replace 0 with 1. Remove that 1 from s. Now s is [0,0]. Next digits in a are 2 and 4. For third digit (2), the next available s is 0, which is smaller. So no replacement. Fourth digit is 4, same thing. So the result is 1124.\n\nYes, that matches the example.\n\nAnother example: if a is 987 and s is 1234567. Then sorted s is 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. Now, check each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is 9. The first element in s is 7, which is smaller. So no replacement. Second digit is 8. First element in s is 7, which is smaller. Third digit is 7. First element in s is 7. Equal. So no replacement. So the result is 987. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe steps in code:\n\n- Read a as a string (since it can be up to 1e5 digits, but in Python, handling strings is manageable).\n- Read s as a string, then sort it in descending order. So for example, s = '010' becomes sorted as ['1', '0', '0'].\n- Then, iterate",
