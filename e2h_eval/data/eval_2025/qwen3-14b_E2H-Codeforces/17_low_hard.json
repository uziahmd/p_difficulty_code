He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix. And there might be multiple valid answers, but we just need to output any one that's correct.\n\nHmm. The key here is to find a way to assign each of the given strings as either a prefix or suffix such that there exists a string s that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes. But how do I find that?\n\nFirst, let's think about what the possible candidates for the full string s could be. Since the given strings include all improper prefixes and suffixes, the actual string s must have all of them as prefixes or suffixes. Wait, no. The problem says that Ivan told us all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for the string \"ababa\" (length 5), the prefixes of lengths 1-4 are \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\". But in the input, these are given in some order, and we don't know which is which.\n\nSo our task is to find for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s, and then output the corresponding P/S sequence. However, since multiple possibilities exist, we need to find any valid assignment.\n\nBut how can we determine what s is? Because once we know s, we can check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one possible s. But how to find it?\n\nLet me think: For a string s of length n, the set of its prefixes includes all the strings of lengths 1 to n-1. Similarly for the suffixes. So, the given list of 2n-2 strings must contain exactly all those prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, the full string s must be such that:\n\n- All prefixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) are present in the input.\n- All suffixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) are present in the input.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, perhaps s can be determined by looking for the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the longest prefix is of length n-1. Similarly for the suffix. But since the input contains two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, but for the actual s, there's exactly one prefix and one suffix of each length. So, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings in the input. One of them is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Except for the case when the prefix and suffix of length l are the same string, which would be possible only if the entire string is made of the same character. Like in the second example where the input is for n=3, and the strings are a, aa, aa, a. The correct string is \"aaa\", and for l=2, both the prefix and suffix are \"aa\".\n\nSo, for each possible candidate s, we can check whether all the prefixes and suffixes of s are present in the input. But how to generate possible candidates for s?\n\nAlternatively, since the actual s must have the property that the longest prefix (length n-1) is present in the input, and the longest suffix (length n-1) is also present. So, perhaps the correct s is formed by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. But how?\n\nWait, for example, take the first sample input. The input strings for n=5 are:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nLooking at the longest possible prefixes and suffixes (length 4). The input has two strings of length 4: \"abab\" and \"baba\". Which one is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nIn the sample, the correct s is \"ababa\". Its prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". So in this case, the two length-4 strings are the prefix and suffix. So, combining them, perhaps the full string s is the prefix (length n-1) + last character of the suffix (length n-1) or something like that?\n\nWait, the full string s must have the prefix of length n-1 as its first n-1 characters, and the suffix of length n-1 as its last n-1 characters. So, the full string s",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is arbitrary. Our task is to assign each string as either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The unknown string `s` must be such that its proper prefixes and suffixes match the given input strings. To find possible candidates for `s`, we can consider combining the longest prefix and suffix from the input.\n2. **Generate Possible Candidates**: For each combination of the longest prefix (length `n-1`) and the longest suffix (length `n-1`), we can generate potential candidate strings by ensuring they overlap correctly.\n3. **Validation**: For each candidate string, check if all given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. If valid, use this candidate to determine the correct assignment of 'P' and 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Generate possible candidates for s\n    # We need to find the correct s by combining the longest prefix and suffix\n    # Try all combinations of the longest (n-1) length strings as prefix and suffix\n    candidates = []\n    for prefix_candidate in len_to_strings[n-1]:\n        for suffix_candidate in len_to_strings[n-1]:\n            # The full string s must be such that the prefix_candidate is its first n-1 chars\n            # and the suffix_candidate is its last n-1 chars\n            # So the full string would be prefix_candidate + last_char_of_suffix_candidate\n            # But also, the first n-1 chars of the suffix_candidate must be the same as the first n-2 chars of the prefix_candidate\n            # Wait, let's think: s has length n.

Since the input has 2n-2 strings, and n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, the count will be correct.\n                # So, for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign P, else S.\n                # However, in cases where a string is both, how to decide?
