He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The input gives me 2n-2 strings, which are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s. But I don't know which is which. My job is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there's at least one possible s that fits.\n\nHmm. So the main idea is to find a way to determine which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. But how?\n\nFirst, let's think about the original string s. The proper prefixes of s are all the substrings starting from the first character up to length 1, 2, ..., n-1. Similarly, the proper suffixes are the substrings ending at the last character, with lengths 1 to n-1.\n\nNow, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. These two must be present in the input. Also, the shortest ones (length 1) are the first character (prefix) and the last character (suffix). But since the input has two strings of each length, for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are two strings. One of them is a prefix, the other a suffix. But how to figure out which is which?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So there exists at least one s that matches. But I have to find any valid assignment of P/S.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFind the correct original string s, then check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. However, since there might be multiple possible s, but we just need any valid assignment, perhaps there's a way to reconstruct s.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, the original string s can be determined by considering that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in some way. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then the original string s must be P + last character of S (since the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], so the original string is s = (longest prefix) + (last character of s). But also, the longest suffix is (s[1..n-1]) which is the same as the longest prefix's suffix of length n-2 plus the last character. Hmm, maybe that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the original string s must be such that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. So, for example, the length n-1 strings: one is the prefix of length n-1 (so s[0..n-2]), the other is the suffix of length n-1 (s[1..n-1]). Therefore, combining these two, the original string s must be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But since the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], its last character is s[n-1]. Therefore, the original string is (prefix of length n-1) + (last character of suffix of length n-1). But the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], so adding the last character of the suffix (which is s[n-1]) gives the full s. But how do I know which of the two length n-1 strings is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nSo here's an idea: among the input strings, there are two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Suppose A is the prefix of length n-1, and B is the suffix of length n-1. Then the original string would be A + (last character of B). Alternatively, if B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then the original string would be B + (last character of A). So for each possible pair of the two length n-1 strings, we can generate a candidate s and check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this candidate.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, we can generate all its prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1, and check if they are exactly the input strings. However, since the input may have duplicates, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so for the correct s, the input must contain exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1 in the input. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` in the input are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Generate Candidate Strings**: For each pair of these candidates, generate a possible string `s` by combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate (and vice versa).\n3. **Validate Candidate String**: Check if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the generated candidate string.\n4. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is found, determine the assignments of 'P' and 'S' for each input string based on whether they are prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    \n    # Try each possible combination of the two candidates as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[0] if i == 0 else candidates[1]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1] if i == 0 else candidates[0]\n        \n        # Generate possible s\n        s1 = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        s2 = suffix_candidate + prefix_candidate[-1]\n        \n        # Check if s1 is valid\n        valid_s = None\n        if check_valid(s1, strings):\n            valid_s = s1\n        elif check_valid(s2, strings):\n            valid_s = s2\n        \n        if valid_s is not None:\n            # Now determine P/S for each input string\n            result = []\n            for s in strings:\n                if is_prefix(s, valid_s):\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\ndef check_valid(s, all_strings):\n    prefixes = set()\n    suffixes = set()\n    for l in range(1, len(s)):\n        prefixes.add(s[:l])\n        suffixes.add(s[-l:])\n    given_set = set(all_strings)\n    return prefixes.union(suffixes) == given_set\n\ndef is_prefix(s, target):\n    return s == target[:len(s)]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, and the subsequent lines contain the prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to easily access the candidates of length `n-1`.\n3. **Generating Candidate Strings**: For each combination of the two length `n-1` strings, potential candidate strings `s` are generated by appending the last character of the suffix candidate to the prefix candidate and vice versa.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string is validated by checking if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid candidate string is found, each input string is checked against it to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the result is printed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of 'P' and 'S' for each input string based on the constraints provided.",
