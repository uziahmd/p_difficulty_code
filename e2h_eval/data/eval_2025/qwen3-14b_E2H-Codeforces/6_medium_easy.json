Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Leha wanting to choose two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. And we have to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers. If it's not possible, return -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. The two vouchers must not intersect. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts. So for vouchers i and j, either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nThe key here is to find pairs of vouchers where their durations sum to x, and they are non-overlapping, and find the minimum cost.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. Need an efficient way, probably O(n log n) or O(n) with some preprocessing.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - duration_i) such that they don't overlap. But how to efficiently find those?\n\nBut even that approach might be tricky. For example, for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d) that end before li, or start after ri.\n\nSo perhaps we can pre-process vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), and also maybe some other structures to allow for quick queries.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a voucher i with duration d. Then we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d). Let's call this target duration t = x - d. For each such voucher j with duration t, we need to check if they don't overlap with voucher i.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal cost for such vouchers j?\n\nFor example, for voucher i, we can look for all vouchers j with duration t, and which end before li (so that voucher j ends before voucher i starts), or start after ri (voucher j starts after voucher i ends). For each of these cases, we need to find the minimal cost of such vouchers j.\n\nIf we can pre-process for each duration t, the minimal cost of vouchers that end before a certain day, and the minimal cost of vouchers that start after a certain day, then for each voucher i, we can check these two possibilities.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\n- Preprocess for each possible duration, two structures:\n   - A sorted list of end times, along with the minimal cost up to that end time.\n   - A sorted list of start times, along with the minimal cost from that start time onwards.\n\nWait, but how to do that? Let me think again.\n\nFor each duration t, we can collect all vouchers of that duration. Let's say we have a list of vouchers with duration t. For these vouchers, we can sort them by their end time. Then, for a given li (the start of voucher i), we need to find all vouchers in this list with end time < li. Among those, we want the one with the minimal cost. Similarly, for the other case where the voucher starts after ri, we need vouchers with start time > ri, and again find the minimal cost among those.\n\nSo for each duration t, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time. For each position in this list, we can have a prefix minimum array. So that for any query of \"find the minimal cost among vouchers with end time <= some value\", we can perform a binary search on the end times and get the minimal cost in O(log m) time, where m is the number of vouchers of duration t.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times. For the same duration t, we can sort the vouchers by their start time, and have a suffix minimum array. So for a query of \"find the minimal cost among vouchers with start time >= some value\", we can binary search and find the minimal cost.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each duration d, a list of vouchers with that duration. Then for each such list, sort them by end time and build a prefix min array. Also, sort them by start time and build a suffix min array.\n\nWait, but for the start time part, when looking for vouchers with start time > ri, we need to find the earliest start time that is greater than ri, and then take the minimum cost in all vouchers from that point onward. So for the sorted list of start times, we can binary search for the first start time that's > ri. Then, the suffix min array would give the minimum cost from that index to the end.\n\nSo steps for each voucher i:\n\n- Compute d = duration_i. Then t = x - d. If t is negative, skip. Also, if t is not present in the duration map, skip.\n\n- For each voucher i, check if t is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our preprocessed data).\n\n- For the current voucher i, we need to find vouchers of duration t that end before li (so that they don't overlap), or start after ri (so that they don't overlap).\n\nSo for the first case (vouchers of duration t ending before li):\n\n- Look into the list of vouchers with duration t, sorted by end time. Find the largest end time that is <= li-1 (since ri < lj, so voucher j ends before li). Then, the minimal cost among those vouchers.\n\nFor the second case (vouchers of duration t starting after ri):\n\n- Look into the list of vouchers with duration t, sorted by start time. Find the smallest start time that is >= ri+1. Then, the minimal cost among those vouchers.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can check both possibilities (if any exist) and take the minimal cost found, then add it to the current voucher's cost, and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut how to handle the preprocessing?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code terms.\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For example, using a dictionary, say duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (each voucher is a tuple of (li, ri, cost)).\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, we process two sorted lists:\n\n- sorted_end: list of vouchers sorted by ri (end time), and a prefix_min array where prefix_min[k] is the minimum cost among the first k vouchers in sorted_end.\n\n- sorted_start: list of vouchers sorted by li (start time), and a suffix_min array where suffix_min[k] is the minimum cost among vouchers from index k to end.\n\nWait, but for the sorted_end, when we want to find all vouchers with end time <= some value, we can binary search the sorted_end list for the largest end time <= that value. Then, the prefix_min array up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_start, we can binary search for the first start time >= some value. Then, the suffix_min array from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo how to build these structures?\n\nFor each duration d in duration_dict:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sorted by end time (ri)\nprefix_min = [infinity] * len(sorted_end)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])  # sorted by start time (li)\nsuffix_min = [infinity] * len(sorted_start)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\nfor i from len(sorted_start)-2 downto 0:\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these are built, for each voucher i with duration d, and target t = x - d, we check:\n\nif t is in duration_dict:\n\n   for the first case (vouchers of duration t ending before li):\n\n       in the sorted_end list for duration t, find the largest end time <= li-1. If such exists, get the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n   for the second case (vouchers of duration t starting after ri):\n\n       in the sorted_start list for duration t, find the first start time >= ri + 1. If such exists, get the suffix_min from that index.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we check both possibilities, and take the minimal possible cost.\n\nNow, the problem is how to perform the binary searches.\n\nLet me think about the first case: for a sorted list of end times, find the maximum end time that is <= target (li-1). This can be done with bisect_right.\n\nFor example, sorted_end_ri is a list of the end times of the vouchers for duration t. We can extract that as a separate list. Then, using bisect_right to find the insertion point of target (li-1) in sorted_end_ri. The index would be the number of elements <= target. So if the insertion point is k, then the elements from 0 to k-1 are <= target. So if k>0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[k-1].\n\nSimilarly, for the second case: sorted_start_li is a list of start times for vouchers of duration t. We want to find the first start time >= (ri + 1). Using bisect_left, which gives the insertion point. If the insertion point is k, then all elements from k to end have start time >= target. If k < len(sorted_start_li), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[k].\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can perform these steps.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, pre-process all vouchers into the duration_dict.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, pre-process sorted_end, sorted_start, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list, compute d = ri - li + 1. Check if x - d is a valid duration. If so, proceed.\n\nFor each such voucher, check the two possibilities (before and after) and collect possible candidates.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python:\n\nBut considering that n can be 2e5, and for each voucher, we may have O(1) operations (with binary searches), the total time should be acceptable.\n\nBut what about the preprocessing for the duration_dict?\n\nYes. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, handling the edge cases:\n\nWhat if x is less than 2? Well, since x is given as at least 2? Wait, no. The input says x can be as low as 2. Wait, the problem statement says x is between 2 and 2e5. Because the first line says n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·10^5). So x can be 2. For example, in the second sample input, x is 2. So, for each voucher, the duration is 3, and x is 2. So no possible pairs.\n\nSo during the processing, for each voucher, the target duration t = x - d. So, for example, if d is 3, and x is 2, t is -1, which is invalid. So we skip.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the n vouchers, storing li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute for each voucher, its duration (ri - li + 1).\n\nGroup vouchers into duration_dict. For example, a defaultdict(list), where each key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (each as a tuple (li, ri, cost)).\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, pre-process the sorted_end and sorted_start, and their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut how to store them? For each duration d, we can have:\n\n- sorted_end_list: list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri? Or perhaps the entire voucher info. Wait, for the sorted_end list, we need to sort by ri. So for each voucher in the list, we can sort by ri. Then, the prefix_min array is based on the cost.\n\nSo for each duration d, we can precompute:\n\nsorted_end_vouchers = sorted(duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nsorted_start_vouchers = sorted(duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nThen, for the sorted_end_vouchers, we can create a list of end times (for binary search) and the prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start_vouchers, create a list of start times and the suffix_min array.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\nFor the sorted_end:\n\n- end_times: a list of the ri values of the vouchers, sorted.\n\n- prefix_min: a list where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the sorted_end_vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start:\n\n- start_times: a list of the li values of the vouchers, sorted.\n\n- suffix_min: a list where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the vouchers from i to end in the sorted_start_vouchers.\n\nSo for example, when processing a voucher i with duration d, and target t = x - d:\n\nCheck if t is in duration_dict. If not, continue.\n\nElse:\n\nFor the first case (vouchers of duration t that end before li of voucher i):\n\nWe look into the sorted_end_vouchers for duration t. The end_times list is sorted. We want to find the largest end_time <= li - 1.\n\nIf such exists, then the minimal cost in those vouchers is the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (vouchers of duration t that start after ri of voucher i):\n\nWe look into the sorted_start_vouchers for duration t. The start_times list is sorted. We want to find the first start_time >= ri + 1. If such exists, the minimal cost is the suffix_min from that index.\n\nSo for each voucher, we can check both possibilities and collect the minimal possible cost.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, how to handle the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nFor the sorted_end_vouchers:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nend_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_start_vouchers:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nstart_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for each voucher, we can do the following.\n\nNow, for each voucher i (li, ri, cost_i):\n\nd = ri - li + 1\n\nt = x - d\n\nif t < 0: continue\n\nif t not in duration_dict: continue\n\nthen, for the duration t, we check:\n\nCase 1: find vouchers of duration t that end before li (so that their ri < li). So their end time must be < li. So the target is li - 1.\n\nSo, in the end_times list for duration t, find the largest element <= li - 1. How?\n\nWe can use bisect_right on the end_times list. For example:\n\nimport bisect\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1) - 1\n\nif index >= 0:\n\n    min_cost = prefix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n    no such voucher.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers of duration t that start after ri. So their li must be > ri. So the target is ri + 1.\n\nIn the start_times list for duration t, find the first element >= ri + 1. Using bisect_left:\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1)\n\nif index < len(start_times):\n\n    min_cost = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n    no such voucher.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can check both cases. For each case that has a valid min_cost, add cost_i + min_cost to the possible answer.\n\nWe need to track the minimal such value across all vouchers.\n\nNow, the problem is that for the same duration t, there could be multiple vouchers. However, by precomputing the prefix and suffix min arrays, we can find the minimal possible cost quickly.\n\nBut what about when the voucher i itself is part of the duration t? For example, if voucher i has duration d, and t is x -d. Suppose t is equal to d, and we are looking for another voucher j with duration t. But in this case, the voucher i could be considered as j. But since we need two different vouchers (i != j), we need to ensure that when checking, we are not considering the same voucher.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when we process voucher i, we look for vouchers of duration t. But if t is equal to d, and the voucher i is part of the duration t's list, then when we check for the case where voucher j is in the same duration, we need to make sure that voucher j is not the same as voucher i. But how?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because, suppose voucher i has duration d. Then, t = x -d. Suppose x is 2d, so t =d. So when processing voucher i, we look for vouchers of duration t (which is d) that end before li, etc. However, the voucher i itself could be in that list. So when we find the minimal cost for those vouchers, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nThis is a possible problem. For example, if there's only one voucher with duration t (which is d), and that is voucher i. Then, when we look for vouchers j with duration t that end before li, we would include voucher i. But that would be invalid because j must be different from i.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would consider voucher i paired with itself, which is not allowed.\n\nSo how to avoid this?\n\nHmm. So during the processing of voucher i, when we look for vouchers j with duration t, we need to make sure that j is not i. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because for each voucher i, when we check the vouchers of duration t, we need to exclude voucher i itself.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nOne approach is to, for each voucher i, during the processing, when checking the duration t, we need to check whether the minimal cost found in the duration t's list includes voucher i. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: when building the duration_dict, for each duration, we have all vouchers. But during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers j of duration t, we can check if the voucher j is different from i.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, in the first case (case 1), when we find the minimal cost in vouchers of duration t that end before li, we need to make sure that there is at least one voucher in that subset that is not i.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, the list of vouchers is stored, and when processing voucher i, we can check if the voucher j is the same as i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nBut in the code above, when processing voucher i, we are considering all vouchers j of duration t. So during the check, when we find the minimal cost, we need to ensure that there exists at least one voucher j in the set that is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems tricky. Because the minimal cost may come from voucher i itself, which would be invalid.\n\nSo for example, if there's only one voucher in the duration t, which is voucher i, then during the check, the code would consider pairing i with itself, which is invalid. So we need to avoid that.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nAn alternative approach: when processing voucher i, when looking for vouchers j in duration t, we can check if the voucher j is different from i. However, since the same voucher can appear multiple times in the duration_dict (if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration), we need to ensure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nWell, perhaps during the processing of voucher i, when we find the minimal cost for the case where vouchers j are of duration t, we need to check if the voucher j is different from i. But how can we do that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because for example, in the first case (case 1), the minimal cost may be achieved by voucher i itself. So when we find the minimal cost, we need to check if that voucher is not i.\n\nBut how can we know that?\n\nPerhaps, during the preprocessing, we can't track that. So maybe the solution is to process all vouchers, and for each voucher i, when checking the two cases (case 1 and case 2), we need to check if there are other vouchers in the duration t's list that satisfy the condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: for each voucher i, when checking the two cases (case 1 and case 2), we can check if the voucher j is not i. However, since the code uses the minimal cost from the list, which could include voucher i, we need to make sure that there's at least one other voucher in the list that meets the condition.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe during the processing, for each voucher i, when we look for vouchers of duration t, we can check if the voucher i is in that list. If yes, then when we find the minimal cost, we need to check if there are other vouchers in that list that meet the condition.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAnother approach: during the preprocessing, for each duration t, we can have all vouchers. Then, during the processing of voucher i, when checking for vouchers of duration t, we can check if the voucher i is in that duration. If so, then during the binary search, we need to exclude it.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed as before, but after finding the minimal cost, check if there exists at least one voucher in the duration t that satisfies the condition and is not i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, in case 1, when we find the index in the end_times list, and get the prefix_min, but if the voucher i is in the duration t, and is part of the vouchers that end before li, then we need to check if there is at least one other voucher in that subset.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, but the problem requires exactly two different vouchers. So during the processing of voucher i, we can't pair it with itself. But when looking for vouchers of duration t, which is x -d, and if t is equal to d, then voucher i is part of the duration t's list. However, when processing voucher i, we need to find another voucher j (not i) in that list that meets the conditions.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nPerhaps, during the processing of voucher i, when checking the case where the duration is t, we can check if there are at least two vouchers in that duration. But that's not sufficient, since the other voucher may not meet the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of voucher i, when we find the minimal cost for case 1, we can check if the voucher i is part of the set that contributes to that minimal cost. If so, then we need to check if there is another voucher in the set that can contribute.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems really complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose there is only one voucher in duration t, and that is voucher i. Then, when processing voucher i, the code would find that the minimal cost is the cost of voucher i, but since there is no other voucher, it's invalid. So in this case, we need to ignore this possibility.\n\nBut how to detect that?\n\nIn this case, during the case 1 check, when we find that the index is >=0, but the only voucher in that case is i itself. So how can we know that?\n\nWell, for case 1, the voucher j must end before li. So if voucher i is part of the duration t, then during case 1, the code would check if voucher i's end time is <= li-1. But voucher i's end time is ri. So ri <= li-1? Which would mean that ri < li. But for voucher i, ri is >= li (since li <= ri). So ri < li is only possible if li = ri + 1, which is impossible. Because ri >= li.\n\nWait! Wait, voucher i has li and ri. So for voucher i, ri >= li. So for case 1, the condition is that voucher j ends before li. So voucher j's ri < li. But for voucher i's own ri, which is >= li, this would not be true. So voucher i cannot be part of the case 1 when processing voucher i. Because voucher i's ri >= li. Therefore, when processing voucher i, during case 1, the voucher j cannot be voucher i. Because voucher j's ri must be < li, but voucher i's ri is >= li. Hence, voucher i can't be in the case 1.\n\nWait, this is a key insight! Because when processing voucher i, in case 1, we are looking for vouchers j of duration t whose ri < li. Since voucher i's ri is >= li, it cannot be in this group. Hence, the voucher i is not part of the case 1. So during case 1 processing, the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. Therefore, no need to worry about that.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: looking for vouchers j of duration t with lj > ri. Voucher i's lj is li. So for voucher i, li is <= ri. So voucher i's lj (li) is <= ri. Hence, voucher i cannot be in the group of vouchers j that have lj > ri. Hence, when processing case 2, voucher j cannot be voucher i.\n\nTherefore, during the processing of voucher i, when checking case 1 and case 2, the voucher j is not voucher i. Hence, we don't have to worry about overlapping with the same voucher.\n\nThis is a crucial point. Because voucher i's own ri is >= li, so during case 1, we are looking for vouchers j with ri < li. Which can't include voucher i. Similarly, for case 2, we are looking for vouchers j with lj > ri. Which can't include voucher i, since voucher i's lj is li <= ri.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without worrying about the same voucher being considered.\n\nThat's great! So this eliminates the problem of selecting the same voucher twice.\n\nSo, now, the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines of li, ri, cost.\n\nFor each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup all vouchers into a dictionary, duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, pre-process the sorted_end and sorted_start lists, along with their prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nFor each voucher in the original list:\n\n   li, ri, cost_i = voucher's data.\n\n   d = ri - li + 1\n\n   t = x - d\n\n   if t < 0: continue\n\n   if t not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   # Now, check for case 1: vouchers of duration t with end time < li\n\n   # get the sorted_end data for duration t\n\n   sorted_end = duration_dict[t]'s sorted_end_vouchers?\n\n   Wait, during preprocessing, for each duration, we need to store the sorted_end list, end_times, prefix_min.\n\n   So perhaps during preprocessing, for each duration, we have a structure like:\n\n   For each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n       sorted_end_vouchers = sorted by end time (ri)\n\n       end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end_vouchers]\n\n       prefix_min = ... \n\n       sorted_start_vouchers = sorted by start time (li)\n\n       start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start_vouchers]\n\n       suffix_min = ...\n\n   So during preprocessing, we can create for each duration d, a data structure that contains these four elements.\n\n   So perhaps, during preprocessing, for each duration d, we create a tuple (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to store this? Let's think.\n\nWe can have a dictionary, say, preprocessed = {}.\n\npreprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process sorted_end_vouchers\n\n    sorted_end_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end_vouchers]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end_vouchers)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_end_vouchers[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_end_vouchers)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end_vouchers[i][2])\n\n    # process sorted_start_vouchers\n\n    sorted_start_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start_vouchers]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start_vouchers)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start_vouchers[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start_vouchers)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start_vouchers[i][2])\n\n    # store in preprocessed\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher i, when we have t, we can check if t is in preprocessed.\n\nSo, for the current voucher i, with li, ri, cost_i:\n\nt = x - d\n\nif t not in preprocessed: continue\n\nthen:\n\n# case 1: find vouchers j with duration t, end_time < li\n\nend_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = preprocessed[t]\n\n# find the largest end_time <= li -1\n\ntarget = li - 1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target) - 1\n\nif index >= 0:\n\n    min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[index]\n\n    total = cost_i + min_cost_case1\n\n    update the answer if this is smaller.\n\n# case 2: find vouchers j with duration t, start_time > ri\n\ntarget = ri + 1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target)\n\nif index < len(start_times):\n\n    min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\n    total = cost_i + min_cost_case2\n\n    update the answer if this is smaller.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the answer is still infinity, output -1, else output the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple vouchers j with duration t, but none of them satisfy the conditions? Then, the code will not consider them.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nx is 5. So for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration 5 - d.\n\nFor the first voucher (d=3), t=5-3=2. So look for vouchers with duration 2.\n\npreprocessed for duration 2 has three vouchers: (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal vouchers:\n\nvoucher 1: l=1, r=3, cost=4 → duration 3.\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2, cost=5 → duration 2.\n\nvoucher 3: l=5, r=6, cost=1 → duration 2.\n\nvoucher 4: l=1, r=2, cost=4 → duration 2.\n\nSo duration_dict for 2 has vouchers 2, 3, 4.\n\npreprocessed for duration 2:\n\nsorted_end_vouchers would be sorted by ri. The ri for vouchers 2 is 2, voucher 4 is 2, voucher 3 is 6. So sorted by ri: vouchers 2,4,3.\n\nend_times = [2,2,6]\n\nprefix_min is [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4, 1) = 1].\n\nSo prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nsorted_start_vouchers would be sorted by li. All three vouchers have li 1, 1, 5. So sorted by li: vouchers 2,4,3. start_times = [1,1,5].\n\nsuffix_min for this sorted_start_vouchers is:\n\nfor index 2 (voucher 3, cost 1): suffix_min[2] = 1.\n\nindex 1 (voucher 4, cost 4): min(4, 1) → 1.\n\nindex 0 (voucher 2, cost 5): min(5, 1) → 1.\n\nSo suffix_min is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, processing the first voucher (li=1, ri=3, cost=4). d=3. t=5-3=2.\n\ncase 1: find vouchers of duration 2 with end_time < li (1). li is 1. So target is 1-1=0. end_times for duration 2 are [2,2,6]. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. index = 0-1 = -1 → no case1.\n\ncase2: find vouchers of duration 2 with start_time > ri (3). ri is 3. target is 3+1=4. start_times are [1,1,5]. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. index is 2, which is < len(3). suffix_min[2] is 1. So total is 4 + 1 = 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nAnother example: voucher 3 (li=5, ri=6, cost=1). duration is 2. t=5-2=3. Check if duration 3 exists. Yes, voucher 1.\n\npreprocessed for duration 3 has sorted_end_vouchers as [voucher1 (ri=3)].\n\nend_times is [3], prefix_min is [4].\n\ncase 1: for voucher3's li=5. target is 5-1=4. end_times is [3]. bisect_right finds 1 → index=0. prefix_min[0] is 4. So total cost is 1+4=5. Which is the same as before.\n\ncase 2: for voucher3's ri=6. target is 6+1=7. start_times for duration 3 is [1]. bisect_left([1], 7) returns 1, which is >= len (1). So no case2.\n\nSo this case contributes 5 as well.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nThus, the minimal is 5.\n\nSo the code works for this sample.\n\nNow, for the second sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3\n\nx is 2. So for each voucher, d=3. t=2-3=-1 → invalid. So no possible pairs. Output -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for large n (up to 2e5), the code must be efficient. Let's proceed.\n\nBut first, note that for the duration_dict, we can use a defaultdict(list). Then, for each duration, process as described.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nImport necessary modules:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nRead n and x:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read the vouchers:\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, create duration_dict:\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost in vouchers:\n    d = r - l + 1\n    duration_dict[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, preprocessed is a dictionary. For each duration d in duration_dict, process as before.\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n    # process sorted_end\n    sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    if len(sorted_end) == 0:\n        pass  # but vouchers_list is non-empty since d is in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, x, and whose total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that meet the required total duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers to allow efficient querying. We sort vouchers by their end time and start time, and compute prefix minimums for end-sorted lists and suffix minimums for start-sorted lists.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a duration that complements the current voucher's duration to sum up to x. We use binary search to efficiently find valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        r = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = {}\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted_end\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        if len(sorted_end) > 0:\n            prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n            prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n            for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n        # Process sorted_start\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min = []\n        if len(sorted_start) > 0:\n            suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n            suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n        preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t < 0:\n            continue\n        if t not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = preprocessed[t]\n        # Case 1: end before l\n        target_case1 = l - 1\n        # Find the rightmost end_time <= target_case1\n        idx_case1 = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_case1) - 1\n        if idx_case1 >= 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx_case1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + current_min)\n        # Case 2: start after r\n        target_case2 = r + 1\n        idx_case2 = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_case2)\n        if idx_case2 < len(start_times):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx_case2]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + current_min)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by end time and start time.
