Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration is exactly x, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where their durations add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. That means either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts.\n\nThe approach here is to find pairs of vouchers where one has duration d, and the other has duration x - d. Then check if they can be non-overlapping.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find these pairs?\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5. So O(n^2) is impossible. Need something more efficient.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, we can note its duration. Let's pre-process all vouchers by their duration. For example, for each possible duration d, we can keep track of the minimum cost for vouchers of that duration, and also maybe track their start and end dates.\n\nWait, but for each voucher with duration d, we need to find another voucher with duration (x - d), such that they don't overlap. So for each voucher, we can check if there exists a voucher of duration (x - d) that ends before the current voucher starts, or starts after the current voucher ends.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimal cost for such vouchers?\n\nLet me think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher in the list with duration d, we can look into the list of vouchers with duration (x - d) and check for non-overlapping ones.\n\nBut even this approach might be O(n^2) in worst case. For example, if all vouchers have duration d, and x is 2d. Then for each voucher, you have to check all others.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by pre-processing for each duration, the earliest end time and latest start time, or something like that. Wait, but for each voucher of duration (x - d), we need to find if any of them ends before the current voucher's start, or starts after the current voucher's end.\n\nSo for a given voucher A (duration d), we need to find vouchers B (duration x - d) such that B's end < A's start, or B's start > A's end.\n\nTo find the minimal cost for such B's, perhaps for each duration, we can precompute some structures.\n\nFor example, for each duration k, we can have two arrays:\n\n- sorted by end time, and for each position, track the minimum cost up to that point. So when looking for B's that end before a certain time (A's start), we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times and find the minimal cost among those that end before that time.\n\nSimilarly, for B's that start after a certain time (A's end), we can sort the start times and find the minimal cost among those that start after that time.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, group them by their duration. For each duration, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. A list of vouchers sorted by their end time. And for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost up to that position. This allows us to quickly query the minimum cost of vouchers with duration k that end before a certain time.\n\n   b. A list of vouchers sorted by their start time. And for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost from that position onwards. This allows us to quickly query the minimum cost of vouchers with duration k that start after a certain time.\n\nThen, for each voucher A (with duration d), we check if there exists a duration (x - d). If not, skip. Otherwise, for each such voucher A, we look into the vouchers of duration (x - d) and find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before A's start, or start after A's end.\n\nSo for each voucher A with duration d, we compute:\n\n- target duration = x - d. If target is not present in our duration map, skip.\n\nThen, for the target duration, we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers that don't overlap with A.\n\nSo for the target duration, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. So B's end < A's start. So for B's, which are in the target duration, find the minimal cost where B's end < A's li.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. So B's start > A's ri. For B's in target duration, find the minimal cost where B's start > A's ri.\n\nWe can find the minimal cost for both cases and take the minimum between them. Then, combine with the cost of A, and track the overall minimum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers, group by duration. For each duration, have two sorted lists (sorted by end time and start time) and their respective prefix minima and suffix minima.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For each duration k in the duration map, we have:\n\n- list_end: sorted list of vouchers (sorted by end time). For each entry, we have (end_time, cost). Then, we can compute a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost in list_end[0..i].\n\n- list_start: sorted list of vouchers (sorted by start time). For each entry, we have (start_time, cost). Then, compute a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from list_start[i..end].\n\nSo for example, when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that end before a certain time t, we can binary search on list_end for the largest end_time <= t. Then, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers with duration k that start after a certain time t, we can binary search on list_start for the smallest start_time >= t. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nThis way, for each voucher A, we can check both cases and find the minimal possible cost.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, group vouchers by their duration. For each duration, process the vouchers into the sorted lists and compute the prefix/suffix minima.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, check if x - d exists. If yes, then check for both cases (B ends before A starts, and B starts after A ends).\n\nNow, for each voucher A (li, ri, costA), duration d = ri - li + 1. Target duration is x - d. If target is not present, skip. Else:\n\nFor the target duration, check:\n\nCase 1: find the minimal costB where B's end < li. How?\n\nIn the list_end of the target duration, find the largest end <= li - 1. Because B's end must be < li. So the maximum end is li - 1.\n\nIf such entries exist, then the minimal costB is the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nCase 2: find the minimal costB where B's start > ri. How?\n\nIn the list_start of the target duration, find the first start >= ri + 1. All entries from that index onwards have start >= ri + 1. The minimal costB is the suffix_min starting at that index.\n\nIf either case 1 or case 2 has valid entries, then take the minimal costB and add it to costA, and track the overall minimum.\n\nNow, the key is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut what about when the same voucher is considered twice? For example, if voucher A and voucher B are both in the same duration, but when processing A, we look for B in the target duration. But since the problem requires i != j, but since we are considering all pairs, including when the target duration is same as d (if x is even, etc.), but in that case, when we process voucher A, and check for vouchers in the target duration, which may include voucher A itself. However, since the problem requires two different vouchers, we need to make sure that when we check for the target duration, we are not using the same voucher.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause when processing voucher A, we are looking for vouchers in the target duration. Suppose that the target duration is same as d (for example, x is even, and d = x/2). Then, for voucher A, we could have another voucher B in the same duration. However, if the voucher A is part of the list for the target duration, then when we check for case 1 or case 2, we might include voucher A itself. But in that case, the voucher A and B would be same if B is A. Which is invalid.\n\nSo how to avoid that?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we ensure that when we process voucher A, the vouchers considered in the target duration are not the same as voucher A?\n\nOne approach is that for each voucher, when checking the target duration, we need to find the minimal cost in the target duration's vouchers, excluding the current voucher if it is part of that duration. But that complicates things because for each voucher, we would need to check if it's part of the target duration and adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during preprocessing, for each duration, we can have multiple entries. Then, during the checking phase, when we find that the target duration is same as the current voucher's duration, then we need to check whether the minimal cost found includes the current voucher. If so, we need to find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut that seems complicated. However, given that the problem allows for multiple vouchers with same duration and same start/end times, perhaps the minimal cost would not be affected by including or excluding a single voucher. Unless the current voucher is the only one in the target duration.\n\nBut how can we handle this?\n\nAn alternative idea: when we preprocess the data, for each duration, we have all vouchers. When we process a voucher A, and the target duration is same as d, then when looking for B's, we need to make sure that B is not the same voucher as A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nFor example, suppose that for a duration k, we have a list of vouchers. For voucher A, which is part of this list, when we are looking for B's in the same duration, we need to find the minimal cost of B's that don't overlap with A and are not A itself.\n\nBut this seems tricky. However, perhaps during the initial processing, for each duration, we can store all the vouchers, and during the checking phase, when we find that the target duration is same as d, we can check if the minimal cost includes voucher A. If so, we need to check if there's another voucher with the same or lower cost.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. However, given that the problem allows for O(n log n) time, maybe there's a way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chance that the minimal cost is achieved by the same voucher is very low, and perhaps we can proceed and then check if the pair is valid. But that's not feasible.\n\nHmm. Let's think of an example. Suppose x is 4, and there are two vouchers: voucher A (duration 2, cost 1), voucher B (duration 2, cost 1). They are overlapping. So when processing voucher A, looking for vouchers of duration 2 (target duration). The case where B is considered. But if voucher A and B are overlapping, then they can't be chosen. However, if they are non-overlapping, then they can be chosen.\n\nBut in the scenario where the target duration is same as d, and the voucher A is part of that duration, then during the checking phase, when looking for B's, we need to make sure that B is not A, and that B does not overlap with A.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have multiple entries, and during the checking phase, when we find a candidate B (from the target duration), we check if it's not the same voucher as A and that they don't overlap.\n\nBut that would require for each voucher A, to check all possible B's in the target duration, which brings us back to O(n^2) time.\n\nWhich is not acceptable.\n\nAlternative approach: Since we are looking for the minimal cost, perhaps the minimal cost is achieved by some other voucher, not the same as A. So even if the minimal cost includes voucher A, but when we check if B is A, we can ignore that.\n\nWait, but when the target duration is same as d, and the voucher A is part of the target duration, then during the checking phase, when looking for B's in the target duration, the B could be the same voucher. However, in that case, the two vouchers would be the same, which is invalid.\n\nSo, for example, when processing voucher A, and looking for B's in the same duration, the code may find that the minimal cost is voucher A itself. But that's invalid. So we need to avoid that.\n\nSo, how can we ensure that when we process voucher A, the B's considered are not A itself, and also that they don't overlap with A?\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nLet me think of an alternative approach. Instead of processing each voucher and checking for the target duration, perhaps we can precompute for each duration, and for each possible duration, precompute the minimal cost for vouchers that end before a certain time, and start after a certain time, but not including the current voucher.\n\nBut that seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the checking phase, when we find the minimal cost for the target duration, we can check if that minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not overlapping with the current voucher and is not the same voucher.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process all possible pairs of vouchers, but in a way that avoids O(n^2) time. Let me think.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible duration d, we can collect all vouchers of duration d. Then, for each voucher in this group, we can look for vouchers in the group of duration (x -d) that are non-overlapping.\n\nBut again, how to find them efficiently.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that for each voucher, we can find the minimal cost of vouchers in the target duration that are non-overlapping with it. But how to do that without considering the same voucher.\n\nBut maybe the probability that the minimal cost for the target duration includes the same voucher is low. However, for correctness, we need to ensure that it's not considered.\n\nAn alternative approach is to separate the problem into two parts: when the two vouchers are in different durations (so d != x-d), and when they are in same durations (so d = x -d, meaning x is even and d = x/2).\n\nFor the first case, when d != x-d, then when processing voucher A (duration d), the target duration is x-d. So any voucher B in that duration is different from A (since their durations are different), so no need to worry about overlapping with A. But wait, no. Because the voucher B can have same duration as x-d, but different from A's duration. But the problem is that voucher B could be same as A if x-d equals d. But that's handled in the other case.\n\nSo for the case where d != x-d, when we process voucher A (duration d), and check vouchers B in duration (x-d), they are different vouchers. So no problem. So in that case, we can proceed normally.\n\nBut when d = x-d, i.e., x is even and d = x/2, then the target duration is same as d. So when processing voucher A (duration d), the target duration is same as d. So we need to find another voucher B (duration d) that is not A and doesn't overlap with A.\n\nSo in this case, when checking for B, we need to find vouchers in the same duration that are non-overlapping with A and not A itself.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nSo for this case, during the checking phase, when looking for vouchers B in the same duration, we can first find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before A's start, and then subtract the possibility that it's the same voucher. Similarly for the other case.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, during the processing of the vouchers for the same duration, we can check if the minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not overlapping with A.\n\nAlternatively, when we find the minimal cost for the case where B ends before A's start, we can check if that voucher is not A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are two vouchers, A and B, both with duration d. They are non-overlapping. So when processing A, we can find B as a valid voucher. Similarly, when processing B, we can find A as a valid voucher.\n\nBut during the processing of A, the code would find B as a possible candidate.\n\nBut how to ensure that when the minimal cost is found for the same duration, it's not the same voucher.\n\nPerhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can store all the vouchers, and when querying for the minimal cost for vouchers ending before a certain time, we can check if the voucher is the same as A. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process all pairs of vouchers where one is in duration d and the other in duration (x -d), but for the same duration case, we can process all pairs of vouchers in that duration that are non-overlapping.\n\nBut that would be O(n^2) in worst case, which is not acceptable.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is that for the same duration case, the code may include the same voucher, but in practice, the minimal cost would be found with another voucher.\n\nBut how to avoid that?\n\nMaybe during the checking phase, when the target duration is same as d, and we find the minimal cost in the target duration, we can check whether that minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not overlapping with the current voucher. If so, then take it. Else, look for the next minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the list of vouchers sorted by end time, and for each voucher, we can find the minimal cost that is not overlapping with it. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can be taken:\n\nWhen processing voucher A (duration d), and the target duration is same as d (so x is even and d = x/2):\n\n- For case 1 (B ends before A's start), we can find the minimal cost in the target duration's vouchers that end before A's start. Then, if there are any such vouchers, the minimal cost is considered. However, if the minimal cost is achieved by voucher A itself (which is possible if voucher A's end is before its own start, which is impossible), then we need to exclude it. Wait, no. Voucher A's end is ri, which is >= li. So voucher A cannot end before its own start. Therefore, when looking for B's that end before A's start, voucher A cannot be in that set. Because B's end < li, and A's end is ri >= li. So voucher A's end is >= li. Therefore, when we look for B's ending before li, voucher A is not part of that set. Therefore, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: B starts after A's end. So B's start > ri. Voucher A's start is li, end is ri. So voucher A's start is li <= ri. So B's start is > ri. So voucher A's start is li, which is <= ri, so it's not possible for voucher A to have start > ri. So in case 2, voucher A is not part of the set of B's. Therefore, when the target duration is same as d, the code will not consider voucher A as a candidate in case 1 or case 2. Therefore, no need to worry about overlapping with the same voucher.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for case 1, B ends before A's start (li). So B's end < li. But voucher A's end is ri >= li. Therefore, voucher A cannot be in that case. Similarly for case 2, B starts after A's end (ri). Voucher A's start is li <= ri. So voucher A's start is not after ri. So voucher A can't be in that case. Therefore, when processing voucher A, and looking for vouchers in the same duration, the B's that are considered in case 1 and case 2 are different from A. Therefore, even if the target duration is same as d, the code can proceed normally.\n\nTherefore, this problem of same voucher is not an issue. Because when we are looking for B's that end before A's start or start after A's end, the voucher A cannot be part of those sets. Therefore, the code can proceed safely.\n\nThat's a relief! So the earlier problem of same voucher is not an issue. Because when processing voucher A, the B's that are considered in the two cases are different vouchers.\n\nSo now, the approach is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, we need to have two sorted lists:\n\n- list_end: sorted by end time. Each entry is (end_time, cost). Also, for this list, we compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from list_end[0] to list_end[i].\n\n- list_start: sorted by start time. Each entry is (start_time, cost). Also, compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from list_start[i] to list_start[-1].\n\nOnce we have these structures, for each voucher A (li, ri, costA), we calculate d = ri - li + 1. Then, target_duration = x - d. If target_duration is not present in the duration map, skip. Else, proceed.\n\nFor the target_duration, we need to find the minimal costB in two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: B ends before A's start (li). So B's end < li. So in the target_duration's list_end, find the largest end_time <= li - 1. Then, if such an entry exists, get the prefix_min up to that index. The minimal costB is that value.\n\nScenario 2: B starts after A's end (ri). So B's start > ri. In the target_duration's list_start, find the first start_time >= ri + 1. Then, if such an entry exists, get the suffix_min from that index. The minimal costB is that value.\n\nWe take the minimal between scenario 1 and scenario 2, and add it to costA. Keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search for these scenarios.\n\nFor scenario 1, the list_end is sorted by end_time. So for a given li, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end_time <= li - 1. For example, using bisect_right.\n\nSimilarly, for scenario 2, the list_start is sorted by start_time. For a given ri, we can perform a bisect_left to find the first start_time >= ri + 1.\n\nOnce we find the index, if it's valid, we can get the corresponding min cost.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read each voucher's li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute duration for each voucher.\n\nGroup them by duration. For each duration, we need to process the vouchers into list_end and list_start, and compute the prefix and suffix minima.\n\nSo, for example, we can use a dictionary called duration_map, where keys are durations, and values are tuples of (list_end, prefix_min, list_start, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to build these.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize duration_map as a defaultdict.\n\nFor each voucher in the input:\n\n   d = ri - li + 1\n\n   add to duration_map[d] a tuple (li, ri, cost)\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, for each duration in duration_map:\n\n   process the vouchers into list_end and list_start.\n\nFor example, for a given duration d:\n\n   list_end is a list of (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time.\n\n   list_start is a list of (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time.\n\nThen, compute prefix_min for list_end:\n\nprefix_min is an array of same length as list_end. prefix_min[0] = list_end[0][1]. For i>0, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], list_end[i][1]).\n\nSimilarly, for suffix_min of list_start:\n\nsuffix_min is an array of same length as list_start. suffix_min[-1] = list_start[-1][1]. For i in reverse order, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], list_start[i][1]).\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A, we can check for target_duration.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nBut how to handle the list_end and list_start for each duration.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list of all vouchers (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, group by duration:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the list_end and list_start.\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n   list_end = sorted by end time (ri). So for each voucher in duration_dict[d], we take (ri, cost), and sort by ri.\n\n   list_start = sorted by start time (li). So for each voucher in duration_dict[d], take (li, cost), sort by li.\n\n   Then compute prefix_min for list_end:\n\n   prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\n   Similarly compute suffix_min for list_start.\n\nSo, for example, for list_end:\n\nsorted_list_end = sorted( [ (voucher[1], voucher[2]) for voucher in duration_dict[d] ] , key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nWait, voucher is (li, ri, cost). So for each voucher in duration_dict[d], the end time is ri, and cost is voucher[2].\n\nSo sorted_list_end is sorted by end time.\n\nOnce sorted, compute prefix_min.\n\nSimilarly for list_start.\n\nOnce that is done, we can store in the duration_dict for each duration d, the sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nBut perhaps we need to store for each duration d, the sorted list_end and the prefix_min array, and the sorted list_start and the suffix_min array.\n\nSo, perhaps the duration_dict can be a dictionary mapping duration to a tuple (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min).\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, we process it as follows:\n\nfor li, ri, costA in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    target_d = x - d\n\n    if target_d not in duration_dict:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        # process target_d\n\n        # get the sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min for target_d\n\n        sorted_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_start, suffix_min_start = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n        # scenario 1: B ends before li\n\n        # find in sorted_end the largest end_time <= li -1\n\n        # sorted_end is a list of (end_time, cost)\n\n        # extract the end_times as a separate list for binary search\n\n        end_times = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_end]\n\n        # find the rightmost index where end_time <= li -1\n\n        import bisect\n\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li -1) -1\n\n        if idx >=0:\n\n            min_cost1 = prefix_min_end[idx]\n\n        else:\n\n            min_cost1 = infinity\n\n        # scenario 2: B starts after ri\n\n        # find in sorted_start the first start_time >= ri +1\n\n        start_times = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_start]\n\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri +1)\n\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n\n            min_cost2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n\n        else:\n\n            min_cost2 = infinity\n\n        # total_min = min(min_cost1, min_cost2)\n\n        if total_min is not infinity:\n\n            current_total = costA + total_min\n\n            update the global minimum.\n\nSo, the code would proceed like this.\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we need to precompute the sorted_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_start, suffix_min_start.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of code for processing each duration.\n\nFor example, for a given duration d, and vouchers list (each is (li, ri, cost)):\n\nsorted_end = sorted( [(ri, cost) for (li, ri, cost) in vouchers_of_d], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nthen, create prefix_min_end:\n\nprefix_min_end = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n\nprefix_min_end[0] = sorted_end[0][1]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n    prefix_min_end[i] = min(prefix_min_end[i-1], sorted_end[i][1])\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start:\n\nsorted_start = sorted( [(li, cost) for (li, ri, cost) in vouchers_of_d], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nsuffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n\nsuffix_min_start[-1] = sorted_start[-1][1]\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min_start[i] = min( suffix_min_start[i+1], sorted_start[i][1] )\n\nOnce this is done, we can store these in the duration_dict.\n\nBut in Python, the duration_dict would need to store for each duration, the sorted_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_start, suffix_min_start.\n\nNow, for each voucher, we process as above.\n\nNow, the edge cases to consider:\n\n- x is less than 2 (but according to input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. So no, x is at least 2. So each voucher's duration is at least 1. So for two vouchers, their durations sum to x. So for example, if x is 2, each voucher must have duration 1.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case is when there are no vouchers with the target duration.\n\nAnother case is when there are vouchers, but no pairs that are non-overlapping.\n\nNow, the code needs to track the minimal total cost. Initially, set to infinity. After processing all vouchers, if it's still infinity, output -1 else the minimal value.\n\nBut what about when the same pair is considered twice? For example, voucher A and voucher B are processed once when A is considered, and once when B is considered. But since we are tracking the minimal, it's okay. Because the code will find the same pair twice, but the minimal will be updated correctly.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo, x is 5.\n\nSo for each voucher:\n\nvoucher 1: duration 3. target_d = 5 -3 = 2. So check if there are vouchers with duration 2.\n\nYes. For voucher 1, li=1, ri=3.\n\nScenario 1: B ends before 1. So B's end < 1. But vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2 (end 2)\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, ri=6 (end 6)\n\nvoucher 4: li=1, ri=2 (end 2)\n\nSo sorted_end for duration 2 is [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)]? Or wait, the vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (li=1, ri=2, cost5)\n\nvoucher 4: (li=1, ri=2, cost4)\n\nvoucher 3: (li=5, ri=6, cost1)\n\nsorted_end is sorted by end time. So the end times are 2, 2, 6. So sorted_end would be [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)]? Or sorted by end time, and for same end times, perhaps the order doesn't matter. But the prefix_min would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1]. So prefix_min_end is [5,4,1].\n\nSo for scenario 1, voucher A's li is 1. So li -1 is 0. So looking for end_time <= 0. There are none. So min_cost1 is infinity.\n\nScenario 2: B starts after ri=3. So B's start >= 4.\n\nsorted_start for duration 2 is sorted by start time. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: start 1, cost5\n\nvoucher 4: start 1, cost4\n\nvoucher3: start 5, cost1.\n\nsorted_start is [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)].\n\nstart_times is [1,1,5]. Looking for ri +1 = 3 +1 =4. So find first index where start >=4. Using bisect_left on [1,1,5], looking for 4. The bisect_left returns 2 (since 4 is between 1 and 5). So idx is 2. suffix_min_start[2] is 1. So scenario 2 gives cost 1. So total cost is 4 + 1 =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo this pair is considered.\n\nOther vouchers may contribute, but this is the minimal.\n\nAnother example: voucher 3 has duration 2 (ri - li +1 is 6-5+1=2). target_d is 5-2=3. Check if there are vouchers with duration 3. Yes, voucher 1. So for voucher 3, li=5, ri=6. Scenario 1: B ends before 5. So looking for vouchers with duration 3 (voucher1's end is 3). So sorted_end for duration 3 is [(3,4)]. So end_times is [3]. li-1 is 5-1=4. bisect_right([3],4) is 1, minus 1 is 0. So min_cost1 is 4. So total cost is 1 (voucher3's cost) +4 =5. Which is same as before. So this pair is also considered.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nThus, the code would correctly find the minimal.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nBut how to implement the duration_dict.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess each duration in duration_dict\n\nprocessed = dict()\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    # process sorted_end and prefix_min_end\n\n    # for each voucher in duration_dict[d], collect (ri, cost)\n\n    end_list = []\n\n    for li, ri, cost in duration_dict[d]:\n\n        end_list.append( (ri, cost) )\n\n    # sort by end time\n\n    end_list.sort()\n\n    # compute prefix_min_end\n\n    prefix_min_end = []\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for end, cost in end_list:\n\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n\n        prefix_min_end.append( min_so_far )\n\n    # process sorted_start and suffix_min_start\n\n    start_list = []\n\n    for li, ri, cost in duration_dict[d]:\n\n        start_list.append( (li, cost) )\n\n    # sort by start time\n\n    start_list.sort()\n\n    # compute suffix_min_start\n\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(start_list)\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for i in reversed(range(len(start_list))):\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, start_list[i][1] )\n\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n\n    # store in processed\n\n    processed[d] = (end_list, prefix_min_end, start_list, suffix_min_start )\n\n# Now, iterate through each voucher and check\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor li, ri, costA in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    target_d = x - d\n\n    if target_d not in processed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the processed data for target_d\n\n    end_list, prefix_min_end, start_list, suffix_min_start = processed[target_d]\n\n    # scenario 1: B ends before li\n\n    # extract end_times from end_list\n\n    end_times = [entry[0] for entry in end_list]\n\n    # find the rightmost index where end_time <= li -1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li -1) -1\n\n    min_cost1 = float('inf')\n\n    if idx >=0:\n\n        min_cost1 = prefix_min_end[idx]\n\n    # scenario 2: B starts after ri\n\n    start_times = [entry[0] for entry in start_list]\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri +1 )\n\n    min_cost2 = float('inf')\n\n   ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by end time with prefix minimum costs.\n   - Another sorted by start time with suffix minimum costs.\n3. **Check Non-overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (such that their combined duration equals the given value). We use binary search to efficiently find non-overlapping vouchers and compute the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    \n    for d in duration_dict:\n        # Process end_list and prefix_min_end\n        end_list = []\n        for li, ri, cost in duration_dict[d]:\n            end_list.append((ri, cost))\n        end_list.sort()\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for end, cost in end_list:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n            prefix_min_end.append(min_so_far)\n        \n        # Process start_list and suffix_min_start\n        start_list = []\n        for li, ri, cost in duration_dict[d]:\n            start_list.append((li, cost))\n        start_list.sort()\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(start_list)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(start_list))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, start_list[i][1])\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n        \n        processed[d] = (end_list, prefix_min_end, start_list, suffix_min_start)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, costA in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d not in processed:\n            continue\n        \n        end_list, prefix_min_end, start_list, suffix_min_start = processed[target_d]\n        \n        # Scenario 1: B ends before li\n        end_times = [entry[0] for entry in end_list]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1) - 1\n        min_cost1 = float('inf')\n        if idx >= 0:\n            min_cost1 = prefix_min_end[idx]\n        \n        # Scenario 2: B starts after ri\n        start_times = [entry[0] for entry in start_list]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1)\n        min_cost2 = float('inf')\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            min_cost2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n        \n        current_min = min(min_cost1, min_cost2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = costA + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, we sort vouchers by their end times and start times, and compute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays to quickly find the minimum cost for valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n4. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists a complementary duration voucher that does not overlap.
