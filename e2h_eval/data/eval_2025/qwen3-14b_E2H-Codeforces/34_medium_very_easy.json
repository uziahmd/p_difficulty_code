And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums.\n\nSo, the input gives me n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output should be the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods. And the answer needs to be precise with at least 6 decimal digits.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach with O(n*k) time complexity would be too slow. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 2e5, then the number of windows is 1, but for each window, summing takes O(k) time. But in that case, it's O(n), which is acceptable. Wait, but if k is 1e5 and n is 2e5, then the number of windows is 1e5+1, each requiring O(k) time. So total time would be O(n*k) which would be 2e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAh right, the sliding window technique. Let's think about that. The sum for the first window is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then, for each subsequent window, we subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. This way, each step takes O(1) time, leading to O(n) total time.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Then, for each next window, subtract a[i] and add a[i + k], for i from 0 to (n - k - 1).\n3. Keep track of all these sums, then compute their average.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the average is the sum of all the window sums divided by the number of windows. So, the total number of windows is (n - k + 1).\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCalculate the total sum of all window sums, then divide by (n - k + 1).\n\nSo, how to compute the total sum of all window sums?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first example:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nThe windows are [3,4] (sum 7) and [4,7] (sum 11). The average is (7+11)/2 = 9, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the total sum of all windows is 7 + 11 = 18, divided by 2 gives 9.\n\nSo, using the sliding window approach, we can compute each window sum and accumulate the total.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_sum as sum of first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to (n - k):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n\nAdd this current_sum to total_sum.\n\nOnce all windows are processed, divide total_sum by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that's the approach.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently in Python.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e5, the code must be efficient. The sum of the first k elements can be computed in O(k) time, which is acceptable. Then, the rest of the steps are O(n - k) time. So overall O(n) time.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the input examples:\n\nThe first sample input is given as:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. But in the sample input, there are three test cases, but maybe that's just the way the user presented the examples. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers. So, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user provided multiple examples. But in the actual programming problem, the input is one test case per run. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input seems to have three separate test cases. But that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. However, the actual problem expects that the program reads one test case. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, the input is one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases in the sample input. For example, in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThen another input is 1 1 and 10, etc. So perhaps the problem expects that the code can handle multiple test cases? But that's not clear from the problem statement. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ... \n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample outputs, the outputs are for each of the inputs given. So perhaps the user is showing that the code should process multiple test cases. But that's conflicting with the problem statement. Wait, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, and the sample input is given as multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k. So, perhaps the original problem has only one test case per input. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So maybe the problem is expecting that the code can read multiple test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich would correspond to the first sample output of 9.0000000000.\n\nThe second input is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nWhich outputs 10.0000000000.\n\nThird input is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWhich outputs 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k. So, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases. But the problem's input description isn't clear on that.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integer numbers.\n\nSo, this suggests that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input, but the actual problem expects only one test case. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the code must read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases, and the output is for each of them.\n\nBut how to determine that? Well, the original problem's sample input shows that there are three test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut the user's sample input shows three test cases, and the output is three lines. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description does not mention that. So perhaps the problem is from a source where multiple test cases are present.\n\nBut since the user provided the sample input as a list of inputs, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description is ambiguous. However, the original problem's note says that in the third example there are 7 weeks. Which implies that the code is to process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given by the user, the first input is a string like '3 2\\n3 4 7' which is one test case. The second is '1 1\\n10' and third is '8 2\\n...'.\n\nSo perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases as input, and the code should process all of them. However, the original problem's input is unclear. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases and the sample output has multiple lines, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the input is given as two lines per test case. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how can we know? Well, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nSecond input:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput: 10.0000000000\n\nThird input:\n\n8 2\n\n...\n\nOutput: 28964.2857142857\n\nSo, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read all test cases from the input. However, the problem statement's input description is ambiguous. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention that. But in this case, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So, perhaps the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, each test case is represented by two lines: the first line is n and k, the second line is the array.\n\nSo, the code must read the input line by line, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), which gives all the lines. Then, process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think about the sample input. The sample input is given as three separate test cases. So, for example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 3 2\n\nLine 2: 3 4 7\n\nSecond test case:\n\nLine 3: 1 1\n\nLine 4: 10\n\nThird test case:\n\nLine 5: 8 2\n\nLine 6: 1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo, the code should process pairs of lines. So, the code can read all lines, then iterate through them two at a time.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, perhaps the code can read all lines into a list, then process them in pairs. For example, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\nBut then, for each test case, the first line is n and k, the second line is the array.\n\nSo, in the code, the steps would be:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nFor each test case, take two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read from standard input, which could be multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So perhaps the original problem is for a single test case, but the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the user's example shows that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the user's sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the sample outputs, they are given as a list of outputs. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, in the code, I need to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So, the code will read all lines from stdin, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly?\n\nIn Python, for example, the code can read all input as a list of lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process and output\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? Well, according to the problem statement, each test case has two lines, so the input will have even number of lines.\n\nSo, that's the approach.\n\nNow, for each test case, compute the average as per the problem.\n\nNow, implementing the sliding window approach.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute the sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, for each next window, subtract the element leaving and add the new element.\n\nAccumulate the total sum of all window sums.\n\nThen, divide by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1).\n\nBut for the case when k = n, then there is only one window, which is the sum of all elements.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum\n\nthen, for each i in 1 to (n - k):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n\nadd to total_sum.\n\nOnce all done, average = total_sum / (number_of_windows)\n\nBut how to compute the initial sum?\n\nIn Python, sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for large k, say 2e5, this is O(k) time. But since the total time is O(n), it's acceptable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is manageable.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nn, k = ... \n\na = list of integers.\n\nif n == 0 or k ==0: but according to constraints, 1 <= k <=n <= 2e5.\n\nso proceed.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nnumber_of_windows = n - k + 1\n\nfor i in range(1, number_of_windows):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / number_of_windows\n\nThen, output the average with enough decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, how to format the output?\n\nThe output needs to have at least 6 decimal digits. So, for example, in the first sample, the output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo, the code can format the output with 10 decimal digits, as in the sample.\n\nSo, print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average)) ?\n\nBut in Python, when you print, you need to ensure that even if the number is an integer, it is printed with decimal digits. For example, 9.0 should be printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSo, formatting with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about floating point precision? For example, when the average is a fraction that cannot be represented exactly as a float, but the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6. So, using floating point division and printing with sufficient digits should be okay.\n\nBut in Python, using floating point division may have precision issues. However, since the sum is an integer (since all a_i are integers), and the average is (sum of all window sums) divided by (number_of_windows), which is an integer divided by an integer.\n\nBut when we compute total_sum, which is the sum of all window sums, each of which is an integer. So total_sum is an integer. Then, average is total_sum / (number_of_windows).\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample, total_sum is 18, divided by 2 gives 9.0.\n\nIn the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 202750 / 7 (since 28964.2857142857 * 7 = 202750?), let me check:\n\nThe third example has n=8, k=2. The array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1].\n\nNumber of windows is 8 - 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nEach window sum:\n\nwindow 1: 1+2=3\n\nwindow 2: 2+4=6\n\nwindow 3: 4+100000=100004\n\nwindow 4: 100000 + 123 = 100123\n\nwindow 5: 123 + 456 = 579\n\nwindow 6: 456 + 789 = 1245\n\nwindow 7: 789 + 1 = 790\n\nTotal sum is 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = let's compute:\n\n3 + 6 = 9; +100004 = 100013; +100123 = 200136; +579 = 200715; +1245 = 201960; +790 = 202750.\n\nSo average is 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714..., which is what the sample shows.\n\nSo, in Python, when we compute this, the division is done as a float, and when printed with 10 decimal digits, it's correct.\n\nBut how to handle the division in Python? Using floating point division.\n\nNow, in code:\n\ntotal_sum is an integer. number_of_windows is an integer. So average = total_sum / number_of_windows.\n\nBut in Python, dividing integers with / gives a float.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing this.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: k = 1. Then each window is a single element. The average is the average of all elements. Because the number of windows is n -1 +1 = n. So sum of all elements divided by n. Which is same as the average of the array.\n\nBut the code would compute sum of each window (each element) and sum them all, then divide by n. Which is same as sum(a) / n.\n\nAnother edge case: k =n. Then there is one window, sum is sum(a), average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, k=1. Output is a[0].\n\nSo, code handles that.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, for the initial sum, for a[:k], but for large k, this is O(k) time. However, given that the constraints are up to 2e5, and the code is O(n) per test case, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead all lines, process in pairs.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple test cases, but the code is written to process them all.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        n_k_line = lines[idx]\n        idx +=1\n        a_line = lines[idx]\n        idx +=1\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        # Compute the sum of all window sums\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        num_windows = n - k + 1\n        for i in range(1, num_windows):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / num_windows\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nBut wait, what if there are not enough lines? For example, if the input ends with an incomplete test case. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the code can assume that the lines are in pairs.\n\nBut in practice, the code may crash if there's an odd number of lines. However, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7.\n\ntotal_sum =7.\n\nnum_windows = 3-2+1=2.\n\nLoop runs for i in 1 to 1 (range(1, 2) is one iteration).\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[1+1] = a[2] =7. So 7-3+7= 11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage is 18 / 2 =9.0.\n\nPrinted as 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Output matches.\n\nSecond test case: 1 1, a = [10]\n\ncurrent_sum = sum([10]) =10.\n\nnum_windows =1. So loop does not run. average is 10/1=10.0. Printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\ncurrent_sum = 1+2=3. total_sum=3.\n\nnum_windows=8-2+1=7. So loop runs from 1 to 6 (i=1 to 6, 6 iterations).\n\nLet's compute:\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 3 - a[0] (1) + a[1+2-1] = a[1+1] = a[2] =4. So 3-1+4=6. total_sum +=6 → 3+6=9.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum is 6 - a[1] (2) + a[2+2-1] = a[3] = 100000. 6-2=4 + 100000 → 100004. total_sum += 100004 → 9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\ni=3:\n\ncurrent_sum = 100004 - a[2] (4) + a[3+2-1] = a[4] = 123. 100004 -4 = 100000 + 123 = 100123. total_sum += 100123 → 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=4:\n\ncurrent_sum = 100123 - a[3] (100000) + a[4+2-1] = a[5] =456. 100123-100000 = 123 +456 = 579. total_sum +=579 → 200136 + 579 = 200715.\n\ni=5:\n\ncurrent_sum =579 - a[4] (123) + a[5+2-1] = a[6] =789. 579-123=456 +789= 1245. total_sum +=1245 → 200715 + 1245 = 201960.\n\ni=6:\n\ncurrent_sum = 1245 -a[5] (456) + a[6+2-1] = a[7] =1. 1245-456 = 789 +1 = 790. total_sum +=790 → 201960 +790 = 202750.\n\nThen, average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is printed as 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where n=2, k=2. Then the sum is sum of the two elements. The average is that sum divided by 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1. Then the number of windows is 2. The sum is a[0] + a[1], average is (a[0]+a[1])/2.\n\nNow, code should handle that.\n\nNow, considering that the code is handling multiple test cases, and the sum is calculated properly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- When k=0? But the constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\n- When the array is empty? No, since n >=1.\n\nNow, the code is written.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n and k, the code may take some time, but it's O(n) per test case.\n\nNow, for the formatting, the code uses the format string with 10 decimal digits. However, in Python, when the number is an integer, like 9.0, the format will show 9.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, the division operator returns a float, and when printed with .10f, it will display 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code processes each pair of lines and outputs the correct results.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) from a given list of daily sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each k-day period using a sliding window technique to ensure optimal performance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to compute the sum of each consecutive k-day period in linear time. By maintaining a running sum and adjusting it as we slide the window across the list, we avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for each window.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, compute the sum of the first k days. Then, iteratively adjust this sum by subtracting the day that exits the window and adding the new day that enters the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: After computing the sum of all valid k-day periods, divide the total sum by the number of such periods to get the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        n_k_line = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        a_line = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        num_windows = n - k + 1\n        for i in range(1, num_windows):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / num_windows\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows to compute the average, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required sums in linear time, making the solution suitable even for large input sizes.",
