They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament proceeds in phases, and each phase's matches are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the matches are decided based on whether s[i-1] is 0 or 1. In each match during phase i, the lower or higher skill team wins, respectively.\n\nOur task is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. So, for each possible x, we need to determine if it's possible to arrange the initial permutation p so that x wins the tournament according to the rules given by s.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think recursively. The tournament structure is a binary tree. Each round halves the number of teams. For example, in the first round, there are 2^n teams, then 2^{n-1}, etc., until one remains.\n\nThe key is to model for each possible x, what conditions must be met for it to be able to reach the final.\n\nLet me think about the process. Let's consider that in each phase, the way the matches are decided depends on the phase's rule. For example, in phase 1 (the first round), the matches are between adjacent pairs, and the winner is determined by the rule (higher or lower skill). Then, in phase 2, the winners of the first phase are grouped again into pairs, and the same applies.\n\nSo, for a team to win the tournament, it must win all the matches in each phase. But the arrangement of the initial bracket determines which teams meet in each round.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily, the challenge is to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the initial positions of the teams such that x can win each round according to the rules of the phases.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the permutation p is given, but we have to choose p such that x is the champion. Wait no: the problem says that x is winning if there exists a permutation p (so, we can arrange the initial positions of the teams) such that when the tournament is played according to the rules of s, x wins.\n\nSo the question is, for each x, can we arrange the initial positions of the teams (i.e., decide which team is in which position in the bracket) such that x makes it through all rounds.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. For each round, the way the matches are decided depends on the phase. Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the teams are paired in a certain way, and the winner proceeds to the next round.\n\nBut the initial arrangement of the teams determines which teams meet in each round. However, since we can arrange the permutation p, we can choose the initial positions of the teams. So the problem becomes determining, for x, whether there's a way to arrange the initial bracket so that x can win each round according to the rules of each phase.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), the teams are split into pairs. The winner of each pair proceeds to the next phase. Then in phase 2, those winners are split into pairs again, etc.\n\nBut the order in which the teams are arranged in the initial bracket affects which teams they face in each subsequent round. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps for x to be the champion, we need to ensure that in each phase, x can beat its opponent, considering the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how do we model the opponents that x would face in each round? Let's think of it as building a path for x to reach the final. For each round, x must be able to win against the opponent in that round, given the rules of that phase.\n\nBut the opponents depend on the structure of the bracket and the other teams. Since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps for each round, we can choose the opponents that x faces in that round, provided that those opponents are weaker or stronger as required by the phase's rule.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. Let's imagine that for a given round, the number of teams is 2^k. For x to reach the final, it needs to win all the matches in each phase. Let's think of the tournament as a series of layers. Each layer corresponds to a phase. For example, for n=3, the tournament has 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1 (round of 8): 4",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure and rules are defined such that in each phase, teams are paired and the winner is determined based on whether the higher or lower skill level wins, as specified by the input string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `2^n` teams and proceeds in `n` phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (0 or 1) indicating whether the lower or higher skill level team wins, respectively.\n3. **Recursive Analysis**: For a team with skill level `x` to be the champion, it must win all matches in each phase. We use a recursive approach to determine the valid range of skill levels that can reach the final in each phase.\n4. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, we calculate the minimum and maximum possible skill levels that can reach the final. This helps us determine if a given skill level `x` can be the champion by checking if it lies within the valid range for each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    def get_winning_range(n, s):\n        # For each round i (starting from 0), we track the min and max possible values that can reach the final\n        # Initially, the entire range [1, 2^n] is possible\n        # We process the rounds from the first (i=0) to the last (i=n-1)\n        # For each round, depending on the rule (s[i]), we update the min and max ranges\n        # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then in this round, the current range must be split into pairs where the higher wins\n        # So, the next range would be the min of the two halves and the max of the two halves, but considering how the winners are chosen\n        \n        # Start with the full range\n        min_val = 1\n        max_val = (1 << n)\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Current phase is i-th (0-based)\n            # The number of teams in this phase is 2^(n - i)\n            # For the current phase, we need to find the possible range after this phase\n            # Depending on the rule (s[i] is '0' or '1')\n            rule = s[i]\n            if rule == '1':\n                # Higher wins. To proceed, the team must be the highest in its bracket.\n                # So, in each step, the range is divided into two parts, and the higher part is kept.\n                # But since we can arrange the initial bracket, the min and max for the next round will be:\n                # The current min and max must be such that the team is the maximum in its group.\n                # So, for the next round, the possible range is [current_min, current_max], but the actual possible values are those that can be the maximum in their group.\n                # However, since we can arrange the bracket, the possible range after this phase is [current_min, current_max], but the next phase's range is determined by the same logic.\n                # Wait, perhaps a better way: for the rule '1', the team must be the maximum in its group. Therefore, for the next round, the range of possible values is [current_min, current_max], but the team must be the maximum in its group. So, the next round's min and max can be adjusted based on how many teams are in the group.\n                # However, since we can arrange the bracket, for the next phase, the possible range is [min_val, max_val], but we have to ensure that there are enough teams with lower values to allow x to be the maximum in each round.\n                # Alternatively, think recursively: for each phase, the number of teams is halved. For the rule '1', the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{k}, so in each step, the possible range of the team is [previous_min, previous_max], but in the next step, the range is [previous_min, previous_max], because you can arrange the bracket so that the team is the maximum in its group.\n                # Wait, this seems not correct. Let me think again.\n                # Suppose in phase i (the i-th phase, 0-based), the number of teams is 2^{n-i}.\n                # For rule '1', in each match, the higher skill team wins. So, in order for a team x to proceed to the next phase, it must be the maximum in its group of 2 teams in the first phase, then in a group of 4 teams in the second phase, etc.\n                # Therefore, in the first phase, x must be the maximum of 2 teams. In the second phase, it must be the maximum of 4 teams. And so on.\n                # Therefore, for each phase, the number of teams that x must be the maximum of is 2^{i+1} (since in phase i, the group size doubles each time).\n                # So, for the team x to survive all phases, it must be the maximum in groups of size 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^n.\n                # Therefore, the minimal value x can be is the minimal value that is larger than (number of teams in the group - 1) teams.\n                # Wait, but since we can arrange the initial bracket, for x to be the maximum in each group, the number of teams with skill less than x must be sufficient.\n                # For example, in the first phase (group size 2), x must be the maximum. So, there must be at least one team with skill less than x.\n                # In the second phase (group size 4), x must be the maximum of 4 teams. So, there must be at least 3 teams with skill less than x.\n                # Similarly, in phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1} (since the first phase is i=0, group size 2^1 = 2, etc.)\n                # So, for x to be the maximum in each group, the number of teams with skill less than x must be >= (2^{i+1} - 1) for each i from 0 to n-1.\n                # Therefore, the total number of teams with skill less than x must be >= sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2^{i+1} - 1) = sum_{i=1}^n (2^i -1) ) = sum_{i=1}^n 2^i - sum_{i=1}^n 1 = (2^{n+1} - 2) - n.\n                # But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n                # Alternatively, for the rule '1', the team must be the maximum in each round. Therefore, the minimal possible value of x is the number of teams that must be smaller than it. For example, in the first round, x needs to be bigger than 1 team. In the second round, bigger than 3 teams. In the third, bigger than 7 teams, etc. So, for the i-th phase (0-based), the number of teams that must be smaller than x is 2^{i+1} - 1.\n                # Thus, for x to be able to win under all '1' rules, x must be >= (sum_{k=1}^n (2^k -1 )) + 1). Wait, no. Because each phase requires that x is the maximum in its group of size 2^{i+1} (for phase i). So, for phase 0, group size is 2, so x must be larger than at least 1 team. For phase 1, group size is 4, so x must be larger than 3 teams. For phase 2, group size is 8, so larger than 7 teams. And so on until phase n-1, which has group size 2^n, so x must be larger than 2^n -1 teams. So, the total number of teams that must be smaller than x is (2^n -1). Which means x must be at least (2^n -1 + 1) = 2^n. But that's impossible, since the maximum x is 2^n. So this suggests that only the team with the maximum skill can win if all phases are '1'. Which makes sense.\n                # Similarly, for the rule '0', the team must be the minimum in each group. So, the number of teams that must be larger than x is (2^{i+1} -1) for each phase i. Thus, the maximum x can be is (2^n - (sum_{i=1}^n (2^i -1 )) ). But again, this depends on the rules of each phase.\n                # Therefore, for each phase, depending on the rule, we need to adjust the possible range of x.\n                # So, here's an idea: for each phase, depending on the rule, we can compute the minimum and maximum possible values that can reach the final. We start with the full range [1, 2^n]. Then, for each phase, we adjust the min and max based on the rule.\n                # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then in this phase, the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{phase+1}. To ensure that, the number of teams with skill less than x must be at least (2^{phase+1} -1). Therefore, x must be at least (2^{phase+1} -1 + 1) = 2^{phase+1}. But this is for a single phase. However, since the rules vary across phases, we need to track the constraints from all phases.\n                # This seems complex, but maybe we can model it as follows:\n                # For each phase i (from 0 to n-1), depending on the rule, we compute the required min and max for x.\n                # For rule '1' (higher wins): in this phase, the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{i+1}. Therefore, the number of teams with skill less than x must be at least (2^{i+1} - 1). Hence, x must be >= (2^{i+1} -1 + 1) = 2^{i+1}.\n                # For rule '0' (lower wins): in this phase, the team must be the minimum in its group of size 2^{i+1}. Therefore, the number of teams with skill greater than x must be at least (2^{i+1} - 1). Hence, x must be <= (2^{i+1} -1) - (2^{i+1} -1) = 1? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, for the team to be the minimum in a group of size 2^{i+1}, there must be at least (2^{i+1} -1) teams with higher skill. Hence, the maximum x can be is (total_teams - (2^{i+1} -1)) = 2^n - (2^{i+1} -1).\n                # But this is for each individual phase. However, the constraints from all phases must be satisfied simultaneously.\n                # So, for example, if the rules are '1' followed by '0', then for the first phase, x must be >= 2^1 = 2, and for the second phase, x must be <= (2^n - (2^2 -1)) = 2^n - 3.\n                # Therefore, the overall valid x must satisfy all these constraints from all phases.\n                # So, the approach is to compute for each phase i, the lower bound (if rule is '1') and upper bound (if rule is '0'), and accumulate the constraints.\n                # Let's formalize this:\n                # Initialize lower = 1, upper = 2^n\n                # For each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n                #   if s[i] == '1':\n                #       required_lower = 2^{i+1}\n                #       lower = max(lower, required_lower)\n                #   else:\n                #       required_upper = 2^n - (2^{i+1} - 1)\n                #       upper = min(upper, required_upper)\n                # After processing all phases, the valid x are those in [lower, upper]\n                # This seems promising. Let's test this with the examples.\n                \n                # Example 1: Input is 3, '101'\n                # n=3, s = '101'\n                # For each phase:\n                # Phase 0: rule '1' (i=0)\n                # required_lower = 2^(0+1) = 2\n                # lower becomes max(1, 2) = 2\n                # Phase 1: rule '0' (i=1)\n                # required_upper = 2^3 - (2^(1+1) -1) = 8 - (4-1) = 8-3=5\n                # upper becomes min(8,5)=5\n                # Phase 2: rule '1' (i=2)\n                # required_lower = 2^(2+1) = 8\n                # lower becomes max(2, 8) =8\n                # Now lower is 8, upper is 5. No solution? But the sample output is 4 5 6 7 for input '3\\n101'.\n                # Wait this contradicts. So this approach must be wrong. What's wrong here?\n                \n                # Let's check the sample input 3\\n101. The output is 4 5 6 7. According to our calculation, lower is 8 and upper is 5, which is invalid. Clearly, the approach is incorrect.\n                # So what's wrong with the reasoning?\n                \n                # The mistake is in assuming that for each phase, the constraint applies to the entire tournament. However, the constraints for each phase are not independent. For example, in the first phase, the group size is 2, and the team must be the maximum in its group. But in the next phase, the group size is 4, and the team must be the maximum in its group of 4, but this group is composed of the winners of the previous phase. So the constraints are not simply additive, but depend on the structure of the tournament.\n                \n                # Therefore, the previous approach is incorrect. Need to think differently.\n                \n                # Alternative approach: simulate the possible ranges for each round.\n                # For each round, the number of teams is halved. For example, in round 1 (phase 1), the number of teams is 2^{n-1}. The key is to determine, for each round, the minimum and maximum possible skill level that can reach that round.\n                \n                # Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a function that returns the possible range of values that can reach the final given the rules up to a certain round.\n                # For the base case, the final round (round n) has 2 teams. The winner is determined by the rule of the nth phase (but wait, the string s has length n, and for n phases, the first phase is phase 1, the second phase is phase 2, etc. So for n=3, there are 3 phases. So for the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0], then phase 2 is s[1], phase 3 is s[2].\n                # Let's think of the process as starting from the leaves (initial teams) and moving up to the root (final match).\n                # For each level of the tournament tree, we can compute the possible range of values that can reach that level.\n                \n                # Let's consider the following approach:\n                # Start with the initial range of all possible values [1, 2^n].\n                # For each phase (from the first to the last), we update the possible range based on the rule of that phase.\n                # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then in this phase, the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{phase+1} (assuming phase starts from 0). However, this is not accurate.\n                \n                # Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. To reach the final, the team must win all matches. For each match, the team's skill must be either higher or lower than its opponent, depending on the phase's rule.\n                \n                # Another idea: For each phase, the number of teams is halved. For a team to reach the next phase, it must win its match in the current phase. The opponents in each phase depend on the bracket arrangement, but since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponents such that the team can win according to the phase's rule.\n                \n                # For example, if the rule in phase i is '1', then the team must be stronger than its opponent in that phase.

To do so, depending on the rule, it needs to have an opponent with lower or higher skill.\n                # However, since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponents for x in each phase. For example, in phase i, x can be paired with the weakest possible team if the rule is '1', ensuring x wins.\n                # Therefore, for x to be able to win the tournament, it's sufficient that there are enough teams with lower or higher skill levels in each phase.\n                \n                # Let's think recursively. For the team x to win the tournament, it must be able to win each phase.

Therefore, for the next round, the range of possible values is [current_min, current_max], but the team must be the maximum in its group. So, the next round's min and max can be adjusted based on how many teams are in the group.\n                # However, since we can arrange the bracket, for the next phase, the possible range is [min_val, max_val], but we have to ensure that there are enough teams with lower values to allow x to be the maximum in each round.\n                # Alternatively, think recursively: for each phase, the number of teams is halved. For the rule '1', the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{k}, so in each step, the possible range of the team is [previous_min, previous_max], but in the next step, the range is [previous_min, previous_max], because you can arrange the bracket so that the team is the maximum in its group.\n                # Wait, this seems not correct. Let me think again.\n                # Suppose in phase i (the i-th phase, 0-based), the number of teams is 2^{n-i}.\n                # For rule '1', in each match, the higher skill team wins. So, in order for a team x to proceed to the next phase, it must be the maximum in its group of 2 teams in the first phase, then in a group of 4 teams in the second phase, etc.\n                # Therefore, in the first phase, x must be the maximum of 2 teams. In the second phase, it must be the maximum of 4 teams. And so on.\n                # Therefore, for each phase, the number of teams that x must be the maximum of is 2^{i+1} (since in phase i, the group size doubles each time).\n                # So, for the team x to survive all phases, it must be the maximum in groups of size 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^n.\n                # Therefore, the minimal value x can be is the minimal value that is larger than (number of teams in the group - 1) teams.\n                # Wait, but since we can arrange the initial bracket, for x to be the maximum in each group, the number of teams with skill less than x must be sufficient.\n                # For example, in the first phase (group size 2), x must be the maximum. So, there must be at least one team with skill less than x.\n                # In the second phase (group size 4), x must be the maximum of 4 teams. So, there must be at least 3 teams with skill less than x.\n                # Similarly, in phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1} (since the first phase is i=0, group size 2^1 = 2, etc.)\n                # So, for x to be the maximum in each group, the number of teams with skill less than x must be >= (2^{i+1} - 1) for each i from 0 to n-1.\n                # Therefore, the total number of teams with skill less than x must be >= sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2^{i+1} - 1) = sum_{i=1}^n (2^i -1) ) = sum_{i=1}^n 2^i - sum_{i=1}^n 1 = (2^{n+1} - 2) - n.\n                # But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n                # Alternatively, for the rule '1', the team must be the maximum in each round. Therefore, the minimal possible value of x is the number of teams that must be smaller than it. For example, in the first round, x needs to be bigger than 1 team. In the second round, bigger than 3 teams. In the third, bigger than 7 teams, etc. So, for the i-th phase (0-based), the number of teams that must be smaller than x is 2^{i+1} - 1.\n                # Thus, for x to be able to win under all '1' rules, x must be >= (sum_{k=1}^n (2^k -1 )) + 1). Wait, no. Because each phase requires that x is the maximum in its group of size 2^{i+1} (for phase i). So, for phase 0, group size is 2, so x must be larger than at least 1 team. For phase 1, group size is 4, so x must be larger than 3 teams. For phase 2, group size is 8, so larger than 7 teams. And so on until phase n-1, which has group size 2^n, so x must be larger than 2^n -1 teams. So, the total number of teams that must be smaller than x is (2^n -1). Which means x must be at least (2^n -1 + 1) = 2^n. But that's impossible, since the maximum x is 2^n. So this suggests that only the team with the maximum skill can win if all phases are '1'. Which makes sense.\n                # Similarly, for the rule '0', the team must be the minimum in each group. So, the number of teams that must be larger than x is (2^{i+1} -1) for each phase i. Thus, the maximum x can be is (2^n - (sum_{i=1}^n (2^i -1 )) ). But again, this depends on the rules of each phase.\n                # Therefore, for each phase, depending on the rule, we need to adjust the possible range of x.\n                # So, here's an idea: for each phase, depending on the rule, we can compute the minimum and maximum possible values that can reach the final. We start with the full range [1, 2^n]. Then, for each phase, we adjust the min and max based on the rule.\n                # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then in this phase, the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{phase+1}. To ensure that, the number of teams with skill less than x must be at least (2^{phase+1} -1). Therefore, x must be at least (2^{phase+1} -1 + 1) = 2^{phase+1}. But this is for a single phase. However, since the rules vary across phases, we need to track the constraints from all phases.\n                # This seems complex, but maybe we can model it as follows:\n                # For each phase i (from 0 to n-1), depending on the rule, we compute the required min and max for x.\n                # For rule '1' (higher wins): in this phase, the team must be the maximum in its group of size 2^{i+1}. Therefore, the number of teams with skill less than x must be at least (2^{i+1} - 1). Hence, x must be >= (2^{i+1} -1 + 1) = 2^{i+1}.\n                # For rule '0' (lower wins): in this phase, the team must be the minimum in its group of size 2^{i+1}. Therefore, the number of teams with skill greater than x must be at least (2^{i+1} - 1). Hence, x must be <= (2^{i+1} -1) - (2^{i+1} -1) = 1? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, for the team to be the minimum in a group of size 2^{i+1}, there must be at least (2^{i+1} -1) teams with higher skill. Hence, the maximum x can be is (total_teams - (2^{i+1} -1)) = 2^n - (2^{i+1} -1).\n                # But this is for each individual phase. However, the constraints from all phases must be satisfied simultaneously.\n                # So, for example, if the rules are '1' followed by '0', then for the first phase, x must be >= 2^1 = 2, and for the second phase, x must be <= (2^n - (2^2 -1)) = 2^n - 3.\n                # Therefore, the overall valid x must satisfy all these constraints from all phases.\n                # So, the approach is to compute for each phase i, the lower bound (if rule is '1') and upper bound (if rule is '0'), and accumulate the constraints.\n                # Let's formalize this:\n                # Initialize lower = 1, upper = 2^n\n                # For each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n                #   if s[i] == '1':\n                #       required_lower = 2^{i+1}\n                #       lower = max(lower, required_lower)\n                #   else:\n                #       required_upper = 2^n - (2^{i+1} - 1)\n                #       upper = min(upper, required_upper)\n                # After processing all phases, the valid x are those in [lower, upper]\n                # This seems promising.
