Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the problem says both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, all cells in both diagonals must be the same as each other. So, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must all have the same character. So, first, I need to collect all the characters on both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nThen, for all other cells not on either diagonal, they must be the same as each other and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all diagonal cells (both diagonals) are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same. Let's call this 'other_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char != other_char.\n\nBut how to collect the cells on the diagonals and the others?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the grid.\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIt's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n\nIt's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for each cell, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, then check if it's equal to d_char. Otherwise, check if it's equal to other_char.\n\nBut how to collect d_char and other_char?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters from the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So total unique diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, that's 5 cells. The total cells are 9, so non-diagonal is 4 cells. So for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nCheck for all cells:\n\nCollect all the diagonal characters. Then check they are all same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and different from the diagonal ones.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nLet me think: For each cell (i, j) in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. For the diagonals, collect their characters. Then, for non-diagonal, collect their characters.\n\nBut for the first part, we can collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then check that all non-diagonal characters are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal characters?\n\nFor example, for the first diagonal (main), it's from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). For the anti-diagonal, (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). However, for the center cell (when n is odd), it's part of both diagonals. So when collecting, we need to make sure that we don't count duplicates. But for checking if all the diagonal cells are same, even if they are counted twice, it's okay. Because if the center cell is same as others, then it's okay.\n\nWait, but for example, in the case where the main diagonal has all 'x's and the anti-diagonal also has all 'x's. Then all the cells on both diagonals are 'x's. So the code can collect all the cells on both diagonals, and check that they are all same. But when collecting, for example, the center cell is included in both diagonals. But that's okay. Because when checking, if all the cells in the diagonals are same, then even if the same cell is checked twice, it's still valid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCollect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that all of them are same. Then collect all",
