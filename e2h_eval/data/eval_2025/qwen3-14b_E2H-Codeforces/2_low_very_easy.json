Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells in the two diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same, and that they are not equal to 'd'.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j), check if it's on either diagonal. For a cell to be on the main diagonal, i == j. For the other diagonal, i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if it's on either of those, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters from the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? Since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. But that's okay, because it's counted once. So for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. But when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking that all are same, it's okay. Because even if we check all cells on the diagonals, including the center once, but the code would check that all are same.\n\nSo, the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal.\n- Collect all diagonal characters into a set. If the size of this set is not 1, then return NO.\n- Then collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size of this set is not 1, return NO.\n- Also, check that the diagonal set and non-diagonal set are different. If they are same, return NO.\n\nBut wait, how to collect the diagonal characters. Let me think:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, for all such cells, collect their characters. Then check that all are same.\n\nThen for all other cells, collect their characters. Check that all are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO\n\nelse if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO\n\nelse if diagonal_chars == non_diagonal_chars → NO\n\nelse → YES\n\nWait, but what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Like when n=1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 (since center is counted twice) = 5 cells. The total cells are 9. So non-diagonal is 4 cells.\n\nSo, the code would work.\n\nBut let's test with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck the diagonals. For each cell (i,j",
