Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card is a single integer.\n\nSo the approach here is to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Then, we need to find how much more we need to add (or subtract) to make the total sum zero. But since we can only use cards with values between -x and x, we need to figure out the minimal number of cards required to reach that target.\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example: input is 3 2 with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So we need to add -2. Since x is 2, we can use one card with -2. Hence the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second example, input is 2 3 with numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. So we need to add +4. Since x is 3, the maximum per card is 3. So how? We can take two cards of 2 each (sum 4). So two cards. Because one card can't be 4 as x is 3. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the total sum of the given cards. Let's call it s. Then, we need to find the minimal number of cards to add such that their sum is -s. But each card can be between -x and x. So what's the minimal number of cards needed to get a sum of -s?\n\nWait, but the sum of the new cards must be equal to -s. Let's call this target T = -s.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the minimal number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to T.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways. Let's consider that each card can contribute at most x, and at least -x. So for the minimal number of cards, we want to maximize the sum per card. So for example, if T is positive, then we can use as many x as possible. Similarly for negative.\n\nBut let's think about the absolute value of T. Let's say |T| is the total amount we need to cover. Each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, maybe not. Because if T is exactly divisible by x, then it's |T|/x. Otherwise, it's (|T|//x) + 1. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nFor example, if T is 4 and x is 3. Then, the maximum per card is 3. So two cards: 3 + 1 = 4. So two cards. Which is ceil(4/3) = 2. Similarly, if T is 5 and x is 3: 3+2=5, so two cards. So yes, the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). Wait, but what if T is 3 and x is 3? Then one card. Which is 3/3=1. So yes.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 0? Then zero cards are needed. But in that case, the original sum is already zero. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nCalculate the sum s of the given cards. Then T = -s. If T is zero, answer is zero. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nBut how to compute that minimal number? Well, the minimal number is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. But wait, because each card can contribute up to x. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 3, then 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceiling is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's check another example. Suppose T is 2 and x is 2. Then 2/2 is 1, which is correct. So the minimal number is 1.\n\nBut what if T is 1 and x is 2? Then you can use one card with 1. So again, 1. So yes, the formula is |T| divided by x, rounded up.\n\nWait, but what if T is negative? For example, T is -5 and x is 3. Then the minimal number is same as 5/3, which is 2. Because you can use two cards of -3 and -2. So sum is -5. So yes",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining how many additional cards are needed to balance this sum to zero, considering the constraints on the maximum absolute value of the numbers on the cards.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the total to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, the minimum number of cards required is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value allowed on a card (x), rounding up to ensure we cover any remainder.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        nums = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        s = sum(nums)\n        target = -s\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Calculate the minimal number of cards\n            abs_target = abs(target)\n            min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n            print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, handling multiple test cases if provided.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, the sum of the given numbers is computed.\n3. **Target Determination**: The target sum required to balance the total to zero is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum allowed absolute value (x) ensures that we account for any remainder, thus providing the minimum number of cards needed to achieve the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using basic arithmetic operations and ensures that the constraints are respected, providing an optimal solution.",
