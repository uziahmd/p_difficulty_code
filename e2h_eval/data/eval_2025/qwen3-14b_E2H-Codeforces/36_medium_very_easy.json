The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the conditions required for such a configuration to exist. \n\nFirst, the towers that are built must be arranged in a way that allows covering all towns 1..n exactly once. Also, the signal ranges can't reach town 0 or n+1. \n\nLet me think about what kind of tower arrangements are valid. For example, if there's a tower in town i, then its signal power p must be such that it doesn't reach town 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 -i). But since the signal needs to cover some towns, but not others. \n\nBut maybe there's a pattern here. Like, the arrangement of towers must be such that each tower covers a certain range, and these ranges don't overlap except on the edges. Wait, but each town must be covered exactly once. So the coverage regions must form a partition of the towns 1..n. \n\nWait, but how can the signal ranges be set? For example, if there's a tower at position i, then setting its power to p would cover towns from i-p+1 to i+p-1, but wait the problem says |c - i| < p. So that's equivalent to c being in (i - p + 1, i + p -1)? Wait, no. Let me rephrase: |c - i| < p implies that c is between i - p + 1 and i + p - 1? No, wait. Let's take p=2. Then |c-i| < 2 means c can be i-1, i, or i+1. Because the distance is less than 2. So the range is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. So the length of coverage is 2p-1. \n\nBut for the problem's constraints, the signal must not reach town 0 or n+1. So for any tower at position i, the maximum possible p is such that i - p + 1 > 0 (so p < i) and i + p -1 < n+1 (so p < n+1 -i). Therefore, the maximum p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 -i). But when choosing p, we need to ensure that the tower's signal doesn't reach 0 or n+1. \n\nBut how do we model the valid configurations of towers? Let's think of the towers as being placed in such a way that they can be assigned ranges that exactly cover each town once. \n\nAn important observation here is that for a valid configuration, the towers must be arranged such that each tower covers a contiguous block of towns, and these blocks are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n. Also, each tower's coverage must not reach 0 or n+1. \n\nWait, but how can that happen? For example, if there's a tower at position i, and it's covering a range that starts at some left point and ends at some right point. The coverage must be such that the leftmost town covered by the tower is i - p + 1, and the rightmost is i + p -1. But for the tower's coverage to not reach town 0, the leftmost town covered must be at least 1. Similarly, the rightmost town covered must be at most n. \n\nSo for a tower at position i, the maximum possible p is such that i - p + 1 >= 1 => p <= i. And i + p -1 <= n => p <= n - i + 1. So the maximum p for tower i is min(i, n - i + 1). \n\nBut how does this relate to the arrangement of towers? Maybe the key is to find a way to partition the towns into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower, and each tower's interval must be centered at its position. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a valid set of towers where each tower is responsible for covering a certain interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns. \n\nAnother thought: For each tower, the coverage must be such that the interval it covers is exactly [a, b], where a and b are such that the tower is located at the midpoint. For example, if a tower is covering [a, b], then the tower must be at position m where m is the middle of a and b. But since the signal power p is such that the coverage is from m - p + 1 to m + p -1, which is length 2p - 1. So the interval [a, b] must have length 2p -1, and m is the center. \n\nBut for the coverage to be exactly [a, b], the tower must be at m, and p = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2. Because the length of the interval is 2p-1. So for example, if the interval is length 3, then p is 2. \n\nBut how can we model this? It seems complex. However, perhaps there's a way to model the valid tower configurations as those that form a certain kind of structure, like a \"domino tiling\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have n towns. Let's think of the possible ways to arrange the towers. For example, the first tower (if present) must cover some range, and then the rest of the problem reduces to smaller subproblems. \n\nWait, let's consider that for the entire interval [1, n], there must be a tower that covers the entire interval. But that's only possible if there's a tower at position m, where m is such that m - p + 1 = 1 and m + p - 1 = n. Solving, we get that p = (n + 1)/2, and m must be (1 + n)/2. So this requires that n is odd, and the tower is at the middle. But this is just one possibility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the valid configurations are those where the towers form a structure where each tower is responsible for covering a segment, and the segments are adjacent. For example, the first segment is covered by a tower at position i, and then the next segment starts at i+1, etc. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. \n\nWait, but the problem isn't about counting the number of valid tower configurations, but rather the probability that after randomly placing towers (each with 50% chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers. \n\nSo, for each possible subset of towers, we need to check if there's a way to assign signal powers. Then, the total probability is the number of valid subsets multiplied by (1/2)^n (since each subset has probability 1/2^n). \n\nThe challenge is to compute the number of valid subsets. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S of {1, 2, ..., n} such that there exists a way to assign signal powers to the towers in S so that:\n\n- All towns 1..n are covered exactly once.\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo, the question is: How can we count the number of subsets S that satisfy this condition?\n\nLet me think about the structure of such subsets S. \n\nEach town in S must be part of a coverage interval. Moreover, the coverage intervals must be non-overlapping and cover exactly the towns 1..n. \n\nAnother way to look at it is that the coverage intervals form a partition of [1..n], and each interval must be covered by exactly one tower. \n\nMoreover, for an interval [a, b] to be covered by a tower at position m, it must be that m is in the middle of [a, b], and the length of the interval is 2p-1, where p is the signal power. \n\nBut for the tower to be able to cover exactly [a, b], the tower must be located at m, and the signal power must be p = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2. Wait, because the length of the interval is 2p-1. So, 2p-1 = b - a + 1 → p = (b - a + 2)/2. \n\nBut this requires that the length of the interval is even or odd? Let's see. For example, if the interval length is 3, then p is (3+1)/2 = 2. Which makes sense. If the interval is length 1, then p is (1+1)/2 = 1. So the tower is at the same position as the interval. \n\nSo, for any interval [a, b], there's exactly one position m that can cover it, which is the midpoint. And that's m = (a + b) / 2. But since a and b are integers, this requires that a + b is even, i.e., the interval length is odd. \n\nWait, the length is b - a + 1. For example, a=1, b=3: length is 3, which is odd. The midpoint is 2. So yes. For a=1, b=2: length is 2, even. Then (a + b) is 3, which is not even. So there's no integer m that is the midpoint. Hence, such an interval cannot be covered by a single tower. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that any valid coverage must consist of intervals of odd lengths, each covered by a tower at their midpoints. Moreover, these intervals must be non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S of {1, ..., n} such that S is exactly the set of midpoints of such intervals. \n\nThis seems similar to tiling the line with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile contributes exactly one tower (its midpoint). \n\nFor example, for n=2, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {1,2}: each tower covers [1,1] and [2,2]. So each has length 1 (odd), and the midpoints are 1 and 2. \n\n- {2}: the tower covers [1,3], but n=2. Wait, no. Because the coverage can't reach town 3 (n+1=3). So the tower at position 2 must have p such that 2 + p -1 <= 2 → p <=1. So p=1. Then the coverage is [2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2, 2]. So the tower at 2 can't cover town 1. So that subset {2} is invalid. \n\nWait, but according to the first example, when n=2, the answer is 1/4. Which corresponds to the subset {1,2}. \n\nSo for n=2, the only valid subset is {1,2}, which gives 1/4 probability. \n\nAnother example: for n=3. The valid subsets could be:\n\n- {1,2,3}: each covers their own town. \n\n- {2}: covers [1,3], which is length 3 (odd). The midpoint is 2. \n\nSo for n=3, the valid subsets are {1,2,3} and {2}. So the count is 2. The probability is 2/(2^3) = 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the second example given in the note. \n\nSo the problem now becomes: find the number of ways to partition the interval [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths, and for each such partition, the set of midpoints is the subset S. \n\nSo the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of such tilings. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to tile the interval [1..n] with tiles of odd lengths. Each tile contributes exactly one tower (its midpoint). \n\nNow, the question is: how to compute this number of tilings. Let's denote this number as f(n). Then, the answer is f(n) * (1/2)^n, since each subset S has probability (1/2)^n. \n\nBut how to compute f(n)?\n\nLet's think recursively. For the first tile, it can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc., up to n (if n is odd). \n\nFor example, if the first tile is of length 1 (covers [1,1]), then the remaining problem is to tile [2..n], which is of length n-1. \n\nIf the first tile is of length 3, then the remaining problem is to tile [4..n], which is length n-3. \n\nIn general, for the first tile of length k (k is odd), the number of ways is f(n - k). \n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5,...} f(n -k), where k is odd and k <=n. \n\nBut what is the base case? \n\nFor n=0, which is the case when the interval is empty. There's exactly one way to tile it (the empty tiling), so f(0) = 1. \n\nFor n=1, the only way is to take a tile of length 1. So f(1) = 1. \n\nFor n=2, the possible k is 1 (then the remaining is n=1, which has f(1)=1). So f(2) = f(1) = 1. \n\nBut wait, earlier for n=2, the valid subsets are {1,2} (which corresponds to two tiles of length 1 each). But according to the recurrence, f(2) would be f(1) + ...? Wait, the recurrence is for the number of tilings. So for n=2, the possible first tile is of length 1 (k=1), leading to f(1) = 1. Then, the remaining is n=1, which can be tiled in 1 way. So total is 1. But for n=2, the tiling is two tiles of length 1. So f(2) = 1. Which matches. \n\nSimilarly, for n=3, the possible first tiles are k=1 (leaves 2, which has f(2)=1) or k=3 (leaves 0, which has f(0)=1). So f(3) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches the earlier example. \n\nSo the recurrence seems correct. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute f(n), then multiply by 1/(2^n) mod 998244353. \n\nBut how to compute f(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nLooking at the recurrence, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + ... ? Wait, no. Because the sum is over all odd k. Let's think about the recurrence again. \n\nFor each n, f(n) = sum_{k=1,3,...} f(n -k), where k is odd and k <=n. \n\nBut for example, for n >=1:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut this seems similar to a Fibonacci-like recurrence, but with steps. \n\nAlternatively, notice that the recurrence can be rewritten as:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nWait, let's think. Let me see for small n:\n\nn=0: 1\n\nn=1: f(1) = f(0) = 1\n\nn=2: f(2) = f(1) = 1\n\nn=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nn=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \n\nn=5: f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \n\nWait, but what's the pattern here? Let's see:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8 ?\n\nLet's compute f(4):\n\nPossible first k is 1 (leaves 3, which is f(3)=2?), or 3 (leaves 1, which is f(1)=1), or 5 (no). So f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 +1 =3. Yes. \n\nThen for n=5: sum over k=1,3,5. \n\nk=1: f(4) =3 \n\nk=3: f(2) =1 \n\nk=5: f(0)=1 \n\nTotal: 3+1+1=5. \n\nn=6: sum for k=1,3,5. \n\nk=1: f(5) =5 \n\nk=3: f(3) =2 \n\nk=5: f(1) =1 \n\nTotal 5+2+1=8. \n\nSo for n=6, f(6) = 8. \n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13?\nLet me compute f(7). For k=1,3,5,7:\n\nk=1: f(6) =8 \n\nk=3: f(4) =3 \n\nk=5: f(2) =1 \n\nk=7: f(0)=1 \n\nTotal 8+3+1+1=13. \n\nYes. So the sequence looks like the Fibonacci numbers, but shifted. \n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nf(0) = 1 \n\nf(1) = 1 \n\nf(2) = 1 \n\nf(3) = 2 \n\nf(4) = 3 \n\nf(5) = 5 \n\nf(6) = 8 \n\nf(7) = 13 \n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence starting from f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, then f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Wait:\n\nCheck for n=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 ✔️ \n\nn=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 +1 =3 ✔️ \n\nn=5: f(5) = f(4) + f(3) =3 +2=5 ✔️ \n\nn=6: 5+3=8 ✔️ \n\nYes! So the recurrence simplifies to f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 2? Wait, but what about for n=2?\n\nWait for n=2, according to the original recurrence, it's f(2) = f(1) =1. But according to the new recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), for n=2, that would be f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1+1=2, which contradicts the earlier value. \n\nWait, something is wrong here. Let me check again. \n\nEarlier calculations showed that for n=2, f(2) =1. But according to the new idea that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), for n≥2, that would give f(2)=f(1)+f(0)=1+1=2. Which is not matching. \n\nSo what's going on here? \n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me re-examine the original recurrence. \n\nThe original recurrence for f(n) is sum over all odd k (k=1,3,...) of f(n-k). \n\nBut when I looked at the numbers, for n=3, it was f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 +1=2. \n\nFor n=4, it's f(3) + f(1) = 2 +1=3. \n\nFor n=5, it's f(4) + f(2) + f(0) =3 +1 +1=5. \n\nFor n=6, it's f(5) + f(3) + f(1) =5+2+1=8. \n\nFor n=7, it's f(6) + f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 8 +3 +1 +1=13. \n\nSo the pattern here is that for even n, the sum includes terms for all odd k up to n. For example, for n=4, which is even, the sum is f(3) + f(1). \n\nBut for n=5, which is odd, the sum is f(4) + f(2) + f(0). \n\nSo for n, the sum is f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut how does that relate to f(n-1) + f(n-2)?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to find a recurrence for f(n) in terms of previous terms. Let's see:\n\nLet me think about f(n) and f(n-1). \n\nFor example, f(n) = sum_{k odd} f(n -k). \n\nSimilarly, f(n-1) = sum_{k odd} f(n-1 -k). \n\nBut how can we relate them? Let's consider that for f(n), the sum is over all odd k. Let's split the sum into k=1 and the rest. \n\nSo f(n) = f(n-1) + sum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k). \n\nNow, for the sum over k odd >=3, let's substitute k' = k-2. Then k' is odd >=1. \n\nSo sum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k) = sum_{k' odd >=1} f(n - (k'+2)) = sum_{k' odd} f( (n-2) -k' ). \n\nWhich is exactly f(n-2). \n\nThus, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nWait! This is a crucial insight. \n\nSo for all n ≥ 2, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nBut then why for n=2, according to this recurrence, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1=2, but earlier calculation said f(2) is 1?\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here. Let me recheck. \n\nOriginal definition for f(n): the number of ways to tile [1..n] with tiles of odd lengths. \n\nFor n=2, the possible tilings are:\n\nOnly possible way is two tiles of length 1. So the number is 1. \n\nBut according to the recurrence f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1 =2. Which contradicts. \n\nSo where is the mistake in the derivation?\n\nLet me rederive the recurrence. \n\nWe said that f(n) = sum_{k odd} f(n -k). \n\nThen, we split the sum into k=1 and the rest. \n\nsum_{k odd} f(n -k) = f(n-1) + sum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k). \n\nThen, substituting k' = k-2 (so k' is odd >=1), the sum becomes sum_{k' odd} f(n - (k' + 2)) = sum_{k' odd} f( (n-2) -k' ) = f(n-2). \n\nSo f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nBut for n=2, according to this, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1 = 2. But actual value is 1. \n\nSo why the discrepancy? \n\nAh! Because when k is 1, the term is f(n-1), but for the other terms, the substitution may not hold. \n\nWait, for n=2, the sum over k odd is k=1 and k=3 (but 3>2). So the sum is f(2-1) = f(1) =1. So f(2) =1. \n\nBut according to the derivation, we said that sum_{k odd >=3} ... equals f(n-2). For n=2, that sum is zero (since k >=3 is larger than n=2). So the derivation would say f(2) = f(1) + 0 =1. Which is correct. \n\nWait, but according to the previous step, the sum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k) = f(n-2). But for n=2, that sum is zero, and f(n-2) = f(0) =1. Which would imply that the derivation is wrong. \n\nSo there's a mistake in the derivation. Let me re-examine. \n\nThe substitution step: \n\nsum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k) \n\nLet me make substitution k = k' + 2, where k' is odd and ≥1. \n\nBut k must be ≥3, so k' ≥1. \n\nThen, for each such k, n -k = n - (k' + 2) = (n-2) -k'. \n\nSo the sum becomes sum_{k' odd ≥1} f( (n-2) -k' ). \n\nBut this is exactly f(n-2), because f(n-2) is the sum over all k'' odd ≥1 of f( (n-2) -k'' ). \n\nYes. So the sum_{k odd ≥3} ... equals f(n-2). \n\nSo for n=2, this sum is f(0) =1. But according to the actual calculation, the sum is zero. \n\nWait, why? Because when n=2, the sum over k odd ≥3 is zero (since k can't be 3). But according to the substitution, it's f(n-2) = f(0) =1. Which is a contradiction. \n\nAh! Because the substitution assumes that (n-2) -k' ≥0. For example, for n=2, (n-2) -k' = 0 -k', which is negative. But f is defined for n ≥0. However, for negative arguments, what is the value?\n\nThe original definition of f(n) is for n ≥0. For n <0, the value is zero. Because there's no way to tile a negative-length interval. \n\nSo for the sum_{k' odd ≥1} f( (n-2) -k' ), when n=2, this is sum_{k' odd ≥1} f( 0 -k' ) = sum_{k' ≥1} 0 = 0. Which contradicts the previous assertion that it equals f(n-2) = f(0) =1. \n\nSo there's a mistake in the substitution. \n\nAh, I see. The substitution is not correct. Because when you make the substitution k = k' +2, then for the sum to be valid, n -k must be ≥0. So for the original sum, k can be up to n. \n\nBut when we do the substitution, for the sum over k odd ≥3, the term f(n -k) is only non-zero when n -k ≥0. So for k ≤n. \n\nThus, the sum_{k odd ≥3} f(n -k) = sum_{k' odd ≥1} f( (n-2) -k' ) if (n-2) -k' ≥0. \n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. So the substitution is only valid when n-2 ≥k' ≥1. \n\nSo the equality sum_{k odd ≥3} f(n -k) = f(n-2) is not correct. \n\nHence, the earlier derivation was incorrect. \n\nThis complicates things. So the initial idea that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) is not valid. \n\nBut then, how to find a recurrence for f(n)?\n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe original recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k odd} f(n -k), where k is odd and 1 ≤k ≤n. \n\nWe can write this as:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut what's the pattern here? For example, for n=2:\n\nf(2) = f(1) \n\nn=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(0) \n\nn=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(1) \n\nn=5: f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) \n\nn=6: f(6) = f(5) + f(3) + f(1) \n\nn=7: f(7) = f(6) + f(4) + f(2) + f(0) \n\nSo for even n, the sum is f(n-1) + f(n-3) + ... + f(1) \n\nFor odd n, it's f(n-1) + f(n-3) + ... + f(0) \n\nBut how to find a recurrence here. Let's look at the values again:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13\n8 | 21 \n\nWait, for n=3: 2 = 1 + 1 (f(2) + f(0) = 1 +1 =2)\n\nn=4: f(3) + f(1) = 2 +1 =3 \n\nn=5: f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3+1+1=5 \n\nn=6: f(5) + f(3) + f(1) =5+2+1=8 \n\nn=7: f(6) + f(4) + f(2) + f(0) =8+3+1+1=13 \n\nn=8: f(7) + f(5) + f(3) + f(1) =13+5+2+1=21 \n\nLooking at the sequence, it seems that for n ≥ 1, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - something? Or maybe it's the same as the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted. \n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nn=0 → 1 \n\nn=1 → 1 \n\nn=2 → 1 \n\nn=3 → 2 \n\nn=4 → 3 \n\nn=5 →5 \n\nn=6 →8 \n\nn=7 →13 \n\nn=8 →21 \n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. But here, for n ≥ 1, f(n) = F(n) ?\n\nWait, for n=1, f(1)=1 = F(2) (assuming F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.)\n\nn=2: f(2)=1=F(3)=2? No. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but with different indexing. \n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nThe sequence for f(n) is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... which is the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(2) = 1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc. But for n=0, it's 1. \n\nBut for n ≥ 1, f(n) = Fib(n). Let's check:\n\nFibonacci numbers (assuming Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) =5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21).\n\nSo for n=1, Fib(2) is 1 → matches f(1)=1. \n\nn=2: Fib(3)=2 → but f(2)=1. No. Doesn't match. \n\nHmm. Not sure. \n\nBut looking at the values, for n ≥ 2, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - f(n-3) ? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the values:\n\nFor n ≥ 2, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - something?\n\nWait for n=2, according to previous values, f(2)=1, and f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1=2. Which is larger than f(2)=1. So no. \n\nBut earlier analysis suggested that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 3? Let's check:\n\nFor n=3, f(3) =2, f(2) +f(1) =1+1=2 → yes. \n\nn=4: f(4)=3, f(3)+f(2) = 2+1=3 → yes. \n\nn=5: f(5)=5, f(4)+f(3)=3+2=5 → yes. \n\nn=6: 8 = 5+3 → yes. \n\nn=7: 13 = 8+5 → yes. \n\nn=8: 21 = 13+8 → yes. \n\nSo for n ≥3, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nBut what about n=2? According to this recurrence, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1 = 2, but actual value is 1. \n\nSo the recurrence holds for n ≥3, but not for n=2. \n\nSo what's the correct way to model this? \n\nIt seems that for n ≥ 3, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nWith base cases f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1. \n\nThis would explain the sequence. \n\nSo for n ≥3, the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nSo how to handle this? \n\nLet me verify for n=3:\n\nUsing the original recurrence, f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches the recurrence f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 +1=2. \n\nYes, because for n=3, the original recurrence gives f(3) = f(2) + f(0) =1 +1=2. But according to the new recurrence for n≥3, it's f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 +1=2. So both agree. \n\nSimilarly, for n=4, original recurrence gives f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2+1=3. The new recurrence says f(4)=f(3)+f(2) =2+1=3. So again agrees. \n\nSo why does the original recurrence for f(n) = sum_{k odd} f(n-k) give the same result as the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n≥3?\n\nBecause for n ≥3, the sum_{k odd} f(n-k) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nLet me see for n=3:\n\nsum_{k odd} f(3-k) = f(2) + f(0) = 1+1=2. \n\nWhich is equal to f(3-1) + f(3-2) = f(2)+f(1) =1+1=2. \n\nYes. \n\nFor n=4:\n\nsum_{k odd} f(4-k) = f(3) + f(1) = 2+1=3. Which is f(3)+f(2)=2+1=3. \n\nYes. \n\nFor n=5: sum is f(4) + f(2) + f(0) =3+1+1=5. Which is f(4)+f(3)=3+2=5. \n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly placing radio towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: The valid configurations of towers must allow for non-overlapping coverage intervals that exactly cover all towns from 1 to n. Each interval must be centered at a tower's position and have an odd length.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The number of valid configurations can be determined using dynamic programming. Let `f(n)` represent the number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] with tiles of odd lengths. This leads to a recurrence relation where `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)` for `n ≥ 3`, with base cases `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, and `f(2) = 1`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute f(n) using dynamic programming\n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if max_n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if max_n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, max_n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute the probability: dp[n] / 2^n mod MOD\n    # Which is dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod MOD\n    power = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_power = pow(power, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    result = (dp[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the number of valid configurations for `i` towns. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` is derived from the observation that each valid configuration can be extended by adding a new tower either as a single unit or extending previous configurations.\n2. **Modular Inverse**: To compute the probability, we need to divide by `2^n`. Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we compute the modular inverse of `2^n` under modulo 998244353.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution runs in O(n) time and space, making it efficient for large values of `n` up to 200,000. This ensures that the solution handles the upper constraint effectively.",
