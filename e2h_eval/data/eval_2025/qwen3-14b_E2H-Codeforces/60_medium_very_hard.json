Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to find, after each modification to the string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. And we have to consider that certain Morse code strings are invalid (the four given ones). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key point is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4, not being one of the four invalid ones) corresponds to a unique English letter. So any substring of S that is a valid Morse code string contributes to the count. However, the count isn't just the number of such substrings. Because the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\", which implies that each sequence is a concatenation of letters. For example, if the substring \"11\" is a valid code (say for 'M'), then the sequence consisting of just 'M' counts as 1. But if there's another substring like \"1\" (say for 'T') and \"1\" again, then the sequence \"TT\" (two Ts) would be another count. So the total number is all possible ways to split the string into valid Morse code letters, considering all possible substrings.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note in the first example. In the sample where S is \"111\", the answer is 7. The explanation lists 7 different sequences. Let me see:\n\nThey list:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (1+1), \"TM\" (1+11), \"MT\" (11+1), \"TTT\" (1+1+1). So each of these sequences is a way to split some substring of S into valid Morse codes. But how do these correspond to substrings?\n\nFor example, the substring \"1\" can be split as T. The substring \"11\" can be split as M or as T+T. Similarly, the substring \"111\" can be split as O, or T+M, or M+T, or T+T+T. \n\nBut the problem says that each sequence is represented by some substring. So the count is the total number of such sequences across all possible substrings. However, each occurrence of a valid split is counted once. For example, the substring \"11\" (which is of length 2) can be split into two different sequences: either as M (one letter) or as T followed by T (two letters). Both of these are considered as separate sequences. So the total count is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each step, compute the total number of such splits across all substrings of the current S.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. For each position in the string, we can track the number of ways to split the substring ending at that position. Then, for each new character added to S, we can update these counts.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's say dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse code letters. Then, for each i, we can look back 1, 2, 3, or 4 steps (since Morse code letters are up to 4 characters long), check if the substring from i - k + 1 to i is a valid code (i.e., not in the forbidden list and has length between 1 and 4), and add dp[i - k] to dp[i]. However, this approach would give us the total number of ways to split the entire string up to position i into valid letters. But the problem requires counting all possible substrings, not just the entire string.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem is not about splitting the entire string into letters, but about all possible substrings of S. Each substring can be split into valid letters in some number of ways, and we need to sum all those possibilities.\n\nFor example, for S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (split as 1 way)\nLength 2: \"11\" (split as 2 ways)\nLength 3: \"111\" (split as 3 ways)\nThen, for each of the three substrings of length 1, each contributes 1. For the two substrings of length 2 (positions 1-2 and 2-3), each contributes 2. For the one substring of length 3, contributes 3. Total is 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*1 = 3 + 4 +3 = 10? But according to the example, the answer is 7. Hmm, that doesn't match. So clearly my understanding is wrong here.\n\nWait, the example says after appending three '1's, the answer is 7. Let me recheck the note. The example lists 7 sequences. So according to that, the total is 7. So my previous approach must be incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct way to model this?\n\nThe problem is that each valid substring (in Morse code) corresponds to a single letter. But sequences of letters are formed by concatenating these letters. So the count is the number of all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing some substring of S into Morse code letters. Each such sequence is counted once, regardless of how many times it appears in different substrings. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, if a certain sequence is formed by two different substrings, does that count as two sequences or one?\n\nLooking at the note in the first sample: the answer is 7. The sequences listed are:\n\nT (from \"1\"), M (\"11\"), O (\"111\"), TT (from \"11\" split as 1+1), TM (from \"111\" split as 1+11?), MT (from \"111\" split as 11+1?), TTT (from \"111\" split as 1+1+1). Wait, but how many sequences are there?\n\nThe note lists 7 sequences. Each of them is a distinct sequence. For example, \"TT\" is a different sequence than \"T\" (a single T). So the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing any substring of S into Morse code letters. But that seems very different from the initial idea. However, in the note, the example shows that the same Morse code (like \"11\") can be parsed in different ways (as M or as T+T), leading to different sequences. So the total number of sequences is the number of all possible distinct sequences that can be formed by any valid parsing of any substring of S.\n\nBut that's impossible, because the same sequence can be formed by multiple substrings. For example, if S is \"11\", then the substring \"11\" can be parsed as M or as T+T. So the sequences are M, T, T, TT. But the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So the question is whether the sequences themselves are counted once, even if they are formed by multiple substrings. For example, the sequence \"TT\" is counted once, even if it can be formed by multiple substrings (like \"11\" in S = \"111\").\n\nBut according to the note, in the first example, the answer is 7. The sequences listed are 7 distinct sequences. So the count is the number of unique sequences that can be formed by any possible parsing of any substring. But that seems very hard to compute, because you have to track all possible sequences generated by all possible substrings and their possible parsings. However, the sample input suggests that the answer is the number of possible ways to parse the entire string, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about unique sequences, but about the number of possible ways to split substrings into valid Morse code letters. For example, in the first sample, the answer is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe total number of ways to split all possible substrings into valid Morse code letters. For example:\n\nEach substring of length 1 contributes 1 way (assuming it's valid). There are 3 substrings of length 1 (each \"1\"). So 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: there are two substrings (\"11\" and \"11\"). Each can be split in 2 ways (as M or as T+T). So 2 * 2 =4.\n\nSubstrings of length 3: one substring \"111\" which can be split in 3 ways (O, T+M, M+T, T+T+T? Wait, how many ways are there to split \"111\"? Let's think. The possible splits:\n\n- Take the first 1 as T, then the remaining \"11\" can be split into M or T+T. So two options here: T followed by M, or T followed by T and T. Then, the entire split would be T-M, T-T-T.\n\nWait, but the split of \"111\" can be:\n\n- Split into O (111) → 1 way.\n\n- Split into T + M (11) → 1 way.\n\n- Split into M + T → 1 way.\n\n- Split into T + T + T → 1 way.\n\nTotal of 4 ways? But the note says that for the first example, the answer is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe total would be 3 (from length 1) + 2*2 (from length 2) + 1*4 (from length 3) = 3 +4 +4= 11. Which is more than 7. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my initial understanding of the problem is incorrect. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note, the answer is 7. The explanation lists 7 sequences. These sequences are:\n\n- T (1)\n\n- M (11)\n\n- O (111)\n\n- TT (1+1)\n\n- TM (1+11)\n\n- MT (11+1)\n\n- TTT (1+1+1)\n\nSo that's 7 sequences. Each of these is a unique sequence. So the count is the number of unique sequences that can be formed by parsing any substring of S into Morse code letters. However, the problem statement says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo, for example, the sequence \"TT\" is counted once, even if it can be formed by multiple substrings. The key is that each unique sequence is counted once, regardless of how many times it appears in different substrings. But that seems difficult to compute, because we need to track all possible sequences generated by any possible parsing of any substring.\n\nBut the sample input contradicts this. For instance, the first sample has S = \"111\". The substring \"11\" can be parsed as M (sequence [M]) or as T and T (sequence [T, T]). So the sequences M, TT are both counted. Similarly, the substring \"111\" can be parsed as O (sequence [O]), TM (T followed by M), MT (M followed by T), TTT (T followed by T followed by T). So these four sequences. Adding up all the unique sequences:\n\nFrom length 1 substrings: T (counted once).\n\nFrom length 2 substrings: M, TT.\n\nFrom length 3 substrings: O, TM, MT, TTT.\n\nTotal sequences: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, which matches the sample. So the answer is indeed the number of unique sequences that can be formed by parsing any substring of S into Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging. Because for each possible substring, we have to generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse code letters, and then collect all unique sequences. But given that m can be up to 3000, and each step appends a character, the string can be up to 3000 characters long. The number of substrings is O(n²), and for each substring, the number of possible splits could be exponential. So for n=3000, this approach is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there must be a smarter way to model this problem. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing any substring of S into valid Morse code letters. Each such sequence is a list of letters (each represented by a valid Morse code string), and the concatenation of their Morse codes forms a substring of S.\n\nBut since the Morse code for each letter is unique (except for the forbidden ones), each sequence of letters corresponds to a unique concatenation of Morse codes. Therefore, each unique sequence corresponds to exactly one unique string (the concatenation of Morse codes). So the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct substrings of S that can be split into valid Morse code letters (i.e., each part is a valid code, and the entire substring is the concatenation of these parts). Each such substring represents exactly one unique sequence of letters.\n\nWait, this is a critical insight. Because the mapping from sequences of letters to their concatenated Morse code is injective (since each letter's Morse code is unique and the concatenation is unique). So, the number of unique sequences is equal to the number of distinct substrings of S that can be split into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut then, the problem becomes: after each step, count the number of distinct substrings of S that can be split into valid Morse code letters. Because each such substring corresponds to exactly one unique sequence of letters.\n\nSo for example, the substring \"11\" can be split into M (so it's counted once) or into T and T (so it's also counted once as a different split? No, because the split into T and T is a different way of splitting the same substring. But the problem is about the sequences, which would be [T, T], which is a different sequence than [M]. However, the substrings that are split into different ways are the same substring. But in this case, the same substring can be split in multiple ways, leading to different sequences. But according to the earlier analysis, each split of a substring into valid codes corresponds to a unique sequence, and the problem counts all such sequences. However, the same sequence can be formed by different substrings. But the problem says \"represented with some substring of S in Morse code\", so if the same sequence is formed by multiple substrings, it's still counted once.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the answer is 7. Which corresponds to 7 unique sequences, each formed by at least one substring. So the problem is to count the number of unique sequences, not the number of splits. So the problem is equivalent to counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing some substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because for each possible substring, we can generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid codes. Then, collect all of these sequences and count the unique ones. But with S up to 3000 characters long, this approach is computationally impossible due to time constraints.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each sequence corresponds to a unique concatenation of valid Morse code strings, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct strings that are formed by concatenating valid Morse code strings and are substrings of S. Because each such string is the concatenation of valid codes (so corresponds to a unique sequence of letters), and the count is the number of such distinct strings.\n\nBut then, the problem becomes: count the number of distinct substrings of S that can be split into valid Morse code strings (i.e., each part is a valid code, and the entire substring is the concatenation of these parts).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nFor example, the sample S is \"111\". The valid substrings are:\n\n- \"1\": valid, so count it once.\n\n- \"11\": valid (as \"11\" is M), and also can be split into \"1\"+\"1\" (but the substring \"11\" itself is a valid code, so the substring \"11\" is counted once. However, when split into \"1\"+\"1\", the concatenation is the same substring \"11\" (the code for \"1\"+\"1\" is \"11\"). But since the code for M is \"11\", then the same substring \"11\" can be interpreted in two different ways. However, the problem says that the sequences are counted as different sequences. But according to the earlier analysis, the sequences are different (M vs TT). However, in this case, the code for the sequence M is the same as the code for the sequence TT (both are \"11\"). So the same substring can be used to represent different sequences, but the problem counts them as separate sequences. But according to the sample, the substring \"11\" is counted as contributing two sequences (M and TT), but the problem counts them as two different sequences. But according to the earlier reasoning, the number of unique sequences is the number of unique concatenations of valid codes. But in this case, the same substring \"11\" can be split into two different sequences, but each of those sequences corresponds to a unique concatenation. However, the concatenation is the same (\"11\") for both. That's a contradiction. So my previous conclusion is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my entire line of thinking is wrong. Let me go back to the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nAh! The key here is that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring of S. The way they are represented is that the sequence's Morse code is a substring of S. For example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\" (since T is \"1\", and TT is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\"). Similarly, the sequence \"M\" is represented by the same substring \"11\". So the same substring can represent multiple sequences. However, the problem is asking for the number of sequences, not the number of substrings. Thus, the answer is the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by any way of parsing any substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do we count that? Because for the same substring, there may be multiple ways to parse it into different sequences. However, each sequence is a different one. For example, \"11\" can be parsed as M (sequence [M]) or as TT (sequence [T, T]). Both are different sequences, and both should be counted once each.\n\nBut how can we track all these possible sequences without generating them explicitly?\n\nThis seems extremely challenging. However, perhaps there's another way. Since each sequence of letters corresponds to a unique string of Morse code (the concatenation of the codes of each letter), but different sequences can have the same Morse code string. However, the problem is to count the number of sequences, not the number of Morse code strings. This makes it even more complicated.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each Morse code string (of length 1-4) corresponds to exactly one letter except the four invalid ones. So, for example, the code \"11\" corresponds to the letter M. However, the code \"11\" can also be split into two letters, each with code \"1\" (T). Thus, the same Morse code string can represent different sequences of letters. However, the problem counts both sequences as separate.\n\nThus, the problem requires us to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by any way of parsing any substring of S into valid Morse code letters. Each such parsing gives rise to a sequence, and we need to count all such sequences (even if they are generated by different substrings or different parses of the same substring).\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming again. Suppose that for each position i in the string S, we track all possible sequences of letters that end at position i. Then, for each new character added, we can look back and see all possible ways to split the current string into valid codes, and accumulate the sequences.\n\nBut storing all possible sequences is not feasible for large S. For example, with S of length 3000, the number of possible sequences could be enormous, leading to memory and time issues.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of tracking sequences, track the set of possible Morse code strings that can be formed by splitting substrings ending at each position. Then, for each such Morse code string, the number of sequences that it represents is the number of ways to parse it into letters. But this seems not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually to count the number of valid ways to split the entire string into letters, but that doesn't align with the sample. For example, in the first sample, the entire string \"111\" can be split in 4 ways (as per the note), but the sample answer is 7. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for every possible substring of S, we need to consider all possible ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters. Each such split corresponds to a sequence of letters, and we need to count all of them, but ensuring that duplicates are not counted multiple times. Wait, no. If two different substrings produce the same sequence, it's still counted once. Or is it counted once per occurrence? No, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So it's the number of unique sequences, not the number of splits.\n\nBut this is very difficult to compute. How can we do this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps the problem is actually not about unique sequences, but about the number of possible splits of all substrings. For example, in the first sample, the answer is 7, which is the sum of the number of ways to split each substring:\n\nFor S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" → 1 way.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" → 2 ways (split as M or as T+T).\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → 4 ways (split as O, T+M, M+T, T+T+T).\n\nTotal is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Which matches the sample. So this must be the correct interpretation.\n\nAh! So the problem is to compute, after each step, the total number of ways to split all possible substrings of S into valid Morse code letters. Each split is counted as one, even if it produces the same sequence as another split. So the answer is the sum over all substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nThat makes sense now. Because in the first sample, the answer is 1 (for length 1) + 2 (for length 2) + 4 (for length 3) = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is not about unique sequences, but about the total number of ways to split all substrings into valid codes. Each such way is counted as a separate entry.\n\nNow the problem becomes manageable. Now, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. For each position i in the string, let's compute the number of ways to split the substring ending at i into valid codes. But since we need to consider all substrings, we can maintain for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Then, the total answer is the sum of all these values for each position.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a string of length n. For each i (1-based), let dp[i] be the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i] into valid codes. Then, the total answer is the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[n].\n\nWait, no. Because dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the entire string up to i into valid codes. But we need to consider all possible substrings. For example, for a string of length 3, the substrings are:\n\nS[1], S[1-2], S[1-3], S[2], S[2-3], S[3].\n\nEach of these substrings can be split into valid codes. So the total is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring.\n\nThus, for each position i, we need to consider all substrings that end at i. For example, for i=3, the substrings ending at i are S[1-3], S[2-3], S[3]. For each of these, we need to calculate the number of ways to split them.\n\nThis suggests that for each i, we can compute the number of ways to split the substrings ending at i. Let's define for each i, a variable that tracks the number of ways to split the substring ending at i, of varying lengths. For example, for each position j ≤ i, we can look back and see if the substring from j to i is a valid code. If it is, then we can add the number of ways to split the substring up to j-1.\n\nWait, this sounds like the standard way to compute the number of ways to split a string into valid codes. So for the entire string, we use dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if S[i-k+1..i] is valid, then dp[i-k] else 0). With dp[0] = 1 (base case).\n\nBut how to extend this to account for all substrings?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that for each position i, we want to calculate the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. For example, for each j from 1 to i, the substring S[j..i] can be split into valid codes. We need to calculate the total number of ways for all these substrings.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can compute the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i] into valid codes (this is the standard dp approach), but then we also need to compute the number of ways for all other substrings that end at i.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps we can find a way to track for each i, the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i. Let's denote this as dp[i], which represents the total number of ways to split all substrings that end at position i. Then, the overall answer after each step is the cumulative sum of dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[n].\n\nWait, no. Because dp[i] would be the sum of the number of ways to split each substring ending at i. For example, if i=3, dp[3] would be the number of ways to split S[1-3], plus the number of ways to split S[2-3], plus the number of ways to split S[3].\n\nSo how can we compute this dp[i]?\n\nLet's think recursively. For each i, the substrings ending at i can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each possible length l (1<=l<=4), if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring before it (if any) plus 1 (if the entire substring is valid). Wait, no. Let's think about the standard dp approach for splitting the entire string.\n\nIn the standard problem, for the entire string, dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the first i characters. It is calculated as sum_{k=1 to 4} (if S[i-k+1..i] is valid, then dp[i-k] else 0). The base case is dp[0] = 1.\n\nBut for our case, we need to calculate for each possible substring ending at i. Let's think of a new DP array, say, ways[i], which represents the number of ways to split the substring ending at position i. For example, for the substring S[1..i], S[2..i], ..., S[i..i], we need to find the total number of ways to split all of them.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, and for each possible length l (1 to 4), if the last l characters form a valid code, then the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length l is equal to the number of ways to split the substring before that (i-l) characters. For example, if we have a substring ending at i of length l, and the code is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring up to i-l, plus 1 (if i-l is zero, which means the entire substring is valid).\n\nWait, this seems similar to the standard approach. Let's think again.\n\nLet me define for each position i, the value f[i] as the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i] into valid codes. Then, f[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if S[i-k+1..i] is valid, then f[i-k] else 0). With f[0] = 1.\n\nBut this only accounts for the entire string up to i. However, our problem requires us to account for all possible substrings. So, for example, the substring S[j..i] can be considered as a string of length i-j+1. To compute the number of ways to split this substring, we can use a similar approach. But how to aggregate this for all j?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for each position i, the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i is equal to the sum for l in 1..4 of (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then (number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l) + 1 if i-l is zero? No. Wait, for the substring S[j..i], the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split it as a standalone string. So for each possible j, we need to compute the number of ways to split S[j..i]. But this seems computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to track, for each position i, the sum of the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. Let's call this total_ways[i]. Then, the total answer after each step is the sum of total_ways[1] + total_ways[2] + ... + total_ways[i].\n\nTo compute total_ways[i], we can think about all possible substrings ending at i. For each possible length l (1 to 4), if the last l characters (ending at i) form a valid code, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring before it (i.e., the substring ending at i-l) plus 1 if the entire substring is valid. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me think of an example. Let's say i=3, and the substring S[1..3] is \"111\". The total_ways[3] is the sum of the number of ways to split S[1..3], S[2..3], and S[3..3].\n\nFor S[3..3], which is \"1\", valid. The number of ways is 1.\n\nFor S[2..3], which is \"11\". Valid. The number of ways is 2 (split into \"11\" or \"1\"+\"1\").\n\nFor S[1..3], which is \"111\". Valid. The number of ways is 4 (as per the sample).\n\nSo total_ways[3] = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, which matches the sample.\n\nNow, how to compute this total_ways[i] efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each i, total_ways[i] = sum_{l=1 to 4} (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then (ways[i-l] + 1 if i-l == 0 else ways[i-l] ? )) No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l (if any) plus 1? No, that's not correct. For example, the substring S[2..3] (length 2) is \"11\". The number of ways to split it is 2. This is calculated as follows: if we take the entire substring as valid (1 way), plus the ways to split the first part. Wait, for the substring S[j..i], the number of ways is the same as the standard dp approach applied to that substring. So, for the substring S[j..i], its number of ways is equal to the number of ways to split it as per the standard dp.\n\nBut how can we track this for all possible j?\n\nAnother idea: for each i, and for each possible l (1 to 4), if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l (if any) plus 1 (for the case where the entire substring is taken as a single code). Wait, this seems similar to the standard dp approach.\n\nLet me think of the standard dp approach for the substring S[j..i]. The number of ways to split this substring is equal to the sum for k=1 to 4 (if the substring S[j..j+k-1] is valid, then the number of ways to split S[j..j+k-1] is 1 (if j+k-1 == i) plus the number of ways to split the rest. Hmm, this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each position i, and for each possible length l (1 to 4), whether the last l characters form a valid code. Then, for each i, we can compute the total_ways[i] as follows:\n\ntotal_ways[i] = sum_{l=1 to 4} (valid[i][l] ? (ways[i-l] + 1) : 0 )\n\nWait, no. Because for the substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the substring up to i-l, plus 1 if the entire substring is valid. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, for the substring of length l ending at i. If this substring is valid, then there is at least one way to split it (taking the entire substring as one code). Additionally, if there are ways to split the part before it (i-l), then for each of those ways, we can append this code to get a new way. Wait, no. Because the substring of length l is the entire substring being considered. For example, if we're considering the substring S[j..i], and the entire substring is valid, then there is 1 way to split it. But if there's a way to split S[j..k] and then S[k+1..i], then that would be another way. However, this depends on the entire substring.\n\nThis seems to bring us back to the standard dp approach. So for each possible substring ending at i, the number of ways is computed as follows:\n\nLet's define a dp array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Wait, but this might not be the same as the standard dp.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, let's define dp[i] as the total number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. Then, for each i, we can look back at positions i-1, i-2, etc., and see if adding the current character allows for new splits.\n\nBut how to compute dp[i]?\n\nLet me think. For each i, we can consider all possible lengths l (1 to 4) such that the substring ending at i of length l is valid. For each such l, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l, plus 1 (if i-l is 0, meaning the entire substring is valid). Wait, for example:\n\nIf the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l (which is the part before this l-length substring) plus 1 (the case where we take this l-length substring as a single code). But this is not quite right. Because the substring ending at i-l may have multiple ways to split, and each of those ways can be extended by adding this l-length code. So for example, if there are x ways to split the substring ending at i-l, then adding this l-length code gives x ways. Plus, if the l-length code is valid, we can add 1 way (taking the entire l-length code as a single letter). Wait, no. Because the l-length code is the entire substring. For example, if we have a substring of length l, then the number of ways to split it is 1 (just take it as one code) plus the number of ways to split it into smaller parts. But how?\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's refer back to the standard problem of counting the number of ways to split a string into valid codes. The standard dp[i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically growing string `S` using Morse code.
