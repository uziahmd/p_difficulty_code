Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So, he starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn becomes another used candle when it's done. The question is to find out how many total hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2. So initially, he uses 4 candles, giving 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. Again, he can make 2/2 = 1 new. So add 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle. Which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. So 2 hours. Now he has 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, after burning the 2 new ones, he has 2 more used. So total used is 2. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. Wait but the sample output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 is 8? Oh right. Because initial 6 hours, then 6 used candles. 6 /3 is 2 new. So he uses them, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used. So total is 6+2=8. Oh right. So that's why the output is 8.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But each time you make new candles, they are burned again, which adds to the total hours and also contributes to the used pile again.\n\nSo the way to model this is:\n\nStart with a candles. Total hours is a. Then, the used candles are a. Then, while the number of used candles is >= b, we can make new candles. For each batch:\n\nnumber_of_new = used_candles // b\n\ntotal_hours += number_of_new\n\nused_candles = (used_candles % b) + number_of_new \n\nWait, because after making the new candles, the used ones that were used to make them are now gone (they are converted into new ones). So for example, if you have 4 used candles, and b is 2. Then 4//2 = 2 new. So the used_candles becomes 0 (since all 4 are used to make 2 new). Then, after burning those 2 new, you add 2 to used_candles. Then again check if you can make more.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nused = a\n\nthen loop:\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nRepeat until used < b.\n\nYes. So that's the algorithm.\n\nLet me test with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4. used is 4.\n\nloop:\n\n4 >= 2: yes.\n\nnew = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 4+2=6. used is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nloop again: 2 >=2. new=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2. exit. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal starts at 6. used is 6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2. total 6+2=8. used is 0 + 2 = 2. Now 2 <3. exit. So total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now 1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total 5. used=5.\n\n5//3 is 1. total becomes 5+1=6. used is 5%3=2 +1=3. Now, 3 >=3. So new is 3//3=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. So total is 7.\n\nYes. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b, then compute this.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b from input. The input is two integers on a line. So for example, in the sample input, the first case is '4 2', then '6 3'.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a single line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single line with two integers a and b. So for example, in the sample input, the first example is 4 2, and the output is 7. So the code needs to read a and b from a single line.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read something like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the total.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nused = a\n\nloop while used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if a is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because used is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. used is 2. new is 1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1=1. So total is 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total 3. used is 3. new is 1. total is 4. used is 0 +1=1. So total is 4.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total 5. used=5.\n\nLoop:\n\n5//2=2. total 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nLoop again: 3//2=1. total 7+1=8. used is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Exit. So total is 9.\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 5 candles: 5 hours. Then 5 used. Make 2 new (using 4), 1 left. Burn 2, add 2 hours. Now used is 2 (from the 2 new ones) + 1 (leftover from before) = 3. Then make 1 new (using 2 of the 3). Burn that, add 1 hour. Now used is 1 (from the previous 3-2=1) +1 (from the new one) = 2. Make another new. Burn, add 1. Now used is 0 +1=1. So total is 5+2+1+1=9. Yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code should work. Let's write it.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen compute as per the steps.\n\nSo:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 4 2. Output 7. Which matches.\n\nSecond sample input: 6 3. Output 8. Which matches.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Output is 7. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using candles, considering he can reuse the remnants of burned-out candles to create new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Vasily starts with `a` candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Each time a candle is burned, it becomes a used candle. These used candles can be collected and converted into new candles if there are enough of them.\n3. **Recycle Used Candles**: For every `b` used candles, Vasily can create one new candle. This new candle can be burned again, contributing to more hours of illumination and potentially more used candles.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue the process of burning candles and recycling used ones until there are not enough used candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. The initial total hours of illumination is `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Track Used Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the used ones. These used candles are then used to make new ones.\n3. **Recycling Process**: While there are enough used candles to make at least one new candle (i.e., `used >= b`), convert them into new candles. Each batch of new candles adds to the total hours and contributes to the count of used candles again after they are burned.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Repeat the recycling process until there are not enough used candles left to form a new one, ensuring all possible hours of illumination are counted.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the number of hours by iterating through the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources.",
