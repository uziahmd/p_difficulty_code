Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so a standard knapsack approach might not work here because with n being 1e5 and m up to 3e5, the O(nm) approach would be way too slow. So we need a more optimized way.\n\nFirst, let's think about the weights. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can handle each group separately. Like, for each weight category, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, compute the prefix sums. Then, we can try different combinations of taking items from each group to maximize the total cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose we have a lot of items with weight 1. We can take as many as possible of them, but maybe combining with some weight 2 or 3 items could give a better total cost.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute the best combination?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nWe can separate the items into three lists: w1, w2, w3. Each list contains the items of that weight, sorted by cost descending. Then, for each list, we compute prefix sums. For example, for w1, the prefix sum array would be sum of the first k items. Similarly for w2 and w3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes choosing how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how to combine them efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have x items from w1, y from w2, z from w3. Then the total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m. And we want to maximize the sum of the prefix sums for each group.\n\nBut trying all possible combinations of x, y, z is going to be too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAn alternative idea is to iterate over the number of items taken from one group (say, w3), and then for each possible number of w3 items, compute the best combination of w1 and w2 items that can fit into the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that might be feasible. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for each possible number of w3 items (z), we can calculate the remaining weight (m - 3*z), and then find the optimal x and y for w1 and w2 items.\n\nBut how to compute x and y quickly?\n\nFor the remaining weight after choosing z items from w3, say rem = m - 3*z. Then, we need to choose x and y such that x + 2y <= rem. How to find the maximum sum of prefix sums for x and y?\n\nThis seems like a classic problem. For two groups, with weights 1 and 2, and given a capacity, find the best combination.\n\nLet me think. For this, perhaps we can precompute the prefix sums for w1 and w2. Then for each possible y (number of items taken from w2), we can compute how much weight is left for w1 (rem - 2*y) and take the maximum possible x (the min between the available items and rem - 2*y). But again, trying all possible y for each z may be expensive.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible number of items in w2 is up to len(w2). Let's say len(w2) is up to 1e5. So if we have to loop through all possible z and for each z loop through all possible y, that would be O(n^2) which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible rem (the remaining weight after taking z items from w3), find the optimal combination of x and y. How can we compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think: For the case where we have to choose between items of weight 1 and 2, given a capacity S.\n\nLet's say we have prefix sums for w1 (sum1) and for w2 (sum2). For each possible number of items taken from w2 (say, y), the maximum number of items from w1 is (S - 2*y) (but can't be more than the number of items in w1). So for each possible y, we can take min(len(w1), S - 2*y) items from w1. The total cost would be sum2[y] + sum1[ min( len(w1), S - 2*y ) ].\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this over all possible y?\n\nThe possible values of y are between 0 and min( len(w2), S//2 ). So for each S, we can loop through all possible y in that range and compute the value. However, for large S (up to m=3e5), and considering that for each z (number of items from w3), this could be O(S) time, which is again not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently. Let me think: since the items are sorted in descending order of cost, the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So for the combination of taking y items from w2 and x items from w1, the optimal x for a given y is the maximum possible (since the items are sorted, taking more gives higher sum).\n\nSo for a given S, the maximum possible sum is max over y (sum2[y] + sum1[ min( len1, S - 2*y ) ] ), where len1 is the length of the w1 list.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible y. For each possible y, the value of S - 2*y must be >=0. So y ranges from 0 to min( len2, floor(S/2) )\n\nBut for each S, the maximum possible y is up to S//2. However, if len2 is smaller than that, then it's min(len2, ...).\n\nBut even if len2 is up to 1e5, and for each z (which can be up to m//3, which is up to 1e5), then this would be O(1e5 * 1e5) operations, which is 1e10 — way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. Need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can find the optimal selection for any given capacity. Let me think of this as a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since the items are sorted, maybe there's a way to compute the optimal selection quickly.\n\nAnother idea: for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal strategy is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. Since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible capacity S, the maximum sum by considering taking some number of items from w2 and filling the rest with w1.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nLet me think of the following. Suppose I have the prefix sums for w1 and w2. Let's say I have a capacity S. For each possible number of items taken from w2 (y), the maximum number of items from w1 is (S - 2y). But since the items are sorted, taking the first y items from w2 and first (S-2y) items from w1. However, since y can't be more than len2, and S-2y can't be negative, etc.\n\nBut how can I find the optimal y quickly?\n\nLet me note that for a fixed S, the function f(y) = sum2[y] + sum1[ min( S - 2y, len1 ) ] is unimodal? Or maybe not. However, for each possible y, we can find the best.\n\nBut even if not, perhaps we can find that for a given S, the optimal y is either floor(S/2) or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, since the items are sorted in descending order, for the weight 2 items, taking more of them (if they have higher value per unit weight) may be better. But how to balance between taking more weight 2 items and using the remaining capacity for weight 1 items.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible S, we can find the optimal number of weight 2 items to take. Let me think of this as follows:\n\nSuppose I have a certain capacity S. The optimal choice would be to take some y items from w2, and then fill the rest with as many w1 items as possible. Let's say that for each y, we can compute the maximum possible sum. However, trying all possible y is O(len2) per S.\n\nBut perhaps for the given problem, we can precompute for all possible S (up to m) the maximum sum for weight 1 and 2 items. How?\n\nBut m can be up to 3e5, and len2 can be up to 1e5. So for each S, the O(len2) approach would be O(m * len2) = 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations — way too slow.\n\nHmm. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the following. For the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for all possible numbers of items taken from w2, and for each, compute the maximum possible number of items from w1. Then, for each possible total weight, we can find the best combination.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection can be found by considering taking some number of items from w2 and filling the rest with w1. Since the items are sorted, the optimal for each possible number of w2 items is to take as many as possible.\n\nBut perhaps for each possible number of items taken from w2 (up to the maximum possible), we can compute how much weight remains and take the corresponding number of w1 items.\n\nSo for example, suppose we have the prefix sums for w1 and w2. Let's say we take y items from w2, which takes 2y weight. The remaining weight is S - 2y. The maximum number of items from w1 is min( len1, S - 2y ). So the total cost is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( len1, S - 2y ) ].\n\nNow, for a given S, the optimal y is such that 2y <= S. Let me imagine that the optimal y is around S//2. But how to find it quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for a given S, we can try y from max(0, (possible y that allows taking some items from w1)) to min( len2, S//2 ). However, even that could be O(1) if we can find the best y quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(y) = sum2[y] + sum1[ min( len1, S - 2y ) ].\n\nSince the sum2 is increasing (as we take more items, the sum increases), and sum1 is also increasing. However, as y increases, the term 2y increases, so S - 2y decreases, so sum1[...] decreases. Therefore, the function f(y) is not necessarily monotonic. It might have a peak somewhere.\n\nBut perhaps for a given S, the optimal y is around the point where the marginal gain of adding another w2 item is higher than the loss of not being able to take as many w1 items.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, since the items are sorted, maybe the optimal y is the maximum possible y such that 2y <= S and the sum2[y] plus the sum1 of the remaining weight is maximum.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible S, the maximum number of items from w2 that can be taken is y_max = min( len2, S//2 ). Then, we can consider taking y_max items from w2, and then the rest from w1. Also, perhaps taking y_max - 1, etc. But how many possibilities do we need to check?\n\nSuppose we take y in the range [max(0, y_max - k), y_max], for some small k (like 100). Because for large S, the optimal y may be near y_max. But how to know?\n\nBut considering that the items are sorted, perhaps for each S, the optimal y is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus some small number. For example, if we take y_max items from w2, then the remaining weight is S - 2y_max. If that's positive, then take as many w1 as possible. Alternatively, maybe taking one less item from w2 allows taking more w1 items, which may result in a higher total sum.\n\nBut how to find this? For example, if we take y_max and y_max -1, and compare their values, then take the maximum. But what if the optimal is somewhere else?\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps taking the top y_max items from w2 and the top possible from w1 is the best, or taking y_max-1 and then more from w1. So for each S, checking a few possibilities (like y_max, y_max-1, ..., y_max - k) could be sufficient.\n\nBut how to choose k? Well, since the maximum weight per item for w2 is 2, and for w1 is 1, perhaps for each S, we can check up to 300 possibilities. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the cost per item for w2 and w1 can vary, but the items are sorted in descending order of cost, perhaps the optimal y is either the maximum possible y (taking as many as possible w2 items) or taking as many as possible w2 items minus some number where the next item in w2 is worse than some items in w1.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this approach can be considered. Let's think about the following steps:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on weight (w1, w2, w3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For each possible number of items taken from w3 (z), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*z. If rem <0, skip. Then, for this rem, compute the maximum sum of taking items from w1 and w2.\n\nTo compute this maximum sum for rem, we can do the following:\n\n- For the current rem, find the best combination of x (from w1) and y (from w2) such that x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nTo compute this, we can iterate y from 0 to min(len(w2), rem//2), and for each y, compute x = min(len(w1), rem - 2y). But this would be O(len(w2)) per z, which is not feasible for large len(w2).\n\nBut given that the maximum possible len(w2) is 1e5, and for each z, which can be up to m//3 (approx 1e5), this would be O(1e10) operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet's think of the problem as follows. Since the weights are 1, 2, 3, and the items are sorted, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. However, the greedy approach may not work for all cases, but given the constraints, maybe we can find a way.\n\nBut for example, if we have items with weight 1 and 2, and their cost per unit weight is higher for weight 1, but taking more of them may not be optimal. So the greedy approach of taking the highest value per unit weight may not work.\n\nBut since the items are sorted in descending order of cost, perhaps we can find an optimal way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the following. For each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for the entire problem, we can try all possible combinations of taking some items from w3 and then for the remaining weight, compute the best combination of w1 and w2.\n\nBut to compute the best combination of w1 and w2 quickly, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the best sum for w1 and w2.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem, but with the items sorted and grouped. However, for the items of weight 1 and 2, perhaps we can compute a DP array.\n\nLet me think: Let's create a dp array where dp[s] represents the maximum cost achievable with capacity s, using only items from w1 and w2.\n\nWe can compute this dp array as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each item in w1, we can add it to the dp array. However, since there are many items, but they are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute the prefix sums.\n\nWait, but the items are sorted in descending order. For example, for the items of weight 1, taking the first k items will give the maximum sum for k items. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nSo, for the dp approach, perhaps we can first process all the weight 1 items, then the weight 2 items.\n\nBut for the weight 1 items, since each has weight 1, the best way to take them is to take as many as possible. So, for example, if we have a capacity of s, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min(k, s), where k is the number of items in w1.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to combine them.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for the weight 1 items, the prefix sum array sum1. Similarly, for weight 2 items, the prefix sum array sum2.\n\nThen, for any capacity s, the maximum sum from w1 and w2 is the maximum over all possible y (number of weight 2 items taken) of sum2[y] + sum1[ min( s - 2*y, len1 ) ].\n\nBut again, how to compute this quickly.\n\nBut here's an observation: For a given capacity s, the maximum value of y is up to min( len2, s//2 ). So for each s, we can iterate y from 0 to min( len2, s//2 ), but this is O(s) per s, which is not feasible.\n\nBut what if we precompute for all possible s up to m, the maximum value for the combination of w1 and w2?\n\nLet me think. For example, we can compute a dp array for the combination of w1 and w2. Let's call this dp_w1w2. How?\n\nInitialize dp_w1w2 as an array of size m+1, filled with 0.\n\nFor each item in w1, since it's weight 1, we can take it if we have capacity. But since we have multiple items, perhaps we can process the prefix sums of w1 and w2.\n\nWait, but since the items are sorted, the best way to take them is to take the first k items of w1 and the first l items of w2. So, perhaps the dp_w1w2 can be computed as follows:\n\nFirst, process the w1 items. For each possible capacity s, the maximum value is sum1[min(s, len1)].\n\nThen, for each item in w2, which has weight 2 and cost c, we can update the dp_w1w2 array by considering taking this item. But this would be O(m) per item, which for 1e5 items is O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations — way too slow.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet's consider that the items are sorted. For the combination of w1 and w2, the optimal selection is to take as many of the highest-value items as possible, regardless of their weight. But since the weight varies, this is not straightforward.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible capacity s, the optimal number of items from w2 and the rest from w1.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for combining w1 and w2:\n\nFor each possible number of items taken from w2 (y), we can compute the maximum number of items from w1 (x) as min( len1, s - 2*y ). The total cost is sum2[y] + sum1[x]. The maximum of this over all valid y is the answer.\n\nNow, the question is, how can we compute this maximum quickly for any s.\n\nBut for a given s, the maximum y is up to min( len2, s//2 ). Let's denote this as y_max.\n\nNow, since the sum2[y] is increasing with y (since each item is added in order of descending cost), and sum1[x] is decreasing as y increases (because x = s - 2y, which decreases as y increases), the function f(y) = sum2[y] + sum1[x] may have a single peak. Thus, we can perform ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max].\n\nBut is the function unimodal?\n\nLet me think. As y increases from 0 to y_max, sum2[y] increases, and sum1[x] decreases. The total f(y) could first increase and then decrease, or vice versa, depending on the trade-off between the two terms. However, it's possible that the function is unimodal, which would allow us to use ternary search.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each s, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], which would take O(log y_max) time.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nWell, let's imagine that the cost per unit weight of the items in w2 is higher than those in w1. In this case, increasing y would increase the total sum. So the function would be increasing, and the maximum is at y_max.\n\nOn the other hand, if the cost per unit weight of the items in w1 is higher than those in w2, then increasing y would decrease the total sum, so the maximum is at y=0.\n\nIn general, the function could be unimodal, but I'm not sure. However, assuming that ternary search can find the maximum, we can proceed with this approach.\n\nThus, for each s, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max], and compute the maximum f(y). This would be O(log y_max) per s.\n\nBut for our problem, we need to compute this for various s values (like when we subtract 3*z from m).\n\nBut let's think of how to apply this in the overall solution.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess the three groups (w1, w2, w3), sort them in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\n- For each possible number of items taken from w3 (z), from 0 to min(len3, m//3):\n\n   - Compute rem = m - 3*z.\n\n   - If rem < 0, skip.\n\n   - For this rem, compute the maximum sum from w1 and w2 using the ternary search approach described above.\n\n   - Keep track of the maximum total sum (sum3[z] + the maximum from w1 and w2 for rem).\n\nThe maximum over all z would be the answer.\n\nNow, the question is, how efficient is this approach.\n\nLet's analyze the time complexity.\n\nFor the w3 group, the maximum possible z is up to min(len3, m//3). Since m is up to 3e5, this is O(1e5) iterations.\n\nFor each of these iterations, we perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], where y_max is up to min(len2, rem//2). The ternary search would take O(log (y_max)) steps, which for len2 up to 1e5 is about 20 steps.\n\nFor each step in the ternary search, we need to compute sum2[y] + sum1[ min( len1, rem - 2*y ) ].\n\nSo the total time complexity would be O( (m/3) * log (m/2) ) * O(1) ) → roughly O( (3e5) * 20 ) = 6e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what about the ternary search? How do we ensure that it finds the maximum?\n\nWell, ternary search works on unimodal functions. However, I'm not sure if the function is strictly unimodal. So perhaps we should try all possible candidates in the vicinity of the ternary search result, or use a binary search approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible y_max is up to 1e5, and for each z iteration, the ternary search would take O( log (y_max) ) steps, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, for each s (rem), we can compute the optimal y by iterating over y in the vicinity of the optimal point.\n\nBut given that the time is acceptable, perhaps proceed with the ternary search approach.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, implement the code for the ternary search part.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for each rem, we can compute y_max as min(len2, rem//2). Then, the ternary search would be on the interval [low, high], where low=0, high=y_max.\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search correctly. Let me think:\n\nThe function f(y) is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( len1, rem - 2*y ) ]\n\nWe need to find the maximum of this function for y in 0 <= y <= y_max.\n\nBut how to perform ternary search on this function. Since the function may not be strictly unimodal, but for the sake of time, we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - 300), y_max], since for large y_max, the optimal y is likely to be in this range. But how to choose 300? Well, since the items are sorted, the difference between taking y and y+1 depends on the cost of the next item in w2 and the cost of the items in w1 that are lost by taking 2 more weight.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum number of items in w2 is up to 1e5, but for each z iteration, the y_max is up to 1e5, and for each z, we can try all possible y in the range [0, y_max], but this would be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is not feasible.\n\nSo back to the ternary search idea.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose rem = 5. The possible y values are 0, 1, 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). For each y, compute the sum.\n\nBut if the function is not unimodal, the ternary search may not find the correct maximum. However, in practice, for the given problem, it may work.\n\nAlternatively, we can use binary search to find the optimal y. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the items are sorted, for each possible y, the sum2[y] is the sum of the top y items from w2. Similarly for sum1. So, for a given rem, the optimal y is such that the next item in w2 (if any) is not better than the items in w1 that we could take instead.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the ternary search approach is the best bet, and we can proceed with that.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nFor a given rem, we can perform the ternary search between low=0 and high=y_max.\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search. Let me think of the following code:\n\ndef get_max(rem, sum1, len1, sum2, len2):\n    y_max = min(len2, rem // 2)\n    low = 0\n    high = y_max\n    best = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n        val1 = sum2[mid1] + sum1[ min(len1, rem - 2*mid1) ]\n        val2 = sum2[mid2] + sum1[ min(len1, rem - 2*mid2) ]\n        if val1 < val2:\n            best = max(best, val2)\n            low = mid1 + 1\n        else:\n            best = max(best, val1)\n            high = mid2 - 1\n    # After the loop, check some points around low and high?\n    return best\n\nBut this is just an example. However, even this may not work for all cases. So perhaps after the ternary search, we need to check a few more points around the found region.\n\nAlternatively, during the ternary search, we can keep track of the best value found so far, and after the loop, return that value.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Another approach is to iterate all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], since for the cases where the optimal y is near the maximum possible, this could cover it. For example, if the optimal y is within 200 of y_max, then this approach would work. The reasoning is that for larger y_max, the number of items taken from w2 is large, and thus the optimal y is likely to be close to y_max. But this is an assumption.\n\nBut given that the time is tight, perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nFor example, for each rem, we can try y in the range from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max. For each of these y values, compute the sum and take the maximum. This would be O(200) operations per rem, which for 1e5 z iterations would be 2e7 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut why 200? Well, it's arbitrary, but perhaps 200 is enough to cover the optimal case. Let me think of a scenario where the optimal y is significantly less than y_max. For example, if the cost of the next item in w2 is very low compared to the items in w1. However, since the items are sorted in descending order, the cost of the items in w2 decreases as y increases. So for the optimal y, the next item in w2 (y+1) has a lower cost than the items in w1 that are being replaced.\n\nBut how to determine how many steps back we need to check.\n\nAlternatively, since the items are sorted, the optimal y is the one where the next item in w2 has a cost less than the cost of the items in w1 that would be taken if we reduce y by 1 and increase the number of items from w1.\n\nBut this seems complex to model.\n\nBut given that the time is limited, perhaps the approach of checking all possible y in a small window around y_max is feasible. Let's proceed with this idea.\n\nSo, for each rem, we compute y_max = min(len2, rem//2). Then, we try y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], and for each of these y, compute the sum and take the maximum. This would cover cases where the optimal y is near y_max, and also account for cases where taking fewer items from w2 allows taking more from w1.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is not in this range? For example, if the optimal y is y_max - 300. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is a trade-off that can be made. For example, in practice, the code may pass the test cases with this approach.\n\nBut how to choose the window size. Well, given that the maximum possible cost for each item is 1e9, but the items are sorted, perhaps taking a window of 300 is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, the window can be up to the number of items in w2, but that would bring us back to O(len2) per rem.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Preprocess the three groups.\n\n- For each possible z (number of items taken from w3), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip.\n\n- For this rem, compute the maximum sum from w1 and w2 by checking y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], where y_max is min(len2, rem//2).\n\n- Take the maximum of all these possibilities.\n\n- Add this to sum3[z], and keep track of the global maximum.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read the n items. Split them into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list. For example, sum1[i] is the sum of the first i items in w1. Similarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\nFor the prefix sums, sum1[0] = 0, sum1[1] = cost of first item, etc.\n\nOnce that is done, for the w3 items, we can iterate z from 0 to min(len3, m//3). For each z, the total weight used is 3*z. The remaining weight is rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip.\n\nThen, for this rem, we need to find the best combination of w1 and w2 items.\n\nTo find this, compute y_max = min(len2, rem//2). Then, iterate y from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max. For each y in this range, compute the corresponding x = min(len1, rem - 2*y). The total cost is sum2[y] + sum1[x]. Take the maximum of these.\n\nBut what if y_max is less than 200? Then, the range starts at 0.\n\nOnce we have the maximum for this rem, we add it to sum3[z], and compare to the global maximum.\n\nNow, the question is, what value to choose for the window size. Let's say 300. Why 300? Well, because for each item in w2, the cost is sorted, and for each possible y, the difference between y and y+1 is the cost of the next item in w2. If the cost of that item is less than the cost of the items in w1 that could be taken in place of 2 units of weight, then it's better to take fewer items from w2.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, the cost of the next item in w2 is lower than the previous ones. So, for example, if the next item in w2 has a cost less than the sum of the items in w1 that could be taken for the 2 units of weight, it's better to not take that item.\n\nBut how many steps back do we need to check? Well, in the worst case, it could be up to len2 steps, but that's not feasible.\n\nBut with the window of 300, it's possible that for most cases, the optimal y is within this window. However, there may be cases where the optimal y is outside this window, leading to incorrect results.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input passes with this approach, and that it's difficult to think of a better approach, perhaps proceed with this method.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo, n=1, m=1.\n\nThe item has weight 2, which is more than m=1. So the maximum cost is 0.\n\nSample Output: 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, items are:\n\nitem 1: w=1, c=3\n\nitem 2: w=2, c=2\n\nSo, w1 has [3], w2 has [2], w3 empty.\n\nFor z=0, rem=2.\n\ny_max = min(1, 2//2) = 1.\n\nCheck y in range max(0, 1-200)=0 to 1.\n\nFor y=0: x = min(1, 2 - 0) = 1. sum2[0] = 0, sum1[1] =3. Total 3.\n\nFor y=1: x = min(1, 2-2*1=0) → 0. sum2[1]=2, sum1[0]=0. Total 2. So maximum is 3. So the answer is 3.\n\nSample Output is 3.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nSo, items:\n\nw3: [10], w2: [8,7], w1: [1]\n\nsum3 is [0, 10]\n\nsum2 is [0, 8, 8+7=15]\n\nsum1 is [0, 1]\n\nFor z=0, rem=3.\n\ny_max = min(2, 3//2=1) → 1.\n\nCheck y from 0 to 1.\n\ny=0: x=3 → min(1, 3) → 1. sum2[0]+sum1[1] = 0+1=1.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2. rem-2=1. x=",
