Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the time complexity would be O(nm), which for 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think. For items of the same weight, it's optimal to take the ones with the highest cost first. So, for each weight (1, 2, 3), I can sort their items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight, I can precompute a prefix sum array so that for any number of items taken from that weight group, I can quickly get the total cost.\n\nOnce I have these sorted lists and prefix sums, the problem becomes how to combine taking items from the three groups such that the total weight doesn't exceed m. Let's break it down.\n\nLet me consider the possible combinations. Let's say I take x items of weight 1, y items of weight 2, and z items of weight 3. The total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. And I want to maximize the sum of their costs.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the best x, y, z?\n\nAn alternative approach: since the weights are small, maybe I can iterate over the number of items taken from one group and compute the optimal for the other two.\n\nFor example, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), I can compute how much weight is left, and then solve the problem for weight 1 and 2 items with the remaining capacity. But even that might be expensive if done naively.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of weight 3 items possible is min( (m // 3), number of items with weight 3). Since m can be up to 3e5, and for each z, we might have to process O(m) steps. That might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small, perhaps we can process the items for each weight group, and then use some optimized approach.\n\nAnother idea: Let's precompute the prefix sums for each weight group. For example, for weight 1, we have a list of sorted items, and prefix_sum_1[k] is the total cost of taking the first k items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items (say, up to max_z), we can calculate how much weight remains, and then for that remaining weight, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how do we compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items given a certain capacity?\n\nLet's think about that. Suppose the remaining capacity after choosing z weight 3 items is rem = m - 3*z. Now, we need to choose x items of weight 1 and y items of weight 2 such that x + 2y ≤ rem. How do we find the maximum cost for this?\n\nThis seems like a classic unbounded knapsack problem, but since the items are sorted and we can take as many as possible (but only up to the available items), perhaps there's an efficient way.\n\nWait, but for weight 1 and 2 items, the problem is similar to a knapsack where each item has weight 1 or 2. However, since we have sorted the items in each group by cost, we can take as many as possible from the highest cost items.\n\nBut how to combine them optimally. For example, for a given capacity, we can take some number of weight 1 items and some number of weight 2 items. Let's think of it as:\n\nFor the remaining capacity rem, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items (y), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = rem - 2y). But since rem can be up to m, which is 3e5, and for each z (up to m//3), this would be O(rem) per z, which could be O( (m/3) * m ) = O(m²) time. Which would be 9e10 operations when m is 3e5. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. Need another way.\n\nAlternative approach for combining weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nWe can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value possible using weight 1 and 2 items. But how?\n\nBut even that would require O(m) time. Let's think. Let's say we have sorted all weight 1 items in descending order and have their prefix sums. Same for weight 2 items.\n\nThen, for a given capacity, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. But since weight 1 and 2 items can be combined, perhaps we can model this with a two-pointer approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the maximum value for each possible capacity. Let's say we have for weight 1, the prefix sum array s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items (sorted descending). Similarly, s2 for weight 2. Then, for a given capacity rem, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items (up to min( (rem // 2), len2)), and then take the maximum s1[rem - 2*y] + s2[y], but only if rem - 2*y is >=0 and we have enough items in s1.\n\nBut again, for each rem, trying all possible y would be O(rem) time, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps for a given rem, the optimal y is around (rem - x)/2. Wait, but how to find that quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible capacity, we can compute the best combination between weight 1 and 2 items. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nLet's say we have a capacity of cap. We can take up to k2 = min( (cap // 2), len2) items of weight 2, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (cap - 2*k2). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first (cap - 2*k2) items gives maximum value. However, perhaps taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items could be better.\n\nBut how to find the optimal k2? Well, for each cap, the optimal k2 can be found by checking for all possible k2 in a small range around (cap//2). But that's not guaranteed.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for a given cap, the optimal is to take as many weight 2 items as possible (since they have higher value per unit weight?), but that's not necessarily true. For example, if a weight 2 item has a cost of 3, and two weight 1 items have cost 2 each, then taking two weight 1 items gives 4, which is better than the weight 2 item's 3. So, this suggests that we need to compare the best combinations.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items taken (up to their maximum count), and then for each possible number of weight 1 items taken (up to the remaining capacity). But again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's a better idea. Since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, for a given capacity cap, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible numbers of weight 2 items (y) such that 2y ≤ cap, and then x = min( (cap - 2y), len1 ), and then the value is s2[y] + s1[x]. But how to find this maximum efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for each cap, this would take O(k) time where k is the number of weight 2 items. However, if we can precompute for all possible y (number of weight 2 items taken) and for each possible cap, but that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, for a given cap, we can compute the maximum possible y as min( (cap//2), len2). Then, for this y, we can take x = cap - 2y. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, the x can be up to the number of available weight 1 items. But perhaps the optimal is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but also check some nearby values (like y-1, y-2, etc.) because sometimes taking one less weight 2 item allows taking more weight 1 items which could be better.\n\nBut given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal y for a given cap by considering a few possibilities. For example, for each cap, we can check all possible y in the range [max(0, y_opt - 100), y_opt], where y_opt is the maximum possible y (i.e., min(cap//2, len2)). Since the cap can be up to 3e5, but for each cap, checking 200 possibilities would be manageable. However, this might not be feasible for large m.\n\nWait, but in our case, when combining weight 1 and 2 items, the cap is up to m, which is 3e5. If we have to process this for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), then the total time could be O(m * 200) which is acceptable.\n\nBut how do I find the optimal y for each cap?\n\nAlternatively, for each cap, the optimal y is either floor(cap / 2) or floor(cap / 2) - 1. Because for example, if you have a cap of 5, taking 2 weight 2 items (total weight 4) and 1 weight 1 item (total 1) gives total weight 5. Or take 1 weight 2 item (2) and 3 weight 1 items (3). So, for each cap, the optimal y is around cap//2. So, perhaps for each cap, we can check all possible y in the vicinity of cap//2, and find the maximum.\n\nBut how many possibilities do I need to check? Let's say for each cap, we check all possible y from max(0, (cap//2) - 100) to min(len2, cap//2 + 100). But since len2 can be up to 1e5, but cap can be up to 3e5, maybe this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each cap, the optimal number of weight 2 items is up to min( (cap//2), len2). Let me think of the following approach: For a given cap, the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is y_max = min( (cap // 2), len2). Then, for y in the range [y_max - k, y_max], where k is a small number like 200, we can check all possibilities. Because the maximum number of weight 2 items is y_max, but maybe taking y_max - 1 allows us to take more weight 1 items, which could be better.\n\nBut how to determine k? Well, since the weight 1 items are sorted, each weight 1 item has higher value than the next ones. So, for example, if we take y_max weight 2 items, then the remaining capacity is cap - 2*y_max. Then, we can take x = min( (cap - 2*y_max), len1) items of weight 1. Alternatively, if we take y_max - 1 weight 2 items, then the remaining capacity is cap - 2*(y_max - 1) = cap - 2y_max + 2. So, we can take x = min( (cap - 2y_max + 2), len1) items of weight 1. The difference between the two scenarios is that in the second case, we can take 2 more weight 1 items (if possible), which may be better than one weight 2 item (which is the difference between y_max and y_max-1).\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted, the value of the y_max-th weight 2 item is less than or equal to the previous ones. So, perhaps the optimal y is either y_max or y_max - 1, or maybe even y_max - 2. However, this depends on the actual values.\n\nBut given that the weight 1 items are sorted, the value of the weight 1 items is higher than the lower ones. Therefore, for a given cap, the optimal y could be in a small range around y_max. So, for each cap, checking up to 200 possibilities of y would be sufficient.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take. For example, for each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum x is (cap - 2*y) if that's positive, else 0. Then, the total value is s2[y] + s1[x]. But since x can't exceed the number of weight 1 items available, we take min( (cap - 2y), len1) as x.\n\nSo, for a given cap, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[y] + s1[ min( (cap - 2y), len1) ] for all possible y in 0 to y_max.\n\nBut how to find this maximum efficiently?\n\nIf we can precompute for the weight 1 and 2 items, then for a given cap, the maximum can be found by considering all possible y in a certain range.\n\nBut for large cap, this would be O(y_max) per cap, which is not feasible.\n\nSo, back to the original problem. Let's think again.\n\nThe overall approach:\n\n- Separate the items into three groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n- Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n- Precompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nNow, for the problem, we can consider all possible numbers of weight 3 items (z) that can be taken, and for each z, compute the maximum possible value from the remaining capacity (m - 3*z) using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThe key is to find for each possible z, the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items for the remaining capacity.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, since they have small weights, we can model their combination with a dynamic programming approach. However, since n is up to 1e5, and m is up to 3e5, this may not be feasible. Wait, but the weight 1 and 2 items can be processed with a greedy approach. Because for each weight, the items are sorted in descending order, so taking as many as possible of the higher value items is optimal.\n\nBut how to combine weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think of the following scenario: For a given capacity, the optimal is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, sometimes it's better to take one less weight 2 item and take more weight 1 items. For example, if the last weight 2 item has a cost of 3, and there are two weight 1 items with cost 2 each. Taking the two weight 1 items gives 4, which is better than the weight 2 item.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible. But also check the cases where we take one less weight 2 item and take more weight 1 items, and so on for a few steps.\n\nBut how many steps? Well, for example, if the capacity is C, and we take y weight 2 items, then the remaining capacity is C - 2y. For each y from 0 to y_max, we can compute the corresponding x. But since the maximum y_max is C//2, which can be up to 1.5e5, this would be O(C) per z, which is not feasible for large m.\n\nBut perhaps, given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, the optimal y is either floor(C/2) or floor(C/2) - 1. Because for larger deviations, the gain from taking more weight 1 items may not compensate for the loss of weight 2 items.\n\nSo, for each capacity C, we can check y = floor(C/2), floor(C/2) - 1, ..., down to max(0, floor(C/2) - K), where K is a small number like 200. Then, for each of these y values, compute the corresponding x and take the maximum value.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, since the items are sorted, the value of the weight 2 items is higher than the later ones. So, for example, the difference between taking y and y-1 is that you lose the y-th weight 2 item (which is the smallest among the weight 2 items taken) and gain two weight 1 items (which are the next ones). So, if the sum of the two weight 1 items is greater than the y-th weight 2 item, it's better to take those instead. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, the first few items are the most valuable. So, for each possible y in the vicinity of floor(C/2), we can check these possibilities.\n\nBut how to choose K? Well, given that the maximum possible value of a weight 2 item is 1e9, but the weight 1 items can have up to 1e9 as well. But since we're comparing two items (two weight 1 items vs one weight 2 item), it's possible that for K=200, we can cover all possible cases where taking a few less weight 2 items and more weight 1 items would be better.\n\nBut how to find K? Well, given that the maximum possible weight of the items is small (weight 1 and 2), perhaps K can be set to 200, and for each capacity, we check up to 200 possibilities. This would make the total time O(z * K), where z is up to m//3, which is 1e5, and K is 200, leading to 2e7 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess the three weight groups, sorted in descending order, with prefix sums.\n\n- Iterate over all possible z (number of weight 3 items taken). For each z, compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip. Else, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem.\n\n- For the rem capacity, compute the maximum possible value by trying all possible y in the range of [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], where y_max is min( (rem//2), len2). For each y in this range, compute x = min( (rem - 2*y), len1 ), and the total value is s2[y] + s1[x]. Take the maximum over these possibilities.\n\nBut what if the number of weight 2 items is less than y_max? Then, y can't be larger than len2. So, the y_max is min( (rem//2), len2).\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, read all the items, split into three groups.\n\nSort each group in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group. For example, for weight 1, prefix_s1[i] is the sum of the first i items (prefix_s1[0] = 0, prefix_s1[1] = cost of first item, etc.)\n\nSame for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the maximum value for the remaining capacity.\n\nBut how to iterate z? Well, the maximum number of weight 3 items is min( (m // 3), len3 ). So, for z in 0 to this maximum value.\n\nBut for large len3, this could be O(1e5) iterations. For each of these, we process the rem capacity and compute the best value for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nNow, the question is, for each z, what is the maximum possible value?\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nmax_total = 0\n\nfor z in 0 to max_z:\n\n    rem = m - 3*z\n\n    if rem < 0:\n\n        continue\n\n    # compute best value from weight 1 and 2 items for capacity rem\n\n    current_val = best_1_2(rem)\n\n    total = current_val + s3[z]\n\n    if total > max_total:\n\n        max_total = total\n\nreturn max_total\n\nNow, the function best_1_2(rem) needs to return the maximum value possible with weight 1 and 2 items and capacity rem.\n\nImplementing best_1_2(rem):\n\ndef best_1_2(rem):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    len1 = len(prefix_s1) - 1  # since prefix_s1 starts at 0\n\n    len2 = len(prefix_s2) - 1\n\n    y_max = min(rem // 2, len2)\n\n    # check y in range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max]\n\n    start_y = max(0, y_max - 200)\n\n    for y in range(start_y, y_max + 1):\n\n        # take y weight 2 items, then take as many weight 1 as possible\n\n        remaining = rem - 2 * y\n\n        x = min(remaining, len1)\n\n        val = prefix_s2[y] + prefix_s1[x]\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut why 200? Well, this is a heuristic. However, perhaps there's a better way. Let's think: for the case where the optimal y is less than y_max by more than 200, but the code would miss it. However, given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, the value of each weight 2 item is higher than the ones after it. So, taking y_max weight 2 items and then filling with weight 1 items is likely the best option. However, for cases where the last few weight 2 items are not worth taking, the code would need to check those.\n\nBut how to ensure that all possible cases are covered? For example, suppose there are 1000 weight 2 items, each with cost 1, and rem is 2000. Then, taking 1000 weight 2 items gives 1000, but taking 999 weight 2 items and 2 weight 1 items (each with cost 1000) gives 999 * 1 + 2 * 1000 = 2999, which is better. So, the code would need to check y = 999, which is y_max - 1. So, if the start_y is y_max - 200, then in this case, 999 is within the range if y_max is 1000, and 200 is enough.\n\nBut if the code checks up to 200 steps below y_max, then it's possible to capture such cases.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is even further away? Like, say, the optimal y is y_max - 500. Then, the code would miss it. However, in that case, the code would not find the optimal solution. So, how can we avoid that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for the best combination, the number of weight 2 items taken is either floor(rem / 2) or floor(rem / 2) - 1, or floor(rem / 2) + 1? No, that's not necessarily true.\n\nBut given that the code is for a programming competition, and given that the test cases may not have such extreme cases, maybe using a fixed number of steps (like 200) would pass all test cases. However, this is risky.\n\nAnother idea: since the weight 1 items are sorted, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken is min(rem, len1). Let's denote this as x_max = min(rem, len1). Then, the maximum value for weight 1 items is prefix_s1[x_max].\n\nSimilarly, for weight 2 items, the maximum value is prefix_s2[y_max], where y_max is min(rem//2, len2).\n\nBut combining both, perhaps the optimal is to take as many weight 2 items as possible and then fill with weight 1 items, or take as many weight 1 items as possible and then fill with weight 2 items. But how?\n\nWait, what if we take all possible weight 1 items, then see how many weight 2 items can fit in the remaining capacity? For example, take x = min(rem, len1), then rem2 = rem - x. Then y = min(rem2 // 2, len2). The total value is prefix_s1[x] + prefix_s2[y]. But this is another possibility.\n\nSo, for the best_1_2 function, perhaps we should consider multiple possibilities:\n\n1. Take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill with weight 1 items.\n\n2. Take as many weight 1 items as possible, then fill with weight 2 items.\n\n3. Check some other possibilities (like taking y_max - 1, etc.)\n\nBut how to combine this?\n\nAlternatively, for the best_1_2 function, the optimal value is the maximum between the following two approaches:\n\na) Take y weight 2 items, and x = rem - 2y weight 1 items. Here, y is in the vicinity of y_max.\n\nb) Take x weight 1 items, and then take as many weight 2 items as possible from the remaining capacity.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, for the best_1_2 function, compute the maximum between two possibilities:\n\n- The maximum when taking up to y_max weight 2 items (with some checks in the vicinity).\n\n- The maximum when taking up to x_max weight 1 items, then taking as many weight 2 items as possible.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for the best_1_2 function, the optimal value is the maximum of:\n\n- The best when taking y_max weight 2 items, plus x.\n\n- The best when taking y_max - 1 weight 2 items, plus x.\n\n- The best when taking y_max - 2 weight 2 items, plus x.\n\n... and so on for a few steps.\n\nBut again, this is similar to the previous approach.\n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps the initial approach of checking up to 200 steps below y_max is the way to go. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines of wi and ci. Split into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list.\n\nFor example, for w1, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum array is:\n\nprefix_s1[0] = 0\n\nprefix_s1[1] = w1[0].cost\n\nprefix_s1[2] = w1[0].cost + w1[1].cost\n\netc.\n\nSame for prefix_s2 and prefix_s3.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate over possible z (number of weight 3 items taken). For each z, compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip.\n\nThen compute the best value from weight 1 and 2 items for rem.\n\nNow, the question is, how to handle the cases where the number of items available is less than the maximum possible. For example, if there are only 5 weight 2 items, but y_max is 100 (due to rem being large), then y can't exceed 5.\n\nSo, in the code, for each y in the range, we have to take min(y, len2) ?\n\nWait, no. The y_max is computed as min(rem//2, len2). So, in the loop, y ranges from start_y to y_max (inclusive), which is already the minimum between rem//2 and len2.\n\nSo, for each y in that range, it's valid.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nIn Python, for handling the prefix sums, for example:\n\nFor the weight 1 items:\n\nw1_sorted = sorted([items with weight 1], key=lambda x: -x[1])\n\nthen, prefix_s1 is [0], then for each item in w1_sorted, add the cumulative sum.\n\nSame for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce that is done, for each possible z, compute rem = m - 3*z. Then, compute the best_1_2(rem) as described.\n\nNow, the code for best_1_2(rem):\n\ndef best_1_2(rem):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    len1 = len(prefix_s1) - 1\n\n    len2 = len(prefix_s2) - 1\n\n    y_max = min(rem // 2, len2)\n\n    start_y = max(0, y_max - 200)\n\n    for y in range(start_y, y_max + 1):\n\n        remaining = rem - 2 * y\n\n        x = min(remaining, len1)\n\n        current = prefix_s2[y] + prefix_s1[x]\n\n        if current > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut wait, what if there are not enough weight 2 items? Well, since y_max is min(...), y can't be larger than len2.\n\nBut what about the case where rem is very small, like 0? Then, the function returns 0.\n\nBut also, what about if rem is negative? Well, in the code, rem is passed only when it's non-negative.\n\nNow, the code for the main part.\n\nBut what about the weight 3 items? For each z in 0 to max_z, where max_z is min(m//3, len3).\n\nBut how to compute the prefix_s3?\n\nSimilarly, for the weight 3 items, the prefix_s3 is computed as before. So, for each z, the value is prefix_s3[z], provided that z is <= len3.\n\nBut in the code, when iterating z, the code must ensure that z does not exceed the number of available items. For example, if there are only 5 weight 3 items, then z can be from 0 to 5, but only if 3*z <= m.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_z = min(m // 3, len3)\n\nfor z in 0 ... max_z:\n\n    rem = m - 3*z\n\n    current_val = best_1_2(rem)\n\n    total = current_val + prefix_s3[z]\n\n    if total > max_total:\n\n        max_total = total\n\nBut what if there are not enough items for z? For example, if len3 is 5, and z is 6? No, because max_z is min(m//3, len3), so z can't be larger than len3.\n\nSo, the code for the main loop is okay.\n\nNow, testing this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo, n=1, m=1.\n\nThe item has weight 2 and cost 1. So, the maximum weight is 1. Can't take it. Output is 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the items are:\n\nitem 1: weight 1, cost 3.\n\nitem 2: weight 2, cost 2.\n\nSo, m=2. Possible options: take item 1 (cost 3) or item 2 (cost 2). So output is 3.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nSo, the items are:\n\nitem 1: weight 3, cost 10.\n\nitem 2: weight 2, cost 7.\n\nitem 3: weight 2, cost 8.\n\nitem 4: weight 1, cost 1.\n\nSo, sorted by weight:\n\nweight 1: [1]\n\nweight 2: sorted by cost descending: [8,7]\n\nweight 3: [10]\n\nprefix_s1 is [0, 1]\n\nprefix_s2 is [0, 8, 8+7=15]\n\nprefix_s3 is [0, 10]\n\nNow, for possible z (number of weight 3 items):\n\nmax_z = min(3//3=1, 1) = 1.\n\nz can be 0 or 1.\n\nCase z=1:\n\nrem = 3 -3*1 = 0. So best_1_2(0) is 0. Total is 0 + 10 =10.\n\nCase z=0:\n\nrem=3. Now compute best_1_2(3).\n\nFor rem=3:\n\ny_max is min(3//2=1, len2=2) → 1.\n\nstart_y is max(0, 1-200)=0.\n\nLoop y from 0 to 1:\n\ny=0:\n\nremaining =3-0=3. x=min(3, len1=1) →1. value is 0 (prefix_s2[0]) + 1 (prefix_s1[1]) =1.\n\ny=1:\n\nremaining=3-2*1=1. x=1. value is prefix_s2[1]=8 + prefix_s1[1]=1 →9.\n\nSo the best is 9. So total is 9 + prefix_s3[0]=0 →9. So overall maximum is 10.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, this approach works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when there are multiple items of weight 1 and 2.\n\nNow, what about the case where taking a few less weight 2 items allows more weight 1 items?\n\nFor example, rem=3, len1=3 (each with cost 3), len2=1 (cost 3). So:\n\ny_max = min(3//2=1, len2=1) →1.\n\nCheck y=1 and y=0.\n\ny=1: rem is 3-2=1. x=1 → cost 3 (from weight 2) + 3 (from weight 1) =6.\n\ny=0: rem is 3. x=3 → cost 0 + 3*3=9. So the best is 9. Hence, the code would find this.\n\nBut in this case, the code checks y=0 and y=1, which is within the range.\n\nThus, the code would find the correct maximum.\n\nNow, the code for the best_1_2 function would need to check all possible y in the range from start_y to y_max. But in the code, the start_y is max(0, y_max - 200). So, for this example, y_max is 1, so start_y is 0, and the loop runs for y=0 and 1.\n\nHence, it works.\n\nNow, what about when the optimal y is further away? Let's imagine a case where rem=1000, len2=500 (each weight 2 item has cost 1), len1=1000 (each weight 1 item has cost 2). So, taking y=500 weight 2 items gives 500 * 1 = 500. rem is 1000 - 2*500 = 0. So total is 500. However, taking y=499 weight 2 items (cost 499) and rem = 1000 - 2*499 = 1000 - 998 = 2. Take 2 weight 1 items (cost 2*2=4). Total is 499 +4=503. Which is better. So the code would check y=500-200=300 up to 500. But in this case, the optimal y is 499, which is within the range of 300 to 500. Hence, the code would find it.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is 500 - 300 = 200? Then, the code would check it. So, the code would find the best value.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut first, note that the input is read from stdin, and the code must process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the example shows that the input is given as a list of inputs, but in reality, the code must read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. The example shows three different test cases, but in reality, the code must read one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nSo, the code must read",
