Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position divided by two might be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because the order of lanterns matters when checking consecutive gaps. If they are not sorted, we can't just check adjacent ones.\n\n2. After sorting, check the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0) / 2. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then this gap is zero, so no contribution.\n\n3. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them is (current - previous). The required d for this gap would be (current - previous) / 2. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap, which is (current - previous)/2 away from each lantern.\n\n4. Finally, check the gap between the last lantern and the end of the street (l). The required d here is (l - a[-1])/2.\n\nThe answer is the maximum value among all these calculated values.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple lanterns? For example, if there's a gap between two lanterns that's larger than others, then that's the critical one. So the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions. Then compute the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since the start is 0), the distance from 0 to first lantern is a[0], so the required d is a[0]/2. But if the first lantern is at 0, then this is zero.\n\n- between consecutive lanterns: for each i from 1 to n-1, the difference between a[i] and a[i-1]. The maximum of these differences divided by 2.\n\n- the distance from the last lantern to l, which is (l - a[-1]) / 2.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no lanterns? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck the initial gap: 0 to 0, so nothing. Then between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThen the end gap is 15-15=0 → 0. So the maximum is 2.5, which matches the first sample output of 2.5.\n\nSecond example input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5].\n\nInitial gap: 2-0 = 2 → 1.0. Then between 2 and 5: 3 → 1.5. Then end gap is 5-5=0. So maximum is 1.5? But the sample output is 2.0. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait what's the sample input?\n\nWait the second input is '2 5\\n2 5'. So the street is length 5. The lanterns are at 2 and 5. So the first lantern is at 2. The initial gap is 2-0 = 2, so d would be 1.0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so 3/2 = 1.5. Then the end gap is 5-5=0. So the maximum is 1.5. But the sample output is 2.0. Wait that's a problem. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample says that with d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], the second covers [3,5]. So the whole street is covered. But according to our calculation, the maximum required d is 1.5. Why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because in this case, the first lantern is at 2. The initial gap is 2 units from 0 to 2. The required d for that is 2/2 = 1.0. But if the first lantern is at 2, then the left end of the street (0) is 2 units away. So the d must be at least 2, because the lantern's coverage is from 2 -d to 2 +d. For the left end (0) to be covered, 2 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ 2. So the initial calculation was wrong. Oh no! So my previous approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's wrong here? Let me think again.\n\nThe initial approach considered the first gap as (a[0] - 0) / 2. But that's only correct if the lantern is at a[0], and the coverage extends to the left. However, if the lantern is at a[0], then the distance from 0 to the lantern is a[0], so the radius needs to be at least a[0] to cover 0. Because the lantern's coverage is from a[0] -d to a[0] +d. So for 0 to be covered, a[0] -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. But that's not possible if the lantern is at a[0], but the first lantern is at a[0], then the distance from 0 to the lantern is a[0]. So the required d for the left end is a[0], not a[0]/2.\n\nWait, that's a mistake in my initial reasoning. Oh no! So my previous approach was wrong.\n\nSo where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine.\n\nThe problem is that the initial approach thought that the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns (after sorting) determines the required d, but that's not considering the ends. For example, if the first lantern is at position x, then the distance from 0 to x is x. The coverage of the lantern must reach 0, which requires that x -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ x. But that's not correct. Wait, the lantern covers points within distance d. So the lantern at x will cover from x -d to x +d. So for 0 to be covered, it must be that x -d ≤ 0 ≤ x +d. Since x is positive, the left side of the street (0) is covered if x -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ x. But that would require d to be at least x, but that's not the case. Wait, for example, if the lantern is at x = 2, and d is 2, then the coverage is from 0 to 4. So 0 is covered. But if d is 1, then the coverage is from 1 to 3. So 0 is not covered. So the required d for the left end is (x - 0) if the first lantern is at x. But that's not correct. Because if the first lantern is at x, then the leftmost point that can be covered is x -d. To have x -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ x. But that would be the case. So the required d for the left end is x (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). But that's not correct. Because if the lantern is at x, and d is x, then the coverage starts at 0. So the left end is covered. However, if there's another lantern to the right, maybe that's not the maximum. So the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at position x. Then the distance from 0 to x is x. The maximum distance between 0 and the lantern is x. So the required d must be at least x. But that's not correct. Because the lantern's coverage can cover 0 if d is x. But if there's another lantern further to the right, perhaps the required d is determined by the gap between the first and second lantern. So the initial approach was wrong.\n\nSo why in the second sample input, the answer is 2.0. Let's see:\n\nSample input 2: n=2, l=5. Lanterns at 2 and 5. So sorted positions are [2,5]. \n\nThe left end is 0. The first lantern is at 2. So the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So the d must be at least 2. Because otherwise, the left end is not covered. But according to the previous approach, the initial gap was (a[0] - 0) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1. Which is wrong. So that's the mistake.\n\nSimilarly, the end of the street is at 5. The last lantern is at 5. So the distance from 5 to 5 is zero, so no problem. But the gap between the two lanterns is 5-2 = 3. The maximum d needed for that gap is 3/2 = 1.5. But the required d for the left end is 2. So the maximum of 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- The required d is the maximum between:\n\n   a) the distance from 0 to the first lantern (a[0]) divided by 1? No, wait. Wait, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. So d must be at least a[0], because the lantern's coverage is up to d distance. So for example, if the first lantern is at 2, then to cover 0, the d must be at least 2. Because 2 - d <= 0 → d >= 2. So the required d for the left end is a[0] (if the first lantern is at a[0]). But then, what if the first lantern is not at 0, but there's a gap between 0 and the first lantern. So the maximum required d for that part is a[0] (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). Similarly for the end: the distance between the last lantern and l is (l - a[-1]), and the required d is that value. \n\nBut then, what about the gaps between consecutive lanterns? For example, between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions x and y (x < y). The maximum distance between them is y - x. The middle point is (x + y)/2. The distance from this point to x is (y - x)/2. So the required d must be at least (y - x)/2. Because that's the maximum distance from either lantern to the middle point. \n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n- Compute the maximum between:\n\n   - the first lantern's position (distance from 0)\n\n   - the last lantern's distance from l (l - a[-1])\n\n   - the maximum (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum of these values.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think again. For the first lantern, the distance from 0 is a[0]. But that's the distance from 0 to the lantern. The lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the radius d must be at least a[0], because the lantern is at a[0], and the distance from the lantern to 0 is a[0]. So d needs to be at least a[0], because the lantern's coverage is up to d. So the radius needs to be at least a[0] to cover 0. Similarly, for the end of the street, the distance between the last lantern and l is (l - a[-1]). So the radius must be at least that value to cover the end.\n\nBut then, what about the gaps between the lanterns? For example, between two lanterns, the maximum distance between them is (y - x). The middle point is (x + y)/2. The distance from this point to x is (y -x)/2. So the required d must be at least (y - x)/2. Because that's the distance from the middle point to the nearest lantern. \n\nSo the correct answer is the maximum of:\n\nmax( a[0], (l - a[-1]), max_gap_between_consecutive_lanterns / 2 )\n\nWait, but in the second example:\n\na[0] is 2. (l - a[-1]) is 5 -5 = 0. The max_gap between consecutive lanterns is 5-2 = 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2, which is correct.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nsorted a is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\na[0] is 0 → 0. (l - a[-1]) is 15 -15 =0. The max gap between consecutive lanterns is 14-9=5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum is 2.5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose the lanterns are at 1 and 3, and l=4. Then:\n\na[0] is 1. So the left end requires d >=1. The last lantern is at 3, so l - a[-1] is 1. So d must be >=1. The max gap between consecutive is 3-1=2. Divided by 2 is 1. So the maximum is 1. So the answer is 1. Which makes sense. Because the left end is 1 unit away from the first lantern, the right end is 1 unit away from the last lantern. The middle between 1 and 3 is 2, which is 1 unit from both. So d=1 is sufficient.\n\nAnother example: lanterns are at 0 and 4, l=5. Then a[0] is 0, so left end is covered. The last lantern is at 4, so l - a[-1] is 1. The gap between 0 and 4 is 4, divided by 2 is 2. So the maximum is 2. But the right end is 5, which is 1 unit away from the last lantern. So the required d is max(2, 1) = 2. Which is correct. Because the coverage of the lantern at 4 would reach up to 4 + 2 = 6, which covers the 5. So yes, d=2 is sufficient.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate three values:\n\n- the distance from 0 to the first lantern (a[0])\n\n- the distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1])\n\n- the maximum (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nThen take the maximum of these three values.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Read n, l, and the list of a_i.\n\n2. Sort the a_i list.\n\n3. Compute the initial distance (a[0] - 0) → but wait, no: the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0], since the first lantern is at a[0]. So the required d is a[0], because the lantern must cover 0. So the initial value is a[0].\n\nBut wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance is 0. So no problem.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's distance to l is l - a[-1].\n\nThen, for the consecutive gaps, compute the maximum (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2.\n\nSo the maximum of these three is the answer.\n\nSo in code:\n\nSort the list.\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   current_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   if current_gap > max_gap:\n\n      max_gap = current_gap\n\nthen, the required d is max( a[0], (l - a[-1]), max_gap / 2 )\n\nWait, but in the second sample input, a[0] is 2, and (l - a[-1]) is 0. So the maximum is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 1 and 3, l=4. Then the a[0] is 1, l - a[-1] is 1. max_gap is 2. So max(1, 1, 2/2=1) → 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if there is only one lantern. Suppose n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5. Then the a[0] is 5 (distance from 0 to lantern), l - a[-1] is 5. The max_gap is 0 (no consecutive pairs). So the maximum of 5, 5, 0 → 5. Which is correct. Because the lantern must cover 0 and 10. The radius needs to be 5.\n\nYes. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo now, the steps are clear. Now, code-wise:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nCompute the first part: first_lantern = a[0], last_lantern = a[-1].\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(first_lantern, l - last_lantern).\n\nThen compute the max_gap between consecutive lanterns. For each i from 1 to n-1, compute a[i] - a[i-1], and track the maximum.\n\nThen, the required d is the maximum between the initial max_d and (max_gap / 2).\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1?\n\nYes, that's handled. For example, if n=1, then the max_gap is zero. So the code would take the max between first_lantern and (l - last_lantern), which is the same as max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, and a = [0,0,0]. Then the first_lantern is 0, last is 0. The max_gap between consecutive is 0. So the initial max_d is max(0, 5-0=5) → 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct because the lanterns are at 0, so the radius must be 5 to reach the end of the street.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and 5. l=5. Then first_lantern is 0, last_lantern is 5. l - last_lantern is 0. The max_gap between them is 5. So the max_gap / 2 is 2.5. The initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is at 2.5, which is 2.5 away from each lantern.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement in Python.\n\nRead input. The input is given as two lines per test case? Or wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line with n and l, next line with n integers. But the sample input shows two cases. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich probably represents two separate test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. But the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read two lines: first line n and l, second line the list of ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps that's part of the example, but the code is supposed to handle one test case. So the code should read two lines, first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, process one test case.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nRead the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nThen compute:\n\nif n == 0: but according to input constraints n >=1.\n\nSo:\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# compute first part: a[0] and l - a[-1]\n\ncurrent_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\n# compute max_gap between consecutive lanterns\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\ncurrent_max = max(current_max, max_gap / 2.0)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(current_max))\n\nWait, but in the second sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting, a is [2,5]. \n\ncurrent_max is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then max_gap is 5-2=3. So max_gap / 2 is 1.5. current_max is max(2, 1.5) → 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the first lantern is at 0, and the last at l. Then the max_gap between them is l - 0, but divided by 2. So for example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the code would compute current_max as max(5, 5) → 5. Then max_gap is 0. So the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the max_gap between consecutive is 5. So max_gap / 2 is 2.5. The current_max is max(0, 0) → 0. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is 5, which is 5 units from 0 and 10. So the radius needs to be 5. Wait wait no. Wait the lanterns are at 0,5,10. The max_gap between consecutive is 5 (5-0=5, 10-5=5). So max_gap / 2 is 2.5. But the distance between 0 and 5 is 5. The middle is at 2.5. Which is covered by the first lantern (distance 2.5) and the second lantern (distance 2.5). So the required d is 2.5. However, the end points are covered by the lanterns. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are at 0 and 10, and l=10. Then the max_gap is 10. So max_gap / 2 is 5. The current_max is max(0, 0) → 0. So answer is 5. Which is correct. Because the middle is 5 units away from each lantern. So d=5 is required.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in code, when n is 1, the for loop for i in range(1, n) would not run, so max_gap remains 0. So current_max is max(a[0], l - a[-1]) → which is correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input, sort the list, compute the initial max, compute the max_gap, then take the maximum between initial max and max_gap / 2.\n\nBut need to make sure that the output is printed with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, for example, 2.5, using format string with .10f, it will show as 2.5000000000.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    max_d = max(max_d, max_gap / 2.0)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first test case has a[0] as 0. So the first part is max(0, 15 - 15 = 0) → 0. Then max_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14). So 5/2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. The code returns 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not sorted? Like the first input example, where the lanterns are given as [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, it becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. So code works.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then max_d is max(0, 1-0=1) → 1. max_gap is 0. So answer is 1.0.\n\nCase 2: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then max_d is max(1, 0) → 1. Answer is 1.0.\n\nCase 3: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. max_gap is 10. So 10/2=5. So answer is 5.0.\n\nCase 4: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. max_gap is 5. 5/2=2.5. Answer 2.5.\n\nCase 5: n=2, l=5, a=[0, 5]. max_d is 0, max_gap is 5 → 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nBut in that case, the entire street is covered by the two lanterns. Because each lantern covers up to 2.5. So 0-2.5 and 5-2.5=2.5. So the coverage is from 0-2.5 and 2.5-5. So the entire street is covered. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0, 3]. Then:\n\nmax_d is max(0, 5-3=2). So 2. The max_gap is 3-0=3. 3/2=1.5. So the maximum is 2. So answer is 2.0.\n\nWhich is correct. Because the lantern at 3 must cover the end of the street (distance 2). The gap between 0 and 3 is 3. The middle is 1.5 away from each. So d=1.5. But the end requires d=2. So answer is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the maximum gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: This allows us to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial Distances**: Determine the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: Compute the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns after sorting. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half of this maximum gap.\n4. **Determine the Result**: The result is the maximum value among the distances calculated in steps 2 and 3.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    max_d = max(max_d, max_gap / 2.0)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Distances Calculation**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are computed. These distances are critical because they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n4. **Consecutive Gaps Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions, the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is determined. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half of this maximum gap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value between the initial distances and half of the maximum gap, ensuring that all parts of the street are illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the entire street is covered with the minimum possible radius, achieving the desired precision.",
