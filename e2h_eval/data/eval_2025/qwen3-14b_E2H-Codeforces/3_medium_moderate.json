Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is the largest gap between two adjacent lanterns. But wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if a lantern is at the start (0), then the first part is covered up to some point. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo here's the plan: \n\nSort the lantern positions. Then, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each gap between two adjacent lanterns, the maximum distance from the middle of that gap to either end would be half of the gap's size. Because if the gap is between a and b, then the middle point is (a + b)/2. The distance from this middle point to either a or b is (b - a)/2. So the required d for this gap is (b - a)/2. However, if there's a gap between the start of the street and the first lantern, then that's a gap of (a1 - 0). Similarly for the end of the street and the last lantern. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, suppose the first lantern is at position a1. Then the area from 0 to a1 is not covered unless the lantern's radius covers it. So the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The required radius for that area is a1, because the lantern at a1 can cover up to a1 - d. Wait, no. Wait the lantern's coverage is from ai -d to ai +d. So for the street to be covered from 0 to l, all points must be within some [ai -d, ai +d]. \n\nSo for the left end, the first lantern's position is a1. The leftmost point is 0. The lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the distance between a1 and 0 must be <=d. So d must be at least a1. Similarly, for the right end, the last lantern's position is an. The distance between an and l must be <=d. So d must be at least l - an. \n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, say a and b (sorted order), the maximum distance between them is (b - a). The worst case is that there's a point in the middle of the gap that is farthest from both. So the maximum distance between two adjacent lanterns is (b -a). The minimal d required for this gap is (b -a)/2. Because if you have two lanterns, the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from this point to either lantern is (b -a)/2. So that's the maximum required d for that gap. \n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if there's a gap between 0 and first lantern)\n- the last lantern's position (if there's a gap between last lantern and l)\n- the maximum of (b -a)/2 for all consecutive pairs in the sorted list.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the first lantern's position. The initial gap is a[0] - 0. So the required d for that is a[0].\n3. Check the last lantern's position. The gap is l - a[-1], required d is l - a[-1].\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap (current - previous), then divide by 2. Take the maximum of these values.\n5. The answer is the maximum of all these three values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the first and last steps are same. For example, if the lantern is at position a. Then the required d is max(a, l -a). Because the lantern's coverage has to reach 0 and l. So the maximum of those two.\n\nYes. So the algorithm should handle that.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, the lanterns are [2,5]. \n\nFirst check the initial gap: 2 - 0 = 2. So required d for that is 2. \n\nThen the last gap: 5 -5 = 0. So required d is 0. \n\nThen the consecutive gap between 2 and 5: 5-2=3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. \n\nThe maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: first example:\n\nInput is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. \n\nCheck first gap: 0 - 0 is 0. So required d is 0. \n\nLast gap is 15 -15 = 0. \n\nNow the consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample.\n\nSo yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of ai.\n- Compute the maximum of (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 for all i from 1 to n-1.\n- Also compute the first part (a[0] - 0) and the last part (l - a[-1]).\n- The answer is the maximum of those three.\n\nWait, but for the first part, it's a[0] - 0. But the required d for that is a[0], since the lantern at a[0] can cover from a[0] -d to a[0] +d. To cover 0, we need a[0] -d ≤0 → d ≥ a[0]. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute initial_max = a[0]\n\nend_max = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current = gap / 2\n\n   if current > max_gap:\n\n       max_gap = current\n\nthen the answer is max(initial_max, end_max, max_gap)\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? No, n is at least 1 according to input constraints (n ≥1).\n\nSo for example, when n=1, then initial_max is a[0], end_max is l -a[0], and max_gap is 0. So the answer is max(a[0], l -a[0]).\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to read input. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line is n and l. Second line is n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another input line is 2 5 followed by 2 5. But in the problem statement, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code should read one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Probably, the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code should process a single test case. But perhaps the problem is that the user provided two examples. So the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two test cases. For example, the first input is for the first test case, and the second is for the second test case. But the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases? Or maybe the sample input is presented as two separate cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one case.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code should read two test cases. But that's not clear. However, looking at the problem's original description, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code should read one. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. Wait, but in the problem statement's input description, it's not mentioned. So perhaps the sample input is written with two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. \n\nBut looking at the problem's original input format, the code should read one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as two test cases, but the code should read one. However, the user's input may have multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So the code should process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written with two test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. \n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from standard input, which for the programming competition problem would be one test case. Therefore, the code should process one test case. \n\nSo the code will read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i. \n\nSo, for the code, in Python:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and l. Then read the next line, split into list of a_i. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as two lines. So for example, in the first sample input, the first line is '7 15', the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo the code will process that. \n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial_max = a[0]\n\nend_max = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = current\n\nresult = max( initial_max, end_max, max_gap )\n\nPrint result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial_max is 0? For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then initial_max is 0. So the required d for that part is 0. \n\nYes.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nBut need to make sure that the list is sorted.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l. For example:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\na.sort()\n\nThen compute initial_max = a[0]\n\nend_max = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = current\n\nresult = max( initial_max, end_max, max_gap )\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the sorted a is [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]. initial_max is 0, end_max is 0. The max_gap is 5/2 = 2.5. So the result is 2.5. Correct.\n\nIn the second sample input, sorted a is [2,5]. initial_max is 2, end_max is 0. The max_gap is (5-2)/2=1.5. So the max is 2.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. initial_max is 3, end_max is 5-3=2. So result is max(3,2, 0) = 3.0. Which is correct. Because the lantern is at 3, so the radius needs to be 3 to cover 0, and 2 to cover 5. So maximum is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[0]. Then initial_max is 0, end_max is 5-0=5. So the result is 5.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[2, 8]. initial_max is 2, end_max is 10-8=2. The gap between 2 and 8 is 6, divided by 2 is 3. So result is max(2, 2, 3) = 3. So the answer is 3.0. Which is correct. Because the middle of 2 and 8 is 5, which is 3 units away from both. So the radius needs to be 3.0.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, code. Also, note that in Python, when you print, you need to format it with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string as .10f.\n\nBut what about when the result is an integer? For example, in the second sample, the output is 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead a list.\n\nSort.\n\nCompute initial_max, end_max, max_gap.\n\nTake maximum of those three.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. So for example, when the gap is even or odd, it's handled properly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check the first part\nfirst_part = a[0]\n# Check the last part\nlast_part = l - a[-1]\n\n# Check the gaps between lanterns\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nresult = max(first_part, last_part, max_d)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nWait, but what if the first_part is 0? For example, when a[0] is 0, then first_part is 0. Which is correct. Because the lantern at 0 can cover up to d. So for the first part, the required d is a[0] (since 0 is the start of the street). So the code is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nfirst_part is 0, last_part is 15-15=0. The gaps between consecutive elements are:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nmax_d is 2.5. So result is max(0, 0, 2.5) → 2.5. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nfirst_part is 2, last_part is 5-5=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So result is max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. first_part is 3, last_part is 5-3=2. max_d is 0. So result is 3.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. first_part is 0, last_part is 0. The gaps between 0 and 5: 5/2=2.5, between 5 and 10: 5/2=2.5. So result is max(0,0,2.5) → 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. first_part is 0, last_part is 0. gaps between 0-3: 1.5, between 3-10: 7/2=3.5. So result is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,0]. Then sorted a is [0,0,0]. first_part is 0, last_part is 5-0=5. The gaps between consecutive elements are 0, 0. So max_d is 0. So result is max(0,5,0) → 5.0. Which is correct. Because the lanterns are all at 0, so the radius must cover from 0 to 5. So d must be 5.0.\n\nAnother edge case: l=0? But according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then first_part is 0, last_part is 1-0=1. So result is 1.0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then first_part is 1, last_part is 0. So result is 1.0.\n\nSo the code handles all these.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the maximum distance between them. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half the distance between the two lanterns, as the worst-case scenario is the midpoint of the gap.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern)\nfirst_part = a[0]\n# Check the last part (distance from last lantern to l)\nlast_part = l - a[-1]\n\n# Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nresult = max(first_part, last_part, max_d)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of consecutive gaps.\n2. **Initial and Final Checks**: The distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns are considered as these areas might require the largest radius.\n3. **Consecutive Gaps**: By iterating through the sorted lantern positions, we calculate the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The radius needed to cover this gap is half the size of the gap.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is determined by taking the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with the minimum radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including when there is only one lantern or when lanterns are positioned at the ends of the street. The complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it efficient for the given constraints.",
