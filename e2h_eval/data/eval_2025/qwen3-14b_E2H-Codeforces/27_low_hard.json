On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. The goal is to choose the best interval to reverse so that when we reverse it, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the LNDS is. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS would be the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. For example, if the array is [1,1,2,2], the LNDS is 4. If there are some 1s followed by some 2s, that's the best case.\n\nThe challenge here is to find which reversal of a subarray would maximize this LNDS. Let's think about how reversing a subarray affects the sequence.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. The brute force approach would be to try all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each, and take the maximum. However, since n can be up to 2000, the number of intervals is O(n²) = around 4 million. For each of these, computing the LNDS would take O(n) time (since the array is small). So total time would be O(n³) which for n=2000 is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the original array and how reversing a subarray affects the LNDS.\n\nSince the original array has only 1s and 2s, maybe we can find a way to model the optimal reversal without checking every possibility.\n\nLet me think: the LNDS of the original array is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if they are in order. But when you reverse a subarray, you can potentially fix some transitions between 1s and 2s.\n\nFor example, consider the original array [1, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS is 3 (like 1, 2, 2 or 1, 1, 2). But if we reverse positions 2-3, we get [1, 1, 2, 2], which gives LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the key idea here is that reversing a subarray that contains a transition from 2 to 1 (i.e., a place where a 2 is followed by a 1) might help to merge those into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how to find which reversal will give the maximum benefit?\n\nLet me think about the original array. The LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s, but also their arrangement. The maximum possible LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the total number of elements, if they are non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be calculated as follows: the maximum number of 1s before the first 2, then all the 2s. Or maybe it's the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, but that's not right.\n\nWait, no. For example, the array [1,2,1,2] has 2 1s and 2 2s. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc). So the maximum possible LNDS is not simply the count of 1s or 2s. It depends on the order.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you can possibly eliminate some transitions from 2 to 1. For example, if there's a segment with a 2 followed by a 1, reversing that segment would turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is better for the LNDS.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is one that eliminates the most 2→1 transitions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the original array's structure. Let's say that the original array has some number of 1s and 2s. The maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is going to be equal to the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array, but that's not necessarily true. Because reversing a subarray could change the number of such transitions.\n\nWait, the LNDS for an array of 1s and 2s is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence consisting of 1s and 2s. The optimal approach involves analyzing the transitions between 1s and 2s and finding the best subarray reversal to minimize the number of 2→1 transitions, which are detrimental to the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Transitions**: In a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is maximized when there are fewer transitions from 2 to 1. Each such transition reduces the potential length of the LNDS.\n2. **Count Transitions**: First, count the number of 2→1 transitions in the original sequence.\n3. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, determine how many 2→1 transitions can be eliminated. The optimal reversal is the one that eliminates the most such transitions.\n4. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: The maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the minimum number of 2→1 transitions after the optimal reversal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Count the number of 2->1 transitions in the original array\n    transitions = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n            transitions += 1\n    \n    max_remove = 0\n    # Precompute prefix counts of 2's and suffix counts of 1's\n    prefix_2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_2[i + 1] = prefix_2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_1[i] = suffix_1[i + 1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    # Now iterate over all possible intervals [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # The subarray from l to r (0-based), inclusive\n            # When reversed, check how many 2->1 transitions are removed\n            # Original transitions within [l, r] that are 2->1\n            original_in = 0\n            for i in range(l, r):\n                if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n                    original_in += 1\n            \n            # Also consider transitions between l-1 and l, and r and r+1\n            # Check if the reversal affects these\n            left_transition = 0\n            if l > 0:\n                if a[l - 1] == 2 and a[l] == 1:\n                    left_transition = 1\n            right_transition = 0\n            if r < n - 1:\n                if a[r] == 2 and a[r + 1] == 1:\n                    right_transition = 1\n            \n            # After reversing, the new transitions at the boundaries\n            new_left = 0\n            if l > 0:\n                if a[l - 1] == 2 and a[r] == 1:\n                    new_left = 1\n            new_right = 0\n            if r < n - 1:\n                if a[l] == 2 and a[r + 1] == 1:\n                    new_right = 1\n            \n            # The number of transitions removed is original_in + left_transition + right_transition\n            # Minus (new_left + new_right)\n            total_removed = original_in + left_transition + right_transition - new_left - new_right\n            \n            max_remove = max(max_remove, total_removed)\n    \n    max_lnds = n - (transitions - max_remove)\n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Count Transitions**: The code first counts the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays help efficiently compute the number of 2s and 1s in any subarray.\n3. **Evaluate Subarrays**: For each possible subarray reversal, the code calculates how many 2→1 transitions are eliminated by considering both internal and boundary transitions.\n4. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: The maximum possible LNDS is derived by subtracting the minimum number of remaining 2→1 transitions from the total number of elements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal subarray reversal to maximize the LNDS, leveraging prefix and suffix arrays for quick calculations.",
