And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day window, I need to compute the average of those days and then find the average of all those averages.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the average is the sum of all the weeks' total divided by the number of weeks. Because for each week, the average is (sum of k days)/k. Then the overall average is the sum of all those averages divided by the number of weeks. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says: the answer is the average of all weeks. So each week contributes an average, and we need the average of all those averages.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the note: third example has 8 days and k=2. So there are 7 weeks. Each week is two days. The sum of each week's average is (1+2)/2 + (2+4)/2 + ... etc. Then the total sum of these averages divided by 7 is the answer. But the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait, no. Wait the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. But that would be the average of the sums. But the problem says that the average is the average of the averages. Wait, but the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ...\". Let's see that example. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The averages are 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. Which is 9/2. But according to the sample input, the output is 9.000... So wait, that's conflicting. Wait the first sample input is 3 2 and the array [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... So what's happening here?\n\nWait the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weeks. But in the example, the weeks are two weeks. The first week's sum is 3+4=7, the second is 4+7=11. The average of the sums would be (7+11)/2 = 9. Which is what the sample output shows. So why is that the case? Because the problem says that the average is the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. Wait, but the problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, the average is sum of the week divided by k. Then the overall average is the average of those values. Which would be (sum of all weeks' sum /k) divided by the number of weeks. Which equals (total sum of all weeks' sum) / (k * number of weeks). But the sample shows that the output is 9.0, which is the sum of the weeks divided by the number of weeks. So that suggests that the problem is actually asking for the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. But that contradicts the problem statement. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the sample input for that case would be 3 2 and the array [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... So according to the example, the answer is (7 + 11)/2 = 9. Which is the average of the sum of each week. But why? Because the problem says that the average is the average of the average per week. So that would be ( (7/2) + (11/2) ) / 2 = (18/2)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9. So clearly, the problem is not asking for the average of the averages. It's asking for the average of the sums of each week. Because the sample output is 9, which is the average of the sum of each week.\n\nSo the problem's description must have a mistake. Wait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut the sample input given in the first example is '3 2\\n3 4 7' and the output is '9.0000000000'. So according to that example, the answer is the average of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each `k`-day window and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each `k`-day window. This avoids recalculating the sum from scratch for each window, which would be inefficient.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the first `k` days.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, subtract the element that is sliding out of the window and add the new element that is sliding into the window. This allows us to maintain the current window sum in constant time.\n4. **Average Calculation**: After computing the sum of all valid windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].strip().split()))\n        total_sum = 0\n        # Calculate the sum of the first window\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        # Slide the window\n        for i in range(k, n):\n            current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        # Compute the average\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n        # Print with 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, read the values of `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week), followed by the list of sleep times.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the first `k` days is computed. Subsequent window sums are calculated by adjusting the previous sum with the new element entering the window and the element leaving the window.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid windows to get the average sleep time per week, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently in linear time, O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
