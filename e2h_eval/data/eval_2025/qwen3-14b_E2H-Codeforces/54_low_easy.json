Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall some geometry here. In a regular polygon with n sides, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides. But the problem here is about choosing three vertices such that the angle at v2 is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v3. So maybe I need to think about the central angles or something else.\n\nWait, let's think about the regular polygon. For any three vertices v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex of the angle, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick v2 and then two adjacent vertices, the angle would be the interior angle. But if you take vertices further away, the angle changes.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose we have a regular polygon. Let's fix v2 as a vertex. Then, for any two other vertices v1 and v3, the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between them. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle is the interior angle. But if there are k steps between v2 and v1, and m steps between v2 and v3, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of sides between the points. Let me consider that in a regular polygon, the angle formed at v2 by two other vertices depends on how many edges lie between them along the perimeter. For example, in a regular pentagon (5 sides), if you pick three consecutive vertices, the angle at the middle one is the interior angle. But if you pick vertices that are two steps apart, like v1, v2, v4, then the angle at v2 would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon. Let me try to derive this.\n\nIn a regular polygon, all vertices lie on a circle. So the regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. So, the angle at v2 (the vertex) between v1 and v3 can be considered as an inscribed angle. Wait, but inscribed angles depend on the arc they subtend. For example, the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Wait, the central angle for an arc between two points is twice the inscribed angle subtended by that arc. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is θ degrees, then the inscribed angle at v2 would be θ/2. Wait, but that's only if the angle is formed by points on the circumference. Hmm.\n\nBut in our case, the angle is formed by three points on the polygon. Let me think again. Suppose v1, v2, v3 are three vertices of the regular polygon. The angle at v2 is determined by the arcs between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the triangle formed by these three points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3. For example, suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k edges when moving clockwise around the polygon. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 would be k * (360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that arc? No, because if v2 is on the circumference, then the inscribed angle would be half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the arc that is opposite to the angle. For example, if the three points are v1, v2, v3 arranged such that the angle is at v2, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 would be the arc that the angle subtends. Then, the measure of that arc would be equal to twice the angle at v2. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nSo, let's suppose that the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is x degrees. Then the angle at v2 would be x/2 degrees. But since the polygon is regular, each side corresponds to an arc of 360/n degrees.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest angle using mathematical insights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regular Polygon Geometry**: In a regular polygon with `n` sides, each interior angle can be derived from the number of sides. However, for any three vertices forming an angle at one vertex, the angle depends on the arc subtended by the opposite side.\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the angle at a vertex formed by two other vertices depends on the arc length between those vertices. This angle can be computed based on the number of steps (edges) between the vertices.\n3. **Closest Angle Calculation**: For each possible number of steps between vertices, compute the corresponding angle and determine which one is closest to the given angle `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the angle for k steps between v1 and v3\n    # The angle at v2 is (k * 180 / n) degrees\n    # We want to find k such that this angle is closest to a\n    # But since the angle must be less than 180, k can be from 1 to n-2\n    # Because for k steps, the arc is k * (360/n), so the angle at v2 is half of that, which is 180*k/n\n    \n    # However, when k is from 1 to n-2, the angle is (k * 180) / n\n    # Wait, let's think again:\n    # The arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is k * (360/n) degrees\n    # The angle at v2 is half of that arc: (k * 180)/n\n    # So the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k ranges from 1 to n-2\n    # Because if k is n-1, then it's the same as k=1 on the other side, etc.\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    \n    for k in range(1, n - 1):\n        angle = (k * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k?
