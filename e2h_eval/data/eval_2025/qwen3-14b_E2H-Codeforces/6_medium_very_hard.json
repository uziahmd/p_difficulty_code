Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nSo, the input is n vouchers, each with li, ri, costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i≠j) such that:\n\n- Their durations sum to x. So duration_i + duration_j = x.\n- They don't overlap. Which means either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nAnd find the minimal sum of their costs.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. For each voucher, we can compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we need to find another voucher whose duration is (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut how do we efficiently check for that?\n\nLet me think. Let's say for each voucher, we check if there exists a voucher with duration d = x - duration_i. Then, among those vouchers with duration d, find the one that doesn't overlap with the current voucher and has the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to efficiently find those vouchers?\n\nThe problem is that for each voucher, we need to check for vouchers with a specific duration, and also not overlapping.\n\nSo maybe we can pre-process vouchers by their duration. Like, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look up in the dictionary for the required duration (x - duration_i), and then check for non-overlapping ones.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all vouchers with duration d could be O(n^2) in the worst case, which isn't feasible for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo we need a way to find, for a given voucher, the minimal cost voucher with duration d that ends before the current voucher starts, or starts after the current voucher ends.\n\nWait, but how can we do that efficiently?\n\nLet's think for each duration d, we can have some data structures that allow us to quickly find the minimal cost voucher that ends before a certain time, or starts after a certain time.\n\nFor example, suppose we have all vouchers of duration d. Let's say we have them sorted by their end time. Then, for a given voucher with start time l and end time r, we need to find vouchers in duration d that end before l. Because if a voucher ends before l, then the current voucher starts after that voucher ends, so they don't overlap.\n\nSimilarly, we can find vouchers in duration d that start after r. Because then, the current voucher ends before that voucher starts.\n\nSo for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time. Wait, but maybe we can just have one sorted list by end time, and for the start time, perhaps we can have another sorted list?\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can store two things:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by their end time. For each voucher, when looking for vouchers that end before l_i (the start of the current voucher), we can perform a binary search on this list to find the earliest end time that is less than l_i. Then, among all such vouchers, find the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers that start after r_i (the end of the current voucher), we can have a list sorted by their start time, and find the earliest start time greater than r_i, and then find the minimum cost among those.\n\nBut how do we store the minimum cost for these ranges?\n\nAh, right. For each duration d, we can pre-process the vouchers with that duration. Let's take for example, the vouchers with duration d. For each of them, we can sort them by their end time. Then, for each position in this sorted list, we can keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. Similarly, for start time.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nFor each duration d, we have two sorted lists:\n\n1. Sorted by end time. And for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost up to that index. So that when we want to find the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain value, we can find the latest end time that is <= that value, and then get the min cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers sorted by start time, we can have a prefix min array.\n\nBut how to handle both cases (end before l_i, and start after r_i)?\n\nLet me think. For a voucher i with duration di, we need to find vouchers j with duration dj = x - di. Let's call this target duration as d = x - di. So, for each voucher i, we check if d is present in our duration map. If yes, then for all vouchers j with duration d, check if they don't overlap with voucher i.\n\nTo check for non-overlapping, we can split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: voucher j ends before voucher i starts. So rj < li.\n\nCase 2: voucher j starts after voucher i ends. So lj > ri.\n\nSo for each voucher i, and for the target duration d, we need to find the minimum cost in vouchers of duration d that satisfy either case 1 or case 2.\n\nSo for each d, we can have:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by end time. For case 1, we can find the maximum end time that is less than li. Then, among all vouchers up to that end time, the minimum cost.\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by start time. For case 2, we can find the minimum start time that is greater than ri. Then, among all vouchers from that start time onwards, the minimum cost.\n\nSo for each d, we can pre-process these sorted lists and their prefix/suffix minima.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFor example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end time. Let's call this list end_sorted. Also, a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[k] is the minimum cost among the first k+1 elements in end_sorted.\n\nSimilarly, for start_sorted, sorted by start time, and a prefix_min array for that.\n\nWait, but for case 1, we need to find all vouchers in end_sorted with end_time < li. The earliest possible end times. So the maximum end time that is less than li. Once we find the index where end_sorted[i] is the largest end time less than li, then the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimum cost for vouchers that end before li.\n\nFor case 2, we need vouchers that start after ri. So in start_sorted, we can find the first element with start_time > ri. All elements from that index onwards are candidates. The minimum cost among them would be the suffix minima starting from that index.\n\nSo for each duration d, we need:\n\n- end_sorted list (sorted by end time) and a prefix_min array.\n\n- start_sorted list (sorted by start time) and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to build these?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration. Let's call this a dictionary: duration_dict[d] = list of vouchers.\n\n2. For each duration d in duration_dict, process the list to create:\n\n   a. end_sorted: sorted by end time (ri). Also, create a prefix_min array for this list. For each index i in end_sorted, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost).\n\n   b. start_sorted: sorted by start time (li). Also, create a suffix_min array for this list. For each index i in start_sorted, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_sorted[i].cost). Or maybe we can compute it from the end.\n\n3. For each voucher i in the original list:\n\n   a. Compute its duration di = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b. Compute d = x - di. If d is not present in duration_dict, skip.\n\n   c. Else, for the vouchers in duration_dict[d], check for case 1 and case 2.\n\n      i. Case 1: find vouchers in duration_dict[d] that end before li. Use end_sorted for d. Perform a binary search to find the largest end time <= li-1. If such exists, get the min cost from prefix_min.\n\n      ii. Case 2: find vouchers in duration_dict[d] that start after ri. Use start_sorted for d. Perform a binary search to find the first start time >= ri+1. If such exists, get the min cost from suffix_min.\n\n   d. Take the minimum between case1 and case2, and update the global answer.\n\nBut wait, for each voucher i, we need to check both cases. Also, note that the voucher j can't be the same as voucher i. But since we are considering all vouchers in duration_dict[d], which includes all vouchers except i? Wait, no. Because for a voucher i, when we check for duration d, which is x - di, if d equals di, then we need to make sure that we are not selecting the same voucher. However, in this case, the problem requires i≠j. So, for example, if di is 2 and x is 4, then d is 2. So, when processing voucher i, we need to check if there's another voucher j with duration 2 that doesn't overlap with i. However, if the duration_dict[d] contains voucher i itself, then when looking for vouchers j, we need to exclude i. But how?\n\nThis complicates things. Because when we have a voucher i with duration di, and d = x - di = di, then we need to find another voucher j with duration di, which is not i, and that doesn't overlap with i.\n\nSo, during the processing of voucher i, when d equals di, we need to make sure that in the case where we find a voucher j that is the same as i, we ignore it.\n\nBut how can we do that? For example, if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and same li and ri, but different cost. But even if there's only one voucher with that duration, and we are considering it for d=di, then when we look for j, we can't use i itself.\n\nSo, for the case where d is equal to di, we need to check if there are other vouchers in the duration_dict[d] that are not i.\n\nBut how to handle this efficiently?\n\nOne approach is, for each voucher i, when checking the duration d, if d is equal to di, then when we process the case1 and case2, we need to exclude the voucher i itself. But how can we do that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have the list of vouchers, and when processing voucher i, when d is equal to di, we can check if there are other vouchers in the list, and then proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search steps, when checking for the min cost, we can check if the voucher i is present in the list. But that would be expensive.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher i, when d is equal to di, we can check if the list of vouchers in duration_dict[d] has at least two entries, and then proceed. But that's not sufficient because even if there are multiple entries, the voucher i might be the only one that satisfies the non-overlapping condition.\n\nHmm. This seems tricky. Let's think of an example. Suppose there is a voucher i with duration d, and another voucher j with same duration d. When processing voucher i, we need to check if j is non-overlapping with i. But if j is in the same duration group, then during the processing of i, when looking for vouchers in duration d, we need to make sure that j is considered, but not i itself.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nMaybe during the processing of voucher i, when we look for vouchers in duration_dict[d], we can check if the voucher i is part of that group (which would be true if d = di). Then, when we find the minimum cost in the group, we need to make sure that the minimum is not from voucher i itself. But how?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have the list of vouchers sorted, and for each voucher in that list, we can have the min cost excluding that voucher. But that seems impossible because for each voucher, the exclusion is different.\n\nAlternatively, when processing voucher i, and d is di, then during the case1 and case2 checks, when we find the minimum cost, we can check if the voucher i is the only one in the group. If not, then the minimum cost may include voucher i. But in that case, we need to check if the minimum is achieved by another voucher.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, if the group has multiple vouchers, and the min cost is achieved by voucher i, but there's another voucher with same min cost. Then it's okay. Otherwise, if the min is only achieved by voucher i, then we need to find the next min.\n\nThis seems too complicated for the time being. Maybe there's a way to avoid this problem. Let's think: if the voucher i is in the duration group d, then when we process it, we can check if there's any other voucher in the group that doesn't overlap with it. So, during the processing of voucher i, when we look for vouchers in duration d, we can check if the voucher j is not i. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher i, when checking for vouchers in duration d, we can collect all possible candidates and then check if any of them is not i. But that would require checking all candidates, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut given that the problem requires that i and j are different vouchers, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have a list that includes all vouchers, and during the processing, when we find the min cost, we can check if that voucher is i. If it is, then we need to find the next min cost. However, how to do that?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. Perhaps there's a better way. Let's think about the following: for each voucher i, when checking for vouchers j in duration d, we can consider all vouchers in that duration. Even if the voucher j is i itself, but then the code will check if the two vouchers are non-overlapping. But since voucher j is i, then the two vouchers would overlap (they are the same), so they can't be selected. Thus, during the case1 and case2 processing, even if the voucher j is i, the code will not select it, because the conditions are not met.\n\nWait! Because if voucher j is i, then for case1, we have rj < li. But since j is i, rj is ri, and li is li. So ri < li? That's only possible if ri < li, but ri >= li because the voucher's duration is ri - li +1. So ri >= li. So ri < li is impossible. Therefore, for case1, j can't be i. Similarly for case2, lj > ri. But lj is li, and ri is ri. So li > ri? Again, ri >= li. So that's impossible. Therefore, even if j is i, the conditions for case1 and case2 are not satisfied. Therefore, when we process the vouchers in duration_dict[d], including voucher i itself, the code will automatically not select it, because the conditions for non-overlapping are not met. Therefore, we don't need to worry about excluding voucher i from the group.\n\nThat's a relief! Because that means even if the voucher i is in the duration group, when we check for case1 and case2, the voucher i itself will not be considered because it can't satisfy the non-overlapping condition. Therefore, during the processing, we can safely include all vouchers in the duration group, including i itself, and the code will automatically not select it.\n\nThat's a great insight. So, the code can proceed without worrying about that. Because when j is i, the two vouchers are the same, and their intervals are overlapping, so they can't be selected.\n\nTherefore, the steps can proceed as outlined earlier.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary grouped by their duration. For each duration d, we have a list of vouchers.\n\n- For each duration d in the dictionary, sort the vouchers in two ways:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (ri). And for this list, compute a prefix_min array. For each index i, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from vouchers[0..i].\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (li). And for this list, compute a suffix_min array. For each index i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from vouchers[i..end].\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i in the original list:\n\n   Compute di = ri - li + 1.\n\n   Compute d = x - di.\n\n   If d is not in the duration_dict, skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Check for case1 and case2.\n\n      For case1: find all vouchers in duration_dict[d] with end_time < li.\n\n         To do this, take the end_sorted list for d, and find the largest end time that is less than li. Then, the min cost is prefix_min up to that index.\n\n      For case2: find all vouchers in duration_dict[d] with start_time > ri.\n\n         Take the start_sorted list for d, find the first start time that is greater than ri. Then, the min cost is the suffix_min from that index.\n\n      Take the min between case1 and case2, and update the global answer.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\nImplementing the binary search for case1 and case2.\n\nNow, let's think about the binary search.\n\nFor case1:\n\nWe have a list end_sorted, which is sorted in increasing order of end time. We need to find the largest end time that is <= li-1. Because the voucher j must end before li (so that ri_j < li).\n\nSo, we can perform a binary search on the end_sorted list for the value li-1. The upper bound would be the insertion point, and the index before that would be the last element <= li-1.\n\nIf there are such elements, then we take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly for case2:\n\nWe have a list start_sorted, sorted in increasing order of start time. We need to find the first start time that is >= ri + 1. Because lj must be > ri (so that lj > ri).\n\nSo, we can perform a binary search for the value ri + 1. The first occurrence where start >= ri+1 is found. All elements from that index onwards are candidates. The suffix_min for that index gives the minimum cost in that range.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search for these cases.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can be used. For case1, using bisect_right to find the insertion point of li-1 in the end_sorted list. The insertion point gives the number of elements <= li-1. So if the insertion point is k, then there are k elements. If k is zero, then no such elements. Else, the prefix_min[k-1] is the min cost.\n\nFor case2, using bisect_left to find the insertion point of ri+1 in the start_sorted list. The insertion point gives the first element >= ri+1. So, if the insertion point is k, then all elements from k to end are valid. If k is beyond the length of the list, then no elements. Else, the suffix_min[k] is the min cost in that range.\n\nBut how to compute the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nFor the end_sorted list:\n\nprefix_min is an array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from end_sorted[0] to end_sorted[i].\n\nSimilarly, for the start_sorted list:\n\nsuffix_min is an array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from start_sorted[i] to start_sorted[-1].\n\nSo, for example, for the end_sorted list, we can compute prefix_min as follows:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(end_sorted)\nprefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len(end_sorted)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted list:\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(start_sorted)\nsuffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1].cost\nfor i in len(start_sorted)-2 downto 0:\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_sorted[i].cost)\n\nOnce these arrays are built, we can quickly get the min cost for the ranges.\n\nNow, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines of li, ri, costi.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute its duration, and group them into a dictionary.\n\nThen, for each duration d in the dictionary, process the vouchers as follows:\n\n   Sort the vouchers by end time, compute prefix_min.\n\n   Sort the vouchers by start time, compute suffix_min.\n\nStore these in the duration_dict as additional data.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   compute di = ri - li + 1\n\n   d = x - di\n\n   if d not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      process case1 and case2.\n\nNow, for case1:\n\n   end_sorted = duration_dict[d]['end_sorted']\n\n   li_current = li of current voucher.\n\n   target_end = li_current - 1\n\n   using bisect.bisect_right on end_sorted's end times, find the insertion point.\n\n   if insertion_point > 0:\n\n      min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[insertion_point - 1]\n\n   else:\n\n      min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\nSimilarly for case2:\n\n   start_sorted = duration_dict[d]['start_sorted']\n\n   target_start = ri_current + 1\n\n   using bisect.bisect_left on start_sorted's start times, find insertion_point.\n\n   if insertion_point < len(start_sorted):\n\n      min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[insertion_point]\n\n   else:\n\n      min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\nThen, the current candidate is min(min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2). If it's not infinity, compare with the global answer.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle all these steps.\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers in the duration_dict? For example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nduration_dict[d] = {\n    'end_sorted': list of vouchers sorted by end time,\n    'prefix_min': list of min costs,\n    'start_sorted': list of vouchers sorted by start time,\n    'suffix_min': list of min costs,\n}\n\nBut how to store the end times and start times for binary search?\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- end_list: a list of end times (ri) of the vouchers sorted.\n\n- end_prefix_min: the prefix min array.\n\nSimilarly, for start_list: list of start times (li) sorted.\n\nstart_suffix_min: the suffix min array.\n\nBut then, how to get the corresponding cost? Because for the end_list, the end times are sorted, but we need to know the cost of each voucher in that list.\n\nSo, perhaps for the end_sorted list, we can store tuples (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time. Then, the prefix_min array is built based on the cost.\n\nSame for the start_sorted list, storing tuples (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nFor a duration d, the vouchers are stored as:\n\nend_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nThen, end_list would be [v.ri for v in end_sorted]\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to find the insertion point for li_current - 1 in the end_list.\n\nBut in Python, we can use the bisect module on a list. So, for the end_list, we can have a list of the end times, sorted. Then, for the binary search, we can pass this list to bisect.\n\nBut then, for the prefix_min array, we need to have the min cost up to each index.\n\nSo, the code for building the end_sorted and prefix_min would be:\n\nvouchers_for_d = list of vouchers with duration d.\n\nend_sorted = sorted(vouchers_for_d, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nend_list = [v.ri for v in end_sorted]\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(end_sorted)\n\nprefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(end_sorted)-1:\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted.\n\nSo, during the processing for case1, we can get the end_list for duration d, and perform bisect on that.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach voucher can be represented as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Or perhaps as a class. But for simplicity, tuples are easier.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list()\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, group by duration:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, process the vouchers:\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    end_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1]) # sort by ri\n\n    end_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(end_sorted)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i][2] )\n\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n\n    start_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0]) # sort by li\n\n    start_list = [x[0] for x in start_sorted]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], start_sorted[i][2] )\n\n    # store these in the duration_dict, perhaps as a tuple or separate entries.\n\nBut how to store these? Since we can't modify the defaultdict in place, perhaps we need to create another structure. For example, for each duration d, we can store:\n\nduration_info = {\n\n    'end_list': end_list,\n\n    'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n    'start_list': start_list,\n\n    'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n}\n\nBut how to store this in the duration_dict? Maybe we can create another dictionary, like:\n\npreprocessed = defaultdict( ... )\n\nBut perhaps during the initial grouping, we can replace the list in duration_dict with a structure that contains all the processed data. For example:\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min, etc.\n\n    # then, replace duration_dict[d] with a tuple containing end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min.\n\nBut perhaps for each duration d, we can create a new entry in a different structure. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing, for each duration d, we can compute and store the end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min, and then store them in the duration_dict as a tuple. For example:\n\npreprocessing for each d:\n\nend_sorted, end_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_list, suffix_min.\n\nBut perhaps for each d, we can store:\n\nduration_dict[d] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nOnce we have vouchers_list for duration d, process:\n\nend_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nend_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n\nprefix_min = ... \n\nSimilarly for start_sorted.\n\nThen, duration_dict[d] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\n\nBut then, during the processing of each voucher, when we need to access these, we can retrieve them.\n\nSo, in code:\n\npreprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    end_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(end_sorted)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i][2])\n\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n\n    start_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_list = [x[0] for x in start_sorted]\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_sorted[i][2])\n\n    # now, replace the duration_dict[d] with the preprocessed data\n\n    duration_dict[d] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\n\nWait, but this replaces the original list of vouchers with the preprocessed data. However, during this processing, the original vouchers_list is replaced. But since we don't need it anymore, this is acceptable.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original vouchers list, we can process as follows:\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    di = ri - li + 1\n\n    target_d = x - di\n\n    if target_d not in duration_dict:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the preprocessed data for target_d\n\n    end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n    # process case1: find vouchers with end < li\n\n    # using end_list, which is sorted.\n\n    # target_end = li - 1\n\n    target_end = li - 1\n\n    # find insertion point using bisect_right\n\n    import bisect\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_list, target_end)\n\n    # if pos > 0, then there are elements <= target_end\n\n    min_case1 = float('inf')\n\n    if pos > 0:\n\n        min_case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n\n    # process case2: find vouchers with start > ri\n\n    target_start = ri + 1\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_list, target_start)\n\n    min_case2 = float('inf')\n\n    if pos < len(start_list):\n\n        min_case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n\n    current_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n\n    if current_min < answer:\n\n        answer = current_min\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if answer is still infinity, output -1, else output answer.\n\nBut wait, what about when target_d is zero? Well, since x is at least 2 (since n ≥ 2 and x ≥ 2?), no. Wait, the input constraints for x are 2 ≤ x ≤ 2e5. Because in the input description, the first line has n and x with 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x is at least 2. So target_d can be zero only if di is x. But di is the duration of the voucher, which is ri - li + 1 ≥ 1. So x - di can be zero only if x = di. So for example, if x is 5, and di is 5, then target_d is zero. But duration_dict will not have zero, because all vouchers have durations ≥ 1. So in that case, target_d is not in duration_dict, and we skip.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nBut what if x is 2, and a voucher has duration 1. Then target_d is 1. So it's possible.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo for each voucher:\n\nFirst voucher: li=1, ri=3, duration 3. x=5, target_d = 5-3=2.\n\nCheck duration_dict for 2. It has three vouchers: the second, third, fourth.\n\nFor case1: find vouchers with end < li (1). So target_end = 1-1 = 0. end_list for target_d=2 is the sorted list of vouchers with duration 2. Let's see:\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5) → end is 2\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1) → end is 6\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4) → end is 2.\n\nWhen sorted by end, the end_list would be [2,2,6]. So end_list is [2,2,6]. The bisect_right for target_end=0 would be 0. So pos is 0, which is not >0. So case1 is inf.\n\nFor case2: target_start is ri+1 = 3+1=4. The start_list for target_d=2 is the vouchers sorted by start time. The vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5)\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4)\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1)\n\nsorted by start time (li), which is 1,1,5. So start_list is [1,1,5]. We are looking for target_start=4. bisect_left finds the first index where start >=4. In [1,1,5], the first element >=4 is at index 2. So pos=2. suffix_min for pos=2 is the min of the suffix from index 2, which is 1. So case2 gives 1. So current_min is 1. So the total is 4 (current voucher's cost) + 1 = 5? Wait, no. Because the current_min is the min of case1 and case2, which is 1. Then, the total cost is the current voucher's cost (4) plus that 1. Wait, no! Oh wait, no. The current voucher's cost is not added here. Because the current voucher's cost is added when we take the current voucher and the voucher found in the duration_dict.\n\nWait, no. The code above for the voucher i is checking for vouchers j in duration_dict[d], which is x - di. Then, the current voucher's duration is di, and the voucher j's duration is d. So the sum is di +d = x. So the total cost is voucher i's cost plus voucher j's cost. But in the code above, the code is getting the min_case1 and min_case2 as the min cost of voucher j. So the current voucher's cost is added to that.\n\nBut in the code I outlined above, the code is not adding the current voucher's cost. Wait, no. The code for the voucher i is processing, and for each voucher i, the code is trying to find voucher j with duration d. Then, the current voucher's cost is added to the min_case1 or min_case2. But in the code I outlined above, the code is not doing that. Oh, no! There's a mistake here.\n\nOh right! Oh no, the code I outlined earlier is only considering the voucher j's cost. But the total cost is voucher i's cost plus voucher j's cost. So the code is missing that part.\n\nThat's a critical error. So, the code should be:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n   compute di = ri - li + 1\n\n   target_d = x - di\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   get end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min\n\n   case1_min = ... (voucher j's cost)\n\n   case2_min = ... (voucher j's cost)\n\n   current_min_candidate = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n\n   if current_min_candidate is not inf:\n\n       total = current_voucher_cost + current_min_candidate\n\n       compare to the global answer.\n\nAh! So the code is missing adding the current voucher's cost. So that's a big mistake.\n\nSo in the code, for each voucher i, we need to take its own cost, and add it to the min_case1 or min_case2.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor li, ri, cost_i in vouchers:\n\n    di = ri - li + 1\n\n    target_d = x - di\n\n    if target_d not in duration_dict:\n\n        continue\n\n    end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n    # process case1 and case2 as before\n\n    current_min_candidate = min( case1, case2 )\n\n    if current_min_candidate is not inf:\n\n        total = cost_i + current_min_candidate\n\n        answer = min(answer, total)\n\nSo that's crucial. Otherwise, the code would miss adding the current voucher's cost.\n\nIn the sample input, for the first voucher (cost 4), the case2 gives 1. So total is 4+1=5, which is correct.\n\nSo that's a key part of the code.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nNow, the code steps are",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, x, and whose total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently checking for valid voucher pairs using preprocessing and binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in quickly accessing vouchers with specific durations.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into sorted lists based on their end times and start times. We also compute prefix minimum arrays for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum arrays for start-sorted lists to quickly determine the minimum costs for valid ranges.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the required complementary duration (x - current voucher's duration) that does not overlap. This is done using binary search on the preprocessed sorted lists to efficiently find valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration\n    preprocessed = defaultdict(lambda: (None, None, None, None))\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process end_sorted and prefix_min\n        end_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(end_sorted)\n        prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i][2])\n        # Process start_sorted and suffix_min\n        start_sorted = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_list = [x[0] for x in start_sorted]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(start_sorted)\n        suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_sorted[i][2])\n        # Store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost_i in vouchers:\n        duration_i = ri - li + 1\n        target_d = x - duration_i\n        if target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n        # Case 1: end < li\n        target_end = li - 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_list, target_end)\n        case1 = float('inf')\n        if pos > 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n        # Case 2: start > ri\n        target_start = ri + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_list, target_start)\n        case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos < len(start_list):\n            case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        current_min = min(case1, case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost_i + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient access.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
