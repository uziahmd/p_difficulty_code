Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. Each voucher has a duration of ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can precompute its duration. Then, we need to find two vouchers where one has duration d and the other has duration x - d, and they don't overlap. Also, they have to be different vouchers.\n\nThe challenge is to efficiently find such pairs. Considering that n can be up to 2e5, a brute-force approach checking all possible pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this. For each voucher, if I can find another voucher that has the required duration and doesn't overlap with it, then maybe I can track the minimum cost for each duration.\n\nSo here's an idea: group vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we check if there's a voucher with duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it. But even this approach could be O(n²) in the worst case, unless we can find a way to query the minimum cost for vouchers of duration (x - d) that don't overlap with the current voucher.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimum cost of vouchers of duration (x - d) that are either before or after the current voucher?\n\nAnother thought: For each possible duration d, we can precompute the minimal cost of vouchers with duration d that end before a certain day, and the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x - d) that start after a certain day. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher i with duration d, we can look for vouchers j with duration (x - d) such that j ends before li (so that j is before i) or starts after ri (so that j is after i). For each such j, we want the minimal cost.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, store the list of vouchers sorted by their end time (for the ones that end before) and start time (for the ones that start after).\n\nWait, but how do we quickly find the minimal cost for vouchers of a certain duration that end before a certain time, or start after a certain time?\n\nFor example, for a voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers of duration x-d that end before li. And also vouchers of duration x-d that start after ri. Then take the minimal cost among those.\n\nSo, for each duration, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimal cost up to that end time. So for vouchers of duration k, sorted by their end time, and for each position, we can keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. This way, when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers of duration k that end before a certain time t, we can binary search for the largest end time <= t, and then get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the start time: for vouchers of duration k, sorted by start time, and for each position, track the minimum cost from that point onwards. Wait, no. Because if we need vouchers that start after a certain time t, we can find the first voucher in the sorted list with start time > t, and then take the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nBut how to precompute these minima?\n\nLet me think. For each duration k, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n1. Sorted by end time. For each entry in this list, we can precompute a prefix minimum array. So for any end time t, we can find the earliest end time that is <= t, and get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\n2. Sorted by start time. For each entry in this list, we can precompute a suffix minimum array. So for any start time t, we can find the earliest start time that is >= t, and then get the minimum cost from that position onwards.\n\nThis way, for any voucher i with duration d, we can check:\n\n- What is the minimal cost of vouchers of duration (x - d) that end before li (so they don't overlap with i). This can be found by looking into the sorted list of vouchers of duration (x - d) sorted by end time, and finding the maximum end time that is <= li-1. Then take the prefix min up to that index.\n\n- Similarly, what is the minimal cost of vouchers of duration (x - d) that start after ri (so they don't overlap with i). This can be found by looking into the sorted list of vouchers of duration (x - d) sorted by start time, and find the first start time that is >= ri + 1. Then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nIf either of these exists, we can take the minimal value between them and the current voucher's cost, and update the global minimum.\n\nBut first, we need to process all vouchers, group them by their duration, and for each duration, sort the vouchers by end time and start time, and precompute prefix and suffix minima.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers. For each voucher, compute its duration. Let's call this duration d. Then, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, we'll have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (ri), and for each position, a prefix min array (the minimum cost up to that index).\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (li), and for each position, a suffix min array (the minimum cost from that index onwards).\n\n2. For each voucher in the original list, check if there exists a duration (x - d) that is present in the grouped durations. If not, skip this voucher. Otherwise, proceed.\n\n3. For each such voucher, check for vouchers of duration (x - d) that are before or after it. For that, use the two sorted lists for the (x - d) duration.\n\n   a. For the before part: find the maximum end time <= li - 1. If such exists, get the min cost from the prefix min array.\n\n   b. For the after part: find the minimum start time >= ri + 1. If such exists, get the min cost from the suffix min array.\n\n4. Take the min between the before and after options, add to the current voucher's cost, and update the global answer.\n\nBut how to handle the grouping? Let's think about data structures.\n\nFor example, we can have a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where each key is a duration, and the value is a tuple of two lists:\n\n- sorted_end: list of vouchers sorted by end time (ri), and for each entry, the cost.\n\n- sorted_start: list of vouchers sorted by start time (li), and for each entry, the cost.\n\nAdditionally, for each sorted_end list, we have a prefix_min array. Similarly, for sorted_start, we have a suffix_min array.\n\nSo for each duration k in duration_dict:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers with duration k, by ri)\n\nprefix_min = array where prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start = sorted(vouchers with duration k, by li)\n\nsuffix_min = array where suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i].cost)\n\nBut how to compute these prefix and suffix arrays?\n\nOnce the sorted_end list is built, we can compute the prefix min as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_min array:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\n\nfor i in len(sorted_start)-2 downto 0:\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min( sorted_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nOnce these are precomputed, when we need to find the minimal cost for vouchers of duration k that end before a certain time, we can perform a binary search on the sorted_end list to find the largest end time <= t. Then, if found, the prefix_min at that index gives the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly for the start times.\n\nNow, for each voucher, let's consider:\n\nd = duration of voucher i.\n\ntarget_duration = x - d.\n\nif target_duration is not in duration_dict, skip.\n\nelse:\n\n   check for vouchers of target_duration that end before li (so that they don't overlap with voucher i). Also check for vouchers of target_duration that start after ri.\n\nSo, for the first part, in the sorted_end list of target_duration:\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is <= li - 1.\n\nIf such exists, then take the corresponding prefix_min value.\n\nFor the second part, in the sorted_start list of target_duration:\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the smallest start time that is >= ri + 1.\n\nIf such exists, take the corresponding suffix_min value.\n\nThen, for each of these possible candidates, we can take the minimal value and add to the current voucher's cost.\n\nBut we have to make sure that the target_duration is valid. Also, note that the target_duration must be positive. Because if x - d is negative, it's impossible. So, for each voucher, we first check if x - d is positive, and that there are vouchers of that duration.\n\nBut how to handle the case when d is zero? Well, since the duration is ri - li + 1, and li <= ri, so duration is at least 1. So x must be at least 2 (since Leha wants two vouchers with total duration x, each of at least 1). Wait, but the input x can be as small as 2. So for x=2, each voucher must have duration 1 and 1.\n\nSo during processing, for each voucher, we check if x - d is positive and exists in the duration_dict.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nBut how to handle the binary searches?\n\nFor the first part, the sorted_end list is sorted by end time. We can binary search for the maximum end time <= t (t = li - 1). For example, in Python, using bisect_right.\n\nSuppose sorted_end_times is a list of end times for the target duration. We can create a list of end times, and then perform bisect_right to find the insertion point of t. The index would be the number of elements <= t. So if the insertion point is idx, then the maximum end time <= t is at idx-1. If idx is zero, there are no such elements.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start list, which is sorted by start time. We want the first start time >= t (t = ri + 1). We can use bisect_left to find the insertion point. If the insertion point is idx, then all elements from idx onwards have start time >= t. If idx is equal to the length of the list, then there are none.\n\nOnce we find those indices, we can check if they are valid and get the corresponding minima.\n\nNow, the code structure would be something like:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read all vouchers, compute their durations.\n\nGroup the vouchers by their duration. For each duration, sort the vouchers by end time and start time, and compute prefix and suffix minima.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = duration of voucher\n\n   target_d = x - d\n\n   if target_d < 1 or not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      check for vouchers of target_d that end before li (voucher's start time is li, so the other voucher must end before li - 1?)\n\nWait, the voucher i has start time li and end time ri. For a voucher j to not overlap with i, either j ends before li (so rj < li) or starts after ri (so lj > ri). So for the first case, the end time of j must be <= li - 1.\n\nSo, for the first part, we need to find vouchers of target_d that end before li - 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part, find vouchers of target_d that start after ri + 1 (since lj >= ri + 1 implies that rj >= lj >= ri + 1, so ri < lj, which satisfies the non-overlapping condition).\n\nSo, for each voucher i:\n\n   current cost is cost_i.\n\n   target_d = x - d_i.\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      for the target_d, check the two possibilities:\n\n         1. Find min cost of vouchers in target_d that end before li - 1.\n\n         2. Find min cost of vouchers in target_d that start after ri + 1.\n\n      if either exists, then add to current cost and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, how to implement the checks for 1 and 2.\n\nLet me think about the first part.\n\nFor the target_d, we have the sorted_end list (sorted by end time), and the prefix_min array.\n\nSo, for the sorted_end list, we can extract the list of end times. Let's call it end_times. Then, perform a bisect_right on end_times for the value (li - 1). The index gives the number of elements <= li-1. So if idx is 0, no such elements. Else, the prefix_min[idx-1] is the minimal cost.\n\nBut wait, the prefix_min array is built for the sorted_end list. So the sorted_end list is sorted by end time. So, the end_times is just [voucher.end for voucher in sorted_end].\n\nSo, for example, if the sorted_end list is sorted in ascending order of end time, then the end_times list is also sorted.\n\nSo, for the first part, we can do:\n\nIn the target_d's data:\n\nsorted_end = list of vouchers sorted by end time.\n\nend_times = [v.r for v in sorted_end]\n\nprefix_min = ... \n\nWe can perform bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1). Let's call this idx.\n\nif idx > 0:\n\n   min_cost_before = prefix_min[idx-1]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_before = infinity.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part:\n\nsorted_start is the list of vouchers for target_d sorted by start time (li). So their start times are sorted in ascending order.\n\nstart_times = [v.l for v in sorted_start]\n\nWe want to find the first start time >= (ri + 1). Using bisect_left on start_times for (ri + 1). Let's call this idx.\n\nif idx < len(start_times):\n\n   min_cost_after = suffix_min[idx]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_after = infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal between min_cost_before and min_cost_after is the possible candidate for the other voucher. Then, adding the current voucher's cost to that gives a possible total.\n\nBut wait, the current voucher is part of the group for duration d. However, the target_d vouchers are separate. So, when we check for the target_d vouchers, we can have multiple vouchers. But we need to ensure that the voucher j is not the same as the current voucher i. However, since the problem states that i and j must be different vouchers, but in our approach, when we process voucher i, we are looking for vouchers j of duration target_d. Since the current voucher i has duration d, and target_d is x - d. So, if d is equal to target_d (i.e., x = 2d), then the current voucher could be considered as j. But in that case, when we check for vouchers j of duration target_d, we need to make sure that j is not the same as i.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because suppose d = target_d. Then, when processing voucher i, the code would check for other vouchers of the same duration. However, if the current voucher i is part of the target_d group (which it is), then the code might select itself as j. Which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to avoid that?\n\nAh, right. For example, if x = 2d, then target_d = d. So, when processing voucher i, we are looking for vouchers of duration d that are non-overlapping. But the voucher i itself may be in that group. So, when we look for vouchers of duration d, we need to exclude voucher i itself.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis complicates things. Because, when we are checking for vouchers of target_d, which may be same as d, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nOne approach is, during the binary search steps, to check if the voucher j found is not the same as i. However, since there could be multiple vouchers with same l, r, and cost, this approach is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative idea: when building the sorted_end and sorted_start lists for each duration, we can store all vouchers, and during the binary search steps, when we find the minima, we need to check if the voucher that gives the minima is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because the prefix_min array holds the minimum cost up to a certain index, but that minimum could be achieved by any voucher in the sorted_end list up to that index. So, if the current voucher is part of that list, then the min could include it. But we need to exclude it.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the way to handle this is to allow the current voucher to be considered, but then check if the voucher j is different from i. However, that would require that for each possible candidate, we check if it's not the same as i. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose voucher i is in the target_d group. When we look for vouchers of target_d that end before li-1, and if the minimal cost is achieved by voucher i itself. But since voucher i ends at ri, which is >= li (since voucher i's duration is ri - li + 1). So, if voucher i is in the target_d group, then for the first case (before), voucher i's end time is ri. But we are looking for vouchers ending before li - 1. Since li <= ri (because voucher i's duration is at least 1), li - 1 < li <= ri. So voucher i's end time is ri >= li, which is larger than li-1. So, voucher i cannot be in the list of vouchers that end before li - 1. Therefore, in this case, the current voucher i is not part of the sorted_end list that is being considered for the 'before' part. So, no conflict here.\n\nWait, because for the 'before' part, we are looking for vouchers that end before li-1. The current voucher i has end time ri >= li. So, voucher i's end time is not in that list. Therefore, when considering the 'before' part, the current voucher is not part of the target_d group's sorted_end list. So, no need to worry about that.\n\nWhat about the 'after' part? For the 'after' part, we are looking for vouchers that start after ri + 1. The current voucher i starts at li and ends at ri. So, if the voucher i is part of the target_d group, then when we check for vouchers starting after ri + 1, the current voucher's start time is li. So, unless li >= ri + 1, which would imply that ri + 1 <= li. But since ri >= li, this is only possible if ri = li and ri + 1 <= li. Which implies ri + 1 <= ri → 1 <= 0, which is impossible. So, the current voucher i's start time is li, which is <= ri. So, the start time of the current voucher is not >= ri + 1. Hence, the current voucher is not part of the sorted_start list that is being considered for the 'after' part. Therefore, in both cases, the current voucher is not considered as a candidate for the other voucher. Thus, there's no need to worry about the same voucher being selected again.\n\nSo, this problem is avoided. Therefore, the code can proceed without worrying about the same voucher being considered.\n\nThat's a relief. So, the initial approach is safe.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the grouping of vouchers by duration.\n\nFor each duration, sort the vouchers by end time and start time, and compute prefix and suffix minima.\n\nNow, in Python, for each duration, we can store:\n\n- sorted_end: list of vouchers sorted by end time (r).\n\n- prefix_min: list of minima for the sorted_end list.\n\n- sorted_start: list of vouchers sorted by start time (l).\n\n- suffix_min: list of minima for the sorted_start list.\n\nBut how to store this? Maybe using a dictionary, where for each duration, we have a tuple (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min).\n\nBut for each voucher, we need to process these.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each with l, r, cost. Compute duration as r - l + 1.\n\nStore all vouchers in a list.\n\nThen, build the duration_dict.\n\nInitialize duration_dict as a defaultdict, where each key is a duration, and the value is a structure containing:\n\nsorted_end (list of vouchers sorted by r), and the prefix_min array.\n\nsorted_start (list of vouchers sorted by l), and the suffix_min array.\n\nSo, for each duration in duration_dict, process the vouchers:\n\nFor example:\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers with this duration.\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.r)\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.l)\n\n   compute prefix_min for sorted_end:\n\n   prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\n\n   for i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\n   compute suffix_min for sorted_start:\n\n   suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\n\n   for i in len(sorted_start)-2 downto 0:\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min( sorted_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nBut in Python, we can do this with loops.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = voucher.duration\n\n   target_d = x - d\n\n   if target_d < 1 or target_d not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      # process the target_d group\n\n      # first check for vouchers ending before li - 1\n\n      # get the sorted_end and prefix_min for target_d\n\n      target_group = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n      sorted_end_list = target_group['sorted_end']\n\n      prefix_min_list = target_group['prefix_min']\n\n      end_times = [v.r for v in sorted_end_list]\n\n      # find the max end time <= li - 1\n\n      t = voucher.l - 1\n\n      idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t)\n\n      min_cost_before = infinity\n\n      if idx > 0:\n\n          min_cost_before = prefix_min_list[idx - 1]\n\n      # now check for vouchers starting after ri + 1\n\n      sorted_start_list = target_group['sorted_start']\n\n      suffix_min_list = target_group['suffix_min']\n\n      start_times = [v.l for v in sorted_start_list]\n\n      t = voucher.r + 1\n\n      idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, t)\n\n      min_cost_after = infinity\n\n      if idx < len(start_times):\n\n          min_cost_after = suffix_min_list[idx]\n\n      # now, the possible candidates are min_cost_before and min_cost_after\n\n      current_min = min( min_cost_before, min_cost_after )\n\n      if current_min is not infinity:\n\n          total = current_min + voucher.cost\n\n          update the global answer if this total is smaller.\n\nSo, the global answer is initialized to infinity. After processing all vouchers, if it's still infinity, output -1 else output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle the case where there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and target_d?\n\nBut the code above should handle that, as the prefix and suffix minima arrays take care of finding the minimal cost.\n\nNow, some edge cases:\n\nCase 1: x is 2, and there are two vouchers of duration 1, non-overlapping.\n\nCase 2: x is 5, and one voucher has duration 2, another has duration 3, and they don't overlap.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are multiple vouchers of target_d, but none satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3 (3-1+1=3)\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2 (6-5+1=2)\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher, check target_d = 5 - duration.\n\nFor the first voucher (duration 3), target_d is 2.\n\nCheck if there are vouchers of duration 2. Yes.\n\nFor the first voucher, li is 1, ri is 3.\n\nCheck for vouchers of duration 2 that end before 1-1=0. No such vouchers. So min_cost_before is infinity.\n\nCheck for vouchers of duration 2 that start after 3+1=4. The start times of duration 2 vouchers are:\n\nLooking at the vouchers of duration 2:\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2, cost 5.\n\nvoucher 4: l=1, r=2, cost 4.\n\nvoucher 3: l=5, r=6, cost 1.\n\nsorted_start for duration 2 is sorted by l. So the start times are 1, 1, 5. So sorted_start_list is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3]. The suffix_min is computed as:\n\nfor suffix_min:\n\nstart from the end:\n\nsuffix_min[2] = 1 (voucher3's cost)\n\nsuffix_min[1] = min(4, 1) → 1\n\nsuffix_min[0] = min(5, 1) → 1\n\nSo for t = 4, bisect_left on [1,1,5] for 4. The insertion point is 2 (since 4 is between 1 and 5). So idx is 2. Then, suffix_min[2] is 1. So min_cost_after is 1. So adding to current voucher's cost (4) gives 5, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nAnother voucher that could contribute is voucher3 (duration 2). For that voucher, target_d is 5 - 2 = 3. So check if there are vouchers of duration 3. Yes, the first voucher. Then check for vouchers of duration 3 that end before 5-1=4 (voucher3's l is 5?), no, wait:\n\nWait, voucher3's l is 5, r is 6. So duration is 2. So target_d is 5 - 2 = 3. So looking for vouchers of duration 3. There is one voucher (voucher1, duration 3). For voucher3, we check:\n\nCheck if there are vouchers of duration 3 that end before 5-1=4. Voucher1 ends at 3, which is <=4. So min_cost_before is 4. Then, adding voucher3's cost (1) gives 5. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo the code would find both possibilities, and the minimum is 5.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures. How to represent the vouchers. Perhaps, for each voucher, we can store l, r, cost, duration. But during grouping, we can process them.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut first, note that in Python, for the bisect module, we need to generate the end_times and start_times lists for each target_d.\n\nBut for each duration, during preprocessing, we can precompute the end_times and start_times lists. However, during the processing of each voucher, we can generate these lists on the fly. But that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration group, we can store the sorted_end list, and the end_times as a list, and similarly for sorted_start and start_times.\n\nBut perhaps, during preprocessing, for each duration group, we can generate the sorted_end list, and then generate end_times as a list of the r values. Similarly for sorted_start and start_times.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nImplementing this with dictionaries.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\n# Now build the duration_dict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict( lambda: {'sorted_end': [], 'prefix_min': [], 'sorted_start': [], 'suffix_min': []} )\n\nfor l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n\n    # add to the duration_dict\n\n    duration_dict[duration]['sorted_end'].append( (r, cost) )\n\n    duration_dict[duration]['sorted_start'].append( (l, cost) )\n\n# Now, for each duration in duration_dict, sort the lists and compute prefix/suffix minima.\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n\n    # process sorted_end\n\n    sorted_end = duration_dict[duration]['sorted_end']\n\n    # sort by r (end time)\n\n    sorted_end.sort()\n\n    # extract the list of end times and costs\n\n    end_times = [r for r, cost in sorted_end]\n\n    costs = [cost for r, cost in sorted_end]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = costs[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], costs[i] )\n\n    duration_dict[duration]['sorted_end'] = sorted_end\n\n    duration_dict[duration]['prefix_min'] = prefix_min\n\n    # process sorted_start\n\n    sorted_start = duration_dict[duration]['sorted_start']\n\n    # sort by l (start time)\n\n    sorted_start.sort()\n\n    # extract start times and costs\n\n    start_times = [l for l, cost in sorted_start]\n\n    costs_start = [cost for l, cost in sorted_start]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = costs_start[-1]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( costs_start[i], suffix_min[i+1] )\n\n    duration_dict[duration]['sorted_start'] = sorted_start\n\n    duration_dict[duration]['suffix_min'] = suffix_min\n\n# Now, for each voucher, check for possible pairs.\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n\n    target_d = x - duration\n\n    if target_d < 1 or target_d not in duration_dict:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the target group info\n\n    target_group = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n    # check for vouchers ending before l-1\n\n    # process sorted_end and prefix_min\n\n    sorted_end = target_group['sorted_end']\n\n    prefix_min = target_group['prefix_min']\n\n    # extract end_times\n\n    end_times = [r for r, cost in sorted_end]\n\n    t = l - 1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t)\n\n    min_before = float('inf')\n\n    if idx > 0:\n\n        min_before = prefix_min[idx-1]\n\n    # check for vouchers starting after r+1\n\n    sorted_start = target_group['sorted_start']\n\n    suffix_min = target_group['suffix_min']\n\n    start_times = [l for l, cost in sorted_start]\n\n    t = r + 1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, t)\n\n    min_after = float('inf')\n\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n\n        min_after = suffix_min[idx]\n\n    current_min = min( min_before, min_after )\n\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n\n        total = current_min + cost\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n\n    print(-1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but there's a mistake here. In the code above, when building the duration_dict, the 'sorted_end' is stored as a list of tuples (r, cost). But when we sort them, we sort by r (since the first element of the tuple is r). However, in the code, the sorted_end is sorted, which is correct.\n\nBut when we extract the end_times, we take [r for r, cost in sorted_end], which is correct.\n\nBut for the 'sorted_start' part, the code is adding (l, cost) to the sorted_start list. Then, when we sort, sorted_start is sorted by l, since the tuples are (l, cost), and the default sort is lex order. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, during the initial processing of the vouchers, for each voucher, we added to the 'sorted_end' list (r, cost) and to 'sorted_start' list (l, cost). Then, during the processing of the duration_dict, we sort the sorted_end and sorted_start lists.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, when building the duration_dict, for each voucher, the 'sorted_end' is initially filled with (r, cost) tuples. Then, sorted_end is sorted. So the end_times are correctly generated.\n\nBut in the code above, during the processing of the duration_dict, the 'sorted_end' is overwritten with the sorted list. So that's okay.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\nvoucher 0: l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration=3.\n\nvoucher 1: l=1, r=2, cost=5, duration=2.\n\nvoucher 2: l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration=2.\n\nvoucher 3: l=1, r=2, cost=4, duration=2.\n\nduration_dict for duration 3 has:\n\nsorted_end: [(3,4)], prefix_min [4]\n\nsorted_start: [(1,4)], suffix_min [4]\n\nfor duration 2:\n\nsorted_end is [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)] ?\n\nWait, no. For the duration 2 vouchers, the initial 'sorted_end' list is built by adding (r, cost) for each voucher. For voucher1: r=2, cost 5. voucher2: r=6, cost 1. voucher3: r=2, cost 4. So the initial 'sorted_end' list is [(2,5), (6,1), (2,4)]? Or no, because during the initial processing, the code adds (r, cost) for each voucher. Then, during the processing of the duration_dict, the code does sorted_end.sort().\n\nSo for duration 2, the sorted_end list is [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)]? Or when you sort the list of tuples (r, cost), the first element is r, so the sorted list would be ordered by r, then by cost?\n\nWait, in Python, when you sort tuples, they are compared lexicographically. So for (2,5) and (2,4), since the first elements are equal, the second elements are compared. So (2,4) comes before (2,5). So the sorted_end list after sorting would be [(2,4), (2,5), (6,1)].\n\nThus, the end_times would be [2, 2, 6], and the prefix_min would be [4, min(4,5)=4, min(4, 1) = 1].\n\nSo prefix_min is [4, 4, 1].\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start list for duration 2, which is [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)]? Wait, no. The initial 'sorted_start' list is built by adding (l, cost) for each voucher. For the three vouchers of duration 2, l is 1, 5, 1. So initial list is [(1,5), (5,1), (1,4)]. Then, when sorted, sorted_start will be [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)]? Because when sorted, tuples are compared first by l, then by cost. So (1,5) and (1,4): since l is same, compare cost. So (1,4) comes before (1,5). So the sorted_start list is [(1,4), (1,5), (5,1)]. Then, the start_times is [1, 1, 5]. The suffix_min is computed as:\n\nstart from the end:\n\nindex 2: cost 1 → suffix_min[2] = 1.\n\nindex 1: min(5, 1) → 1.\n\nindex 0: min(4, 1) → 1.\n\nSo suffix_min is [1, 1, 1].\n\nSo when voucher0 is processed (duration 3, target_d 2), the code checks for vouchers of duration 2.\n\nFor the first part (before), t = l-1 = 1-1 = 0. end_times for duration 2 is [2, 2, 6]. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0, so no min_before.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, x, and whose total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Sort and Preprocess**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their end time and start time. We also compute prefix minimums for end-sorted lists and suffix minimums for start-sorted lists to quickly find the minimum costs during binary searches.\n3. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a complementary duration (i.e., x - current duration) that does not overlap with it.
