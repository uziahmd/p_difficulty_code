    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible ternary string after performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). But we can't swap 0 and 2 directly. \n\nSo, first, I need to understand what permutations are possible with these swaps. Let's think about the movement of each character.\n\nFor example, can a '0' move past a '2'? Well, since we can't swap 0 and 2 directly. But maybe through some intermediate steps. Let's see: Suppose there's a sequence like 0 1 2. Then, we can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. Wait, but the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, if there's a 1 between 0 and 2, maybe we can move them around. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the key here is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. But 0s can't be moved past 2s directly. So, what's the overall effect?\n\nLet me think about the relative order of the characters. For example, 0s can be rearranged among themselves as long as they can move through 1s. Similarly, 2s can be rearranged through 1s. But 0s and 2s can't pass through each other. Wait, but perhaps 0s can be moved to the left of 2s if there's a way to arrange the 1s in between?\n\nWait, suppose there's a 0 followed by a 2. Since we can't swap them directly. But if there's a 1 between them, maybe we can move the 0 to the right of the 1 and then move the 1 to the right of the 2? Or something like that. Let me think with an example.\n\nTake the string \"0 1 2\". The 0 can swap with the 1 to get \"1 0 2\". Then the 0 can't swap with the 2. But the 0 and 1 can be swapped again to get back. So no progress. Alternatively, the 1 and 2 can be swapped to get \"0 2 1\". Now, the 0 is before the 2. But how can that help? Well, if we have a 0 followed by 2, perhaps we can't move them past each other. So maybe the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed? Because they can't pass each other. Because you can't swap them, and there's no way to move them through 1s?\n\nWait, suppose there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 can move to the right of the 1, and the 2 can move to the left of the 1. So for example, 0 1 2 can become 0 2 1 (by swapping the 1 and 2). Then, the 0 can't move past the 2. But if there's a 1 between them, maybe you can move them around. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that the 0s can be arranged in any order relative to each other, as long as they can move through 1s. Similarly for 2s. But 0s and 2s can't be swapped, so their relative positions are fixed. Wait, but that's not true. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, then perhaps we can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1. So, the 0 and 2 can end up in the same position as each other? No, but their order might be changed. Wait, for example:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2 → swap 1 and 2 → 0 2 1. Now, the 0 is before the 2. But if there's a 0 and 2 in the string, can they be swapped? Only if there's a way to move them through 1s. But in this case, the 0 is before the 2. How can we make them switch places?\n\nIf there's a 0 followed by a 2, but no 1s between them, then they can't be swapped. However, if there's a 1 between them, maybe we can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1. Then, the 0 and 2 would be on opposite sides of the 1. But how can they pass each other? For example, consider the string 0 1 2. We can swap the 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Now, the 0 is before the 2. But the 0 can't swap with the 2. However, the 0 can move to the right of the 1 (if possible). Wait, but in this case, the 0 is already before the 2. Maybe the 0 and 2 can't pass each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Because you can't swap them, and you can't move them past each other through 1s. Because 0 can only move through 1s, and 2 can only move through 1s. So, if a 0 is to the left of a 2, then in the final arrangement, the 0 will remain to the left of the 2. Because even though you can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1, but they can't cross each other. \n\nWait, maybe the 0s and 2s can't pass each other. So the original order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Only the 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. So for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, then the 2 must come before the 0. Because they can't pass each other. \n\nBut how can that be? Let me take an example. Suppose the original string is \"02\". Then, we can't swap them, so the minimum is \"02\". But if the string is \"20\", then the minimum is \"20\" (since we can't swap them). But if the string is \"012\", then we can swap 1 and 2 to get 021. But then, the 0 is still before the 2. So the relative order of 0 and 2 is preserved. \n\nSo the conclusion is that 0s and 2s cannot be reordered relative to each other. Only 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string determines their positions in the final string. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging the 0s and 2s in their original order, but allowing 1s to be placed between them. \n\nBut how can we arrange the 1s optimally? Because 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Wait, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (so 0s and 1s can be swapped), and between 1 and 2 (so 1s and 2s can be swapped). So, 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, for example, a 1 can be moved to the left of a 0 or to the right of a 2. \n\nBut the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the idea is that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order, but the 1s can be arranged between them. \n\nSo, the approach would be to:\n\n- Keep the relative order of 0s and 2s as in the original string. \n\n- Then, arrange the 1s in between them. \n\nBut how to arrange the 1s optimally?\n\nLet me think. Since the 1s can be moved freely between 0s and 2s. So, for example, if we have a group of 0s, then some 1s, then some 2s. We can arrange the 1s to be in between the 0s and 2s. But how to arrange the 1s to get the lex smallest string. \n\nWait, the lex smallest string would want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But given that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, perhaps the optimal arrangement is to collect all 1s between the 0s and 2s. \n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the original string as consisting of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So, for example, if the original string is 0 2 0 2, then in the final string, the order of 0s and 2s must be 0, 2, 0, 2. \n\nBut between them, we can arrange the 1s. So for example, between the first 0 and the 2, we can put as many 1s as possible. Then between the 2 and the next 0, etc. \n\nBut since the 1s can be moved anywhere, perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and place them between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. The 1s can be placed anywhere, but since they are lex smaller than 2 but larger than 0, perhaps we can arrange them to be grouped together in the middle. \n\nWait, but the lex smallest string would want as many 0s as possible first, then 1s, then 2s. So, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the 1s to be between the 0s and 2s. For example, if the original string has a 0 followed by some 1s and 2s, then we can arrange the 1s to be between the 0s and the 2s. \n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the problem as grouping all the 1s into one block. But that's not necessarily correct. For example, suppose the original string is \"0 2 1 0 2\". The 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 2, 0, 2. So the 1 can be placed between the first 0 and 2, or between the 2 and the next 0, etc. To minimize the string, we want to place the 1s as early as possible. Because 1 is larger than 0 but smaller than 2. So placing 1s between 0s and 2s would allow us to have more 0s before the 1s and 2s. \n\nWait, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, then inserting a 1 between them would result in 0 1 2, which is better than 0 2 1. Because 0 1 2 is lex smaller than 0 2 1. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to collect all 1s between the 0s and 2s. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- The 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. \n\n- All the 1s can be placed between them. \n\nBut how to arrange the 1s in between. For example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then between them, we can place all the 1s. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAnother approach: think of the entire string as a sequence of 0s, 2s, and 1s. The 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order, but the 1s can be placed anywhere between them. \n\nSo, for example, the original string could be split into groups of 0s, 2s, and 1s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. \n\nSo, the idea is to process the original string, collect the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between. But where exactly?\n\nLet me think of the original string as a sequence of blocks. For example, the original string may have some 0s and 2s, but also 1s. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to separate the 0s and 2s, keeping their original order, and then insert the 1s between them. \n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and 2, between a 2 and 0, or between two 2s. \n\nBut since 1s are larger than 0s and smaller than 2s, inserting them between 0s and 2s would be better. For example, between a 0 and 2, putting the 1s would allow the 0s to be as left as possible, and the 2s to be as right as possible. \n\nBut what about inserting 1s between two 0s? That would be worse, because 0 is smaller than 1. So, for example, if there are two 0s with a 1 between them, it's 0 1 0, which is worse than 0 0 1. \n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s between two 2s would be worse than putting them between 0 and 2. \n\nTherefore, the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and place them in the positions between 0s and 2s, but in such a way that the 1s are placed in the earliest possible positions where they can be. \n\nWait, but how to determine where to place them. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Then, between each pair of consecutive elements in this list, we can insert the 1s. However, the insertion should be done in a way that the 1s are placed in the positions where they contribute the least to the lex order. \n\nBut perhaps the best way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. For example, if the 0s and 2s are arranged as [0, 2, 0, 2], then inserting all the 1s between the 0 and 2 in the first position, and between the 2 and 0, and between the 0 and 2 in the second position. But how to decide the order. \n\nAlternatively, since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, but the lex order is minimized when the 1s are placed in the earliest possible positions where they can be. \n\nWait, but the lex order is determined by the first differing character. So, for example, inserting a 1 earlier in the string would be worse than inserting it later. Wait, no. Because 1 is larger than 0. So, if there's a 0 followed by a 1, that's worse than a 0 followed by another 0. But if there's a 0 followed by a 1, and there's a 1 that can be placed after a 0 and before a 2, then that's better than having the 1 after the 2. \n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of a concrete example. \n\nSuppose the original string is '02'. Then, the 0 and 2 are fixed in that order. There are no 1s. So the minimal string is '02'.\n\nIf the original string is '012', then the 0 and 2 are in order. The 1 can be moved between them. So the minimal string is '012' (since that's already the case). But if the original string was '021', then we can swap the 2 and 1 to get '012', which is better.\n\nNow, consider the original string '20'. The 0 and 2 are in reverse order. But since we can't swap them, the minimal string is '20'.\n\nAnother example: the original string is '201'. The 2 and 0 are in the order 2, 0. So in the final string, they must stay in that order. The 1 can be moved. So the minimal string would be '012'? Wait, no. Because the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the original order is 2, 0. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string would be '021'? Wait, how?\n\nOriginal string is '201'. The 2 and 0 are in order 2, 0. So in the final string, the 2 must come before the 0. But the 1 can be moved. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string is '2 0 1'. We can swap the 0 and 1 (since they are adjacent) to get '2 1 0'. Then, the 1 and 0 can be swapped again? No, because the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, so yes. Wait, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So in the string '2 1 0', we can swap the 2 and 1 (they are adjacent) to get '1 2 0'. Then, swap the 2 and 0? No, because they are not allowed. So then, the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the string would be '1 2 0'. But the original order of 2 and 0 is 2 comes before 0. But in this case, the 2 is now after the 1. So the 2 is still before the 0. So the order of the 2 and 0 is preserved. \n\nBut the string '1 2 0' is lex smaller than the original '2 0 1'. However, is there a way to get a better string? Like '0 1 2'? But that would require the 0 to be moved before the 2, which is not allowed. So no. So the minimal possible is '1 2 0'? Or perhaps there's a way to arrange the 1s. \n\nWait, the original string is '2 0 1'. Let's think about the 1. We can swap the 0 and 1 to get '2 1 0'. Then, we can swap the 2 and 1 to get '1 2 0'. Then, can we do anything else? The 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the minimal string here is '120', which is better than the original. \n\nBut how does this fit into our previous idea that the 0s and 2s must maintain their original order. In the original string, the 2 comes before the 0. In the final string, the 2 is still before the 0. So that's okay. \n\nSo, the 1s can be placed before the 2 and 0. \n\nSo, the key is that the 1s can be placed anywhere, as long as the relative order of 0s and 2s is maintained. \n\nTherefore, the problem becomes: collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert all the 1s in between them, but in a way that minimizes the lex order. \n\nSo, how to arrange the 1s. \n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a list. For example, if the original string is '201', the list of 0s and 2s is [2, 0]. Then, the 1s can be inserted between them. \n\nIn this case, inserting the 1 between 2 and 0 gives '2 1 0', which is better than inserting it elsewhere. But in the example above, we found that inserting the 1 before the 2 gives '1 2 0', which is even better. \n\nAh! So the 1s can be inserted before the first 0 or 2, between any two elements in the list, or after the last element. \n\nSo the problem now is: how to distribute the 1s in the positions between the 0s and 2s, in a way that minimizes the lex order. \n\nThe lex order is minimized when the earliest possible characters are as small as possible. So, for example, inserting 1s as early as possible may not be good. Because inserting a 1 in front of a 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. \n\nWait, but if the first element in the 0s and 2s list is 2, then inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1, which is better than 2. \n\nSo, the idea is that the 1s can be inserted in any of the possible gaps (before the first element, between elements, after last element). And the optimal way is to arrange the 1s in the earliest possible gaps where they can contribute to a lower lex order. \n\nBut how to choose which gaps to insert the 1s into. \n\nLet me think of the list of 0s and 2s as being separated into positions where we can insert 1s. For example, if the list is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], then there are n+1 gaps where 1s can be inserted. \n\nThe goal is to distribute the 1s into these gaps in a way that the resulting string is lex smallest. \n\nHow to do that? \n\nWell, for the lex smallest string, we want the earliest possible positions to have the smallest possible characters. \n\nSo, for example, inserting 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause a higher lex order. \n\nLet me think of the gaps. \n\nEach gap can be considered as a position where inserting 1s would contribute to the string. \n\nThe first gap is before the first element. \n\nThe second gap is between the first and second elements. \n\nThe third gap is between the second and third elements, etc. \n\nThe last gap is after the last element. \n\nNow, inserting 1s into the first gap (before the first element) would add 1s at the beginning. Which is better than leaving them in later gaps. But only if that helps. \n\nFor example, if the first element is a 2, then inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1, which is better than starting with 2. \n\nHowever, if the first element is a 0, inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. \n\nSo, the optimal way is to insert 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause a higher lex order. \n\nSo, for each gap, we can decide whether inserting 1s there would be better. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAn approach is to greedily insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not create a higher lex order. \n\nLet me think of the following strategy: \n\nFor each gap, decide whether inserting 1s here is better than inserting them in later gaps. \n\nFor example, the first gap is before the first element. If the first element is 2, then inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1, which is better. So we should insert as many 1s as possible here. \n\nIf the first element is 0, then inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1, which is worse than 0. So we should not insert any 1s here. \n\nSimilarly, for the gaps between elements. \n\nFor example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s here would give 0 1s 2. Which is better than inserting them elsewhere. \n\nBetween a 0 and a 0, inserting 1s would make the string 0 1s 0, which is worse than 0 0 1s. \n\nSo, for each gap, the optimal choice depends on the elements around it. \n\nSo, perhaps the best way to arrange the 1s is to insert them into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause the lex order to increase. \n\nBut how to determine which gaps to choose. \n\nLet me think of the gaps as positions where inserting 1s can be done. \n\nThe priority is to insert 1s into the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not lead to a worse lex order. \n\nFor example, the earliest gap where inserting 1s would not make the lex order worse. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nCollect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed_chars'.\n\nThen, collect all the 1s into a list 'ones'.\n\nNow, we need to insert all the ones into the gaps between the elements of fixed_chars, in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nTo do this, we can iterate through the gaps in order, and for each gap, decide how many 1s to insert there. \n\nThe key is to decide for each gap whether inserting 1s there would be better than inserting them in later gaps. \n\nFor example, consider the gaps between the elements of fixed_chars. \n\nFor each gap, we can compare the current gap's position and the surrounding elements. \n\nThe idea is that inserting 1s into a gap where the left element is as small as possible and the right element is as large as possible. \n\nBut how to formalize this. \n\nLet me think of the gaps. For each gap i (from 0 to len(fixed_chars)), the left element is fixed_chars[i-1] if i>0, else None. The right element is fixed_chars[i] if i < len(fixed_chars), else None. \n\nWe want to insert the 1s into the gaps where inserting them would contribute to the lex smallest string. \n\nFor example, inserting 1s into a gap between a 0 and a 2 would be better than inserting them into a gap between a 0 and a 0, or between a 2 and a 2, or between a 2 and a 0. \n\nWait, inserting 1s between 0 and 2 gives 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than inserting them between 0 and 0 (which would have 0, 1s, 0) or between 2 and 0 (which would have 2, 1s, 0). \n\nBut inserting 1s between 2 and 0 (which is allowed since the 2 and 0 are in the original order) would give 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting the 1s between the 0 and 2. \n\nSo, the best gaps to insert 1s are those between a 0 and a 2. \n\nBut if there are multiple such gaps, where to insert them? \n\nAlternatively, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause a higher lex order. \n\nSo, for each gap in order (starting from the first), we can decide how many 1s to insert here. \n\nThe decision for a gap is based on the following: \n\nIf inserting 1s here would not make the string worse. \n\nFor example, for the first gap (before the first element), inserting 1s here would be good if the first element is 2 (since 1 is smaller than 2). If the first element is 0, inserting 1s here would be bad (since 1 is larger than 0). \n\nSimilarly, for a gap between two elements, say a and b. Inserting 1s here would be beneficial if a is 0 and b is 2. Because inserting 1s here would allow the 0s to be as left as possible, and 2s as right as possible. \n\nBut for a gap between a and b, inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere if the current gap allows for a better lex order. \n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not increase the lex order. \n\nLet's think of this as follows: \n\nFor each gap, in order from left to right, we can insert as many 1s as possible into that gap if it's beneficial. \n\nBut how to determine if it's beneficial. \n\nFor the first gap (before the first element), inserting 1s here would be beneficial if the first element is 2. Because inserting 1s here would replace the first element (2) with 1s followed by 2. Which is better. \n\nIf the first element is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than 0. So we shouldn't insert any 1s here. \n\nSimilarly, for a gap between a and b (a is the left element, b is the right element), inserting 1s here would be beneficial if a is 0 and b is 2. Because inserting 1s between them would allow the 0 to be followed by 1s and then 2. Which is better than having the 0 followed by 2 (without 1s) or 2 followed by 0 (but that's not allowed here). \n\nWait, but the gap between a and b can be between any two elements. For example, between a 0 and a 0. Inserting 1s here would make 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than having the 0s together and the 1s after. \n\nSo, inserting 1s into this gap would be worse. \n\nThus, the idea is that inserting 1s into a gap between a and b is beneficial if the a is 0 and b is 2, or if a is 0 and b is 0 (but that's not helpful), etc. \n\nAlternatively, for each gap, we can calculate the impact of inserting 1s into it. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nPerhaps the following approach: \n\nThe optimal way to insert the 1s is to insert them into the gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, and between a 0 and a 1 (but there are no 1s in the fixed_chars). \n\nWait, no. The fixed_chars list contains only 0s and 2s. \n\nSo, for each gap between a and b in fixed_chars (where a is the previous element and b is the next element), the gap is between a and b. \n\nThe optimal insertion of 1s into the gap depends on the values of a and b. \n\nFor example:\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2: inserting 1s here is good. Because inserting 1s between them makes the string 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than having them in other positions. \n\n- If a is 0 and b is 0: inserting 1s here would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than having the 0s together and the 1s in another position. \n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0: inserting 1s here would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting them between a 0 and 2. \n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2: insert all 1s here. \n\n- If a is 2 and b is 2: inserting 1s here would make 2 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is worse than inserting them between 0 and 2. \n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0: inserting 1s here is worse than inserting between 0 and 2. \n\nSo, the best gaps to insert the 1s are those between 0 and 2. \n\nIf there are multiple such gaps, where should we insert the 1s? \n\nFor example, suppose there are two gaps between 0 and 2. Which one should get the 1s? \n\nIn that case, inserting the 1s into the earliest possible such gap would be better. Because inserting them earlier would allow more 0s to be before the 1s. \n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order into a list called 'fixed_chars'.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s into a list called 'ones'.\n\n3. Iterate through the possible gaps (from 0 to len(fixed_chars)) and for each gap, determine if inserting 1s here is beneficial. \n\n   For each gap, the decision is based on the elements surrounding the gap. \n\n   The priority is to insert 1s into the earliest gaps where inserting them is beneficial. \n\n   For example, the earliest gap that is between a 0 and a 2. \n\nOnce we find such a gap, insert all the 1s there. \n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple such gaps? For example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 2, 0, 2], then there are three gaps between 0 and 2 (the first gap between 0 and 2, the third between 2 and 0 is not, the fourth between 0 and 2). \n\nSo, in this case, inserting the 1s into the earliest gap between 0 and 2 (the first one) would be better than inserting them into the later gaps. \n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\nFind all the gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, and insert the 1s into the earliest such gap. \n\nIf there are no such gaps, then insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap that is not between 0 and 2. \n\nBut how to handle that. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal way to insert the 1s is to insert them into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not make the lex order worse. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each gap in order (from first to last), we decide how many 1s to insert into it. \n\nThe decision is as follows:\n\n- For the first gap (before the first element):\n\n   If the first element is 2, then inserting all the 1s here is better. Because 1 is smaller than 2. \n\n   If the first element is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1, which is worse than 0. So we don't insert any 1s here. \n\n- For gaps between two elements (say, a and b):\n\n   If a is 0 and b is 2, inserting all remaining 1s here is optimal. \n\n   Else, if a is 0 and b is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string have 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than putting the 1s after the 0s. \n\n   So, we don't insert any 1s here. \n\n   If a is 2 and b is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string have 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s between a 0 and 2. \n\n   If a is 0 and b is 2, insert all remaining 1s here. \n\n   If a is 2 and b is 2, inserting 1s here would make 2 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is worse than inserting them between 0 and 2. \n\n- For the last gap (after the last element):\n\n   Insert any remaining 1s here. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Split the original string into fixed_chars (0s and 2s in original order) and collect the 1s.\n\n2. Iterate through the gaps in order (from 0 to len(fixed_chars)), and for each gap:\n\n   a. Determine if inserting 1s here is beneficial. \n\n   b. If so, insert all the remaining 1s here and break. \n\n   c. Else, proceed to the next gap. \n\nBut how to determine if inserting 1s here is beneficial. \n\nLet me think for each gap:\n\nFor the first gap (gap 0):\n\n   If the first element in fixed_chars is 2, then inserting 1s here would be better. \n\nFor example, if the first element is 2, then inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is better than 2. \n\nSo, insert all 1s here. \n\nFor gaps between elements (gap i, between fixed_chars[i-1] and fixed_chars[i]):\n\n   Check if fixed_chars[i-1] is 0 and fixed_chars[i] is 2. \n\n   If yes, then inserting 1s here is optimal. \n\nFor the last gap (gap len(fixed",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible ternary string by performing allowed swaps between adjacent characters. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly but can be rearranged through '1's. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: Split the input string into two parts: one containing all '0's and '2's in their original order, and another containing all '1's.\n2. **Insert '1's Optimally**: Determine the optimal positions to insert the collected '1's between the '0's and '2's such that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest. This involves:\n   - Inserting '1's before the first element if it is a '2'.\n   - Inserting '1's between a '0' and a '2' to maintain the smallest lexicographical order.\n   - If no such positions exist, insert '1's at the end of the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Now, determine where to insert the ones\n    result = []\n    # Check the first gap (before the first element)\n    if fixed and fixed[0] == '2':\n        result.extend(ones)\n        result.extend(fixed)\n        return ''.join(result)\n    \n    # Check gaps between elements\n    for i in range(1, len(fixed)):\n        prev = fixed[i-1]\n        curr = fixed[i]\n        if prev == '0' and curr == '2':\n            # Insert all ones here\n            result.extend(fixed[:i])\n            result.extend(ones)\n            result.extend(fixed[i:])\n            return ''.join(result)\n    \n    # If no 0-2 gap found, check the last gap\n    result.extend(fixed)\n    result.extend(ones)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual test cases\n    test_cases = input_str.split()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(min_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separation of Characters**: The input string is split into two lists: `fixed` which contains '0's and '2's in their original order, and `ones` which collects all '1's.\n2. **Optimal Insertion of '1's**:\n   - **First Gap Check**: If the first character in `fixed` is '2', all '1's are inserted before this character to minimize the lexicographical order.\n   - **Between '0' and '2' Check**: If there is a gap between a '0' and a '2', all '1's are inserted here as this position allows the smallest lexicographical order.\n   - **End of String**: If no suitable gaps are found, the '1's are appended at the end of the `fixed` list.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal positions for '1's while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's, leading to the smallest possible lexicographical string.",
