Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. A step is moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks through a line segment (not just a point) are considered adjacent.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, each block can be considered as a node in a graph, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block.\n\nBut the problem is that there are potentially infinitely many blocks. So how can I model this without enumerating all possible blocks?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Since each road is a line, the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions. The key insight here is that the adjacency between regions depends on the lines. But how can I represent the regions in a way that allows me to compute the shortest path?\n\nAlternative idea: Think of each region as being determined by the signs of the equations of the lines. For example, for each line, a point is either on one side or the other. So for each line, we can determine whether the home point is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university point. Then, the problem becomes similar to navigating through hypercubes, where each dimension corresponds to a line, and the value is the sign of the point with respect to that line.\n\nBut how does that help? Well, the regions are determined by the sign of each line equation. So for each line, the home point has a certain sign (positive or negative). Similarly for the university. Now, moving from one region to another requires crossing a line. Each such crossing changes the sign of exactly one line's equation. So, the adjacency between regions corresponds to differing in exactly one line's sign.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the regions are adjacent across that line. Because if two regions are separated by a line, then they differ in exactly one line's sign. So, the problem becomes equivalent to finding the minimum number of sign differences between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector, where each step can flip one sign.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Because two regions that differ in exactly one sign are adjacent. So, the minimum number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step can flip one sign, so the minimal steps would be the number of differing signs.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there are two lines. The home is in a region that is + for line 1 and + for line 2. The university is in a region that is + for line 1 and - for line 2. Then, the Hamming distance is 1. So, you can move directly across line 2, which is adjacent. So the answer is 1 step. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose the home's signs are (+, +) and the university's signs are (-, -). The Hamming distance is 2. So, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you can cross line 1 first (changing to -, +), then cross line 2 (changing to -, -). So two steps. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what if the lines are arranged such that two regions that differ in two signs are adjacent? No, that's not possible. Because two regions that differ in two signs would require crossing two lines. But each crossing only changes one sign. Therefore, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\n- For each line, compute the sign of the home point (s1) and the sign of the university point (s2). \n\n- Count the number of lines where s1 and s2 differ. That's the minimal number of steps.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a line, changing the sign of that line. So, each step can change exactly one sign. Therefore, the minimal steps needed is the number of differing signs.\n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? For example, if two regions differ in two signs, but there's a way to cross two lines in one step? No, because each step can only cross one line. Because moving between two regions requires crossing a single line. So each step changes exactly one sign.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing signs between the home and university's sign vectors.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the sign for each line for the home and university?\n\nFor each line equation a",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the Crazy Town problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves crossing a road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions by infinite roads (lines). Each region (block) is defined by the signs of the equations of the lines. Moving between adjacent blocks requires crossing a line, which changes the sign of exactly one line equation.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The problem can be reduced to comparing the sign vectors of the home and university positions with respect to each line. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is the Hamming distance between these two sign vectors. This is because each step corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one line equation.\n\n3. **Sign Calculation**: For each line, compute the sign of the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ for a line, it means that the home and university are in different regions with respect to that line, requiring a step to cross it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    home_signs = []\n    uni_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        uni_signs.append(1 if val_uni > 0 else -1)\n\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the equations of the roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. The sign of this value determines which side of the line the point lies on.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: Count the number of lines where the signs of the home and university positions differ. This count gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each differing sign indicates a necessary crossing of a line.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in linear time relative to the number of roads, ensuring it handles the input constraints effectively.",
