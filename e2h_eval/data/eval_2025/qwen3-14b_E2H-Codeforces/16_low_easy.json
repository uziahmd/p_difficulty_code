Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving through a common border between blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the blocks are. The blocks are regions divided by the infinite roads. Each road is a line, and the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions. The movement between blocks is allowed if they share a common border (so, adjacent regions). The challenge is to model this as a graph and find the shortest path between the two blocks.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Well, considering that each block can be represented by some kind of identifier based on the position relative to each road. Since each road divides the plane into two halves, the position of a point relative to each line can be determined. For example, for a line ax + by + c = 0, a point (x,y) will be on one side or the other. So, for each line, the block can be represented by a sign (positive or negative) for each line. However, since there are n lines, the total number of possible combinations is 2^n, but in reality, not all combinations are possible because the lines may not divide the plane into that many regions. But for the purposes of modeling, maybe we can use this sign vector as a way to uniquely identify a block.\n\nBut how do I compute which block the home and university are in? Well, for each line, check whether the home point is on the positive or negative side of the line. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem becomes finding the minimum number of steps between these two sign vectors, where each step allows changing the sign of exactly one line (since moving across a road would flip the sign of that line's equation).\n\nWait, no. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. Each road is a line. So, when you cross a road, you change the sign of that particular line's equation. So, the blocks can be thought of as nodes in a graph, where two nodes are connected if their sign vectors differ in exactly one line. Because that would mean that they are adjacent across that line. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps (each step flipping one bit in the sign vector) to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. However, this seems like a BFS problem where each node is a state (a binary vector of length n, where each bit represents the sign of the point relative to that line). But with n up to 300, this approach is impossible. Because 2^300 is way too big. So there's no way to generate all possible states. Therefore, this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So there's something wrong with my initial thinking. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: The problem is similar to finding the minimal number of hyperplanes (roads) that separate the home and university points. Because each step corresponds to crossing a road. So, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home to the university. \n\nBut how can we compute that? Let's think about the parity of the differences. Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a block, but instead of representing all blocks, which is impossible, we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is the current position (the home or some other point), and transitions are moving across roads. But that's not feasible either, since there are infinitely many blocks.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Wait, no. For example, if the home and university are in regions that are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps would be k. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of each road as a hyperplane. The home and university are points in the plane. The question is, how many hyperplanes (roads) separate them. Because each time you cross a hyperplane, you change the region. So the minimal steps is the minimal number of hyperplanes that you need to cross to get from the home to the university. But how to compute that?\n\nWait, but the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university. But how to compute that?\n\nBut how do roads separate the two points? A road separates the two points if the points are on opposite sides of the road. So, for each road, we can check if the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, then that road is part of the separation. \n\nThe minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we can model the movement between blocks as a graph traversal where each node is a block and edges represent adjacency through shared borders. However, given the constraints of infinite regions and large number of roads, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nInstead of explicitly representing all blocks, we can think in terms of the relative positions of the home and university points with respect to each road. The key insight is that the minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the minimal number of roads that separate these two points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine Relative Positions**: For each road, determine whether the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be done by evaluating the sign of the expression $a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for both points.\n2. **Count Separating Roads**: Count how many roads have different signs for the home and university points. Each such road represents a potential step needed to move from one block to another.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Compute sign for home and university for each road\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n\n    # Count the number of roads where the signs differ\n    steps = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            steps += 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university points, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, calculate the sign of the expression $a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for both the home and university points. This determines which side of the road each point lies on.\n3. **Count Differences**: The number of roads where the signs differ between the home and university points is counted. Each differing sign indicates that the points are on opposite sides of that road, thus requiring a step to cross it.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of steps by directly counting the separating roads, leveraging the properties of linear equations and their separation of the plane.",
