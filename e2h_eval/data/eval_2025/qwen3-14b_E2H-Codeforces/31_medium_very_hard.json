Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Vanya has some cards, and the sum of the found cards needs to be zero. The task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero. The cards he can add must have numbers between -x and x, inclusive. \n\nSo first, let's understand the problem. Let's take the example given. In the first input, the sum of the found cards is -1 + 1 + 2 = 2. So he needs to add cards that sum to -2. Since x is 2, he can add a single card with -2, which gives the total sum zero. Hence the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second example, the sum is -2 + (-2) = -4. The maximum absolute value is 3. So he needs to add cards that sum to +4. What's the minimum number of cards? Well, each card can contribute up to +3. So two cards of +2 each (sum 4) would work, but wait, 2 is within x=3. Wait, but the maximum allowed is x. So for example, if you have two cards of +2 each, that's allowed. But maybe there's a better way. Wait, but 3 is larger than 2. So adding one card of +3 would give sum -4 +3 = -1. Not enough. So adding two cards: 3 +1? No, but the sum needed is +4. So what's the minimum number of cards?\n\nThe maximum per card is 3. So for the required sum of +4, the minimal number is two cards. Because 3 + 1 = 4 (but 1 is allowed). But the problem is that the cards can be any numbers between -x and x. So the minimal number of cards needed to reach a sum of S is determined by how much we can add per card. \n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nCompute the current sum of the found cards. Let's call it total. Then, the required sum is -total. Because total + added_sum = 0 => added_sum = -total. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to target = -total. Each card can contribute between -x and x. \n\nBut since we want the minimal number of cards, we need to maximize the sum per card. So for example, if the target is positive, we can use as many x as possible. Similarly, if the target is negative, use as many -x as possible. \n\nLet me think about this. Let's take the target as T. Let's say T is positive. Then, each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, since each card can contribute up to x. For example, if T is 4 and x is 3, then 4/3 is 1.333, so we need 2 cards. Which is correct. Similarly, if T is 3, then one card. \n\nBut what if T is negative? Let's say T is -5 and x is 3. Then, the required sum is -5. So we can use two cards of -3 and one of +1? Wait no. Wait, the sum of the added cards must be T. So if T is -5, then we can take two cards of -3 each. That gives -6. Which is less than -5. So that's not good. Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of absolute values. \n\nWait, the problem is that the sum of the added cards must be exactly T. So for example, if T is 4, and x is 3. Then, the minimal number of cards is 2: 3 + 1. But if T is 5, then 2 cards (3 + 2). So the minimal number is ceil(T / x). But wait, if T is 5 and x is 3, then 5 /3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. Which works. So yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 is 2, which is correct. So the formula seems to hold. \n\nBut wait, what if T is 0? Then, zero cards are needed. But the problem says that the initial sum may already be zero, so the answer is zero. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given cards. Let's call it current_sum.\n2. The target is -current_sum. Let's call it target.\n3. If target is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach target. Which is ceil( |target| / x ), but wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, for example, if target is 4, x is 3. Then, the minimal number of cards is 2. Because 3+1=4. But 1 is allowed. So the minimal number is ceil(4/3) = 2. Similarly, if target is 5, x=3, then 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So yes. \n\nBut what if target is 3, x=3? Then 1 card. Which is correct. So the formula is correct. \n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( abs(target) / x ), but only if target is not zero. \n\nWait, but what if target is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 is 2. So 2 cards. Which is correct. \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nBut wait, let's take another example. Suppose target is 2, x is 3. Then, you can use one card of 2. So the minimal is 1. Which is 2/3 rounded up. 2/3 is 0.666, ceil is 1. Correct. \n\nSo yes, the formula is correct. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the current_sum of the given cards. Then, target is -current_sum. \n\nIf target is zero, answer is 0. \n\nElse, compute the absolute value of target, divide by x, take the ceiling. \n\nBut wait, what if the target is not exactly divisible by x? For example, target is 5, x=3. Then 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. Which is correct. \n\nBut how to compute this in Python? \n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x. Because for example, 5 +3-1 =7, divided by 3 is 2.333 floored to 2. Which is correct. \n\nYes. So for any integer division, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1 ) // b. \n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and x. Then read the list of numbers. Compute current_sum. \n\ntarget = -current_sum. \n\nif target == 0: print 0. \n\nelse: compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x. \n\nBut wait, let's check the examples. \n\nFirst example: \n\nInput is 3 2, numbers -1, 1, 2. Sum is 2. Target is -2. So abs(target) is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1 )//2 = (3)//2 = 1. Which is correct. \n\nSecond example: input is 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target is 4. (4 +3-1 )//3 = 6//3=2. Which matches the sample. \n\nAnother example: if target is 5, x=3. (5+3-1)/3 = 7//3=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: target is 3, x=3. (3+3-1)/3 =5//3=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: target is 4, x=3. (4+3-1)/3=6//3=2. Correct. \n\nYes, this formula works. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's think about edge cases. \n\nCase 1: current_sum is zero. Output 0. \n\nCase 2: target is zero. \n\nCase 3: x is 1. Then, the minimal number of cards is abs(target), since each card can contribute at most 1. \n\nFor example, target is 5, x=1. So (5 +1-1)/1 =5, which is correct. \n\nAnother case: target is 0. So output 0. \n\nAnother case: when the target is negative. For example, target is -5, x=3. Then, the absolute value is 5, and the same formula applies. Because the minimal number of cards is ceil(5/3) = 2. Because you can use two cards of -3 and -2, but wait, the sum would be -5. So two cards. \n\nYes. So regardless of the sign of the target, the absolute value is considered. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and x. \n\nRead list of numbers. \n\ncurrent_sum = sum of numbers. \n\ntarget = -current_sum. \n\nif target == 0: print 0. \n\nelse:\n\n    minimal_cards = (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x \n\n    print(minimal_cards)\n\nWait, but what if x is zero? No, according to the input constraints, x is at least 1. So no problem. \n\nSo this seems to be the solution. \n\nLet me test the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. target is -2. abs(target) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 → 3//2=1. Correct. \n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output 0. \n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x=5. Then target is -5. abs(target) is 5. (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct. \n\nAnother case: sum is 6, x=5. target is -6. abs is 6. (6 +5-1)/5 = 10//5=2. Which is correct. Because 5 + 1 =6, but with two cards. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to handle all cases. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input. The first line is two integers, n and x. The second line is n integers. \n\nIn Python, we can read from stdin. \n\nBut note that in the input examples, the input is given as a list of strings. But in practice, the code should read from stdin. \n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the first line as n and x. \n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers. \n\nCompute current_sum = sum(list). \n\ntarget = -current_sum. \n\nif target ==0: print 0. \n\nelse:\n\n    compute (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x \n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? But according to the problem statement, x is at least 1. So no problem. \n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and x. \n\nThen read the list. \n\nsum_found = sum(list)\n\ntarget = -sum_found\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nYes. \n\nLet me test the sample input. \n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2. list is [-1,1,2]. sum is 2. target is -2. \n\nabs(target) is 2. (2 +2-1) //2 → 3//2=1. Correct. \n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3. list is [-2,-2]. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1) //3 → 6//3=2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, [0]. sum is 0. target is 0. output 0. \n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, [1]. sum is 1. target is -1. abs(target) is 1. (1 +1-1 )//1 =1//1=1. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, [-1]. sum is -1. target is 1. (1 +1-1)//1=1. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: sum is 3, x=2. target is -3. abs is 3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which is correct: 2 + 1 =3. So two cards. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead from stdin. \n\nBut note that in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first input is:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nSo the code can read via input().split().\n\nBut in Python, for reading from stdin, perhaps:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(nums)\n\ntarget = -sum_found\n\nif target ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nYes. \n\nBut let's check the sample input. \n\nSample 1: \n\nn=3, x=2. nums = [-1,1,2]. sum is 2. target is -2. \n\nabs(target) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct. \n\nSample 2: \n\nn=2, x=3. nums = [-2,-2]. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)//3 =6//3=2. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nNow, what about when the target is zero? For example, if the sum of the found cards is zero, then the answer is zero. \n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x=5. target is -5. (5 +5-1)//5 =9//5=1. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should handle all cases. \n\nTherefore, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from integer division. This formula ensures we use the maximum possible value per card (x) to minimize the number of cards needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(nums)\ntarget = -current_sum\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((abs(target) + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines.

The second line contains the values on the found cards.\n2. **Current Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to reach zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum. If this target is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the formula `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`, we efficiently compute the minimum number of cards required. This formula works by dividing the absolute value of the target by the maximum card value (x), adjusting for integer division to ensure we round up when necessary.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards needed using simple arithmetic operations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
