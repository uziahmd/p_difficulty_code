Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem called \"Feed the Golorp\". Let's try to understand what's going on here. The problem says that each golorp's name defines its diet. The output is the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that can be fed to it, or \"false\" if impossible.\n\nHmm. The examples given are strings that look like they might be Befunge code. Oh right, the note says that scientists think the language is Befunge. So maybe the golorp's name is a Befunge program, and we need to find the input that makes it halt, but with some constraints?\n\nWait, the problem says that variables are consumed by the golorps. The variables are digits from 0 to 9. The name of the golorp defines the diet. So perhaps the name is a Befunge program that processes some input, and the variables are the input that needs to be provided so that the program terminates correctly?\n\nBut how does this translate into the problem? The problem says that the number of variables necessary is determined by the shape of the jaws. Maybe the jaws refer to the input mechanism. For example, in Befunge, input is read via the ',' command which takes a character from input. So maybe the number of variables required is the number of times the program reads input.\n\nBut the output is a sequence of digits that must be provided as input to the program such that it halts, and we need the lex smallest such sequence.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because the problem is about simulating the Befunge program with some input, and checking whether it halts, then finding the lex smallest input that makes it halt.\n\nBut Befunge is a 2D esoteric programming language, and simulating it accurately could be complex. However, the problem says that the input is a string that's similar to the samples. So perhaps there's a specific way to parse the input string into a Befunge program and determine what input is needed for it to terminate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem isn't about Befunge at all, but is inspired by it. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that variables are consumed by the golorps, and each golorp's diet is defined by their name. The name is a string that resembles Befunge code. The sample input includes things like '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' which looks like Befunge code with some syntax.\n\nBut perhaps the actual problem is not about simulating Befunge programs, but instead about parsing some kind of pattern in the string that indicates the required input. For example, looking for certain patterns that represent operations and the required input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about parsing the string into a series of constraints. For example, the name may contain parts that indicate how many variables are needed and what conditions they must satisfy.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nInput: ['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' ...]\n\nOutput: '0010'\n\nSo the input string is a Befunge-like code. How can we find the input that makes the program halt?\n\nBut simulating Befunge is tricky. Let's think about what the Befunge code would do. Let's take the first sample input string: ?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.\n\nBreaking it down, perhaps:\n\nIn Befunge, the '?' is a command that pushes a random value (but maybe in this problem's context, it's different). But perhaps the problem is using a simplified version of Befunge, or perhaps the actual code is not Befunge but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is inspired by the structure of Befunge code, where the program has certain instructions that require input, and the variables are the input values. The problem then becomes finding the minimal lex input that allows the program to run to completion.\n\nBut how do I model this? The problem seems very challenging because it requires understanding the Befunge code's behavior and determining the input that would make it halt.\n\nBut given that the sample outputs are possible, perhaps there's a way to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, where each part of the Befunge code imposes certain constraints on the input variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the actual solution is to parse the string for certain patterns. For example, the number of variables required is the number of underscores in the string, or something like that. But that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nFirst sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nOutput: '0010' which is four digits. Let's count the number of variables needed. How many input points are there in the Befunge code?\n\nIn Befunge, the input is read via the ',' command. So perhaps the number of commas in the code equals the number of variables needed. Let's check the first sample input.\n\nLooking at the string: ?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.\n\nI don't see any commas here. Hmm. That's confusing. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are determined by the number of times the program reads input. For example, in Befunge, the program may have multiple instances of commands that read input. Each such instance would correspond to one variable in the input sequence.\n\nBut how to determine that from the given string? The sample input for the first case is a string that may not contain any commas. So perhaps the problem isn't about Befunge after all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about a different language, perhaps similar to Befunge, but with a different syntax. For example, the sample input has parts like ':-___>__', which might be a pattern indicating some operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about a grammar where the input string is a BNF-like expression, and the variables are determined by certain parts of the string.\n\nAnother angle: the output is the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits. So for each position in the input sequence, we need to choose the smallest possible digit that allows the program to terminate.\n\nBut how to model the program's behavior?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the number of underscores in the string. For example, in the first sample input, the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has three underscores. But the output is 4 digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs:\n\nFirst sample output is 4 digits. The input string starts with '?(', then some characters, then ')', then a colon, then some more characters.\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the number of parameters in the function-like syntax. For example, the first sample input starts with ?(...):-... which may resemble a function definition. The part inside the parentheses might be the parameters. Let's count the parameters.\n\nIn the first sample input, the part inside the first parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. How many parameters are there? Well, the parameters could be separated by operators. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about Befunge, but about a different approach. Let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nEach golorp's name is a string that encodes a set of constraints on the input variables. The task is to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that satisfies those constraints.\n\nFor example, the sample input may have some constraints that can be parsed, and the output is the lex smallest sequence that meets them.\n\nBut how to parse these constraints from the string?\n\nLooking at the sample input strings:\n\nSample 1: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nSample output: '0010'\n\nLet me think of the structure. The string starts with ?(...):-...>... The colon may separate the parameters from the rest. The part before the colon may be the parameters, and the part after may be the operations.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is inspired by Prolog syntax. The '?' could be a query, and the rest is a predicate. But again, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is based on the structure of the string, where the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: the problem's title is \"Feed the Golorp\", and the note says that the name is similar to the samples. Looking at the samples, the first sample input's output is 4 digits. Let's count the number of underscores in the first sample's string:\n\nThe first input string is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nInside the first parentheses: '_-_/___*__' â€” there are 3 underscores in the first part (the _-_/ part?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first sample's output length: 4. Let's check the number of underscores in the part after the colon. The part after the colon is ':-___>__.' â€” there are three underscores in that part. But the output is four digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of '>' and '<' symbols. For example, in the first sample, there's ':-___>__.' which has one '>' and one '<'? No, the first sample's output is 4 digits. Not sure.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't getting me anywhere. Let's think differently.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp's name defines its diet. The variables consumed can take values from 0 to 9. The golorp will choose the lex smallest valid sequence. If no valid sequence exists, output false.\n\nSo the problem is to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that satisfies the conditions imposed by the name of the golorp.\n\nBut how to model these conditions?\n\nPerhaps the name of the golorp is a Befunge program, and the variables are the input to this program. The program must halt, and the input is the sequence of digits. We need to find the lex smallest input that makes the program halt.\n\nBut how to simulate Befunge programs to check if they halt?\n\nBefunge is a 2D programming language where the instruction pointer moves in directions (left, right, up, down). The program is written on a grid. The code is executed by moving the instruction pointer over the grid, executing commands.\n\nThe main challenge here is to simulate the Befunge program, given an input string, and determine if it halts. Then, find the lex smallest input that causes it to halt.\n\nHowever, simulating Befunge programs is non-trivial. Moreover, the input to the program is the sequence of digits that we're trying to find. For example, if the program uses the ',' command, which reads a character from input, then each such command would consume one digit from the input sequence.\n\nBut how to model this for the problem?\n\nThe problem says that the input is a single string (the name of the golorp), which is between 13 and 1024 characters long. The output is the lex smallest sequence of digits (or false) that makes the program halt.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Parse the input string into a Befunge program.\n2. Determine how many input digits are required (i.e., the number of ',' commands in the program).\n3. Generate all possible sequences of digits of that length, in lex order, and check if the program halts when given that input.\n4. Return the first such sequence found, or false if none exist.\n\nBut generating all possible sequences is impossible for lengths greater than, say, 5, since there are 10^N possibilities. For N=10, that's 10 billion possibilities. So this approach is computationally infeasible for longer inputs.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way. Perhaps the Befunge program is designed in such a way that the input sequence can be determined through some constraints, like a system of equations or inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Befunge code is structured such that the input digits are used in a way that can be modeled as a series of constraints, which can be solved with backtracking, trying digits from 0 upwards to find the lex smallest solution.\n\nBut how to model the Befunge program's behavior? This seems extremely complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about Befunge at all. Perhaps the name of the golorp is a string that encodes a series of constraints, and the variables are the digits in the input sequence. For example, the string may contain certain patterns that correspond to arithmetic operations, and the input digits must satisfy those operations.\n\nLet me look at the first sample input again: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nThe output is '0010'. Let's see if there's any pattern here.\n\nThe output has four digits. The input string has a part that looks like '-_', '/_', '*_', etc. Maybe each of these represents an operation, and the input digits are operands.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear connection. Another thought: the sample output is 0010, which could be interpreted as a sequence of numbers that satisfies some condition. For example, 0,0,1,0.\n\nBut without knowing the actual logic, this is hard to figure out.\n\nAlternative idea: the problem may be inspired by a specific type of Befunge code that can be modeled as a finite state machine, and the input is determined by the number of steps required to reach a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs, the third input is a very long string, and the output is '0250341', which is seven digits. The fourth input's output is '0101', four digits.\n\nAnother observation: the sample outputs suggest that the number of variables needed is equal to the number of '>' and '<' symbols, or something similar. For example, the first sample has one '>' and one '<' in the string (assuming the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has one '>'), but the output is four digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the string. For example, the first sample's string has several underscores. But again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for hints in the sample inputs and outputs.\n\nSample 1 input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' Output: '0010'.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the input string. The first part is ?(...):-..., which might resemble a Prolog clause. In Prolog, the head is a predicate, and the body is a list of goals. But how does this relate to the problem?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about parsing the string into a series of operations that require the input digits. For example, the number of variables is determined by the number of certain characters in the string.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has three underscores. But the output is four digits. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: the output is the lex smallest sequence, which suggests that the solution involves trying digits in order from 0 upwards, and for each position, choosing the smallest possible digit that allows the rest of the sequence to be filled in.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem where each digit in the input sequence has certain constraints, and we need to find the lex smallest sequence that satisfies all constraints.\n\nBut how to derive these constraints from the input string?\n\nPerhaps the input string is a Befunge program that uses the input digits in a certain way, and the constraints are derived from the program's execution path. However, without knowing the exact Befunge code's behavior, this is difficult.\n\nBut given that the problem is from a competitive programming context, there must be a pattern or a way to model the problem without simulating Befunge.\n\nAnother idea: the name of the golorp is a string that represents a series of operations, and the variables are the digits in the input sequence. For example, each '_' represents a digit, and the operations are arithmetic operations. The sample output may be the result of solving these operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me look at the first sample's input string again. It has parts like '_-_', '/_', '*_', which might suggest subtraction, division, multiplication. Perhaps the variables are used in these operations, and the goal is to find a sequence that satisfies some condition, like the result being zero or something.\n\nFor example, suppose that the program evaluates an expression involving the input digits and requires that the final result is zero. Then, the input digits must satisfy that condition.\n\nBut how to know what the condition is?\n\nAlternatively, the sample output for the first input is '0010', which could be the digits used in an expression that evaluates to zero.\n\nFor example, let's imagine the input is four digits: d1, d2, d3, d4. The expression could be something like ((d1 - d2) / d3) * d4 = 0. If d3 is not zero, then this would require that (d1 - d2) is zero, so d1 = d2. And d4 can be anything. The lex smallest would be 0000, but the sample output is 0010. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression is (d1 - d2) / (d3 * d4) = 0. Which would require that d1 = d2. The lex smallest would be 0000. Again, not matching the sample.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAnother sample: the third input's output is '0250341' which is seven digits. The input string is very long. Perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon?\n\nThe third sample input's string is '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', and the output is '0250341' which is seven digits. Let's count the underscores in the part after the colon.\n\nThe part after the colon is ': -__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.'\n\nAssuming that the part after the colon is the body of the program, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of commas. In this case, there are five commas, but the output is seven digits. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is the number of underscores in the part inside the parentheses. The first part of the string is ?(...) where the ... is a long sequence of underscores and operators. Let's count the underscores in that part.\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is \"______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\". Let's count the underscores:\n\nThe first part is a series of underscores: 20 underscores? Let's see:\n\nThe string is \"______________________\" which is 20 underscores? Or maybe more. But then followed by /, then ____ (three underscores), +, then _______ (five underscores), * etc. It's hard to count manually, but the output is seven digits. So perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem statement again. It says that the golorp's jaws determine the number of variables needed. Variables get to the stomach only via the jaws. So the number of variables is determined by the jaws' structure. Perhaps the jaws are the parts of the program that read input, like the number of commas in Befunge.\n\nIf I assume that the number of variables needed is equal to the number of commas in the string, then for the first sample input, which has no commas, the number of variables would be zero. But the sample output has four digits, so this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of '?' in the string. The first sample has one '?', but the output is four digits. No.\n\nAnother idea: the problem is not about Befunge at all, and the name is just a red herring. The actual problem is to parse the string according to a specific format and generate the lex smallest sequence based on that.\n\nLooking at the sample outputs:\n\nSample 1: input string starts with ?(...) :- ... > ... . The output is 0010.\n\nSample 4 input: ?(__+___+__-___):-___>__. Output is 0101.\n\nLet's look at the part after the colon in sample 4: ':-___>__.' which has three underscores before the '>'. The output is four digits. Not sure.\n\nWait, the output for sample 4 is 0101, which is four digits. The part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has three underscores before the '>'. Maybe the number of underscores before the '>' is the number of variables minus one? Like, three underscores would imply four variables. That fits the first sample: in sample 1, after the colon, there are three underscores before the '>', so four variables. Sample 4 also has three underscores before the '>', and four variables. The third sample's output has seven digits. Let's look at its string.\n\nThe third sample's input is: ?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.\n\nThe part after the colon is :-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.\n\nLet's look for the number of underscores before a certain symbol. For example, the part after the colon starts with :-__<... So two underscores before the '<'. But there are multiple commas. Let's count the commas: there are five commas. The output is seven digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of commas plus some other number. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in the first sample, the output is four digits. The string contains the sequence ':-___>__.' which has three underscores followed by '>'. Perhaps the number of variables is the number of underscores plus one. For example, 3 + 1 = 4. Sample 4 has three underscores before '>', leading to four variables. Third sample's string has parts with varying numbers of underscores, but the output is seven digits. Let's see:\n\nThe third sample's string after the colon is : -__<___, ... Let's see if there's a part with six underscores. For example, in the part '_____<______', there are five underscores followed by a '<' and then six underscores? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of '<' or '>' in the string. For example, in the first sample, there is one '>' and one '<' in the string. But the output is four digits. Not sure.\n\nThis approach is not yielding results. Perhaps I need to think of the problem as a puzzle where the input string is structured in a way that the number of variables is determined by the number of certain characters, and the actual values are determined by some simple rules.\n\nFor example, the number of variables is equal to the number of '+' signs plus the number of '-' signs plus the number of '*' signs plus the number of '/' signs. But again, this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first sample output: '0010'. This could be the minimum sequence of digits that satisfies some condition like having the sum of digits equal to 1 (0+0+1+0=1), but why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the lex smallest sequence of digits where each digit is chosen such that it's the smallest possible, and the sequence is valid for the program. But without knowing what valid means, this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for hints from the examples and try to find a pattern.\n\nSample 1: output is 0010. Let's think about how this could be generated.\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part inside the parentheses. Let's count:\n\nFor the first sample's input, inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. Let's count the underscores:\n\nThe first part is '_-_', which has one underscore. Then '/___' has three underscores. Then '*__' has two underscores. Total of 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. But the output is four digits. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the number of variables is equal to the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, in the first sample, after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has three underscores. Output is four digits. Hmm, 3 + 1 = 4. So maybe the number of variables is the number of underscores in the part after the colon plus one? Let's check the fourth sample.\n\nFourth sample input: ?(__+___+__-___):-___>__. After the colon is ':-___>__.' which has three underscores. Output is four digits. Yes, matches. Third sample's output is seven digits. Let's look at the part after the colon in the third sample's input: ':-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.' Let's count the underscores in this part. \n\nThe part after the colon is '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.' Let's look at the first part: '__<___' has two underscores followed by '<' and then three underscores. Then the next parts have increasing underscores. But counting all underscores in this part might be tedious, but let's try:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- __<___: 2 + 3 = 5 underscores?\nWait, the part is \"-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.\"\n\nLet's split into parts separated by commas:\n\n1. -__<___ â†’ the underscores are \"__\" (before <) and \"___\" (after <). So total 2 + 3 = 5.\n2. ___<____ â†’ 3 + 4 = 7.\n3. ____<_____ â†’ 4 + 5 = 9.\n4. _____<______ â†’ 5 + 6 = 11.\n5. ______<_______ â†’ 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nTotal underscores across all parts: 5 +7+9+11+13 = 45. But the output is seven digits. So this approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nAnother idea: the number of variables is determined by the number of commas in the part after the colon. For the third sample, there are five commas, and the output is seven digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of '<' or '>' in the string. For the first sample, there is one '>' and one '<', total two, but the output is four digits. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem from a different perspective.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp is very health-conscious and chooses the lex smallest sequence. Lex smallest means that we should try digits from 0 to 9, in order, for each position, and for each choice, recursively check if the rest can be filled.\n\nThis suggests that the solution is to perform a backtracking search, trying digits in order from 0 upwards for each position, and checking if the current partial sequence can lead to a valid solution.\n\nBut how to check if a particular sequence is valid?\n\nIf I can model the validation process, then I can perform this backtracking.\n\nBut what is the validation process? It depends on the golorp's name. If the name is a Befunge program, then the validation is whether the program halts when given the input sequence.\n\nBut how to simulate Befunge?\n\nWell, Befunge is a 2D language with a stack, and the program is executed by moving the instruction pointer around the grid. The input is read via the ',' command, which pushes the ASCII value of the next input character onto the stack.\n\nSo, for example, if the program has three ',' commands, then the input sequence must be three characters long. Each ',' reads one character from the input.\n\nThe program halts when it goes out of bounds or encounters a certain command (like the '@' command, which terminates the program).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor a given Befunge program (the golorp's name), determine the number of ',' commands in it. Let this be N. Then, find the lex smallest sequence of N digits such that when this sequence is provided as input to the Befunge program, it halts.\n\nIf no such sequence exists, output \"false\".\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's check the samples.\n\nSample 1 input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nAssuming this is a Befunge program, let's count the number of ',' commands. But the string doesn't contain any commas. So N=0. But the output is four digits. This contradicts the assumption.\n\nHmm, that suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the program is not Befunge, but a different language where the input is read via other commands. For example, in Befunge, the '!' command is a conditional skip, and the '.' is for output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the program is written in a different esoteric language, and the input is determined by the number of certain characters in the string.\n\nBut without knowing the actual language, this is impossible to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another approach. Perhaps the problem is a variation of a known programming problem, and the name is a red herring.\n\nLooking at the sample inputs and outputs again, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the string. For example, the first sample's output is four digits, and the string has 3 + 3 = 6 underscores (not sure), but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the string. For example, the first sample has '-', '/', '*', '-', '*', '-', which is 6 operators, but the output is four digits. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the number of variables is determined by the number of colons in the string. But the first sample has one colon, and the output is four digits. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of parentheses. The first sample has one set of parentheses, so one variable. No, the output is four digits.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a way to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, assuming that the input string encodes a series of constraints on the digits.\n\nFor example, the string might contain parts like ':-___>__', which could represent a constraint that the sum of the first three digits is greater than the fourth.\n\nBut this is pure speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the string might represent a series of operations that must evaluate to zero. For example, the first sample's output is 0010. Let's say that the operations are something like (d1 - d2) / (d3 * d4) = 0. This would require d1 = d2, and d3 and d4 not zero. The lex smallest would be 0010, which fits.\n\nBut how to derive this from the string?\n\nThe string has parts like '_-_', which could represent d1 - d2. Then '/___' could be divided by d3, and '*__' multiplied by d4. But this is very hand-wavy.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the first sample, the constraint is (d1 - d2) / (d3 * d4) = 0. This would require d1 = d2, and d3 * d4 â‰  0. The lex smallest sequence is 0010, where d1=0, d2=0, d3=1, d4=0. Wait, but d3 * d4 would be 1 * 0 = 0, which would cause a division by zero. That's invalid. So this can't be the case.\n\nHmm. This suggests that my assumption is wrong.\n\nAnother possibility: the constraint is (d1 - d2) / (d3) * d4 = 0. This would require either d1 = d2, or d4 = 0. The lex smallest sequence would be 0000, but the sample output is 0010. Why is that?\n\nMaybe there are additional constraints. For example, the program may require that the division is valid, so d3 cannot be zero. In this case, the lex smallest would be 0010, where d3 is 1, and d4 is 0. This would satisfy (0-0)/1 * 0 = 0, which is valid.\n\nSo this could be possible. But how to derive this from the string?\n\nThe string has '_-_/___*__' which could represent (d1 - d2) / d3 * d4. If this expression must evaluate to zero, then the constraints are d1 = d2 or d4 = 0, and d3 â‰  0.\n\nThe lex smallest sequence would be 0000, but that would make d3 = 0, which is invalid. So the next option is 0001 (d4=1), but then the expression is (0-0)/0 * 1, which is division by zero. Invalid. Next, 0010: d3=1, d4=0. This gives (0-0)/1 * 0 = 0, which is valid. So this is the lex smallest valid sequence.\n\nThis matches the sample output of 0010.\n\nThis suggests that the input string encodes an expression that must evaluate to zero, and the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the expression.\n\nIn this case, the first sample's expression has four variables (d1, d2, d3, d4), which corresponds to the four underscores in the expression '_-_/___*__' (wait, let's count: '_-_' is 2 underscores, '/___' is 3, '*__' is 2. Total 2+3+2=7 underscores. Not matching four variables. Hmm. So this approach is not directly applicable.\n\nBut perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of operators. For example, each operator separates variables. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the number of variables is determined by the number of operators plus one. For example, in the expression '_-_/___*__', there are three operators: '-', '/', '*' â†’ 3 operators, so 4 variables. This matches the sample's four variables. This seems promising!\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nIn the first sample's expression part, '_-_/___*__', the operators are '-', '/', '*'. So three operators, four variables. This matches the output length of four.\n\nThe fourth sample's input is ?(__+___+__-___):-___>__. The part inside the parentheses is __+___+__-___, which has three operators: '+', '+', '-', so four variables. The output is 0101, which is four digits. This fits.\n\nThe third sample's input has a long expression inside the parentheses. Let's count the operators in that part. The part is ______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___.\n\nLet's break it down into operators:\n\n- The first part is a series of underscores, then '/'. So one operator so far.\n- Then '____+...' â†’ '+'\n- Then '_______*...' â†’ '*'\n- Then '__-...' â†’ '-'\n- Then '_____*...' â†’ '*'\n- Then '______-___' â†’ '-'\n\nSo total operators: /, +, *, -, *, - â†’ 6 operators. So number of variables is 6 + 1 = 7. Which matches the third sample's output of seven digits. This seems to fit!\n\nGreat! So this appears to be the key insight. The number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the part inside the parentheses of the golorp's name.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Parse the input string to extract the part inside the first set of parentheses. This part is the expression that defines the constraints on the variables.\n\n2. Count the number of operators (like +, -, *, /) in this expression. The number of variables is this count + 1.\n\n3. Generate the lex smallest sequence of digits (0-9) of this length, such that when evaluated as an expression, it evaluates to zero. But wait, why zero? Because in the first sample, the expression evaluates to zero.\n\nBut how to determine what the expression evaluates to? It seems that the expression must evaluate to zero, but how to know that from the input string?\n\nLooking at the first sample, the output is 0010, which evaluates the expression to zero. The fourth sample's output is 0101. Let's see what that would be.\n\nThe fourth sample's expression is __+___+__-___, which with variables d1, d2, d3, d4 would be d1 + d2 + d3 - d4. For the output 0101, this is 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 = 0. So it evaluates to zero. So it seems that the constraint is that the expression evaluates to zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the lex smallest sequence of digits (each between 0-9) of length N (where N is the number of operators in the expression inside the parentheses + 1) such that when the expression is evaluated with these digits as variables, it equals zero.\n\nBut how to parse the expression from the string?\n\nThe expression is inside the first set of parentheses in the input string. For example, in the first sample, the string starts with ?(...):-..., so the part inside the first parentheses is the expression.\n\nOnce we have the expression, we need to parse it into an arithmetic expression, where each underscore represents a variable (d1, d2, ..., dN), and the operators are the operators in the string.\n\nSo, for example, the expression '_",
