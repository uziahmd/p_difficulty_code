He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and we need to convert it to base b, handling Roman numerals when required.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps needed:\n\n1. Read a and b (or R) from the first line.\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. If b is 'R', convert that decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n5. Else, convert the decimal integer to base b, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n6. Output the result without leading zeros.\n\nSo the main steps are converting the input string to decimal, then converting to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\nLet's think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value. However, if c is zero, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number isn't zero. But for other cases, maybe c can be zero? Wait, the input says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. For other cases, the number may be zero? Well, the note says that in any other case, the number won't be greater than 1e15. But the input can have c as zero, but when converting to base b (non-R), we need to output zero correctly. But according to the problem statement, the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nSo, the first step: converting a string in base a to decimal. How to do that?\n\nFor example, if the input is '1111001' in base 2, then converting to decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc. So, the standard way is to process each digit, multiply current total by a and add the digit's value.\n\nBut the digits can be letters, like 'A' in the example where base is 12. So, for example, the input 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, for the conversion from base a to decimal, each character in the string c must be converted to its numeric value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So, for a given character, we can check if it's a digit or a letter. So, for a digit, we can take its int value. For letters, uppercase, perhaps? Well, the input says that the input c is given as a string, but the problem says that when the input is in base a, the digits are as per the standard, but since the input is given as a string, perhaps the letters are uppercase? Well, the problem says that in the input, the third part is an integer c. But how are the digits represented? For example, if the base is 12, then digits go up to 11, which would be represented as 'A' or 'B'? The problem says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So, the input c's digits are in the same format. So, for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nTherefore, when converting the input c to decimal, each character in the string must be converted to its corresponding value. So, for each character in the string:\n\n- If it's a digit (0-9), then its value is int(c).\n- If it's a letter (A-Z), then its value is 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, the input c may have letters only if the base a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So, during the conversion, we need to process each character of the string into its numeric value.\n\nSo, for example, the input 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal would be:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the input has lowercase letters? The problem says that the input is given as a string, but the sample input includes 'A' in one case. For example, the sample input includes '12 13\\nA' which is converted to 'A' in base 13. But since the problem says that the input is correct, perhaps the input c is given with uppercase letters for digits beyond 9. So, we can assume that the input is in uppercase.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we should process the input as uppercase. So, perhaps the code should convert the input string to uppercase first. But the problem says that the input is correct, so perhaps the input c is given in the correct format. So, for example, if the input is 'A', then it's 10 in base 12.\n\nSo, during the conversion, we can process each character as follows.\n\nNow, once we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nSo, the next step is to handle the conversion to base b, or to Roman.\n\nLet's split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, convert the decimal number to base b, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, handling case 1.\n\nConverting a decimal number to base b:\n\nThe standard approach is to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect the remainders. However, we need to handle 0 correctly. For example, if the decimal number is zero, the output is '0' (but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the input is not zero. But for other cases, the input could be zero. However, in the problem statement, the input c may be zero. For example, if the input is 'a=10, b=2, c=0', then the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the case where Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. So, when converting to base b (non-R), we need to handle zero.\n\nSo, for converting decimal to base b:\n\nIf the number is zero, output is '0'.\n\nElse:\n\nWe collect the digits in reverse order. For each remainder, we convert it to the corresponding character. For example, if the remainder is 10, then it's 'A', etc.\n\nSo, code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero? For example, the input c is zero. Then, the code returns '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input c may be zero, but when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So, for example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0, then output is '0'.\n\nNow, for case 2: converting to Roman numerals.\n\nThe Roman numerals have specific rules. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest, and subtract as much as possible.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value, we append the symbol as many times as the number divided by the value, and subtract accordingly.\n\nSo, for example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, etc.\n\nSo, the code for converting a decimal number to Roman numerals would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman conversion will be less than or equal to 3000. So, the code should handle numbers up to 3000. Also, the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input includes '16 R\\n5' which is 5 in decimal. The output is 'V'.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 R\\n4', which is 4 in decimal, output is 'IV'.\n\nSo, the code for Roman numerals seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead a and b. Note that b can be 'R' or an integer between 2 and 25.\n\nRead c as a string.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert to base b.\n\nBut first, need to handle the conversion from c to decimal.\n\nBut what about leading zeros in c? For example, if c is '001' in base 10, it's 1 in decimal. So the code for converting to decimal handles that correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the code needs to read from stdin. The input is given as two lines: first line is a and b, second line is c.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the sample input:\n\nThe first line is '10 2', then the second line is '1'.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is a list of test cases. Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a...\n\nSo, each test case is two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because in the problem statement, the input is two lines. However, in the sample input, it's given as multiple lines. Maybe the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case. Or perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases, but the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem's formatting. For example, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual program is supposed to process one test case per input.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, for example, the first input is '10 2\\n1' which would be a=10, b=2, c=1. The output is '1' which is correct.\n\nSo, the code should read two lines: first line is a and b (with b possibly being R), second line is c.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. However, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem's formatting. Because the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nSo, the code should read two lines from stdin. So, in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\na_and_b = input().split()\na = a_and_b[0]\nb = a_and_b[1]\nc = input().strip()\n\nWait, but the first line may have a and b. For example, if the first line is '16 R', then a is 16, b is R.\n\nBut in code, the first line is split into two parts. So, for example, the first line is split into two parts, a and b.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = line1[0]\nb = line1[1]\nc = input().strip()\n\nBut then, for example, if the first line is '10 2', then a is '10', b is '2'. Then, the second line is the c string.\n\nNow, the problem says that a and b are integers between 2 and 25, except that b can be R. So, in code, a is parsed as an integer, and b is either an integer or 'R'.\n\nSo, the code needs to parse a as an integer. For example, a = int(line1[0]), and then check if line1[1] is 'R' or an integer.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead line1 as a list split by whitespace. Then, a is line1[0], converted to integer. Then, b is line1[1], which can be 'R' or a string that can be converted to an integer.\n\nOnce we have a and b, and the string c, then proceed to convert c to decimal.\n\nNow, converting c to decimal.\n\nImplementing the function to convert the string c in base a to decimal. Let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, c is '0' in base a. Then, the decimal is 0.\n\nAnother example: c is '000' in base 10, which is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So, for example, if the input is a=10, b=R, c=0, then according to the problem statement, this case is not possible. But in other cases, like when converting to base 2, c can be zero.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut wait, what if the base is 10 and the input is 'A'? That would be invalid, but according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So, the code can assume that the input c is a valid number in base a.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal is okay.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then proceed to convert to target base.\n\nNow, handling the case where b is 'R':\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert the decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert to base b.\n\nBut in code, for the case when b is not R, we need to parse b as an integer. So:\n\nif b == 'R':\n    # convert to roman\nelse:\n    target_base = int(b)\n    # convert decimal to target_base\n\nNow, the code for converting decimal to base.\n\nBut what if the decimal is zero? For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then, the output is '0'.\n\nBut in the code for decimal_to_base, when n is zero, returns '0'.\n\nBut what if the input is zero and the target base is R? According to the problem statement, that case is not present.\n\nSo, now, putting all together.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead a and b from first line.\n\nRead c from second line.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (n).\n\nif b is 'R':\n\n    convert n to roman numerals.\n\nelse:\n\n    convert n to base b.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut need to handle the case where n is zero. For example, if c is '0' in base a, then the output is '0' in base b (unless b is R, which is not allowed here).\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, in Python, reading the input. Let's code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    line1 = input().split()\n    a = int(line1[0])\n    b = line1[1]\n    c = input().strip()\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n    else:\n        target_base = int(b)\n        result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, target_base)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but let's test this code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nDecimal value is 1. Converting to base 2: 1. Output is '1'. Which matches sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nDecimal value is 5. Roman is 'V'. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nDecimal is 4. Roman is 'IV'. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nThe decimal value of 1111001 in base 2 is:\n\nLet's compute: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2: 121 in binary is 1111001. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nA in base 12 is 10 in decimal. Converting to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nAnother test case: input a=2, b=10, c=1010. Decimal is 10. Output is '10'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c=255. Output is 'FF'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=R, c=3000. Output is 'MMM'.\n\nBut what about numbers that require subtractive notation?\n\nLike 4 is IV, which is handled correctly.\n\nWhat about leading zeros in the output?\n\nThe problem says to omit leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is zero, output is '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nIn the decimal_to_base function, when n is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, the code collects digits and reverses them. For example, if the decimal is 0, returns '0'.\n\nBut for other cases, for example, if the decimal is 5, and target base is 10, returns '5'.\n\nAnother case: if the decimal is 0 and the target base is 2, returns '0'.\n\nBut what if the input c is zero and the target is R? According to the problem statement, this case is not possible.\n\nNow, what about when the input is c is zero, but the target is not R. For example, a=10, b=2, c=0. The code returns '0'.\n\nBut in the code, the function decimal_to_base returns '0' in that case.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base b which is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, the input for a and b are between 2 and 25. So, the code does not have to handle base 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where c is zero, and target is base 10. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: c is '0' in base a=2. Then decimal is 0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: c is '0000' in base 10. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 25, which uses digits up to 24. For example, decimal 24 is 'O' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 is O).\n\nBut the code uses ord('A') + rem - 10. For rem=24, that's 24-10=14, so ord('A') +14 = 65 +14=79, which is 'O'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: converting decimal 0 to base 2. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting decimal 1 to base 2. Output is '1'.\n\nAnother case: converting decimal 10 to base 16: 'A'.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer, so it's not empty. So, the code can assume that c is a non-empty string.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when converting to base R, the number is 0. But the problem says that in that case, the input is not zero.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the function to_decimal. For example, if the input c is 'A' in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. The code processes each character. For 'A', it is not a digit, so digit is ord('A') - ord('A') +10 = 0 +10=10. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 'Z' in base 36 would be 35, but the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25, so the code can handle up to base 25. For example, in base 25, the maximum digit is 24, which is 'Y' (since 10 is A, 24 is 'Y').\n\nBut the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\ndecimal_value is 1. Converted to base 2: 1. Output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\ndecimal_value is 5. Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\ndecimal_value is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\ndecimal_value is 121. Converted to base 2 is 1111001. Output is same.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\ndecimal_value is 10. Converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is a=5, b=10, c=10. The decimal value is 5. Output is '5'.\n\nAnother test case: input a=10, b=16, c=255. Output 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=10, c=1010. Output is 10.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these.\n\nNow, code is correct.\n\nNow, implement the code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when reading input, sometimes there can be issues with leading/trailing whitespaces. For example, when reading the second line, input().strip() is used. But the problem says that c may contain leading zeros, but the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: Convert the given number from its original base to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its corresponding value, and accumulating the result.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base is not Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to the specified base. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then converted to the appropriate characters (digits or letters for bases greater than 10).\n3. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target is Roman numerals, use a list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation by subtracting the largest possible values from the decimal number iteratively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    line1 = input().split()\n    a = int(line1[0])\n    b = line1[1]\n    c = input().strip()\n    \n    decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n    else:\n        target_base = int(b)\n        result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, target_base)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the original base and the target base (or 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in the original base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `to_decimal` function processes each character of the input string, converting it to its decimal equivalent based on the original base.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The `decimal_to_base` function converts the decimal number to the target base, handling digits greater than 9 by using letters (A, B, etc.).\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The `decimal_to_roman` function constructs the Roman numeral by iterating through predefined value-symbol pairs, subtracting the largest possible values from the decimal number until it reaches zero.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros and special cases for Roman numerals.",
