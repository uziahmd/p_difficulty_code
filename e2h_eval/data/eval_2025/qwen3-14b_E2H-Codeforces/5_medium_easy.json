Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots based on their colors. The colors can be letters or question marks, which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs. Each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm, how to approach this? Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to find pairs between left and right boots where their colors are compatible. The compatibility rules are:\n- Both are same letter.\n- One is a question mark (which can match any other color, including another ?).\n\nSo, the problem is similar to matching two sets with some constraints. But since the order matters (each left boot can be paired with a right one), I need to find an optimal way to pair them.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies.\n\nAn initial idea: For each left boot, try to find a compatible right boot that hasn't been used yet. But how to maximize the count?\n\nBut since there are n elements, and n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient algorithm. Brute force approaches won't work here.\n\nAlternative approach: Think about grouping the left and right boots by their colors, considering the wildcards.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. For each color (including '?'), count how many left boots have that color. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be matched with any color. So, perhaps we can first match specific colors (non-?) between left and right, then handle the wildcards.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, if a left boot has color 'a', and a right boot has color 'a', they can be paired. If there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, then the excess left 'a's can be paired with right '?', or vice versa.\n\nBut how to model this optimally.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, process all the non-wildcard pairs. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Then, handle the remaining left and right wildcards.\n\nBut also, the wildcards can be used to pair with each other, or with other colors.\n\nWait, but the wildcards can be used in two ways: as a left wildcard (can pair with any right) or as a right wildcard (can pair with any left). So perhaps we need to find the optimal way to use them.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots (l_count[c]) and right boots (r_count[c]).\n\n2. For each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left c and right c is min(l_count[c], r_count[c]). So, we can pair those. Then, subtract those from l_count and r_count.\n\n3. After that, we have leftover left boots (which are either '?' or specific colors that couldn't be matched) and same for right.\n\nBut then, the remaining left and right boots include the '?'s and any leftover specific colors. How to pair them?\n\nThe '?' can be used to pair with any. So, for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair as follows:\n\nFor example, suppose after step 2, we have some left '?'s and right '?'s. Also, there might be some left specific colors that couldn't be matched, and same for right.\n\nSo, the next step would be to pair the remaining left and right boots. However, since the '?' can be matched with anything, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between left '?' and right non-? (if possible), and then pair the remaining with '?'.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs is:\n\nsum over all colors c (non-?) of min(left_c, right_c) + min(remaining_left_question_marks, remaining_right_question_marks) ?\n\nNo, because the remaining left '?' can be paired with any right boots (including non-? ones) that are not already paired. Similarly for the right '?'.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\nFirst, pair all same-color non-? pairs.\n\nThen, collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (could be specific colors or ?) and same for the right.\n\nThen, for each left boot that is not paired (say, color 'a'), we can pair it with a right boot that is either a '?', or a color 'a' (but those were already processed in step 1? Or no?)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of counts.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAfter pairing all same-color non-? pairs, the remaining left boots (left_remaining) and right boots (right_remaining) consist of:\n\nLeft_remaining: for each color c (non-?), the count is l_count[c] - paired (which could be zero if all were matched), plus the number of left '?'s.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nBut the left_remaining includes both specific colors and '?'s. Same for right_remaining.\n\nNow, for these remaining, the '?' can be used to pair with any of the other boots.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs here is the minimum of the total remaining left boots and the total remaining right boots. But that's not necessarily correct, because some of the remaining left and right may have specific colors that can't be matched unless paired with a '?'.\n\nWait, but the remaining left boots (after step 1) are those that couldn't be matched with their corresponding right counterparts. For example, if there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, then the extra left 'a's can be paired with right '?'s, or left '?'s can be paired with right 'a's, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFor the remaining left and right boots, we can pair:\n\n- All left '?' can be paired with any right boots (but only once per boot).\n- All right '?' can be paired with any left boots (but only once per boot).\n- But also, there are left boots with specific colors and right boots with specific colors that can be paired if their colors are same. But since in step 1, we already paired all same-color non-? pairs, perhaps there are no such pairs left. Wait, no. Because for example, if there were left 'a's and right 'a's, but after step 1, maybe we have some left 'a's and some right 'a's left. But why? Because in step 1, for each color, we paired as many as possible. So for example, if left 'a's were 5 and right 'a's were 3, then step 1 would pair 3 pairs. The remaining left 'a's would be 2, and right 'a's would be 0. So, in that case, the remaining left 'a's can't be paired with right 'a's, but can be paired with right '?'s.\n\nTherefore, after step 1, for any color c (non-?), the count of left and right boots for that color are zero, except for one of them. For example, if left had more than right, then the left has some leftover, and the right has zero. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nLeft_remaining: for each color c (non-?), left_count[c] is either zero or the excess (if left had more than right). Plus the count of left '?'s.\n\nRight_remaining: for each color c (non-?), right_count[c] is either zero or the excess (if right had more than left). Plus the count of right '?'s.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the remaining left and right boots can't be paired with same color (except for the '?'s). Therefore, the only way to pair them is via using the '?'s.\n\nSo, the idea is to pair the remaining left and right boots by using the '?'s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nleft_q = number of left '?'s remaining.\n\nright_q = number of right '?'s remaining.\n\nleft_rest = sum over all colors c (non-?) of left_count[c] (the excess left boots that couldn't be paired with their corresponding right ones).\n\nSimilarly, right_rest = sum over all colors c (non-?) of right_count[c].\n\nSo, the total remaining left boots is left_q + left_rest.\n\nTotal remaining right boots is right_q + right_rest.\n\nBut how to pair them?\n\nThe maximum possible pairs would be min( (left_q + left_rest), (right_q + right_rest) ), but that's not necessarily achievable, because the left_rest and right_rest may have specific colors that can't be matched unless paired with a '?'.\n\nBut in reality, the left_rest is all left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched with their own color on the right. Similarly for right_rest. So, for example, a left_rest boot has color 'a', and there are no right 'a's left (since those were already paired in step 1). So, the only way to pair that left 'a' is to pair it with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right_rest boot with color 'b' can only be paired with a left '?'.\n\nSo, the total possible pairs is:\n\nnumber of pairs = (number of left_rest + number of right_rest) can be paired with the '?'s and each other.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example:\n\nleft_rest is the number of left boots with specific colors that can't be paired with same color on the right. Similarly for right_rest.\n\nEach of these left_rest can be paired with a right '?'.\n\nEach of these right_rest can be paired with a left '?'.\n\nAdditionally, the left '?' can be paired with right '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs from this phase is:\n\nmin( (left_rest + left_q), (right_rest + right_q) )\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nThe total number of possible pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of left_rest that can be matched with right '?'s (up to the number of right '?'s).\n\n- The number of right_rest that can be matched with left '?'s (up to the number of left '?'s).\n\n- The remaining '?'s can be matched with each other.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of this as:\n\nWe can pair as many as possible of left_rest with right_q, then pair as many as possible of right_rest with left_q, then pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is:\n\nThe total number of pairs is min( (left_rest + left_q), (right_rest + right_q) ) ?\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nmin( (left_rest + left_q + right_rest + right_q), ... ) ?\n\nNot sure. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nleft_rest = 2 (both color 'a')\n\nright_rest = 1 (color 'b')\n\nleft_q = 1\n\nright_q = 2\n\nSo, total left_rest + left_q = 3, right_rest + right_q = 3. So possible to pair all 3.\n\nHow?\n\nPair the two left_rest 'a's with two right_q (so two pairs). Then the left_q (1) can pair with the right_rest (1) (since right_rest is color 'b', and left_q is '?', which can match. So that's a third pair. So total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example:\n\nleft_rest = 3 (all 'a')\n\nright_rest = 3 (all 'b')\n\nleft_q = 0\n\nright_q = 0\n\nThen, no way to pair. So the total is 0.\n\nBut left_rest + left_q = 3, right_rest + right_q = 3, but min is 3. But actual possible pairs is 0.\n\nAh, so my previous idea was wrong. So, the formula isn't just min( left_rest + left_q, right_rest + right_q ). So that approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the correct way?\n\nIn this case, the left_rest and right_rest can't be matched unless there are '?'s. So, the only way to pair them is to use the '?'s. So, the problem is that the left_rest and right_rest can't be paired with each other unless they are '?'.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of pairs from this phase is:\n\nnumber of pairs = min( (left_rest + left_q), (right_rest + right_q) ) - but only if we can arrange that the left_rest can be matched with the right_q and right_rest can be matched with left_q, etc.\n\nBut how?\n\nSo, the correct approach would be:\n\nWe can pair the left_rest with right_q, up to the minimum of left_rest and right_q.\n\nThen, pair the right_rest with left_q, up to the minimum of right_rest and left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q, which is min( (left_q - used_left_q), (right_q - used_right_q) )\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not the optimal way. For example, maybe it's better to pair some left_rest with left_q and right_rest with right_q, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, no. Because left_rest is specific colors, and right_rest is specific colors. So, they can't be paired with each other unless they are paired with a '?'.\n\nSo, the optimal way is:\n\nWe can pair as many left_rest with right_q as possible.\n\nThen, pair as many right_rest with left_q as possible.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nSo, the total pairs from this phase is:\n\npairs = 0\n\npairs += min(left_rest, right_q) â†’ let's call this part1.\n\nleft_rest -= part1\n\nright_q -= part1\n\npairs += min(right_rest, left_q) â†’ part2.\n\nright_rest -= part2\n\nleft_q -= part2\n\npairs += min(left_q, right_q) â†’ part3.\n\nSo total pairs is part1 + part2 + part3.\n\nBut in the previous example where left_rest=3, right_rest=3, left_q=0, right_q=0: part1 is min(3, 0) = 0. part2 is min(3, 0) = 0. part3 is min(0, 0) = 0. Total 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nleft_rest=2, right_rest=1, left_q=1, right_q=2.\n\npart1: min(2, 2) = 2. left_rest becomes 0. right_q becomes 0.\n\npart2: min(1, 1) = 1. right_rest becomes 0. left_q becomes 0.\n\npart3: 0. total 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nleft_rest=2, right_rest=3, left_q=1, right_q=1.\n\npart1: min(2, 1) = 1. left_rest=1, right_q=0.\n\npart2: min(3, 1) = 1. right_rest=2, left_q=0.\n\npart3: min(0, 0) = 0. total 2.\n\nBut what's the actual maximum possible? Let's see:\n\nWe have left_rest (2) can be paired with right_q (1). Then, left_q (1) can be paired with right_rest (3) â†’ 1 pair. Then, the remaining left_rest (1) and right_rest (2) can't be paired. So total 2 pairs. Which matches the calculation.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this seems like a valid approach.\n\nSo, putting this together, the total maximum pairs is:\n\nsum_pairs = same_color_pairs + part1 + part2 + part3.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), pair as many left and right as possible. Record these pairs.\n\n2. Then, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired). These include:\n\n   a. left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched (left_rest).\n\n   b. left boots with '?' (left_q).\n\n   Similarly for right.\n\n3. Then, apply the three steps (part1, part2, part3) to calculate the additional pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nNow, the problem is not only to compute the maximum number of pairs, but also to output the actual pairs. So, we need to track which boots are paired.\n\nBut given the size of n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient way to process the pairs.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, process the same-color pairs.\n\nFor that, we can create dictionaries to count the occurrences of each color in left and right.\n\nBut for each color c (not '?'), we can pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used? Because for each color, we need to pair left and right boots of that color.\n\nBut for example, if there are multiple left boots of color 'a' and multiple right boots of color 'a', we need to pair them. However, the order in which we pair them doesn't matter for the maximum count, but for the output, any valid pairing is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps for each color c (not '?'), we can collect the list of indices of left boots with color c, and the list of indices of right boots with color c. Then, pair them in a one-to-one fashion, up to the minimum of the two lists.\n\nOnce paired, we mark these indices as used.\n\nBut for large n, we need to do this efficiently.\n\nSo, for example, for each color c:\n\nleft_list = list of indices where l[i] == c.\n\nright_list = list of indices where r[i] == c.\n\nThen, pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) elements from each list.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used? We can have two boolean arrays, used_left and used_right, initialized to False. When we pair a left index i and right index j, we set used_left[i] = True and used_right[j] = True.\n\nSo, for the same-color pairing step.\n\nOnce that is done, we proceed to the second phase, which is handling the remaining left and right boots.\n\nFor the remaining left boots, we can collect:\n\nleft_rest: list of indices where l[i] is not '?' and not used_left[i].\n\nleft_q: list of indices where l[i] is '?' and not used_left[i].\n\nSimilarly for right_rest and right_q.\n\nThen, for the part1 step (pairing left_rest with right_q):\n\nWe can take as many as possible from left_rest and right_q.\n\nFor each left_rest index, we can pair it with a right_q index. So, we can iterate through the left_rest and right_q lists, and pair them until one of the lists is exhausted.\n\nSimilarly for part2 (pairing right_rest with left_q).\n\nThen, part3 is pairing the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can:\n\n- For left_rest, collect all the indices where the color is not '?' and not used.\n\n- For left_q, collect all the indices where color is '?' and not used.\n\nSame for right_rest and right_q.\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can process them as follows.\n\nBut for efficiency, since n is up to 150,000, we need O(n) time.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of booleans of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z' (excluding '?'):\n\n   collect the list of left indices with color c, and right indices with color c.\n\n   for each pair, pair them up to min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\n   for each i in 0 to min-1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nOnce that is done, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, collect:\n\nleft_rest = list of indices i where l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nleft_q = list of indices i where l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_rest = list of indices j where r[j] != '?' and not used_right[j]\n\nright_q = list of indices j where r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]\n\nThen, proceed to pair left_rest with right_q as much as possible.\n\nSo, for part1:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_rest), len(right_q) ) ):\n\n   pair left_rest[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark used_left[left_rest[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nSimilarly for part2: pair right_rest with left_q.\n\nfor i in range( min( len(right_rest), len(left_q) ) ):\n\n   pair right_rest[i] with left_q[i]\n\n   mark used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_rest[i]] = True\n\nThen, for part3, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nTake the min of len(left_q_remaining) and len(right_q_remaining), and pair them.\n\nBut how to track the remaining after part1 and part2?\n\nWell, perhaps after part1, the left_rest and right_q are partially used, but since we are processing them in order, we can take the first min(...) elements.\n\nBut perhaps for code, after collecting left_rest, right_q, etc., we can process them as follows:\n\nWe can create pointers for each list.\n\nBut perhaps for code simplicity, we can generate the lists for left_rest, right_q, etc., and then for part1, take the first k elements from left_rest and right_q, where k is min(len(left_rest), len(right_q)), and pair them.\n\nSimilarly for part2 and part3.\n\nOnce all these steps are done, the total pairs are the same_color_pairs + part1 + part2 + part3.\n\nBut how to collect all the pairs?\n\nWe need to collect all the pairs generated during each step.\n\nSo, the code needs to collect the pairs in a list.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nInitialize a list of pairs.\n\nIn the same_color_pairs step, for each color c, for each i in 0 to min(len(left_list), len(right_list))-1:\n\n   add (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) to the pairs list.\n\nThen, during part1, for each i in 0 to k-1:\n\n   add (left_rest[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) to pairs.\n\nSimilarly for part2 and part3.\n\nBut how to collect the left_rest, right_q, etc. lists?\n\nIn Python, for each of the left_rest, we can loop through all the indices and check if they are not used and their color is not '?'.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, this is O(n) time.\n\nBut for the code, let's think:\n\nleft_rest = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_rest = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nOnce these lists are generated, then:\n\nfor part1:\n\nk = min(len(left_rest), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n   pair left_rest[i] and right_q[i]\n\n   mark them as used (but they are already in the lists, which means they are not used yet. So, after pairing, we need to mark them as used.)\n\nWait, but the lists left_rest and right_q are generated once, and during part1, we are pairing their elements. However, once paired, they should be marked as used.\n\nBut since we are generating these lists once, and during the pairing steps, we can process them in order, and after pairing, we can mark them as used. However, since the lists are generated before the pairing steps, the used flags are not updated yet.\n\nSo, during part1:\n\nfor i in 0 to k-1:\n\n   left_idx = left_rest[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n   add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to the pairs list.\n\n   mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for part2 and part3.\n\nBut in code, after generating the left_rest and right_q lists, during part1, we can pair the first k elements.\n\nBut after that, during part2, we need to collect the remaining left_q and right_rest.\n\nWait, but after part1, the left_rest and right_q lists are modified? No, because the lists are generated once. However, during part1, the elements are marked as used. So, for the part2, when we collect the right_rest and left_q, those are generated once, but during part1, some of the right_q elements may have been used, but since the part1 is handled by processing the first k elements, the rest are not processed.\n\nWait, but the part1 is handled by taking the first k elements of left_rest and right_q. Then, during part2, the left_q and right_rest lists are generated once. However, after part1, the elements in left_rest and right_q may have been marked as used, but the left_q and right_rest lists are generated before part1, so they may include elements that are not used yet. Wait, no. Because during part1, the left_rest and right_q are generated once, and during part1, the elements in left_rest and right_q are marked as used. So, during part2, the left_q and right_rest lists are generated once, and they are the original ones, not modified. So, perhaps the code should generate the lists for left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q once, and then during part1, part2, part3, process them, but mark the used flags accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the same_color_pairs are processed, generate the four lists: left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q.\n\nThen:\n\nFor part1:\n\ntake the first k elements from left_rest and right_q, pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nThen, for part2, take the first m elements from right_rest and left_q, pair them, mark as used.\n\nThen, for part3, take the first p elements from left_q and right_q, pair them, mark as used.\n\nBut in code, the left_rest and right_q are lists generated once. However, after part1, the elements in left_rest[0..k-1] are marked as used, and the rest are still in the list but not used. However, during part2, the left_q and right_rest are generated once. But during part1, the elements in right_q are marked as used, but the left_rest and right_q lists are not modified. So, during part2, when we process right_rest and left_q, the elements in those lists are not used yet.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_rest for part2?\n\nNo, during part1, the left_rest and right_q are processed. The left_rest list contains all the left boots with non-? color that are not used. The right_q list contains all the right boots with ? that are not used. So, during part1, the code takes the first k elements from left_rest and right_q, and marks them as used. The remaining elements in left_rest and right_q are not processed here.\n\nBut for part2, we need to process the right_rest and left_q. So, the code can process the right_rest and left_q lists, regardless of what happened in part1.\n\nBut since part1 uses some of the right_q elements, but during part2, the left_q list is generated once, which is the list of all left ? not used. So, the code is okay.\n\nSo, the code for part1 is:\n\nk = min(len(left_rest), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n   left_idx = left_rest[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for part2:\n\nm = min(len(right_rest), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in range(m):\n\n   right_idx = right_rest[i]\n\n   left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, part3:\n\np = min( len(left_q), len(right_q) )\n\nfor i in range(p):\n\n   left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nWait, but after part1, some elements in left_q and right_q may have been used. But during part1, the left_rest and right_q are processed. The left_q list is generated once, and during part1, some elements of right_q are used. But the left_q list is separate. So, during part2, the left_q list is the same as generated before.\n\nBut during part1, the code processes the left_rest and right_q. So, the left_q list is the list of left ? not used. So, during part1, the left_rest and right_q are processed, but the left_q and right_rest are untouched.\n\nSo, the code for part3 would process the remaining elements of left_q and right_q.\n\nBut in the code above, after part1 and part2, the left_q and right_q lists are still the same as generated before. However, during part1 and part2, some elements may have been marked as used. For example, during part1, the right_q elements are marked as used. But during part3, when processing the right_q list, those elements may have been used already.\n\nWait, no. Because the right_q list is generated once, and during part1, the elements of right_q are marked as used. But during part3, the code is processing the right_q list again. However, in the code above, during part3, the code is taking the first p elements of left_q and right_q, which may include elements that were already used in part1 or part2. That's a problem.\n\nBecause the left_q and right_q lists are generated once, but during part1 and part2, some elements may have been marked as used, but the code for part3 is not checking that.\n\nSo, the code as written would have errors here. For example, during part1, the code marks some right_q elements as used. However, during part3, when processing the right_q list, the code would take the first p elements of right_q, which may have been already used.\n\nThis is incorrect. So, how to avoid this?\n\nAh, the problem is that the left_q and right_q lists are generated once, but during part1 and part2, some elements of these lists may have been used. However, the code for part3 is using the same lists again, which contain elements that may have been used already.\n\nThus, the code must process the left_q and right_q lists in a way that skips elements already used.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate the left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q lists once. Then, during part1, part2, part3, process them, but track which elements have been used.\n\nBut for that, perhaps during part1, we can process the left_rest and right_q lists, and then during part2, process the right_rest and left_q lists, and during part3, process the remaining left_q and right_q lists.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternative idea: after generating the four lists (left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q), we can process them in the order of part1, part2, part3, and for each step, process the elements in the lists that are not yet used.\n\nBut how to track that? For example, during part1, we can iterate through the left_rest and right_q lists, and for each element, check if it's not used. But since these lists were generated before, and the used flags are updated as we go, perhaps during part1, we can process the elements in the lists, but only if they are not used.\n\nBut that would complicate the code.\n\nAlternative approach: during part1, process the left_rest and right_q lists, and for each element, mark them as used. Then, during part2, process the right_rest and left_q lists, and for each element, mark them as used. Then, during part3, process the left_q and right_q lists, but only the elements that are not used yet.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nPerhaps during part1, the code can process the first k elements of left_rest and right_q, and mark them as used. Then, during part2, the code can process the first m elements of right_rest and left_q, and mark them as used. Then, during part3, the code can process the remaining elements of left_q and right_q, but only those that are not used.\n\nBut how to find those elements?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the way to handle it is to generate for each of the four lists, and during the processing steps, keep track of the current index.\n\nFor example, for part1, we can have a pointer i for left_rest and j for right_q, and process as long as i < len(left_rest) and j < len(right_q) and the elements are not used.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the part1, part2, part3 steps, we can generate new lists that contain only the elements not used yet. But that would be O(n) time for each step.\n\nBut given that n is up to 150,000, and each step is O(n), it's manageable.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. After the same_color_pairs step, we have the used_left and used_right arrays. Then, for the part1, part2, part3 steps, the code can generate new lists for each step.\n\nBut perhaps the code can generate the left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q once, and then for part1, process the first k elements, and then for part2, process the first m elements, etc. But during part3, the code would need to process the remaining elements of left_q and right_q that are not used.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, during part1, part2, and part3, the code can process the lists and for each element, check if it's not used. But this may take O(n) time for each step.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, the following approach can be taken:\n\nOnce the same_color_pairs are processed, generate the four lists: left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q.\n\nThen, for part1:\n\nWe can iterate through left_rest and right_q, pairing as many as possible, and marking them as used. However, since the lists may have elements that are already used (due to previous steps?), but no, the lists are generated once and the elements are not used yet.\n\nWait, no. The lists are generated once, and during the same_color_pairs step, the used flags are set. So, during the generation of the four lists, they are generated only for indices not used. Thus, the left_rest, left_q, right_rest, right_q lists contain indices that are not used yet.\n\nThus, during part1, the code can safely process the first k elements of left_rest and right_q, because none of them are used yet.\n\nAfter part1, some elements in left_rest and right_q are marked as used, but the rest are not.\n\nThen, during part2, the code can process the right_rest and left_q lists, which are generated once and contain indices not used yet. Thus, during part2, the code can process the first m elements of right_rest and left_q, and mark them as used.\n\nThen, during part3, the code can process the remaining elements in left_q and right_q. However, during part1 and part2, some elements may have been used. Wait, no. The left_q and right_q lists are generated once, and during part1 and part2, the code is processing other lists. For example, during part1, the code processes left_rest and right_q. So, during part1, some elements of right_q are marked as used. However, during part3, the code processes the left_q and right_q lists. But the left_q list is generated once, and during part1, the code didn't touch it. Similarly, during part2, the code processes right_rest and left_q, which may mark some elements of left_q as used.\n\nThus, during part3, the code needs to process the left_q and right_q lists, but skip those elements that have already been used in part1 or part2.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh, here's the problem. For example, during part1, the code uses some elements from right_q. Those elements are now marked as used. However, during part3, the code is trying to process the right_q list again. So, during part3, the code must not process those elements again.\n\nThus, the code for part3 must process only those elements of left_q and right_q that are not used yet.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOne approach is to generate for part3 the left_q and right_q lists again, but only including elements that are not used. However, this would be O(n) time again.\n\nBut given that this is a programming competition problem, and the code is expected to be efficient, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, during part3, we can iterate through the left_q and right_q lists, and for each element, check if it's not used yet. However, this would take O(n) time for each list.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor part3:\n\nCollect the remaining left_q and right_q elements that are not used yet.\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in left_q if not used",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to pair left and right boots based on their colors, where each boot can be a specific color or an indefinite color represented by a question mark ('?').
