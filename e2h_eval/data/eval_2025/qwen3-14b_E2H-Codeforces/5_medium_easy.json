Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question mark is compatible with any color. I need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Well, the main idea is to match left and right boots in such a way that their colors are compatible. Since the question marks can be matched with anything, but we need to maximize the total pairs.\n\nLet me think about possible steps. Maybe first, we can try to match specific colors first. Like, for each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the number of pairs possible is the minimum of left count and right count. Then, after handling those, we can use the remaining '?'s from both sides to form pairs.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be used to match with any color, including other '?'s. So maybe the approach is:\n\n1. Match all specific colors (non-?) between left and right. For example, for each color c, match as many left c's with right c's as possible. This would be min(left_c, right_c) pairs.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched because their counterparts were already used), we can pair the remaining '?'s. But how?\n\nWait, but after step 1, there might be some left and right boots with colors that are not matched yet. For example, if there are more left boots with color 'a' than right boots with 'a', then after matching the min, there are some left 'a's left. Those can't be matched with any right 'a's anymore. However, they can be matched with right '?'s. Similarly, right '?'s can be matched with left '?'s or left non-?s that are left over.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFirst, process all the specific color matches. Then, process the remaining left and right boots (which may include '?') and match them using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nWe can separate the left and right boots into two groups: those with specific colors and those with '?'.\n\nFor the specific colors, we can create a map for left and right counts. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left[c], right[c]). But once we take those pairs, we need to subtract them from the counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including '?') can be matched by using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to handle the remaining ones?\n\nLet's think. After the initial matching of specific colors, the remaining left boots are:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched (because there were not enough right boots of that color).\n- Left boots with '?'.\n\nSame for right boots.\n\nSo, the remaining left and right boots can be paired in the following way:\n\nEach left '?' can be paired with any right boot (including '?') that hasn't been used yet. Similarly, each right '?' can be paired with any left boot (including '?') that hasn't been used yet. But since we want to maximize the number of pairs, we should pair the remaining left and right boots as much as possible.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nLet me think about the remaining left and right boots. Let's say after step 1, there are L_left '?'s on the left, and R_right '?'s on the right. Also, there might be some left boots with specific colors that could not be matched (but their count is zero on the right side). Similarly for the right.\n\nBut perhaps, the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between left '?' and right '?'. Then, for any remaining left '?' and right non-? (but those are already processed in step 1?), no, because in step 1, the non-?s would have been matched with their same color counterparts. Wait, no. For example, suppose there are left 'a's and right 'a's. We matched them. Now, after that, there may be left 'a's left if there were more left than right. But those left 'a's can't be matched with any right 'a's, but they can be matched with right '?'s.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c (not ?), match left c's with right c's. For each such c, take the min of the left count and right count, and record those pairs. Then, subtract that number from both left and right counts.\n\n2. Now, collect all remaining left boots (those with color not matched in step 1) and right boots. These include:\n\n   - Left boots with color c (specific) that had more left than right. So, for example, left has 5 'a's and right has 3 'a's. After step 1, there are 2 left 'a's remaining.\n\n   - Left boots with '?'.\n\n   - Similarly for right.\n\n3. Now, for these remaining boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\n   a. Pair the left '?' with right '?', as much as possible. The maximum is the minimum of the number of left '?'s and right '?'s.\n\n   b. Then, for the remaining left '?'s and right non-?s (but those non-?s have already been processed in step 1, so they must have no matches. Because for example, if a right boot is 'b', then in step 1, we would have matched it with left 'b's. If there were no left 'b's, then that right 'b' would have been left over. But in that case, it can't be matched with any left boot except '?'.\n\nWait, but after step 1, the right non-?s that are left over are those that couldn't be matched with their own color's left boots. For example, if there are more right 'b's than left 'b's. Then, after step 1, the left 'b's are all used up, but there are some right 'b's left. Those can't be matched with any left 'b's. But they can be matched with left '?'s.\n\nSimilarly, the left non-?s that are left over can be matched with right '?'s.\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining left and right boots can be grouped into:\n\nLeft_non_question: those left boots that have a specific color and couldn't be matched (i.e., their color's count in right was less than left's).\n\nRight_non_question: those right boots that have a specific color and couldn't be matched (i.e., their color's count in left was less than right's).\n\nLeft_question: left boots with '?'\n\nRight_question: right boots with '?'\n\nNow, the next step is to pair:\n\n- Left_question with Right_question: as much as possible.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_question and right_non_question (which have specific colors), pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for remaining right_question and left_non_question.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, if there are left_question (say, L) and right_non_question (say, R). Each of the R can be matched with any left_question. So, the number of possible pairs is min(L, R). Similarly for the other way around.\n\nSo, after step 1:\n\nWe can collect all left_non_question (specific colors) and right_non_question (specific colors). Also, left_question and right_question.\n\nSo, the total possible pairs after step 1 is:\n\nstep1_pairs + min(left_question, right_question) + min(remaining left_question, right_non_question) + min(remaining right_question, left_non_question).\n\nWait, but how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the total possible pairs is:\n\nAfter step 1, the remaining left_non_question can be matched with right_question. Similarly, the remaining right_non_question can be matched with left_question. Also, the remaining left_question and right_question can be matched between themselves.\n\nBut how to arrange this optimally.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nLet me calculate:\n\ntotal_pairs = step1_pairs + min(left_q, right_q) + min( (left_q - matched_q), right_non_q ) + min( (right_q - matched_q), left_non_q )\n\nWait, no. Because after pairing left_q and right_q, the remaining left_q can be used to match with right_non_q, and the remaining right_q can be used to match with left_non_q.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is:\n\nstep1_pairs + (number of pairs between left_q and right_q) + (number of pairs between left_q and right_non_q) + (number of pairs between right_q and left_non_q).\n\nBut since the left_q and right_q can be used to pair with both, but they can't be used twice.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to first pair as many left_q and right_q as possible. Then, use the remaining left_q to pair with right_non_q. Similarly, use remaining right_q to pair with left_non_q.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nLet l_q be the number of left '?'s after step 1.\n\nr_q be the number of right '?'s after step 1.\n\nl_non_q is the number of left non-? boots left after step 1.\n\nr_non_q is the number of right non-? boots left after step 1.\n\nBut how to get l_non_q and r_non_q?\n\nActually, l_non_q is the sum over all colors c (non-?) of (left_count[c] - matched_pairs[c]).\n\nSimilarly for r_non_q.\n\nBut perhaps, during the initial step, we can track for each left and right boot whether they are matched or not.\n\nBut that's probably too complicated. Alternatively, during the initial step, for each color c, we can track how many left and right boots are left.\n\nBut perhaps, instead of tracking counts, we can track for each color, how many left and right boots are available.\n\nBut perhaps, the better approach is to collect all the left and right boots that are not matched in step 1, and then process them.\n\nBut how to collect them? Because in practice, we need to track which boots are used and which are not. Because for the output, we need to print the actual indices of the boots in the pairs.\n\nAh, right! The problem requires that we not only compute the maximum number of pairs but also output the pairs (the indices). Therefore, we need to track which boots are used and which are not.\n\nThis complicates things. Because, for example, in step 1, when we match left c with right c, we need to select which specific left and right boots are matched. For example, if there are multiple left c and right c boots, we can pair them arbitrarily, but we need to track which ones are used.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nWe need to process the boots and track which are used. For each step, we can collect the available boots and pair them accordingly.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n1. For each color c (not ?), collect the list of left boots with color c and the list of right boots with color c. Then, for each such c, pair as many as possible (the minimum of the two lists). For example, if left has m boots and right has k boots, then pair the first min(m, k) of them. Record these pairs and mark those boots as used.\n\n2. After step 1, collect all left boots that are not used (either because they were not matched in step 1 or they are '?') and similarly for right boots.\n\n3. Now, for the remaining left and right boots, we need to pair them. Let's consider:\n\n   a. Pair left '?' with right '?'. For this, take as many as possible. For example, take the first min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) pairs.\n\n   b. Then, pair remaining left '?' with right non-? (but those non-? are not matched yet). For each such right non-? boot, which is not used, we can pair it with any left '?'.\n\n   c. Similarly, pair remaining right '?' with left non-?.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut again, the problem is that we need to collect the indices of the boots that are not used yet. So, perhaps we need to track for each left and right boot whether it is used or not. Then, for step 1, we can process the colors and pair the left and right boots.\n\nBut for large n, this needs to be done efficiently.\n\nLet me think of data structures. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can have a list of indices for left boots with color c, and similarly for right boots. Then, for each color, we can pair the left and right boots as much as possible. For example, for color 'a', if there are 5 left and 3 right, we pair the first 3 left 'a's with the first 3 right 'a's. Then, mark them as used.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left 'a's are not used. Similarly for other colors.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched in step 1, we can collect them into separate lists.\n\nFor example, collect all unused left boots into left_unmatched, and same for right_unmatched.\n\nNow, the left_unmatched can be split into:\n\nleft_q = [boots with color '?'].\n\nleft_non_q = [boots with color other than '?'].\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nWe can first pair left_q with right_q. For example, take as many as possible. Then, pair the remaining left_q with right_non_q, and the remaining right_q with left_non_q.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all the left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nNow, for the left_unmatched and right_unmatched, we can:\n\n- Create a list of left_question (those with '?') and left_non_question (others).\n\n- Same for right.\n\nThen, for the left_question and right_question, pair them as much as possible.\n\nFor example, for each i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))), pair left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nThen, the remaining left_q can be paired with right_non_q. For each such left_q, we can pair it with any right_non_q that hasn't been used yet. Similarly for the remaining right_q.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for the remaining left_q and right_non_q, we can pair them as much as possible. Since each left_q can pair with any right_non_q (since they are not used yet), and vice versa.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is min(remaining_left_q, len(right_non_q)).\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right_q and left_non_q.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor all left_q and right_q, pair them first.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q, pair them with right_non_q.\n\nThen, for the remaining right_q, pair them with left_non_q.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut again, how to collect the left_q and right_non_q, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize arrays to track used_left and used_right (boolean arrays of size n).\n\nThen, for each color c (from 'a' to 'z'):\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   pair as many as possible (min of the two lists). For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nOnce this is done, collect all the left indices not used (left_unmatched) and right indices not used (right_unmatched).\n\nNow, for these unmatched, we need to process the '?'.\n\nSo, collect left_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] == '?'] \n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nNow, process the left_q and right_q:\n\npair as many as possible between them. For example, take the first min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q, pair with right_non_q (any of them). For example, take the first min(len(remaining left_q), len(right_non_q)) pairs.\n\nSimilarly for remaining right_q and left_non_q.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut for the code, the problem is that the left_unmatched and right_unmatched are lists of indices. So, for example, after step 1, we have:\n\nleft_unmatched is a list of indices of left boots not used yet.\n\nSimilarly for right_unmatched.\n\nThen, we can split them into left_q and left_non_q.\n\nSame for right.\n\nThen, for the first part, pairing left_q and right_q:\n\nWe can take the first k pairs, where k is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q (after that), pair them with the right_non_q.\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right_q.\n\nBut how to pair them? For example, for the remaining left_q, we can pair each with any of the right_non_q. Since all of them are compatible.\n\nSo, for example, take the first m elements from left_q_remaining and pair them with the first m elements from right_non_q.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, we can just pair them in any order.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nCollect left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nSplit into left_q and left_non_q, right_q and right_non_q.\n\nProcess step 2a: pair left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, process step 2b: pair left_q_remaining with right_non_q.\n\nThen, process step 2c: pair right_q_remaining with left_non_q.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q and right_q?\n\nNow, the problem is that after step 1, the left_unmatched includes all left boots that are not used. For example, those that couldn't be matched in step 1. For these, their color could be a specific color or '?'.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nOnce step 1 is done, collect all left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nThen, for the left_unmatched, create a list of left_q and left_non_q.\n\nSame for right.\n\nNow, for step 2a:\n\nTake as many pairs as possible between left_q and right_q. For example, for i in range(0, min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q, which is left_q[min(...):], pair them with right_non_q. Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut how to pair them?\n\nFor example, take the remaining left_q and pair them with right_non_q. For each left in left_q_remaining, we can pair with the first available right_non_q.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nAfter step 2a, the left_q_remaining is len(left_q) - k, where k is the number of pairs made in step 2a.\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining.\n\nThen, for step 2b:\n\nTake the number of possible pairs between left_q_remaining and right_non_q. That is, min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_non_q)).\n\nPair them.\n\nSimilarly for step 2c.\n\nBut how to collect the right_non_q? It's the list of right_non_q, which are the right boots that are not used and have specific colors (since they couldn't be matched in step 1).\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nleft_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, left_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_non_q.\n\nOnce these are collected, proceed with pairing.\n\nBut for large n, creating these lists can be O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is that for the code, we need to generate the pairs, which are the indices of the left and right boots.\n\nBut how to manage the order of pairing, since the order may affect the possibility of pairing. However, the problem says that any valid maximum answer is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code can proceed in any order.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   for each pair in min(len(left_list), len(right_list)):\n\n       pair them, mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nFor example, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this approach is O(26n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut for each color, we are scanning all the elements. However, for each color, we can precompute the positions. However, for the code, perhaps the easiest way is to loop through each color and collect the indices each time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, and 26 colors, this would be O(26 * n) = 3.9e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nOnce this is done, collect all the left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nThen, proceed with the steps for the '?'.\n\nOnce all pairs are collected, output the total number of pairs and the list of pairs.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures. For the initial step, for each color, we can loop through all the characters and collect the indices. However, for efficiency, perhaps we can pre-process for each color, the list of indices for left and right.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, we can do:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n   left_list = [i for i, ch in enumerate(l) if ch == c and not used_left[i]]\n\nBut in practice, for each color, we need to check all the elements again. Which is O(n) per color. Which is acceptable for 26 colors.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color, we can precompute a list of indices for left and right, and then process them.\n\nBut perhaps, in code:\n\nWe can have for each color, a list of left indices and a list of right indices. However, since we need to process the colors in order, and for each color, we can process the available left and right boots.\n\nBut during the initial step, we can process each color in order, and for each, pair as many as possible.\n\nOnce that's done, collect the left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nNow, for the code, let's think of the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   for i in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n\n       pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n       used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect the left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nleft_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nNow, split into q and non-q.\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in right_unmatched if r[i] == '?']\n\nright_non_q = [i for i in right_unmatched if r[i] != '?']\n\nNow, process step 2a: pair left_q and right_q.\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_q), len(right_q) )):\n\n   pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\n   used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nWait, but in this case, the left_q and right_q are already in the left_unmatched and right_unmatched, which are not used. So, when we pair them, we need to mark them as used.\n\nBut in the code above, the left_unmatched and right_unmatched are lists of indices not used yet. So, after pairing, they need to be marked as used.\n\nBut in the code above, after collecting left_q and right_q, the code pairs them, and marks them as used. However, the code for the initial step already marked some as used. So, the left_unmatched and right_unmatched are not used. So, in the code, after pairing left_q and right_q, those indices are now used.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to do that? Because in the code, after the first step, the left_q is a list of indices not used. So, when pairing them, the code will iterate over the first k elements, and mark them as used. The remaining elements are not used yet.\n\nBut after that, the remaining left_q (those not used) are the ones not in the first k elements.\n\nBut how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, after pairing left_q and right_q, we can collect the remaining left_q and right_q as:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[k:]\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[k:]\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nk = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n   pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\n   used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, the remaining left_q is left_q[k:], and the remaining right_q is right_q[k:].\n\nThen, for step 2b: pair remaining left_q with right_non_q.\n\nSo, for the remaining left_q, and the right_non_q, pair as many as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining right_q and left_non_q.\n\nSo, for step 2b:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q[k:]]\n\nremaining_right_non_q = right_non_q\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_non_q) )):\n\n   pairs.append( (remaining_left_q[i]+1, remaining_right_non_q[i]+1) )\n\n   used_left[remaining_left_q[i]] = True\n\n   used_right[remaining_right_non_q[i]] = True\n\nSimilarly for step 2c:\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[k:]\n\nremaining_left_non_q = left_non_q\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_right_q), len(remaining_left_non_q) )):\n\n   pairs.append( (remaining_left_non_q[i]+1, remaining_right_q[i]+1) )\n\n   used_left[remaining_left_non_q[i]] = True\n\n   used_right[remaining_right_q[i]] = True\n\nWait, but in this code, for step 2b, we are pairing the remaining left_q with right_non_q. So, for each of the remaining left_q, we pair them with the first available right_non_q. Similarly for step 2c.\n\nBut this would take care of all possible pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_non_q?\n\nBut in code, after step 2a, the remaining_left_q is left_q[k:], and the right_non_q is as collected before.\n\nSo, the code for step 2b would be:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_q) - k, len(right_non_q) )):\n\n   pairs.append( ... )\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\n# Step 2b: pair left_q_remaining with right_non_q\n\nnum_pairs = min( len(left_q) - k, len(right_non_q) )\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   left_idx = left_q[k + i]\n\n   right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for step 2c:\n\n# Step 2c: pair right_q_remaining with left_non_q\n\nnum_pairs = min( len(right_q) - k, len(left_non_q) )\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   left_idx = left_non_q[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_q[k + i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nWait, but in this case, for step 2c, the right_q_remaining is right_q[k:], and we pair them with left_non_q.\n\nBut how to index them? For example, for the first num_pairs elements of right_q_remaining, and the first num_pairs elements of left_non_q.\n\nBut the code above would pair them in this way.\n\nBut perhaps, in code, the step 2b and 2c can be implemented as follows:\n\nAfter step 2a:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[k:]\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[k:]\n\n# Pair remaining_left_q with right_non_q\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_left_q), len(right_non_q) ) ):\n\n   left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n# Pair remaining_right_q with left_non_q\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_right_q), len(left_non_q) ) ):\n\n   left_idx = left_non_q[i]\n\n   right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n   pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this may not be correct. Because in the first loop, for example, if len(remaining_left_q) is 5 and len(right_non_q) is 3, then we pair 3 pairs. The remaining_left_q after that is 2 elements. Then, in step 2c, the remaining_right_q may have len(remaining_right_q) = len(right_q) - k. So, if len(right_q) -k is 5, then in step 2c, we pair with left_non_q. But the code above takes the first len(left_non_q) elements of remaining_right_q.\n\nBut this is acceptable, as any pairing is allowed.\n\nBut what about the order? For example, if we pair left_non_q with remaining_right_q, but there are more right_q_remaining than left_non_q. Then, the code pairs the first len(left_non_q) elements of right_q_remaining.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut let's test with some examples.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would process that correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one, which outputs 0. For example, if the left and right have no compatible pairs.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, considering the code, what about the order in which colors are processed in step 1? For example, if a color is processed first, and then another color. But since the code processes all colors in order, it should not matter, as all possible pairs are considered.\n\nBut what about overlapping? For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', and another left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a'. The code pairs them in order.\n\nNow, the code for the initial step is correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where a left boot is '?', and a right boot is 'a'? In step 1, since the color is 'a', but the left boot is '?', which is not processed in step 1. So, the code would not pair them in step 1, and they would be processed in the later steps.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the code, the problem is that in step 1, for each color c, we collect left and right indices. However, the code uses l[i] == c and not used_left[i]. But since in the initial step, used_left and used_right are all False, the code collects all the left and right indices for that color.\n\nBut for the first step, the code loops through all colors in order, and for each color, pairs the left and right boots. So, for example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', they are paired.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in Python, the code may be too slow for n=1.5e5. Because for each color, we are looping through all n elements. For 26 colors, that's 26 * 1.5e5 = 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, for Python, this is manageable. However, perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternative approach for step 1:\n\nInstead of for each color, collect the indices, we can precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. For example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n\n   right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, we can process them. However, this would miss colors that are not present in l or r. But for the code, we can loop through all possible colors (a-z), and for each, check if they exist in left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nBut even this approach may not be better than the previous one.\n\nBut perhaps, in the code, for the initial step, the code can be optimized by precomputing the lists for each color.\n\nBut perhaps, for the code, the initial approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut the code as outlined earlier may have a problem: when collecting the left_list and right_list for each color, in the initial step, the code checks for not used_left[i] and not used_right[i]. But in the initial step, all are unused, so the code is okay.\n\nBut during the initial step, the code may have multiple passes over the same indices. However, since after pairing, the used_left and used_right are marked as True, the next time the same color is processed, those indices are not included.\n\nBut in the code, for each color, the code re-scans all the elements. So, for example, for color 'a', the code scans all elements again. But this is O(n) per color.\n\nBut perhaps, this is not efficient. However, for the problem constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps it's better to precompute for each color, the list of indices, and then process them, keeping track of which are used.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    # collect left indices with color c and not used\n\n    left_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]:\n\n            left_list.append(i)\n\n    # collect right indices with color c and not used\n\n    right_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]:\n\n            right_list.append(i)\n\n    # pair them\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6, which is manageable.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the left_unmatched and right_unmatched.\n\nThen, proceed with the steps for the '?'.\n\nNow, the code for the rest:\n\nleft_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in left_unmatched if l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in right_unmatched if r[i] == '?']\n\nright_non_q = [i for i in right_unmatched if r[i] != '?']\n\nk = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by specific colors or the wildcard character '?', which can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Matching of Specific Colors**: For each specific color (from 'a' to 'z'), we first attempt to pair left boots with the same color as right boots. This ensures that all specific color matches are made first.\n2. **Handling Wildcards**: After handling specific colors, we then handle the remaining boots that either have wildcards ('?') or could not be matched with their specific color counterparts.
