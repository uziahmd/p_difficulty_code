The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The frog starts at position 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't step outside [0, x] when trying to reach positions. For each x from 0 to m, we need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions reachable under that constraint, then sum all those f(x) values.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out for a given x, what positions are reachable. But since m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute this for each x individually. So there must be some pattern or mathematical formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Without any constraints, the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a's and subtracting b's. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the reachable positions depend on x.\n\nBut maybe the key is to find the set of positions that are reachable in general, and then for each x, count how many of those positions are within [0, x].\n\nWait, but the frog can't go beyond x. So even if a position is in the reachable set, if it's larger than x, it's not counted. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the reachable positions without considering the x constraint. Let's say the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because the frog can make steps of +a and -b. So the reachable positions are all numbers of the form k*(a) - l*(b), where k and l are non-negative integers. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the frog can jump multiple times. But the problem is that the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. However, the movement is such that the frog can reach positions that are in the set generated by linear combinations of a and b, but with certain constraints based on the steps taken.\n\nAlternatively, the problem resembles the classic coin problem. But here, instead of coins, we have steps. The frog can move forward a steps or backward b steps. However, the frog can't go negative or beyond x. But perhaps the positions reachable without any constraints are those that are in the set {k*a - l*b | k, l ≥ 0} and also satisfy certain conditions.\n\nBut since the frog starts at 0, and can make any number of jumps, the positions reachable are all integers that can be expressed as (some number of a steps) minus (some number of b steps), but also ensuring that during the process, the frog never goes below 0 or above x. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reachable positions are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a, b). Let me check. For example, if a=5, b=3, then d=1. So all integers are reachable? But in the first example, when x is 5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2? Or maybe not. Wait, the first example says f(5)=3. So positions 0, 5, 2? Let me see.\n\nIn the first example, when x is 5. The frog can jump from 0 to 5. Then from 5, can it jump back to 5-3=2. From 2, can it jump to 2+5=7, but that's beyond x=5, so not allowed. Or from 2, can it jump back to 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So the reachable positions are 0, 5, 2. Hence f(5)=3.\n\nSo the positions are 0, 2, 5. Which are all congruent to 0 mod 1 (since gcd(5,3)=1). So yes, they are all possible. But how to find all positions that can be reached, given that during the journey, the frog can't go outside [0,x].\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of f(x), the positions that are reachable are those numbers in the set S = {n | n = k*a - l*b, k,l ≥0} and n is between 0 and x. But how to find this set S?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position. The frog can move from k to k+a or k-b. But during the movement, the frog must stay in [0, x]. However, for the purpose of finding reachable positions, we can model this as the set of positions that can be reached starting from 0, and during the traversal, never stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut for large x (up to 1e9), we can't simulate this. So we need a mathematical way to compute f",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on the number line starting from position 0, given constraints on the frog's jump sizes and the interval within which it must stay. We then sum these values for all intervals from 0 to a given maximum value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The key insight is that the reachable positions are determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `d = gcd(a, b)`, then all reachable positions must be multiples of `d`.\n\n2. **Modulo Analysis**: For any position `k` to be reachable, it must satisfy `k % d == 0`. This helps in reducing the problem to checking positions within a certain range that are multiples of `d`.\n\n3. **Range Constraints**: For each `x` from 0 to `m`, we need to count how many multiples of `d` are within the range `[0, x]`. This count is given by `x // d + 1`.\n\n4. **Summing Values**: Since we need the sum of `f(x)` from `x = 0` to `x = m`, we compute the sum of counts for each valid multiple of `d` within the range `[0, m]`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    m = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    b = int(data[2])\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    total = 0\n    # For each x in [0, m], f(x) is the number of multiples of d in [0, x]\n    # So sum_{x=0}^m (floor(x/d) + 1)\n    # Which equals sum_{k=0}^{m//d} (m - k*d + 1) ?
