Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new one. And this new candle can be used again, so it's a loop.\n\nThe example given is when a=4 and b=2. The output is 7. Let me think through that example. \n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are used, so he has 2 used ones. Convert them into 1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now, he has 1 used candle. But since he needs 2 to make a new one, he can't do anything else. So total is 4+2+1=7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3. Output is 8. Let's check. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 used candles. 6/3=2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 used. Can't make any more since 2 <3. So total is 6+2=8. Oh wait, but wait, maybe there's another step? Wait, no. Because after the 2 used, you can't make any more. So yes, total is 8.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones, adding to the total hours.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of it as:\n\nTotal hours starts as 0. We have a certain number of candles. Each time we burn them, we add to the total hours. Then, collect the used ones, convert them into new ones. Repeat until we can't convert anymore.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Each time you burn a candle, it becomes a used one. So, the process is:\n\nInitially, you have 'a' candles. You burn them all. That gives 'a' hours. Then, you have 'a' used candles. Then, you can make (a // b) new candles. The number of used candles left after this is (a % b). Then, you burn those new candles, adding (number of new candles) to the total hours. Then, again, collect the used ones from this step, and repeat.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWe have current_candles = a. Then, each time, we burn all current_candles. Add current_candles to total_hours. Then, the used_candles increases by current_candles. Then, we can make new_candles = used_candles // b. The remaining used_candles is used_candles % b. Then, current_candles becomes new_candles. Repeat until current_candles is zero.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because when you burn the current_candles, they become used. So, for example:\n\nInitially, current_candles = a. Burn them all. So total_hours += a. Now, used_candles = a. Then, new_candles = used_candles // b. Then, the used_candles becomes (used_candles % b) + new_candles? No, wait. Because when you make new_candles, you take (used_candles // b) * b used candles, and convert them into new_candles. So the remaining used_candles is (used_candles % b) + (new_candles? No, no. Because the new_candles are made from the used ones. So once you make new_candles, those new ones are added to the current_candles, and the used_candles is the leftover from the previous step.\n\nWait, maybe the process is:\n\nEach time, you have some number of used candles. You can convert as many as possible into new candles. The number of new candles is (used_candles // b). Then, the remaining used candles is (used_candles % b). But then, when you burn the new candles, they become used again.\n\nSo here's a possible algorithm:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\nused_candles = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\n",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining how many hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, we must account for both the initial set of candles and the ability to recycle used ones into new ones. The key idea is to simulate the process of burning and reusing candles as efficiently as possible.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Burn**: Start by burning all the initial `a` candles. This gives us `a` hours of light.\n2. **Recycling Used Candles**: After each burn, collect the used candles and determine how many new candles can be made from them using the conversion rate `b`.\n3. **Repeat Process**: Use the newly made candles again, adding to the total hours, and repeat the recycling process until no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis is a loop-based approach where:\n- We keep track of the number of used candles.\n- At each iteration, we calculate how many new candles can be made from the used ones.\n- We then add the number of new candles to the total hours, and continue the process with these new candles.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    used = 0\n    \n    # First, burn all initial candles\n    total_hours += a\n    used = a\n    \n    while used >= b:\n        new_candles = used // b\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        used = (used % b) + new_candles\n    \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initial Burn**: All `a` candles are burned, contributing `a` hours.\n- **Recycling Loop**:\n  - While there are enough used candles (`used >= b`), convert them into new candles.\n  - Add the number of new candles to the total hours (since they will be burned next).\n  - Update the count of used candles to include the leftover from the previous batch and the newly created ones.\n- The loop stops when there are not enough used candles to make another new one.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently handles the conversion and reuse of candles in O(log a) time complexity due to the repeated division by `b`, which makes it suitable even for the upper limits of the constraints.",
