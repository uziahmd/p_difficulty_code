He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one being a prefix and the other a suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each of the input strings such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key point is that there might be multiple valid assignments, but we just need to output any one that works.\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of some possible s. But how?\n\nLet me think. The main idea is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input is all the prefixes and suffixes, but not labeled, we need to find a way to assign them such that there's a string s that has exactly those prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how can I reconstruct s? Well, the correct s must be such that:\n\n- All the prefixes of s (of lengths 1..n-1) are present in the input.\n- All the suffixes of s (of lengths 1..n-1) are present in the input.\n\nBut since the input contains exactly all of them (as per the problem statement), we need to find which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nBut how do I find the correct s? Because once I know s, I can check for each input string if it's a prefix or suffix of s, and then assign accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that there could be multiple possible s's. However, the problem allows any assignment that is consistent with at least one possible s.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Find a candidate string s that is compatible with the given input strings. Once we have that, we can check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nLet's think: the correct s must have the property that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input: one is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. So, for example, for length 1, there are two strings. One of them is the first character of s (the prefix of length 1), and the other is the last character of s (the suffix of length 1).\n\nSo, for the entire input, we need to select for each length l, one string as the prefix and one as the suffix, such that when we combine them, they form a string s that is consistent across all lengths.\n\nBut how to find this s?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the full string s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the longest proper prefix (length n-1) and the longest proper suffix (length n-1) must overlap in a way that allows us to reconstruct s.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have the prefix of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. Then combining these two gives us the full string s. Because the prefix of length n-1 is the first n-1 characters, and the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters. So their concatenation would be s[0..n-2] + s[1..n-1], which is s[0] followed by s[1..n-1] (since the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So combining them, the overlapping part is s[1..n-2], and the full string would be the first part plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, the full string s is of length n. So the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the full string can be determined by taking the prefix of length n-1 (which is s[0..n-2]) and appending the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (which is s[n-1]). So, if we have both the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their roles (prefix or suffix) are not specified. Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with this assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate String**: The key insight is that the correct string `s` can be reconstructed using the longest proper prefix and suffix. Specifically, the longest proper prefix (length `n-1`) and the longest proper suffix (length `n-1`) must overlap in such a way that they can be combined to form the original string `s`.\n\n2. **Reconstruct String**: By combining the longest proper prefix and the longest proper suffix, we can reconstruct the original string `s`. This is because the longest proper prefix of `s` is `s[0..n-2]` and the longest proper suffix is `s[1..n-1]`. Combining these two gives us the full string `s`.\n\n3. **Validate and Assign Roles**: Once we have a candidate string `s`, we can check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`. Based on this check, we assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each pair of candidates as prefix and suffix to reconstruct s\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Reconstruct possible s\n            s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if all prefixes and suffixes are present in the input\n            # For each length l from 1 to n-1, check that the prefix and suffix of s are in the input\n            valid = True\n            for l in range(1, n):\n                prefix = s[:l]\n                suffix = s[-l:]\n                # Check if both are present in the input\n                count_prefix = 0\n                count_suffix = 0\n                for st in strings:\n                    if st == prefix:\n                        count_prefix += 1\n                    if st == suffix:\n                        count_suffix += 1\n                if count_prefix < 1 or count_suffix < 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P/S based on s\n                result = []\n                for st in strings:\n                    if st == s[:len(st)]:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif st == s[-len(st):]:\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                        pass\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: We identify the two strings of length `n-1` which are potential candidates for the longest proper prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstruct String `s`**: By combining these candidates, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: For each reconstructed `s`, we check if all required prefixes and suffixes are present in the input.\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid `s` is found, we determine the role (prefix or suffix) of each input string relative to `s` and construct the output string accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine a valid configuration of prefixes and suffixes that matches the problem constraints.",
