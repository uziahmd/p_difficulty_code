He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix. And there might be multiple valid answers, but we just need to output any one that's correct.\n\nHmm. The key here is to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of the actual string s. But since we don't know s, how can we figure this out?\n\nLet me think. The given input includes all improper prefixes and suffixes of s. So for each possible length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings (one prefix and one suffix). But the problem is that the input strings are given in arbitrary order, and we don't know which is which.\n\nSo the approach must be to find the correct assignment of P and S labels such that there exists some string s of length n where the given strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do I find such an s? Because for each possible combination of P and S labels, I need to check if there exists a string s that matches those prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut checking all possible combinations of P and S labels would be computationally expensive. Since there are 2n-2 elements, each being P or S, but with exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's (since there are n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes). Wait, no. Wait, the total number of prefixes is n-1 (each length from 1 to n-1), same for suffixes. So the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. So the output string has exactly n-1 P's and same number of S's.\n\nBut trying all possibilities for the labels is not feasible for n=100, since 2n-2 is 198, and combinations would be C(198, 99) which is way too big.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For the correct string s, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the full string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and suffix. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the longest prefix is of length n-1. Let's call it p. Similarly, the longest suffix is of length n-1, call it s. Then, the actual string s must be p + last character (but that's not necessarily correct, because the longest prefix is of length n-1, so the full string is p plus one more character. However, the longest suffix is of length n-1, which is the entire string except the first character. So the full string must be the concatenation of the first character and the longest suffix. So if we can find the longest prefix and longest suffix, then the full string s must be such that:\n\ns = (longest prefix) + [some character], and also s = [some character] + (longest suffix). Therefore, the longest prefix and longest suffix must overlap in the middle. So the first n-1 characters of s is the longest prefix, and the last n-1 characters is the longest suffix. Therefore, the first character of the longest suffix must be the same as the first character of the longest prefix? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the full string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. For example, the longest prefix is of length n-1. Let's say that's p. The longest suffix is of length n-1, say s. Then, the full string s must be p[0...n-2] + x, where x is the last character. Also, the full string must be y + s[0...n-2], where y is the first character. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s is p, and the last n-1 characters is s. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of p must match the last n-2 characters of s. So p[0..n-3] == s[1..n-2]. Therefore, combining these two gives that the full string is p[0..n-2] + (s[0])? Or something like that. Wait, perhaps the full string s is the combination of the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Let's think of the full string as having length n. The longest prefix (length n-1) is the first n-1 characters. The longest suffix (length n-1) is the last n-",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is arbitrary. Our task is to assign each string a label 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with these labels.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix (each of length `n-1`) are crucial because they help determine the full string `s`. The full string `s` must be such that the longest prefix is its first `n-1` characters, and the longest suffix is its last `n-1` characters.\n2. **Determine the Full String**: Using the longest prefix and suffix, we can infer the full string `s` by ensuring that the overlap between these two strings is consistent.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once we have a candidate for `s`, we validate each input string to check if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the longest prefix and suffix candidates (length n-1)\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == n-1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all pairs of candidates as possible longest prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        for j in range(len(candidates)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            \n            # Check if they can form a valid s\n            # s should be prefix_candidate + last_char and also first_char + suffix_candidate\n            # So the first n-2 chars of prefix_candidate must match the last n-2 chars of suffix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[:-1] == suffix_candidate[1:]:\n                s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[0]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    # Now, check all input strings against s\n    result = []\n    for s_str in strings:\n        if s.startswith(s_str):\n            result.append('P')\n        elif s.endswith(s_str):\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # This shouldn't happen according to the problem statement\n            result.append('P')  # fallback, though not expected\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: We identify all strings of length `n-1` as potential longest prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Forming the Full String**: By checking overlaps between these candidates, we infer the full string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each input string is checked against the inferred string `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the result is constructed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct labels for each string based on the inferred full string `s`, leveraging the properties of prefixes and suffixes.",
