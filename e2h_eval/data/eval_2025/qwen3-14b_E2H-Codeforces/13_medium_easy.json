For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 elements. The distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher note. For example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. But if the order is reversed, like E to C, it's 8 semitones? Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So when considering X and Y, if X is lower than Y, the distance is the number of steps from X to Y. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (total steps in circle) minus the steps from Y to X? Or wait, maybe the way to compute the distance between two notes is (y - x) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured along the scale from the lower to upper. Wait, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check the order of the notes.\n\nThe notes are ordered as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So each consecutive note is +1 semitone. So the distance between X and Y (when X is before Y in the sequence) is (Y's index - X's index). But if X is after Y, then the distance would be (Y's index + 12 - X's index)? Or wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see: from E to C, moving upwards. Let's think of the sequence as circular. So the distance from E to C would be (C's position - E's position) mod 12? Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Wait, no. Let's take the example given: between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the list of notes:\n\nC is index 0.\n\nC# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4. So from C to E is 4 semitones. That's correct. Now between E and C: the problem says that the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E upwards to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. But how do we compute this?\n\nSo, given two notes, X and Y, the distance is (Y's index - X's index) if Y is after X. Otherwise, (Y's index + 12 - X's index). Wait, no. Because if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8. Which matches the example. So the formula for the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). But another way to compute this is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Wait, no. Because if y_index is less than x_index, then (y_index -x_index) would be negative. But mod 12 would give the positive value. For example, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is (y -x). If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (y + 12 -x). Which is equivalent to (y -x) mod 12. Because for example, when X is E (4) and Y is C (0), (0-4) is -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is defined as the number of semitones from the lower to upper. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. So the formula is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which can be written as (Y - X + 12) % 12. Wait, but (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same result. For example, if Y is 0 and X is 4, Y - X is -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. However, the problem says that for the major triad, the distance between X and Y must be 4 semitones, and between Y and Z must be 3 semitones. So when considering the order of the three notes, we need to check for any permutation of the three notes whether there exists an ordering where the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\nBut since the chord is unordered, we need to check all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any of them satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the three input notes into their corresponding indices (0 to 11).\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three indices. Since the order matters for checking the distances.\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If so, it's a major triad.\n\n   b. Check if the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. If so, it's a minor triad.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut since there are 3! = 6 permutations, we can check all of them.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the total distance between X and Z is 7 semitones. But since the order is X-Y-Z, with X to Y being 4, Y to Z being 3. So the total from X to Z is 4+3=7. But if the three notes are arranged in some order, perhaps we can check for all possible pairs.\n\nAlternatively, for the three notes, there are three possible ways to arrange them as X, Y, Z. For example, for each of the three possible choices of Y (the middle note), check if the distances between X and Y is 4, and Y and Z is 3. But since the order is not fixed, perhaps checking all permutations is easier.\n\nBut for code purposes, generating all permutations of the three notes and checking for each of them is manageable.\n\nSo first, I need to map the note names to their indices. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as such. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo, for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc. H is 11. Then, after H comes C again.\n\nSo the first thing is to create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's create that.\n\nOnce the three notes are converted into their indices, let's call them a, b, c.\n\nNow, generate all permutations of these three elements. For each permutation (x, y, z), check:\n\ndistance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3 → major.\n\nOR\n\ndistance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between x and y? As (y - x) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. For example, if x is 0 (C) and y is 4 (E), then the distance is 4. If x is 4 (E) and y is 0 (C), then the distance is 8. But according to the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is computed as from the lower to upper. So in the case of x and y, if x is lower than y, then the distance is y - x. If x is higher than y, then the distance is (y + 12 - x). So the formula is (y - x) if y >= x else (y + 12 - x). Which can be calculated as (y - x) % 12? Wait, no. Because (y - x) mod 12 gives the same result as (y -x) if positive, but for negative numbers, it wraps around. For example, if x is 4, y is 0: (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance. So yes, the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, in the problem's example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So yes.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking the major or minor triads, the distance between X and Y must be exactly 4 semitones. So for a permutation (X, Y, Z), the distance between X and Y must be 4, and between Y and Z must be 3. So how to compute that?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: C, E, G. The indices are 0, 4, 7. Let's check the permutation (C, E, G). Distance between C and E is (4-0) mod 12 =4. Then between E and G is 7-4=3. So that's a major triad. So yes.\n\nAnother example: C# B F. Let's see the notes. Let's convert them to indices. Let's see:\n\nC# is 1. B is 10. F is 5. So the permutation B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\ndistance between B (10) and C# (1): (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5 -1 =4. So that's 4. So this is a minor triad.\n\nSo the code needs to check for each permutation of the three notes, whether the first two steps are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Create a mapping from note names to their indices.\n\n- Read the three input notes, convert them to indices.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\n- For each permutation, check if the first two distances are 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor).\n\n- If any permutation meets the major condition, return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\n- If none, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, the mapping. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's make sure that the order is correct. The problem says the order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the index of each note is their position in this list.\n\nSo, for example, 'H' is at index 11.\n\nSo the code can create a dictionary:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\nThen, for each input note, we can get their index.\n\nNow, for the three input notes, we can get their indices as a list. Let's say notes_list = [note1, note2, note3]. Then, their indices are [a, b, c].\n\nNow, generate all permutations of these three elements. Since the order matters, we can use itertools.permutations.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations([a,b,c], 3) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCompute distance between x and y: (y - x) % 12.\n\nIf that equals 4, then compute distance between y and z: (z - y) % 12. If that equals 3 → major.\n\nElse, check if distance between x and y is 3 and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either condition, then return the respective result.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what about permutations where the same note is used more than once? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the chord is a set of three notes, but the input may have duplicates? No, because the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but I think that the problem expects that they are distinct. Because a chord is an unordered set of three notes. However, the problem says nothing about duplicates. But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but perhaps they can be same. However, in that case, the distances would be zero. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, perhaps the input is always three distinct notes. But the code should handle any input.\n\nBut for the code, even if the input has duplicates, the code will process it. However, since the problem says that the answer is unique, perhaps the input will not have duplicates. But regardless, the code can process it.\n\nBut for example, if all three notes are same, then in all permutations, d1 and d2 will be zero. So it's strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can proceed.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of three elements, each being a string of three notes. But in the problem's input, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the sample input shows that the input is something like:\n\nC E G\n\nC# B F\n\nA B H\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of three elements, but in reality, the actual input is one line per test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the sample input is given as:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably the list of test cases. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps each line is a separate test case. But the user's example shows that the input is a list of three elements. However, the original problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So for example, the first test case is 'C E G', which outputs 'major'. The second is 'C# B F' which outputs 'minor', and third 'A B H' outputs 'strange'.\n\nBut the code needs to process one line of input. So in the code, the input is read as a single line, split into three notes.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three elements, but that's probably a mistake. Because the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. For example, in the sample input, the user wrote:\n\nInput: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut perhaps that's the list of test cases. But for the code, each test case is a single line. So for example, the code is supposed to read one line, split into three notes.\n\nSo the code would read the input as:\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is three different lines, but perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. However, the code should process one line of input, which is three notes separated by spaces.\n\nSo for the code, the input is read as:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nSo for example, if the input is 'C E G', then notes is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nNow, in the code, the code will process that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nFirst case: C, E, G.\n\nindices are 0, 4, 7.\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nOne permutation is (0,4,7). d1 is 4-0 =4 mod12 is 4. d2 is 7-4=3 mod12 is 3. So found_major is True.\n\nThus, output is 'major'.\n\nSecond case: C#, B, F.\n\nIndices: C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. One permutation is B, C#, F: (10, 1, 5). d1 is (1-10) mod12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 -1) mod12 =4. So this is minor. So found_minor is True.\n\nThird case: A, B, H.\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's see:\n\nTake permutation (9,10,11). d1 is 1, d2 is 1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation (9,11,10). d1 is (11-9)=2 mod12=2. d2 is (10-11) mod12 = 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 9, 11). d1 is (9-10) mod12 = 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 11, 9). d1 is (11-10) =1. d2 is (9-11) mod12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11,9,10). d1 is (9-11) mod12 = ( -2 ) mod12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11,10,9). d1 is (10-11) mod12 = 11. d2 is (9-10) mod12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code needs to read the input, process it, and output the correct result.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nBut the code needs to be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where multiple permutations satisfy the condition? For example, if a chord is both major and minor? But according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can safely check for any occurrence of major or minor.\n\nBut the code checks all permutations, and if any permutation meets the major condition, then found_major is set to True. Similarly for minor. So even if multiple permutations meet the condition, the code will correctly set the flags.\n\nNow, let's test for a case where a permutation is major and another is minor. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen. But the code will check for both. For example, if a chord is both major and minor, but the problem says that there are no such cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous, so the code can safely check for the flags.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All three notes are same. For example, C C C. Then all permutations will have d1 and d2 as 0. So output is strange.\n\nEdge case 2: Notes are C, E, G. Which is major. So code returns major.\n\nAnother case: C, E, G#. Let's see. The permutation C, E, G#. Distance between C and E is 4. Between E and G# is (G# is index 8. So 8 -4 =4. So d2 is 4. So not 3. So not major. What about other permutations?\n\nAnother permutation: C, G#, E. d1 is (G# is 8 -0 =8 mod 12 is 8. Not 4. So no. So this would not be a major or minor.\n\nAnother example: C, D, F. Let's check. For a minor triad, we need X-Y to be 3, Y-Z to be 4. Let's see:\n\nIf the permutation is C, D, F. Distance between C (0) and D (2) is 2. Not 3. Another permutation: D, C, F. d1 is (C - D) mod 12 is (0 - 2) mod12 = 10. No. What about C, F, D. Let's see. X=C (0), Y=F (5). d1 is 5-0=5. Not 3. Hmm. Maybe this is not a minor or major.\n\nAnother example: C, E, G is major. What about E, G, C? Let's see. For this permutation, X=E (4), Y=G (7). d1 is 3. Then Y to Z is C (0). (0 -7) mod 12 is 5. So no. So not minor. But another permutation: E, C, G. d1 is (C - E) mod 12 is (0 -4) mod12 = 8. Not 3 or 4. So no. So the code would find the correct permutation.\n\nAnother example for minor: B, C#, F. Which is the sample input. So the code should detect that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations, which generates all possible orderings. For three elements, there are 6 permutations. So for each of them, the code checks.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses (y -x) mod 12. Which is correct.\n\nYes, I think this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither.

This allows for easy calculation of semitone distances using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked for both major and minor triad conditions.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly when moving from higher to lower notes.\n4. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the results are determined based on whether any permutation met the criteria for a major or minor triad. If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
