For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem says that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Let me check that. Let's see:\n\nC to C# is 1 semitone. Then C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4. Yes. So between X and Y, the distance is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position) semitones? Or maybe the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is always taken as the smallest number of semitones when moving upwards. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E up to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if Y is higher than X, then it's Y - X. If Y is lower, then it's (Y + 12 - X). But since the notes are cyclic, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, but that would give a value between 0 and 11. But for example, between C and E, Y is E, which is 4 semitones higher than C. So the distance is 4. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (C's position - E's position) mod 12? Let me think. Let's assign each note an index. Let's make a list of the notes in order. Let's say:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So for example, C is index 0, E is index 4. So the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). But that's equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, because if Y is lower than X, then (Y_index - X_index) would be negative. But mod 12 would give a positive value. Wait, for example, if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then Y_index - X_index is -4. mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Which is what we get here. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper, perhaps that's the way to compute it.\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, when checking for major or minor triads, we need to find if there's an ordering of the three notes where X, Y, Z satisfy certain distances.\n\nFor a major triad: the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. So the total distance between X and Z is 7 semitones. But since the order is X, Y, Z, then the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So the total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, perhaps that's not important. What matters is that in the ordered sequence, the first interval is 4, the second is 3.\n\nSimilarly for minor: the first interval is 3, the second is 4.\n\nSo the approach is: for the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the intervals). For each permutation, check if the first interval (X to Y) is 4 and the second (Y to Z) is 3. If any permutation satisfies that, then it's a major chord. Similarly, check for minor.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible permutations of the three notes?\n\nWell, the three notes can be ordered in 6 different ways (3! = 6). For each of these permutations, check if the first two intervals meet the criteria for major or minor.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meets the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n\n2. Assign each note to its index in the list of notes.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n4. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Compute distance between X and Y: (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured as from the lower to upper. Wait, but how do we know which is lower? Because the way the distance is calculated is that if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But the mod 12 approach gives the same result as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. However, in the problem's example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8. So yes, the mod 12 approach gives the correct distance.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking the major or minor triad, the distance between X and Y must be exactly 4 semitones, and between Y and Z exactly 3 semitones. So for a permutation (X, Y, Z), the distance from X to Y must be 4, and from Y to Z must be 3. So, in code, for each permutation, compute (Y_index - X_index) mod 12 == 4? And (Z_index - Y_index) mod 12 == 3?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So perhaps, the way the distance is calculated is that for two notes, the distance is the number of semitones when moving from the lower note to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But how do we know which is lower? Well, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). But this is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is higher, then mod 12 is the same as Y - X. If Y is lower, then (Y - X) is negative, and mod 12 gives the positive value. So for example, if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0), then (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8, which is the correct distance.\n\nSo, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. However, when we check for major or minor, the distance between X and Y must be exactly 4, and between Y and Z exactly 3. But how does that work?\n\nLet me take the first example: \"C E G\".\n\nThe notes are C (0), E (4), G (7). Let's consider the permutation (C, E, G). The distance between C and E is (4 - 0) mod 12 = 4, which is correct. Then between E and G is 7-4=3. So that's correct. So this is a major triad.\n\nAnother example: \"C# B F\". Let's see. The notes are C#, B, F. Let's look at the permutation B, C#, F. B is index 10 (assuming the list is as follows: C is 0, C# 1, D 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F# 6, G 7, G# 8, A 9, B 10, H 11. Wait, the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes, B is index 10, H is 11. Then C# is index 1. So for the permutation B, C#, F:\n\ndistance between B (10) and C# (1) is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Because 1-10 is -9. Adding 12 gives 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then between C# (1) and F (5): (5 - 1) mod 12 is 4. So that's 4 semitones. So this is a minor triad.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Create a list of the notes in order, with their indices. So for example, a dictionary mapping note names to their index.\n\n- For the three input notes, get their indices.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes (since the order matters for checking the intervals).\n\n- For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   Check if (distance between X and Y is 4) and (distance between Y and Z is 3). If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\n   Also check if (distance between X and Y is 3) and (distance between Y and Z is 4). If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, return 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none of the permutations meet either condition, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations of the three notes. Since there are three elements, there are 6 permutations. For example, for [A, B, C], the permutations are all possible orderings.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for the three notes, generate all permutations, then check each one.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line. It's three space-separated notes. For example, input could be like 'C E G' or 'C# B F'.\n\nSo first, split the input into three notes. Then for each note, find its index in the list.\n\nLet me create the list of notes in order. Let's define:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is correct. So for each note, we can create a dictionary to map the note name to its index. For example:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut what about the note 'H'? In the problem statement, the notes are listed as ... A, B, H. So the order is correct.\n\nOnce we have the indices for the three notes, we can generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if (distance between x and y) is 4 and (distance between y and z) is 3. How to compute distance between x and y? As (y - x) % 12. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But in the case of X being lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the calculation is (y - x) mod 12. But in code, for two indices, x and y, the distance is (y - x) % 12. Wait, but for example, if x is 0 (C), y is 4 (E), (4-0) mod 12 is 4. Correct. If x is 4 (E), y is 0 (C), (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance. So yes.\n\nSo, for a permutation (x, y, z):\n\ndistance_xy = (y - x) % 12\n\ndistance_yz = (z - y) % 12\n\nIf distance_xy == 4 and distance_yz == 3 → major.\n\nIf distance_xy == 3 and distance_yz == 4 → minor.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check these conditions.\n\nOnce any permutation meets major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo in code, for the three input notes, we can generate all permutations, and for each, check these conditions.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nThen, read the input. For example, input is a single line with three notes. Like input().split().\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three elements, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, in the example given, the input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably the list of test cases. However, the actual input for the program is a single line with three notes. So for example, the user inputs something like \"C E G\" and the code reads that line.\n\nSo in code, the input is read via input().split().\n\nOnce we have the three notes, we can get their indices.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three indices. For example, for notes [a, b, c], permutations would be all 6 possible orderings.\n\nFor each permutation, check if the distances match for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major' as the answer. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but permutations returns all possible orderings. For example, for three elements, there are 6 permutations. For each permutation, we check the two conditions.\n\nBut in the case where multiple permutations meet the condition, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so once any permutation meets major, we can return major.\n\nBut why not check all permutations? Because once any permutation meets the condition, we can return the answer.\n\nBut the code above checks for each permutation, and if any permutation meets the major condition, it prints 'major' and exits. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut what about permutations that may meet both conditions? According to the problem statement, there are no such cases. So the code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nFirst case: C E G → indices are 0,4,7.\n\nPermutations:\n\n(0,4,7): d1 = 4-0=4 mod 12 is 4. d2 is 7-4=3 → 3. So major. So output 'major'.\n\nSecond case: C# B F → notes are C#, B, F. Their indices are 1, 10, 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. Let's take B (10), C# (1), F (5). So x=10, y=1, z=5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 - 1) mod 12 = 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So output 'minor'.\n\nThird case: A B H. Indices are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. For example:\n\nA (9), B (10), H (11). d1 is 1, d2 is 1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B (10), H (11), A (9). d1 is (11 -10) =1 mod 12 → 1. d2 is (9-11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: H (11), A (9), B (10). d1 is (9 -11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. Not 3 or 4. So none of the permutations will meet the conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about other possible permutations for the same case?\n\nAnother example: let's take the first case. The code would check all permutations, but as soon as the first permutation (0,4,7) is checked, it would print 'major' and exit.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same triad can be ordered in multiple ways, but only one of them meets the condition. For example, if the code checks permutations in a different order, but the code would still find the correct answer.\n\nBut the code checks all permutations, and as soon as any permutation meets the major or minor condition, it returns the answer.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nWhat about a triad that can be ordered as major in two different ways? But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code will return the correct answer regardless.\n\nAnother edge case: notes that wrap around the cycle. For example, H, C, E. Let's see:\n\nH is index 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nPermutation H, C, E.\n\nd1 = (0 - 11) mod 12 → ( -11 ) mod 12 → 1. No. But if the permutation is C, E, H. Then d1 is 4, d2 is (11 -4) mod 12 → 7. So no. Not major or minor.\n\nAnother example: C, E, B. Let's see. Let's check if any permutation meets the major or minor.\n\nC is 0, E is 4, B is 10.\n\nCheck permutation C, E, B. d1 is 4, d2 is (10 -4) mod 12 =6. No. Another permutation: E, B, C. d1 is (10 -4) mod 12 =6. No. Another permutation: B, C, E. d1 is (0 - 10) mod 12 = 2 → 2. No. Another permutation: B, E, C. d1 is (4 - 10) mod 12 = ( -6 ) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation: C, B, E. d1 is (10 -0) mod 12 = 10. No. Etc. So this would be strange.\n\nAnother example: Let's think of a minor chord. For example, C, E#, G. Wait, but perhaps not. Let's think of a minor chord. For example, the permutation X, Y, Z where X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4.\n\nLet me take B, C#, F. Which was the sample. So that's a minor chord.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the notes C, E, G. Which is major. What if the input is given as E, G, C? Then, checking permutations. One of the permutations would be E, G, C. d1 between E and G is 7-4=3 (since E is index 4, G is 7. 7-4=3. So d1 is 3. Then between G and C: (0 -7) mod 12 → 5. No. So not minor. But another permutation would be E, C, G. d1 is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Not 3 or 4. But the correct permutation is C, E, G. Which would be checked in the permutations.\n\nSo the code will find that.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the note names correctly mapped? For example, 'H' is the last note, index 11. The note_order list must be correct.\n\nYes, according to the problem statement, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the note_order list is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the input notes may be in any order. For example, the input could be 'E C G' which is the same as 'C E G'.\n\nSo the code will generate permutations and check all possibilities.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses permutations of the indices. So even if two notes are same (but according to the problem, the input is three distinct notes?), but the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the chord is a set of three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. So perhaps the input can have duplicates? But according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But for this problem, the input is three notes, which may be same? But according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they are all different. However, the code will handle even if they are same. For example, if all three are same note, then all permutations would have d1 and d2 as 0. So the code would output 'strange'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a valid chord. However, the code doesn't need to check that.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nImporting permutations from itertools.\n\nBut in some coding environments, the code may need to have the necessary imports.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best practice. However, in code submission, using sys.exit() is better. But in the code, using exit() may work. However, in some environments, exit() may not be available. So perhaps using sys.exit() is better. However, in code submission, the code can use sys.exit().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can break early once a condition is found.\n\nBut the code above uses exit(), which in Python is in the sys module. However, in some contexts, exit() is available. However, to make sure, perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes. That's better.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G → code outputs major.\n\nSample Input: C# B F → outputs minor.\n\nSample Input: A B H → outputs strange.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take the minor example. Suppose the input is B C# F. The code would generate permutations. One of them is B, C#, F. Which gives d1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 = 5 - 1 = 4. So yes, minor.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take a minor chord. Let's say the notes are C, E#, G. Wait, but what is E#? Well, according to the note_order list, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So E# is not present. So perhaps that's not a valid note. So perhaps a better example is C, D#, F#. Let's see. Let's check if that's a minor chord.\n\nWait, for a minor chord, the distances should be 3 and 4. Let's see:\n\nLet's take X, Y, Z as C, D#, F#. Let's see. The indices are 0, 3, 6.\n\nCheck permutation C, D#, F#. d1 is 3-0=3. d2 is 6-3=3. Not 4. So not minor. Another permutation: C, F#, D#. d1 is (6 -0) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation: D#, C, F#. d1 is (0 - 3) mod 12 = 9. No. Hmm. Maybe another example.\n\nLet me think of a minor chord. For example, C, E, G is major. What about C, D#, F#? Let's see. Let me check for a permutation where X is D#, Y is F#, Z is C. Then:\n\ndistance between D# (3) and F# (6) is 3. Then between F# (6) and C (0) is (0 -6) mod 12 = 6. No. Not 4. Not helpful.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the minor chord B, C#, F. Which is the sample input. So the code works.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the minor chord C, E, Gb. Wait, but in our note_order, there is no Gb. Instead, there's F#, G, G#. So perhaps a minor chord could be C, E, G#? Let's see.\n\nWait, the minor triad requires that the first interval is 3 and the second is 4. Let's see:\n\nLet's say the permutation is C, E, G#. The distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So that's major. Not minor. But if there's a permutation where the first interval is 3.\n\nFor example, suppose the notes are C, D#, F#. Let's check for a permutation where the first interval is 3. Let's see:\n\nIf the permutation is D#, F#, C. The distance between D# (3) and F# (6) is 3. Then between F# (6) and C (0) is (0 -6) mod 12 = 6. Not 4. So no.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the notes D, F, A. Let's check.\n\nD is index 2, F is 5, A is 9.\n\nCheck permutation D, F, A. Distance between D and F is 5-2=3. Between F and A is 9-5=4. So this is a minor triad. So the code should output 'minor'.\n\nSo for input D F A, the code would generate permutations. One of them is D, F, A. d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So output 'minor'.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor chord based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Notes and Their Indices**: The 12 musical notes are arranged in a cyclic order. Each note has an index corresponding to its position in this order.\n2. **Permutations of Notes**: Since the order of notes matters for checking the chord type, we generate all permutations of the three input notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the semitone distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Check for Major or Minor Chord**: For each permutation, check if the distances between the first and second note (4 semitones) and between the second and third note (3 semitones) form a major chord, or if the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively for a minor chord.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Order and Indices**: The list `note_order` defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its respective index.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read and converted into indices using the `note_to_index` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are checked.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n5. **Major/Minor Check**: If any permutation meets the distance criteria for a major or minor chord, the corresponding result is printed immediately. If none do, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
