There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with certain restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of squares of each house's height. But there are restrictions that say, for certain ranges, the maximum height in that range can't exceed a certain value. And we need to find the optimal heights for all houses that satisfy all these restrictions and maximize the profit.\n\nHmm, first, I need to think about how to model this. Since n and h are up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach isn't feasible. Wait, but 50 houses each with up to 50 possible heights would be 50^50 possibilities, which is way too big. So brute force is impossible here. Need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about constraints. Each restriction says that in a certain interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height is at most x_i. So for each such interval, the maximum of all houses in that range must be <= x_i.\n\nThe problem is similar to some kind of constraint satisfaction problem where we need to assign values to each house (a_i) such that for all restrictions, the max in their interval is <= x_i. And then maximize the sum of a_i squared.\n\nHow can we model this? Maybe dynamic programming? Or perhaps using some kind of backtracking with pruning? But even with backtracking, for n=50, it's going to be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints are about the maximum in intervals, perhaps we can model this as a problem where each house's height is constrained by the minimum of all the restrictions that apply to it. Wait, but each restriction applies to a range. For example, a house at position k might be part of multiple ranges. The maximum allowed height for that house is the minimum of all x_i for which the house is in [l_i, r_i]. Wait, no. Because for each restriction, the maximum in the interval must be <= x_i. So for a particular house, if there's a restriction that covers it, then that house's height can't be higher than x_i, but only if that house is the maximum in that interval. Wait, no. Because the restriction says that the maximum in the interval is at most x_i. So, any house in that interval can't have a height higher than x_i. Because if one of them was higher, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. Therefore, for any restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i], every house in positions l_i to r_i must have a height <= x_i. Because if even one house in that interval is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose there's a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is at most 2. Then, all three houses must be <=2, because if any of them is higher than 2, the max would be higher. So yes, for each restriction, all houses in the interval must be <=x_i. So that simplifies things. Because each house's maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house. But wait, not exactly. Because a restriction might not directly apply to a house. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then house 2 is in that interval. So its maximum allowed is 2. However, if there's another restriction on [2,2] with x=3, then the house 2 can be up to 3. But the first restriction requires that the maximum in [1,3] is <=2. So house 2 can't be higher than 2. Because if house 2 is 3, then the max of [1,3] would be 3, violating the first restriction. Therefore, the house's maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's of restrictions that cover that house. Wait, no. Because if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then house 2 can't be higher than 2. But if there's a restriction on [2,2] with x=3, that's not conflicting. Because the first restriction requires that the max of [1,3] is <=2, so house 2 can't be more than 2. So even though the second restriction allows it to be 3, the first one restricts it. So the effective maximum for house 2 is min(x_i for all restrictions that include it). Wait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because a restriction on a larger interval may impose a stricter limit than a restriction on a smaller interval. So for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house. Because any restriction that",
    "response": "To solve the problem of maximizing the profit from building houses under zoning restrictions, we need to consider both the constraints and the objective function (maximizing the sum of squares of house heights). Here's a structured approach to solving this:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Constraints on Heights**: \n   - Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a range [l_i, r_i] must be ≤ x_i.\n   - This implies that every house in [l_i, r_i] can be at most x_i in height. Because if even one house in the range exceeds x_i, the maximum would exceed x_i, violating the restriction.\n\n2. **Effective Maximum for Each House**:\n   - For each house at position `i`, its maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i values from restrictions that include house `i`.\n\n3. **Objective Function**:\n   - The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the chosen house heights.\n   - We aim to maximize this sum under the constraints derived from the restrictions.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n- **Step 1: Determine the Effective Maximum Height for Each House**\n  - Initialize an array `max_heights` where `max_heights[i]` will store the effective maximum height for house `i`.\n  - Initially, set `max_heights[i] = h` for all houses.\n  - For each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, update `max_heights[j] = min(max_heights[j], x_i)` for all `j` in `[l_i, r_i]`.\n\n- **Step 2: Calculate Maximum Profit**\n  - With the effective maximum height for each house known, the optimal height for each house to maximize profit is simply its effective maximum height.\n  - The profit is then the sum of the squares of these effective maximum heights.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for line in data:\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n        \n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for i in range(l - 1, r):\n                if max_heights[i] > x:\n                    max_heights[i] = x\n        \n        total_profit = sum(h * h for h in max_heights)\n        results.append(str(total_profit))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n- The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.\n- For each test case, it initializes the `max_heights` array with the global maximum height `h`.\n- It then applies all the restrictions by iterating over the affected range and updating the maximum height of each house accordingly.\n- Finally, it computes the total profit by summing the square of the effective maximum height for each house.\n- The result for each test case is printed on a new line.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit efficiently within the given problem limits.",
