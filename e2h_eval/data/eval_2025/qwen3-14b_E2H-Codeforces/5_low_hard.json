Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what compatibility means here. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with another specific same color. But a question mark (?) can be paired with any color, including another question mark. So for example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right is '?', that's compatible. Similarly, if both are '?', they are compatible.\n\nSo the goal is to pair as many as possible. How do I approach this?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the steps needed.\n\nI think the first step is to process the left and right boots, trying to match them optimally. Since the question marks can be flexible, perhaps we can handle them in a way that maximizes the total pairs.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\n1. Match specific colors first. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a', we can look for a right boot with 'a' and pair them. This would use up both. But since there might be multiple, we need to count frequencies.\n\nBut how to efficiently do that? Maybe using frequency counts for each color on left and right. But since we can have question marks, which can act as wildcards, maybe we need to handle them in a way that they can cover any missing matches.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the question marks can be used either as a wildcard for specific colors or as a wildcard for other question marks. So maybe the strategy is:\n\n- First, pair all left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, if left has 'a' and right has 'a', pair them. But how to do that optimally?\n\nBut since the question marks can be used in multiple ways, maybe we need to process the non-question marks first, and then handle the question marks.\n\nAnother idea: For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots. The maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the counts. Then, subtract those from the counts. Then, handle the remaining question marks.\n\nBut wait, the question marks can also be used as wildcards for specific colors. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c (not ?), pair as many left c with right c as possible. For example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 5 'a's, we can make 3 pairs. Then, subtract these from the counts.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (including question marks), we can pair the question marks. However, the question marks can be used to cover any remaining specific colors, or each other.\n\nWait, but after step 1, the remaining left and right boots would have some specific colors and question marks. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n- For each color c (not ?), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Then, the remaining left and right boots (with ?) can be matched with each other, but also with any remaining specific colors. Wait, no. Because after step 1, the specific colors have already been matched as much as possible. But maybe there are some left specific colors that weren't matched because the right didn't have enough. For example, if left has 5 'a's and right has 3 'a's, then after step 1, 3 pairs are made, leaving 2 left 'a's. These could be matched with right question marks.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- First, for each color c (not ?), pair left c with right c as much as possible. Let's say we have counts for left and right.\n\nThen, collect all the remaining left boots (which are either ? or colors that couldn't be matched) and same for right. Then, for the question marks, we can pair them with any remaining specific colors or other question marks.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nWe have two groups:\n\nLeft group: L (specific colors) and Lq (question marks)\n\nRight group: R (specific colors) and Rq (question marks)\n\nAfter step 1, we have:\n\nFor each specific color c, the number of left c and right c have been matched as much as possible. So, for each color c, the remaining left c is left_c - matched_c, and same for right.\n\nBut then, the remaining left_c (for specific colors) can be matched with right question marks. Similarly, the remaining right_c can be matched with left question marks. Also, the question marks can be matched with each other.\n\nSo perhaps the next steps are:\n\nFor all specific colors on",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility rules are such that specific colors must match exactly, while question marks ('?') can match any color, including other question marks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Match Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), count the number of left and right boots. Pair them as much as possible based on the minimum count of each color on both sides.\n2. **Handle Remaining Specific Colors with Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, use remaining question marks to cover any unmatched specific colors on either side.\n3. **Pair Remaining Question Marks**: Finally, pair the remaining question marks from both sides with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # We need to process multiple test cases, but the input is given in a way that each case is a group of three lines.\n    # Wait, looking back at the example input, the input seems to be multiple test cases concatenated.\n    # However, the original problem says that the input is for one test case.
