Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility rules are: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can be compatible with any color, including another question mark. And each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output needs to be the maximum number of pairs and their indices. Oh right, and the indices are 1-based.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Let's think about how to maximize the pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to pair as many as possible. Let's think about different cases.\n\nLet me consider that for each left boot and right boot, their colors must be compatible. But since each can be used once, we need to find a matching between left and right boots.\n\nThis sounds like a bipartite graph matching problem. However, with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach here.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to model this with some counting and greedy pairing.\n\nLet me think. The key is to pair the boots in such a way that we maximize the count. Let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, let's process the pairs where both are specific colors. For example, if a left boot has color 'a' and a right boot has color 'a', they can be paired. But if there are multiple such pairs, we need to pair them optimally.\n\nBut also, the question marks can be used to fill in the gaps. So maybe we can first pair all the specific color matches, then use the question marks to pair with the remaining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first pair the specific colors, then use the question marks on both sides to pair with whatever is left.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with that color and the number of right boots with that color. For each color c, the maximum possible pairs for that color is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract those from the counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?') can be paired using the question marks.\n\nBut wait, this might not be optimal. Because maybe some left '?' can be paired with right '?', but if we have more left '?' than right '?', then after pairing the left '?' with right '?', the remaining left '?' can be paired with other specific colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first pair all the non-question mark colors, then pair the question marks with the remaining.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's first pair as many as possible between left and right boots that have the same specific color. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could have either specific colors or ?), we can pair the ?s with whatever is left.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s? For example, if there are left ?s and right ?s, we can pair them. Also, left ?s can be paired with right specific colors (if those specific colors are not already matched). Similarly, right ?s can be paired with left specific colors.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the steps again:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not ?), take the min of the count of left and right c's. Then, pair them. But how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut since the actual indices matter for the output, we need to track which positions are used. However, for the purpose of counting, maybe we can first count how many pairs we can get for each color, then process the question marks.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Because the actual positions may affect the pairing. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', pairing them is straightforward. But if there are multiple options, we need to choose which ones to pair.\n\nBut for the maximum count, the order in which we pair them doesn't matter. So perhaps we can first process all the specific color pairs, then process the ? pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Create two dictionaries for left and right boots, counting the number of each color (excluding ?).\n\n- For each color c (excluding ?), the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). We can add this to the total.\n\n- Then, subtract these counts from left_count and right_count.\n\n- Now, for the remaining left and right boots, which include ?",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the **Colored Boots** problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot has a color (a lowercase letter or a question mark `?`), and compatibility is defined such that:\n\n- Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same.\n- A question mark (`?`) is compatible with any color.\n\nThe goal is to pair each left boot with a right boot in such a way that their colors are compatible, ensuring that no boot is used more than once.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Overview\n\nWe can break down the solution into two main steps:\n\n1. **Match Specific Colors**: First, match left and right boots that have the same specific color. This is straightforward since only matching colors are compatible.\n\n2. **Match Question Marks**: After pairing all specific color matches, use the remaining question marks (from both left and right) to pair with any unpaired boots. Since `?` is compatible with any color, this gives us flexibility in pairing.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- We'll use dictionaries to count the number of specific colors on both left and right sides.\n- We'll iterate through each color (excluding `?`) and pair as many as possible.\n- After that, we'll handle the `?` cases:\n  - Pair remaining `?` on the left with unpaired non-`?` on the right.\n  - Pair remaining `?` on the right with unpaired non-`?` on the left.\n  - Finally, pair any leftover `?` from both sides with each other.\n\nThis greedy approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    left = list(l)\n    right = list(r)\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors\n    left_count = defaultdict(int)\n    right_count = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for c in left:\n        if c != '?':\n            left_count[c] += 1\n    for c in right:\n        if c != '?':\n            right_count[c] += 1\n\n    matched_pairs = []\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n\n    # Create lists of indices for each color\n    color_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if left[i] != '?':\n            color_indices[left[i]].append(i)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if right[i] != '?':\n            color_indices[right[i]].append(i)\n\n    # First, match specific colors\n    for color in color_indices:\n        left_list = color_indices[color]\n        right_list = color_indices[color]\n        l_ptr = 0\n        r_ptr = 0\n        while l_ptr < len(left_list) and r_ptr < len(right_list):\n            if not used_left[left_list[l_ptr]] and not used_right[right_list[r_ptr]]:\n                matched_pairs.append((left_list[l_ptr] + 1, right_list[r_ptr] + 1))\n                used_left[left_list[l_ptr]] = True\n                used_right[right_list[r_ptr]] = True\n                l_ptr += 1\n                r_ptr += 1\n            elif not used_left[left_list[l_ptr]]:\n                l_ptr += 1\n            else:\n                r_ptr += 1\n\n    # Step 2: Match ?
