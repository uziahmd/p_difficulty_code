After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where their mark is the maximum for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the marks for the first student in each subject.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects their mark is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the steps.\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Let's read the gradebook as a list of lists. Each row is a student, each column is a subject.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe gradebook would be:\n\nStudent 0: [2, 2, 3]\nStudent 1: [2, 3, 2]\nStudent 2: [1, 1, 2]\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2, student 2 has 1)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nStudent 0 has 2 in subject 0 (max), and 3 in subject 2 (max). So he is successful.\nStudent 1 has 2 in subject 0 (max?), but wait, the max for subject 0 is 2. So student 0 and 1 both have 2. So student 1 is also successful because he has 3 in subject 1 (max there). So student 1 is successful.\nStudent 2 has no max in any subject. So the total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the maximum for each subject (column).\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers. So for each row in the input, we can process it as a list of integers.\n\nOnce we have the data, for each column (subject), compute the maximum value.\n\nFor example, for the first sample:\n\ncolumns are:\n\ncol0: [2,2,1] → max is 2\ncol1: [2,3,1] → max is 3\ncol2: [3,2,2] → max is 3\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo for student 0: [2,2,3]. Check each column:\n\ncol0: 2 == max (yes) → so he is successful.\n\nSo even if a student has multiple max in different subjects, it's enough once.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute for each column the maximum.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the column's max.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nIn Python, since the data is stored as a list of lists (each row is a list of integers), for each column index j, iterate through all rows and collect the j-th element, then take max.\n\nFor example, for column j:\n\nmax_marks = [max(row[j] for row in gradebook) for j in range(m)]\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max for that column.\n\nSo for each student in gradebook:\n\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            mark as successful and break\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. For each line, convert to a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in a column is equal to max_marks for that column.\n\nCount the number of students who meet this condition.\n\nNow, code-wise",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert each row of the gradebook from strings to lists of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have at least one mark that matches the maximum mark for any subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    gradebook.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\n# Compute the maximum for each subject (column)\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_col = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_col:\n            max_col = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_col)\n\n# Check each student\ncount = 0\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line is read as a string and converted into a list of integers representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This is stored in a list `max_marks` where each index corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Successful Student Check**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If so, increment the count of successful students and move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject and checking each student against these values. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
