    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the answer is 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So overlapping is allowed.\n\nThe brute force approach would be to check all possible substrings and see if they appear at least twice. But since the string length is up to 100, maybe that's manageable. Let's think about the steps.\n\nLet me think: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. The maximum possible L is floor(n/2), but maybe even higher? Wait, for example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then the maximum substring is 4 (since 'aaaa' occurs twice, overlapping). So for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1, but only if the first n-1 characters are same as the last n-1. But for example, for n=5, the maximum possible L is 4, but that would require that the first 4 and the last 4 are same. So for the general case, we can check all possible L from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1, and for each L, check all possible substrings of that length, and see if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (len(s)-1) down to 1.\n\n2. For each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n\n3. If found, return L as the answer.\n\n4. If no such substring is found for any L, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nFor example, for the string 'ababa', len is 5. So possible L starts from 4, then 3, etc. For L=4, the substrings are 'abab' and 'baba'. Neither of these appear more than once. Then L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' appears twice. So return 3.\n\nSo the approach would work.\n\nNow, for each L, how do I check if any substring of length L occurs at least twice?\n\nFor each L, iterate through all possible starting indices i (from 0 to len(s) - L), and collect all substrings of length L. Then check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut for checking duplicates, perhaps using a set. For each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if the size of the set is less than the number of substrings. Because if there are duplicates, the set will have fewer elements. But wait, that's not sufficient. Because if there are multiple duplicates, but the same substring occurs more than once. For example, if a substring appears three times, then the set will have that substring once, but the count would be more than one.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, collect all substrings, and check if any of them appears at least two times.\n\nSo for each L, we can create a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each substring. Then, for any substring with count >=2, return True.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking existence, perhaps using a set. For example, for each substring, as we generate it, check if it's already in the set. If yes, then return True for this L. Otherwise, add it to the set. This would be more efficient, as we can break early once a duplicate is found.\n\nSo for each L, we can do the following:\n\nInitialize a set. Then for each i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n   substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n   if substr is in the set: return True for this L.\n\n   else: add substr to the set.\n\nIf after checking all substrings for this L, no duplicates found, proceed to L-1.\n\nThis way, for each L, we can check in O(n) time (for n being the length of the string). Since the maximum L is up to 100, and for each L, the process is O(n), the total time is O(n^2), which for n=100 is acceptable.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ndef longest_substring(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return L\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but for example, in the case where the same substring appears more than once, but not overlapping. Like 'aaaaa' with L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3) and 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So the code would catch that. So this approach works.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, the sample input 'ababa' with L=3. The first occurrence is at i=0 (aba), then i=2 (aba). The code would check for substrings in order. When i=0, substr is 'aba' added to the set. Then when i=2, substr is 'aba', which is already in the set, so returns True. So that's correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. Wait, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line containing the string. Wait, no. Wait the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is a string. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty...\n\nSo the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows a list of strings. That's probably because the sample input is showing multiple test cases. For example, perhaps the actual input is a single string, but the sample shows multiple test cases. However, the user's code needs to read from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input seems to be a list of strings, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe input is given as the first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. But the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] which is a list of three strings. But that's probably a mistake in formatting. Or perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for clarity, but in reality, the input is a single string.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. For example, for the sample input, perhaps the input is 'abcd', then 'ababa', then 'zzz' as separate test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the desired outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. But the problem says \"You're given a string...\", implying that it's a single string. But the sample input shows multiple strings. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is presented in a way that shows multiple test cases. However, the actual code needs to process one string per input line.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the original problem is in a format where the input is a list of test cases. But the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So maybe the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem description is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is a list of strings (each being a test case), and the output is a list of corresponding answers. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem description, and the actual code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input may be multiple test cases. For example, perhaps the input is multiple lines, each line being a string. But the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings. However, in practice, the code needs to read from stdin, which could be multiple lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. But the sample shows multiple strings. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single string. However, the sample output is also a list of outputs. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each on separate lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one string, and output one number. However, the sample input shows three strings and the sample output shows three numbers. Therefore, perhaps the original problem is that the code should process multiple test cases, each given on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement is unclear. However, looking at the original problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut in practice, when you have programming competition problems, the input is usually multiple lines. For example, each line is a separate test case. So perhaps the original problem is that the input is multiple lines, each line is a string. And for each of them, output the answer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as the first input line contains the string. Which would imply that there is only one test case.\n\nThis is confusing. However, the user's note says that this is a very easy question. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustration, but the actual code is supposed to read a single string from input. For example, the sample input for 'abcd' would output 0, for 'ababa' output 3, etc.\n\nBut in that case, the code would read a single string, and output one number. However, the sample input shows three strings and outputs three numbers. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So maybe the sample input is written in a way that the first line is a list of strings, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate lines, each being a string.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from input, process each as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the problem's input description? Well, the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not accurate, and the actual code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three strings and outputs three numbers, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. So perhaps the input is multiple lines, each being a separate string. So for example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's input says that the first line contains the string. So perhaps that's a mistake. For example, perhaps the problem is that the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So let's assume that the input is multiple lines, each being a string. For example, the sample input has three lines: 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz', and the output is three numbers: 0, 3, 2.\n\nTherefore, the code must read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them, and process each.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. Which is conflicting. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem's input description is incorrect, and the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input is written as a list of strings, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line, which is a list of strings, like the sample input. But that's unlikely, since the input is supposed to be a string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is a single string per line. For example, the sample input is three separate lines, each being a string. So the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nIn that case, the code would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, compute the answer and print it.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and compute the answer\n\n    print(answer)\n\nBut for the sample input, if the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThen the output would be 0, 3, 2.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the outputs are ['0', '3', '2'], which would be printed as 0\\n3\\n2\\n.\n\nSo, the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains the string. Which implies that there's only one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. Therefore, this is conflicting. However, given the sample, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Therefore, proceed under that assumption.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a string, but the sample shows multiple strings, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. However, the user's note says that this is a very easy question, so the code is likely to be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual input is a single string. For example, the problem might have been presented with the sample input as a list for clarity, but the actual input is a single string. In that case, the code should read a single string, and output the answer.\n\nBut then, for the sample input, the code would take 'abcd' as input, output 0, then 'ababa' as input, output 3, etc. But how would that work? The user's code must read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is typically one line per test case.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects to read a single string, and output one number. However, the sample input and output show multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps look at the sample input and output. For example, the sample input is given as a list of strings, but the output is a list of numbers. So the code should process each string in the input list and output the corresponding answer.\n\nBut in practice, the code must read from stdin. So if the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps the code should read them as lines. For example, the input is given as three lines, each being a string. So the code would read each line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo assuming that, the code would be:\n\nRead each line from stdin, for each line, compute the answer.\n\nNow, the code for solving the problem for a single string is as discussed earlier.\n\nNow, implementing the function.\n\nLet's code the function for a single string.\n\nFor example, for the string 'zzz', the possible L is 2. For L=2, substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So the code would return 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 'abcd' has no repeated substrings. So returns 0.\n\nSo the code for a single string is:\n\ndef max_repeated_substring_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return L\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nBut wait, for L in range(n-1, 0, -1). For example, if n is 1, then n-1 is 0, and the loop runs from 0 down to 0, but the range is (n-1, 0, -1) which is range(0, 0, -1) which is empty. So for n=1, returns 0. Which is correct, since a single character can't have a substring that appears twice.\n\nSo that's handled correctly.\n\nNow, in Python, for the code, the code would read each line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    max_len = L\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if max_len > 0:\n\n                break\n\n        else:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, for each line, the code processes the string. For example, for 'ababa', the code would check L=4 (n-1 is 4 for len 5). For L=4, the substrings are 'abab' and 'baba' â€” no duplicates. Then L=3, check substrings. The first is 'aba', added. Then i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: 'aba' is already in the set. So returns 3. So the code would print 3.\n\nBut the code above, for each line, loops from L = n-1 down to 1. For each L, it checks all substrings, and if any duplicate is found, returns L and breaks out of all loops. Otherwise, continues.\n\nBut the code as written for the main function may have an issue. Because for each line, the code starts with max_len = 0, then for each L, checks. Once a L is found, it prints L and breaks. Else, after all Ls, prints 0.\n\nBut the code inside the for line loop would be:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    ... compute and print ...\n\nBut the code for the function would be:\n\nBut in the code above, the 'for line in sys.stdin' would read all lines. For example, if the input is three lines, then the code would process each line.\n\nBut the code inside the for line loop:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n   ... \n\n   if found, print L and break.\n\nBut in the code, after breaking, the code would proceed to the next line. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the 'max_len' is initialized to 0. Then, for each L, for the current line, we check. Once a L is found, print it and break. Else, after all Ls, print 0.\n\nBut the code above uses a for-else structure. Wait, no. The code inside the for line loop is:\n\nfor line in ...:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    for L in ...:\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in ...:\n\n            substr = ...\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                max_len = L\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(...)\n\n        if max_len > 0:\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nWait, no. The code has a for loop for L in ... and then an else clause. But the code for the 'for L in ...' loop is not enclosed in a for-else. The code above is:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                max_len = L\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if max_len > 0:\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nWait, no. The 'for L in ...' loop does not have an else. The else is part of the for line loop? No. The code as written has the else attached to the for L loop? No. The code above is written as:\n\nInside the processing of each line:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n   ... \n\n   if max_len >0: break\n\nelse:\n\n   print(0)\n\nBut that's not correct. Because the else is attached to the for L loop. Wait, in Python, the else clause of a for loop is executed when the loop completes normally (i.e., not broken by a break). So, in the code:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n    ... \n\n    if found:\n\n        break\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nSo, the code for each line is:\n\nfor line in ...:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in ...:\n\n        ... check for substrings ...\n\n        if found:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut that's not the case in the code I wrote earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe code I wrote earlier had:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                max_len = L\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if max_len > 0:\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut this code is incorrect. Because the 'else' is attached to the for L loop. But the for L loop is not in a for-else structure. The 'else' is attached to the for line loop? No, the code is written with the else after the for L loop. Which is not correct. Because the code is:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n    ... \n\n    if ...:\n\n        break\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut the code as written in the previous code block is not structured that way. The code inside the line loop is:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n   ... \n\n   if max_len>0: break\n\nelse:\n\n   print(0)\n\nBut that's not correct. The else is attached to the for L loop. So the code is:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n    ... \n\n    if ...:\n\n        break\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut in the code above, the 'else' is part of the for L loop. But in the code as written, the code is:\n\nInside the processing of a line:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n    ... \n\n    if max_len>0: break\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut that's not correct. Because the 'else' is not attached to the for L loop. Because the code is written as:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n    ... \n\n    if max_len>0: break\n\n    # no else here\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut that else is not part of the for loop. It's part of the for line loop. Which is not correct.\n\nAh, I see. So the code I wrote earlier was incorrect. The correct way is to have the else clause attached to the for L loop. So the code should be:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut this is better. Because for each line, we check all possible Ls. Once found, print and break. If none found, print 0.\n\nAlternatively, using the for-else structure.\n\nLike:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        else:\n\n            continue\n\n        break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nThis is a more Pythonic way. Let's explain:\n\nFor each L in descending order:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   for each i in possible positions:\n\n      substr = ...\n\n      if substr in seen: then print L, break out of the i loop.\n\n      else add to seen.\n\n   if the i loop completes without breaking (i.e., no duplicates found for this L), then continue to next L.\n\n   else, break out of the L loop and proceed to print.\n\nIf all Ls are checked and no duplicates found, then the else clause of the L loop is executed, which prints 0.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nSo the code for each line is:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        else:\n\n            continue\n\n        break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nThis code handles all cases. Let's test for the sample input.\n\nFor 'abcd':\n\nn=4. L ranges from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. So the inner loop completes, continue to next L.\n\nL=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates. Continue.\n\nL=1: substrings are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique. So no duplicates. So after all Ls, the else clause is executed, print 0.\n\nFor 'ababa' (n=5):\n\nL starts from 4 down.\n\nFor L=4:\n\nsubstrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. Continue.\n\nL=3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' added.\n\ni=1: 'bab' added.\n\ni=2: 'aba' is in seen. So print 3 and break.\n\nThus, output is 3.\n\nFor 'zzz' (n=3):\n\nL=2.\n\nsubstrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So during the i loop, when i=1, substr is 'zz' which is already in seen. So print 2.\n\nThus, the sample outputs are correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nTest case: s = 'aa' â†’ output is 1. Because substring 'a' occurs twice. But for L=1, the code will check. Let's see:\n\nn=2. L starts from 1 (since n-1 is 1).\n\nFor L=1:\n\nsubstrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). So during the i loop, when i=1, substr is 'a' which is already in seen. So print 1.\n\nAnother case: s='aaa' â†’ maximum L is 2. For L=2, substrings are 'aa' (i=0), 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nAnother case: s='aabbaa' â†’ the maximum substring is 3. For example, 'aab' and 'aab'? Or 'aabbaa' has 'aa' appearing multiple times. Let's see. The longest is 3? Or 4? Let's think.\n\nThe string is 'aabbaa'.\n\nPossible substrings of length 3:\n\naab, abb, bba, baa.\n\nBut 'aab' occurs once, 'abb' once, 'bba' once, 'baa' once. No duplicates.\n\nLength 2: 'aa' occurs at 0-1, 4-5. Also, 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', etc. So for L=2, 'aa' occurs twice. So the answer is 2. But wait, what about longer substrings?\n\nWait, for L=3, the substrings are aab, abb, bba, baa. None of these are repeated. But for L=2, 'aa' occurs twice. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, there's also 'ab' occurs once, 'bb' once, 'ba' occurs once, 'aa' occurs twice.\n\nSo the code would return 2.\n\nBut what about the substring 'aa' in positions 0-1 and 4-5. So yes.\n\nSo the code would find that for L=2, and return 2.\n\nBut what about the substring 'aabbaa' has a longer substring. For example, 'aabbaa' has 'aabbaa' of length 6, but no duplicates. So the code returns 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' â†’ the maximum L is 4. Because the substring 'aaaa' occurs at positions 0-3 and 1-4. So the code would find for L=4, and return 4.\n\nSo for the string 'aaaaa', len is 5. L starts at 4. For L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So the code returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nNow, the code is written in Python. Now, the code must read from stdin, and output the answer for each line.\n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        else:\n\n            continue\n\n        break\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut wait, what if the input line is empty? According to the problem statement, the input string is non-empty. So the code can assume that s is non-empty.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nSo the code would process each line and output accordingly.\n\nBut in the code, for the line 'zzz', the code would process as follows:\n\nn=3.\n\nLoop L in 2, 1.\n\nFor L=2:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n\ni=0: substr 'zz' added to seen.\n\ni=1: substr 'zz' is in seen â†’ print 2 and break.\n\nThus, output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of multiple lines, each containing a string. We need to process each string individually.\n2. **Substring Search**: For each string, we check all possible substrings starting from the longest possible length down to 1. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring as soon as possible.\n3. **Set Utilization**: For each length, we use a set to keep track of substrings we have seen so far. If a substring is found in the set, it means we have encountered it before, and thus we return the current length as the result for that string.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as we find a valid substring length, we terminate further checks for that string to optimize performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    s = line.strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    found = False\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                found = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if found:\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, strips any extraneous whitespace, and processes each string individually.\n2. **Iterating Over Lengths**: For each string, we start checking from the longest possible substring length (which is `n-1` where `n` is the length of the string) down to 1.\n3. **Checking Substrings**: For each length `L`, we generate all possible substrings of that length and check if they have been seen before using a set. If a duplicate is found, we immediately print the length `L` and stop further checks for that string.\n4. **Handling No Duplicates**: If no valid substring is found after checking all lengths, we print `0`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by leveraging early termination and set operations for quick lookups, resulting in an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
