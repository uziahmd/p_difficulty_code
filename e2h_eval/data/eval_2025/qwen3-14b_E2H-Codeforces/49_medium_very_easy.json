They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values given for each road (edge) between two lawns (vertices). The task is to determine if such a configuration exists and if so, output one possible solution.\n\nSo, the input gives us n lawns and m roads. Each road connects two lawns and has a GCD and LCM value. For each edge, the GCD and LCM of the two connected vertices' mushroom counts must be those values.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. For each edge between u and v, we have:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nBut there's a relation between GCD and LCM: gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a*b. So, for any two numbers a and b, their product equals the product of their GCD and LCM. Therefore, for each edge, the product of the GCD and LCM must be equal to the product of the two numbers. But since the GCD and LCM are given, we can compute that product.\n\nBut wait, for each edge, we have that a_u and a_v must be multiples of the GCD. Also, their LCM is given. Let me think: Let's suppose that for a pair (u, v), the GCD is g and LCM is l. Then, the product of a_u and a_v is g*l. Also, since the GCD is g, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime (since any common divisor would have been part of the GCD). Then, the LCM of a_u and a_v is g * x * y. Which must equal l. Therefore, l must be equal to g * x * y. So x * y = l / g. Also, since x and y are coprime, this implies that x and y must be divisors of l/g and coprime. \n\nSo for each edge, the product of the two numbers (a_u and a_v) is g*l. Also, their ratio must be such that they are multiples of g, and their LCM is l.\n\nBut how do we assign values to the nodes?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each edge imposes constraints on the nodes it connects. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined based on the edges connected to it. However, since the constraints are between pairs of nodes, we need to find a way to assign values that satisfy all these constraints.\n\nLet me think of this as building a graph where each connected component must have consistent assignments. For example, if two nodes are connected by an edge, their values must satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions. But since the constraints are between pairs, maybe we can model this with a union-find structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the constraints are between pairs, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations or relations.\n\nAnother approach: For each connected component in the graph, we can assign variables to the nodes and find values that satisfy all the edge constraints. However, the problem is that for each edge, there are multiple possibilities for the values of the nodes. How can we ensure consistency across the entire component?\n\nLet me consider that for each edge between u and v, we have that a_u and a_v must be multiples of the GCD (g). Let me denote that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g. Because LCM(a_u, a_v) = g * x * y = l. Therefore, l/g must be equal to x*y, and since x and y are coprime, x and y must be factors of l/g and coprime.\n\nBut how do we assign x and y for each edge? For example, if we have multiple edges connected to a node, the x and y values must be consistent across all edges connected to that node.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For instance, if we pick a starting node and assign a value, then propagate constraints through the edges.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for each edge, there are two possibilities for the pair (x, y). For example, if the edge requires that x*y = k (where k = l/g), and x and y are coprime, then x and y could be any pair of coprime factors of k. However, once you fix x for one node, the other node's value is determined (y = k/x). But how do we ensure that this choice is consistent with other edges connected to the same node?\n\nThis suggests that the graph must be bipartitioned in some way. Wait, but perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I have a connected component. Let's take a node u and assign a value to it. Then, for each edge connected to u, I can determine the value of the adjacent node. However, the problem is that when there are cycles in the graph, the assignments must be consistent around the cycle.\n\nFor example, consider three nodes u, v, w connected in a triangle. Suppose we assign a value to u, compute the value for v based on the edge u-v, then compute the value for w based on the edge v-w, then check if the edge u-w's constraints are satisfied. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem can be approached by building a graph where each node's value is determined based on the edges, and we need to perform a BFS or DFS traversal, assigning values as we go, and checking for consistency.\n\nBut how do we handle the assignment? Let's think about the following steps:\n\nFor each connected component in the graph:\n\n1. Choose a starting node. Assign it a value. But what value? Well, the value must be such that for each edge connected to it, the GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the value of the node depends on the edges. For example, if we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then the product of u's value and v's value is g*l. However, if u is assigned a value, then v's value is (g*l)/u's value. But also, the GCD of u and v must be g. So, the value of u must be a multiple of g, and the value of v must be a multiple of g. Also, the GCD(u, v) must equal g.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the edge between u and v with given g and l. Let's suppose that a_u and a_v are the mushroom counts. Then:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nWe know that a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, since the GCD is g, we can write a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime. Then, the LCM of a_u and a_v is g * x * y. Therefore, l = g * x * y. Hence, x * y = l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, x and y must be coprime factors of l/g.\n\nTherefore, for each edge, x and y must be coprime factors of (l/g), and their product is exactly that value. So, for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be such that x * y = k, where k = l/g, and gcd(x,y) = 1.\n\nNow, for the edge between u and v, once we assign a value to u (say, a_u = g * x), then a_v must be g * y, where y = k / x. But since x and y are coprime, this ensures that the GCD of a_u and a_v is g, and the LCM is l.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning x values to the nodes in such a way that for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v equals k (k = l/g for that edge), and x_u and x_v are coprime.\n\nWait, but how do we assign the x values? Because for each edge, the product x_u * x_v must be k. But since x_u and x_v are coprime, this implies that x_u must divide k, and x_v must divide k. Also, x_u and x_v must be coprime.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like a system of equations where for each edge, x_u * x_v = k, and gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1. However, since the product is fixed and the numbers are coprime, each x_u and x_v must be divisors of k and their product is k. So, for each edge, the pair (x_u, x_v) must be a pair of coprime factors of k whose product is k. Thus, for each such edge, x_u must be a divisor of k, and x_v = k / x_u.\n\nBut how can we assign x values to nodes such that for every edge, this condition holds?\n\nThis seems similar to a bipartition problem. Because, for example, if we have an edge between u and v with x_u * x_v = k, and x_u and x_v are coprime, then once x_u is chosen, x_v is fixed as k/x_u. However, if there are multiple edges connected to a node, then the x value of that node must be compatible with all of them.\n\nSo, for example, suppose node u is connected to node v via an edge with k1, and to node w via an edge with k2. Then, the x_u must be a divisor of k1 and also a divisor of k2. But since x_u * x_v = k1 and x_u * x_w = k2, then x_v = k1/x_u and x_w = k2/x_u. Also, since x_v and x_u are coprime, x_u must be coprime with x_v (which is k1/x_u). But since x_u divides k1, and x_v is k1/x_u, their product is k1, and they are coprime. So that's okay.\n\nBut how can we ensure that all these constraints are satisfied across the entire connected component?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the x values as being determined by a BFS or DFS traversal. Let's think of building a graph where each node's x value is determined relative to the starting node. For example, if we start with a node u and assign x_u = some value (like 1?), then for each adjacent node v, we can compute x_v as k / x_u, where k is the corresponding l/g for that edge. However, the problem is that the initial x_u can't be arbitrary. For example, x_u must be a divisor of all the k's for edges connected to u. Wait, but how do we choose x_u?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can build a system where the x values are determined by the product of the k's along paths. Let me think: For example, suppose we have a path from u to v through a series of edges. The product of the k's along the edges would need to be such that x_u * x_v = product of ... ?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for any two nodes connected by a path, their x values must multiply to the product of the k's along the edges in the path. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there is a path u - v - w. For the edge u-v, the k is k1. For the edge v-w, the k is k2. Then, for u and v, x_u * x_v = k1. For v and w, x_v * x_w = k2. So, x_u * x_v * x_v * x_w = k1 * k2. But x_u * x_w = (k1 * k2) / (x_v^2). Hmm, but that's not helpful. However, if we multiply the two equations, we get x_u * x_v^2 * x_w = k1 * k2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the product of x_u * x_v = k1 and x_v * x_w = k2, then multiplying them gives x_u * x_v^2 * x_w = k1*k2. But unless we have more information, it's hard to see the relation between x_u and x_w.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the product of x_u and x_w. From the equations:\n\nx_u = k1 / x_v\n\nx_w = k2 / x_v\n\nSo, x_u * x_w = (k1 * k2) / (x_v^2)\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps, for a cycle in the graph, the product of the k's along the cycle must be a square. Let me think: For example, take a triangle u-v-w-u. Let the edges have k1 (u-v), k2 (v-w), k3 (w-u). Then, from the equations:\n\nx_u * x_v = k1\n\nx_v * x_w = k2\n\nx_w * x_u = k3\n\nMultiply all three equations: (x_u x_v x_w)^2 = k1 k2 k3 → x_u x_v x_w = sqrt(k1 k2 k3). Therefore, k1 k2 k3 must be a perfect square. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nSo, in order for the cycle to be consistent, the product of the k's along the cycle must be a perfect square.\n\nThis suggests that during the BFS/DFS traversal, whenever we encounter a back edge (i.e., a cycle), we must check whether the product of the k's along the cycle is a perfect square. If not, the answer is impossible.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a starting node. Assign x to it as 1 (or some value that divides all k's for edges connected to it? Wait, but how do we choose that?)\n\nWait, but the x value for the starting node can be arbitrary? No, because for each edge connected to it, x must be a divisor of the k for that edge. So for example, if the starting node u is connected to v via an edge with k1, then x_u must be a divisor of k1. Similarly, if u is connected to another node w via an edge with k2, x_u must divide k2. Therefore, x_u must be a common divisor of all k's of the edges connected to u.\n\nBut how can we choose x_u? Well, perhaps the x_u can be chosen as 1, but only if all the k's for edges connected to u are divisible by 1 (which they always are). However, this may not be sufficient. For example, if the k's are 6 and 4 for two edges connected to u. Then, x_u must divide both 6 and 4, so x_u can be 1 or 2. Choosing 1 would allow x_v = 6/1 = 6 and x_w = 4/1 = 4. However, if later on, there's a constraint that requires x_v to be something else, that might conflict.\n\nBut how can we choose x_u in a way that allows for consistency?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the x values are determined up to a multiplicative factor. For example, if we assign x_u as a certain value, then all other x's are determined based on that. However, the problem is that the initial assignment may not be valid. So perhaps we need to find a value for x_u such that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me think again. Since for each edge, x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is k (l/g), then x_u must be a divisor of k, and x_v must be k/x_u. Moreover, since they are coprime, x_u and x_v must be coprime. So for the edge between u and v, x_u must be a divisor of k, and x_v = k / x_u. And since they are coprime, x_u must be coprime with k/x_u. Which implies that x_u must be a divisor of k and that x_u and k/x_u are coprime. Which is equivalent to saying that x_u is a divisor of k and that x_u is square-free? Or perhaps not. Wait, for example, if k is 6, then x_u can be 1 (coprime with 6), or 2 (coprime with 3?), but 2 and 3 are coprime. Wait, 2 divides 6 and 6/2 = 3. gcd(2,3) is 1. So yes. Similarly, if x_u is 3, then 6/3=2, which is coprime. So for k=6, the possible x_u's are 1, 2, 3, 6. But wait, for x_u = 6, x_v would be 1, which is coprime with 6. So yes. So in general, for any divisor d of k, if we set x_u =d, then x_v = k/d, and since d and k/d are coprime, that works.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because if d divides k, then k/d is an integer. But why are d and k/d necessarily coprime? Because if they had a common divisor greater than 1, say p, then p divides d and k/d. Therefore, p divides k. So, since d divides k, and p divides d, then p divides k. But then, p divides k/d? Let's see. Suppose that d * (k/d) = k. So, if p divides d and p divides k/d, then p divides k. But that's possible. For example, take k = 4, d = 2. Then k/d is 2. So d and k/d are 2 and 2, which are not coprime. But according to our earlier reasoning, this would be invalid. But in that case, the product x_u * x_v = 4, but x_u and x_v are both 2, which are not coprime. Hence, this would not satisfy the condition that x_u and x_v are coprime. Therefore, this suggests that my earlier conclusion was wrong. So, the x_u and x_v must be coprime, which requires that d and (k/d) are coprime. Therefore, for a given k, the possible d's are those divisors of k where d and (k/d) are coprime.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible pairs (x_u, x_v) are pairs of coprime integers whose product is k. Therefore, for each edge, the x_u must be a divisor of k, and x_v must be k/x_u, and they must be coprime. Which implies that for each edge, the k must be such that there exists at least one pair of coprime divisors whose product is k. But since k = l/g, and l must be a multiple of g (since LCM is at least as big as the GCD), then k is l/g, which is an integer. However, for the pair (x, y) to exist, the product x*y must be k and they are coprime. Which is always possible. For example, take x=1 and y=k. They are coprime. So for any k, there exists such a pair. Therefore, for each edge, there's at least one possible way to assign x and y.\n\nBut how to choose the x's for the nodes such that for all edges, the x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is k.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning x values to the nodes such that for each edge between u and v, x_u * x_v = k (where k is l/g for that edge) and gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1.\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each edge enforces that x_u * x_v = k and gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of this as a bipartition problem. For example, if we have an edge between u and v with k, then x_u and x_v must be coprime and their product is k. So, x_u must be a divisor of k and x_v = k/x_u. Now, if I assign x_u as some divisor of k, then x_v is determined. However, if there are multiple edges connected to u, the x_u must be a divisor of all the k's of those edges. Therefore, x_u must be a common divisor of all k's of edges connected to u.\n\nWait, that's an important point. For example, suppose node u is connected to two edges. Edge 1 has k1, Edge 2 has k2. Then, x_u must be a divisor of k1 and a divisor of k2. Therefore, x_u must be a common divisor of k1 and k2. Therefore, the x_u must be a divisor of the GCD(k1, k2).\n\nSo, for each node u, the x_u must be a common divisor of all the k's of edges connected to u. Therefore, the x_u must be a divisor of the GCD of all k's of edges connected to u.\n\nBut how can we find such x values?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each connected component, we can model the x values as follows:\n\n- Assign x values to nodes in such a way that for each edge, x_u * x_v = k and gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1.\n\nThis can be done by building a graph where each edge represents a relation between x_u and x_v, and we can perform BFS or DFS to assign values.\n\nLet me try to think of the following approach:\n\nChoose a starting node, assign it a value (like 1?), then for each neighbor, assign x_neighbor = k / x_current. Then proceed recursively, checking for consistency.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value for the starting node? Well, the initial value must be a divisor of all k's for edges connected to the starting node. However, how do we know what that is?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value can be determined as follows. For the starting node u, the x_u must be a divisor of all k's of edges connected to u. Therefore, the x_u must be a divisor of the GCD of all those k's. So, for example, if the starting node has edges with k values 6, 4, then the GCD is 2, so x_u can be 1 or 2. Choosing one of these as the initial value.\n\nBut how do we choose between them? Well, perhaps we can choose the GCD itself as the initial value. But then, for each edge, x_u is the GCD of the k's, and then x_v = k / x_u. But this may not be feasible if x_v is not coprime with x_u.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assign x_u as 1. But then, for each edge connected to u, x_v is k, and since x_u is 1, which is coprime with any k, that's okay. But then, when we process other edges connected to v, we must make sure that their k's are compatible with the x_v = k.\n\nBut how can we handle that? Let's take an example.\n\nExample: Input is 2 nodes connected by an edge with GCD 1 and LCM 3. Then k = LCM / GCD = 3 / 1 = 3. So, x_u * x_v = 3. Assign x_u = 1, then x_v = 3. Check that gcd(1,3)=1. Yes. So that's valid. Then the mushroom counts are a_u = 1 * GCD = 1*1=1, a_v = 3 * 1=3. Which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother example: Suppose there's a node u connected to two edges. Edge 1: k1=6, Edge 2: k2=4. So, the GCD of k1 and k2 is 2. So x_u must be a divisor of 2. So possible options are 1 or 2.\n\nIf we choose x_u = 1:\n\nFor edge 1: x_v = 6/1 = 6. Check gcd(1,6) = 1. Okay.\n\nFor edge 2: x_w = 4/1 =4. Check gcd(1,4)=1. Okay.\n\nThen, if there are further edges connected to v and w, we proceed accordingly.\n\nIf we choose x_u = 2:\n\nFor edge 1: x_v = 6/2 =3. Check gcd(2,3)=1. Okay.\n\nFor edge 2: x_w =4/2 =2. Check gcd(2,2) = 2 !=1. Which is invalid. So this assignment would not work. Hence, choosing x_u=2 here is invalid.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the initial assignment must be x_u=1, which is possible.\n\nSo, the key is to choose x_u as a divisor of the GCD of all k's of edges connected to u, and then proceed with the assignments, checking for consistency.\n\nBut how can we find such a divisor?\n\nThis seems complex. However, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- For each node, collect all the k values of its edges. Compute the GCD of all those k's. Let's call this G. Then, the x value for the node must be a divisor of G. However, since the x value must also be such that for each edge, when multiplied by the neighbor's x value, equals the k of that edge, and the two x values are coprime.\n\nBut how can we find such a value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each edge between u and v has a weight of k. Then, for each connected component, we can assign x values such that for any two connected nodes, x_u * x_v = k. This seems like a system of equations. For example, if we have a tree, we can assign x values starting from the root. For a cycle, we need to check consistency.\n\nSo, here's an idea:\n\n- Treat the graph as a tree (assuming it's connected). Choose a root node. Assign x_root as 1. Then, for each child node, assign x_child = k / x_parent. Proceed recursively. Once all nodes are assigned, check for all edges whether x_u * x_v equals their k and whether gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1.\n\nBut what if the graph has cycles? Then, during the traversal, when we reach a node that's already visited, we need to check if the current x value is consistent with the previously assigned value. If not, then it's impossible.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose we have a triangle u-v-w-u. Let's say the edges have k1, k2, k3. Starting at u, assign x_u =1. Then, for edge u-v, x_v = k1. For edge v-w, x_w = k2 / x_v = k2 / k1. For edge w-u, we should have x_w * x_u = k3. Which implies (k2/k1) * 1 = k3 → k2/k1 = k3 → k1*k3 =k2. But if this is not true, then there's a contradiction.\n\nSo, in this case, during traversal, when we reach the back edge, we check if the product of the current x values equals the k of the edge. If not, return NO.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm could be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Perform BFS or DFS, assigning x values as follows:\n\n   - When visiting a node for the first time, assign x value based on the parent's x value and the edge's k.\n\n   - When encountering a back edge (already visited node), check if x_current * x_visited equals the k of that edge. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce all edges are processed and no contradictions are found, then proceed to compute the mushroom counts as a_i = g_i * x_i, where g_i is the GCD from the edge connected to the node. Wait, no. Wait, for each node, the mushroom count is a_i = GCD * x_i? Or depends on the edge?\n\nNo, the GCD and LCM are per edge. For example, for an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x*y = l/g, and gcd(x,y) = 1.\n\nBut the x values are per node. However, for a node u connected to multiple edges, each with different GCDs and LCMs. How can we reconcile this?\n\nAh, here's a problem. Because the x values depend on the edge. For example, if node u is connected to node v via edge with GCD g1 and LCM l1, and to node w via edge with GCD g2 and LCM l2, then for each edge, we have:\n\na_u = g1 * x_uv (for the edge u-v)\na_u = g2 * x_uw (for the edge u-w)\n\nBut this implies that g1 * x_uv = g2 * x_uw. Which may not be possible unless there's a way to reconcile these equations.\n\nWait, this seems to be a problem. How can the same node u have different a_u values depending on the edge?\n\nAh, this indicates that my previous approach is flawed. Because the a_u is the same regardless of which edge it is connected to. Therefore, the x values must be such that for any two edges connected to u, the a_u computed via those edges is the same.\n\nThis complicates things. Because earlier, I thought of x as being per node, but now it's clear that the x is dependent on the edge. Therefore, this approach is not correct.\n\nSo, what's wrong with my previous reasoning?\n\nEarlier, I considered that for each edge between u and v, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x*y = l/g and x and y are coprime. However, this g is specific to that edge. So, for a node u connected to multiple edges, each with their own g and l, the a_u must be equal to g1 * x1 for one edge, and g2 * x2 for another edge. Therefore, these must be equal. Hence, this implies that for each node, the value a_u must be the same across all edges connected to it. Therefore, the x values must be chosen such that for each edge, a_u is consistent with all other edges connected to u.\n\nThis seems very complex. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think again. For each edge (u, v), we have:\n\na_u = g_uv * x_uv\na_v = g_uv * y_uv\nwith x_uv * y_uv = l_uv / g_uv, and gcd(x_uv, y_uv) = 1.\n\nBut since a_u is the same for all edges connected to u, we must have that for any two edges (u, v) and (u, w), the a_u computed from both edges must be the same. That is:\n\ng_uv * x_uv = g_uw * x_uw.\n\nBut how can this be ensured?\n\nThis suggests that the problem is more complex than previously thought. Perhaps I need to find a way to assign a_u for each node such that for every edge (u, v), the GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each edge, the a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nWhich implies that a_u and a_v are multiples of g, and that their product is g*l. Also, since the GCD is g, the LCM is l, and the product is g*l, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can say that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g.\n\nBut since a_u is the same across all edges connected to u, the x's must be chosen such that for each edge connected to u, the x for that edge is a_u / g_edge, where g_edge is the GCD of that edge.\n\nBut this seems difficult to manage. How can we ensure that for all edges connected to u, a_u / g_edge is consistent with the other edges?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nFor each node u, let's define a_u = k_u * g, where g is some value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that for any two edges connected to u, say (u, v) with GCD g1 and LCM l1, and (u, w) with GCD g2 and LCM l2, we have:\n\na_u = g1 * x1\na_u = g2 * x2\n\nWhere x1 * y1 = l1/g1, and x2 * y2 = l2/g2, with y1 and x1 coprime, etc.\n\nBut this implies that g1 * x1 = g2 * x2. So, x1/x2 = g2/g1.\n\nBut how can this be handled? It seems that this introduces dependencies between the different edges connected to u.\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps I need to find a way to model the relationships between the nodes in terms of their a values.\n\nLet me think about the following. For each edge (u, v), we have that a_u and a_v are multiples of g. Let's say that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then, as before, x * y = l/g, and gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nBut since this is for a particular edge, and a_u is the same across all edges connected to u, this means that for any other edge connected to u, say (u, w), the a_u must be a multiple of its GCD, say g', and so on.\n\nThis seems very challenging. Perhaps there's a way to model the a values as products of the GCDs and some other factors.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each edge (u, v), the a_u must be a multiple of g, and the a_v must be a multiple of g. So, for all edges connected to u, the GCD of those edges must divide a_u.\n\nThis implies that a_u must be a common multiple of all the GCDs of edges connected to u. Let's denote this as GCDs for edges connected to u as g1, g2, ..., gn. Then, a_u must be a multiple of the LCM of these g's.\n\nBut how can we find such a value for a_u that satisfies all edges?\n\nThis seems like a promising direction. Let's think about this.\n\nLet me denote for each node u, the LCM of all GCDs of edges connected to u as G_u. Then, a_u must be a multiple of G_u. Let's assume that a_u = G_u * k_u, where k_u is some positive integer.\n\nThen, for each edge (u, v), the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. Since a_u is a multiple of G_u, and a_v is a multiple of G_v, and g is the GCD of the edge.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose node u is connected to v via an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, a_u = G_u * k_u, a_v = G_v * k_v. The GCD of a_u and a_v is g. So, g = gcd(G_u * k_u, G_v * k_v). Also, the LCM is l = lcm(G_u * k_u, G_v * k_v).\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to relate k_u and k_v.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it clearly. Let's think of the earlier example where the edge between u and v has GCD g and LCM l. Then, a_u * a_v = g * l. So, substituting a_u = G_u * k_u and a_v = G_v * k_v:\n\nG_u * k_u * G_v * k_v = g * l.\n\nBut I don't know if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, since the GCD of a_u and a_v is g, then g must divide both a_u and a_v. So, since a_u is a multiple of G_u, which is the LCM of the GCDs of edges connected to u, and g is one of those GCDs, then G_u must be a multiple of g. Similarly for G_v.\n\nWait, no. Because G_u is the LCM of the GCDs of edges connected to u. So, if one of those GCDs is g, then G_u is a multiple of g. So, a_u = G_u * k_u is a multiple of g, which is required.\n\nSo, for the edge between u and v, the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. Since a_u is a multiple of g and a_v is a multiple of g, we can write a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x * y = l/g.\n\nSo, this brings us back to the earlier scenario.
