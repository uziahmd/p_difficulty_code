You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle, and the number of ways to do that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required. A simple cycle with an odd length. Oh right, and each vertex occurs once. So it's a simple cycle, which is a cycle where no vertices are repeated except the starting and ending one. And the cycle must be of odd length. \n\nSo the problem is about finding the minimal t and the number of ways to achieve that. \n\nLet me think: what's the condition for a graph to have an odd-length cycle? Well, if the graph is bipartite, then it can't have any odd-length cycles. Because bipartite graphs can only have even-length cycles. So if the graph is bipartite, then adding edges to create an odd-length cycle would require certain steps. Otherwise, if the graph already has an odd-length cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1? Wait, but maybe there are multiple existing odd cycles. But the problem says to find the minimal t. So if the graph already contains an odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of ways to choose such a cycle (but since we need to add zero edges, perhaps the answer is 1? Or maybe the number of existing odd cycles? No, the problem says that the answer w is the number of ways to add t edges to form an odd cycle. So if the graph already has at least one odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of possible such cycles? But that seems complicated. However, the note in the example shows that when the input is a triangle (3 nodes connected as a cycle), the output is 0 1. Which makes sense because there's exactly one way to form the cycle (the existing one). So in that case, if the graph already contains an odd cycle, then t is zero, and w is the number of existing odd cycles? But how do we count that?\n\nWait, but the problem requires that after adding t edges, the graph has at least one such cycle. So if the graph already has such a cycle, then t is zero, and the number of ways is the number of such cycles. However, that seems computationally expensive. But maybe the problem is not about counting existing cycles, but about whether the graph is bipartite or not. Because if the graph is bipartite, then we need to add edges to make it non-bipartite. Otherwise, if it's not bipartite, then t is zero.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the graph may not be connected. So for each connected component, we need to check if it's bipartite. Because if any connected component is not bipartite, then there's already an odd-length cycle in that component. So the entire graph would have an odd-length cycle. Therefore, if the graph is not bipartite, then t is 0, and w is 1? Because adding zero edges. But how many ways are there? For example, if there are multiple existing odd cycles, but the problem requires that the way to add edges (which is zero edges) is counted as one way. Because the question says that two ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So if there are multiple existing odd cycles, but you don't add any edges, then the way is just one way (since you add zero edges). But the problem says that the output w is the number of ways to add t edges to form a cycle. So if the graph already contains an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would allow for that cycle. But how many different ways are there? Because the problem counts the number of ways to add edges. If the graph already has an odd cycle, then the number of ways would be the number of existing odd cycles? Or is it 1? Because the way to add edges is to add zero edges. But the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges (here, t is zero) to form a cycle. So in this case, the answer would be 1, because there's only one way to add zero edges. But that doesn't make sense. For example, if there are two separate odd cycles, then adding zero edges would allow for both cycles. But the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add edges. So the way is not about choosing which cycle to have, but about adding edges. Since in this case, you don't add any edges. So regardless of how many existing cycles there are, the number of ways is 1. Because the way is determined by the set of edges you add. So if you add zero edges, then there's only one way. So the answer would be t=0 and w=1. But why does the example input with 3 nodes and 3 edges (a triangle) give output 0 1? That matches this idea. So in that case, the answer is correct. So if the graph already has at least one odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is 1. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges to form a cycle. So in this case, adding zero edges, but how many different ways are there? Well, since the way is determined by the edges added. Adding zero edges is only one way. So regardless of how many existing cycles there are, the answer is 1. So the first step is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not bipartite, then output t=0 and w=1. \n\nBut if the graph is bipartite, then we need to add edges to make it non-bipartite. How can we do that? \n\nSo the problem reduces to two cases:\n\nCase 1: The graph is not bipartite. Then t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite. Then we need to add edges to create an odd-length cycle. \n\nNow, how to compute the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nIn case 2, since the graph is bipartite, adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle. Because in a bipartition (A,B), any edge between A and B is allowed. But adding an edge within A or within B would create an odd-length cycle. Because suppose you have a bipartition (A,B), and you add an edge between u and v in A. Then, since the original graph is bipartitioned, the path from u to v in the original graph is of even length. Adding the edge u-v creates a cycle of length (even +1) which is odd. So the minimal number of edges to add is 1. Because adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle. \n\nSo, in this case, t is 1. \n\nBut how to compute the number of ways? The number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in the same partition. \n\nBut wait, the graph is bipartite. So each connected component is bipartite. So for each connected component, we can compute the number of possible edges between the two partitions. Wait, no. For each connected component, the bipartition is into two sets, say X and Y. The number of possible edges that can be added between two nodes in X is C(|X|, 2). Similarly for Y. But since the original graph doesn't have any edges between nodes in X (because it's bipartite), adding any such edge would create an odd-length cycle. \n\nBut the problem is that the graph may consist of multiple connected components. So, for each connected component, we can compute the number of possible edges that can be added within each partition. Then, the total number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (number of possible edges in X_i choose 2 + number of possible edges in Y_i choose 2). Wait, no. Because adding any such edge would create an odd cycle. However, the problem requires that after adding the edges, there exists at least one odd cycle. So, for the minimal t, which is 1, the number of ways is the total number of such possible edges across all connected components. Because adding any one of them would create an odd cycle. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges (here, t=1) to form a cycle. So each way is adding exactly one edge. So the number of such edges that can be added is the sum for each connected component of (number of possible edges within the same partition). \n\nBut how to compute that. Let's think. For each connected component, which is bipartite, we can split it into two parts, say A and B. The number of possible edges that can be added within A is C(a, 2), where a is the size of A. Similarly for B. So for each connected component, the number of possible edges is (a*(a-1)/2 + b*(b-1)/2). Summing over all connected components gives the total number of ways. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the graph is given, and we need to add exactly t edges (t=1 here) to form a cycle. So each way is adding exactly one edge. So the total number of such edges is the sum over all connected components of (a choose 2 + b choose 2). \n\nBut in the first example input:\n\nThe first input is 4 nodes and 4 edges. The edges are 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. Let's see the structure. \n\nLooking at the graph: nodes 1,2,3,4. \n\nEdges between 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4. So the graph is connected. Let's check if it's bipartite. \n\nLet me try to color it. Let's start with node 1 as color 0. Then its neighbors 2 and 3 must be color 1. Then node 4 is connected to 2 and 3. So 4's color must be 0. Now, check if there are any edges between nodes of same color. For example, node 2 is color 1, node 4 is color 0. So edges between 2-4 is okay. Between 3-4: 3 is color 1, 4 is 0. Okay. Between 1-2 and 1-3: okay. So the graph is bipartitioned into {1,4} and {2,3}. \n\nSo the sizes of the partitions are 2 and 2. So the number of possible edges within each partition is C(2,2) + C(2,2) = 1 +1 = 2. Which matches the first example's output of 1 2. So that's correct. \n\nAnother example: the second input is 3 nodes connected as a triangle. That's a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So the graph is not bipartite. Hence, the output is 0 1. \n\nThird example: 3 nodes and 0 edges. The graph is bipartite (each component is a single node, which is trivially bipartitioned). So for each component (each node is a component), the partitions are size 1 and 0. So for each component, the number of possible edges is (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. Wait, but there are three components. So the total is 0. But according to the third example, the output is 3 1. Wait, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, the third example input is 3 0. So the graph has three nodes, no edges. So each node is a connected component. For each connected component (single node), the bipartition is (1,0). So the possible edges that can be added within the same partition are (C(1,2) + C(0,2)) = 0. But for each component, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition. However, in this case, the component has only one node. So there are no possible edges to add within the same partition. But the output is 3 1. Wait, that suggests that the minimal t is 3. But according to our earlier reasoning, when the graph is bipartite, the minimal t is 1. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right, because for a connected component that's a single node, the bipartition is (1, 0). So to create an odd-length cycle, you need to add edges. But adding one edge would not form a cycle. So for a component with a single node, you can't form a cycle by adding one edge. Because a cycle requires at least two edges. So, the problem is that the current approach is missing something. \n\nSo the problem is that when the graph is bipartite, but adding one edge may not form a cycle. For example, if the component is a single node, then adding one edge would not form a cycle. Similarly, if a component is a single edge (two nodes connected by one edge), then adding another edge between them would form a cycle of length 2 (but that's even). Wait, but that's not a valid cycle. \n\nSo the key point is that adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a bipartitioned component can create an odd-length cycle, but only if there exists a path between those two nodes. \n\nWait, in a bipartition (A,B), adding an edge between u and v in A. Then, if u and v are in the same partition, then the original path between u and v is of even length. Adding the edge creates a cycle of length (original path length + 1), which is odd. But this is only possible if there is a path between u and v. \n\nSo if u and v are in the same component, then adding the edge between them would create a cycle. But if u and v are in different components, then adding the edge between them would not create a cycle. \n\nSo, for a connected component, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd-length cycle. But for a disconnected component (like a single node), adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (but which are not in the same component) would not form a cycle. \n\nSo, the initial reasoning was incorrect. The number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd-length cycle is not just the sum of (C(a,2) + C(b,2)) for each connected component. Because for a connected component, adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle. However, for a disconnected component (like a single node), adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (but in different components) would not create a cycle. \n\nSo the problem becomes: for the graph to be bipartite, and we need to add edges to create an odd-length cycle. The minimal number of edges required is 1 if there exists at least one connected component with at least two nodes. Otherwise, if all connected components are single nodes (i.e., n nodes and 0 edges), then adding one edge won't create a cycle. So what's the minimal t in that case?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the graph is three isolated nodes. To form an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges. What's the minimal number of edges?\n\nA cycle of length 3 requires three edges. So adding three edges (connecting all three nodes in a triangle) would create a cycle. But what is the minimal number of edges needed? Let's see:\n\nIf the graph has three isolated nodes. To form a cycle, you need at least three edges. Because a cycle of three nodes requires three edges. So adding three edges. So t is 3, and the number of ways is 1 (only one way to connect all three nodes into a triangle). \n\nBut according to the third example in the problem statement, the input is 3 0, and the output is 3 1. Which matches this scenario. \n\nSo, the previous approach is missing this case. So the problem is more complex than initially thought. \n\nSo the overall plan is:\n\nFirst, check if the graph is bipartite. If it is not, then t=0 and w=1. \n\nIf it is bipartite, then:\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle. \n\nThe minimal t can be either 1 or 2 or higher, depending on the structure of the graph. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nCase 1: There exists a connected component with at least two nodes. \n\nIn this case, adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition of that component will create an odd-length cycle. So t=1. \n\nBut if all connected components are single-node (n=number of nodes, m=0), then adding one edge cannot create a cycle. So we need to add enough edges to form a cycle. \n\nSo, for this case, the minimal t is:\n\nIf there is at least one connected component with at least two nodes: t=1. \n\nElse (all components are single nodes): to form a cycle, we need to have a cycle of length k, which requires k edges. The minimal k is 3 (since cycle must have more than one vertex, so at least 3 vertices). So for n >=3, adding 3 edges (forming a triangle) is required. So t=3. \n\nBut how to compute the number of ways in this case?\n\nFor example, if all components are single nodes, then the number of ways is C(n,3) (choosing 3 nodes to form a triangle). But in the third example, n=3, so C(3,3)=1. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo, putting this together, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite. If not, then output t=0, w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if there exists at least one connected component with size ≥2.\n\nIf yes:\n\nThen t=1, and the number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (C(a,2) + C(b,2)), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions in that component. \n\nIf no (i.e., all components are single nodes):\n\nThen t=3, and the number of ways is C(n,3).\n\nBut wait, in the case where all components are single nodes, but n is less than 3? For example, n=2. Then, it's impossible to form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So for n=2, the minimal t would be 1 edge (but adding that edge would form a cycle of length 2, which is even). So that's not acceptable. So in that case, what's the answer?\n\nWait, the problem says that the cycle must be of odd length and consist of more than one vertex. So for n=2, it's impossible to form such a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the input is given as n and m. So for example, if n=2, m=0. Then, the graph is bipartite. We need to add edges to form an odd-length cycle. \n\nBut for n=2, the minimal t is 2 edges. Because adding two edges would form a cycle of length 2 (but even), but that's not allowed. Wait, but adding two edges would create two edges between the two nodes, but the problem says that the graph can't have parallel edges. So that's invalid. \n\nSo, in this case, for n=2, it's impossible to form an odd-length cycle. But according to the problem statement, the input can be such. How to handle this?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the graph is given with no loops or parallel edges. So when n=2 and m=0, the graph is bipartite. Then, the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle is impossible? But the problem says that the answer must exist. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is such that the answer exists. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given, but maybe in some cases it's impossible. However, according to the problem statement, the answer must be computed. So for example, for n=2, m=0, the answer would be t=3? But how can you form a cycle with 3 edges? Because you need three nodes. \n\nSo this case is impossible. But the problem says that the input is such that the answer exists. So perhaps the constraints on the input ensure that n is at least 3 when necessary. But looking back at the problem statement, the input constraints are:\n\nThe first line has n and m. The problem says that the graph can be disconnected, but the input is such that there is at least one way to add edges to form an odd-length cycle. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the graph may not have any edges. For example, in the third sample input, n=3 and m=0. So the answer is possible. \n\nBut for n=2 and m=0, there's no way to form an odd-length cycle. Because any cycle would require at least 3 nodes. So the problem must have constraints that n ≥ 3 in such cases. But the problem says nothing about that. So perhaps the code needs to handle this case. \n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, the third example is n=3 and m=0, which outputs t=3 and w=1. \n\nSo, in general, for the case where the graph is bipartite, and all connected components are single nodes (so n ≥ 1):\n\nIf n < 3, then it's impossible to form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. However, the problem says that the graph can have any n and m. So perhaps the code should assume that the input allows for such a solution. \n\nBut how to handle this? For example, if n=1, then no cycle can be formed. But according to the problem statement, the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So in this case, the answer would be impossible. However, the problem says that the input is given, but perhaps the code can assume that the input is such that the answer exists. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample input includes n=3, m=0. So the code must handle cases where n is 3 or more. \n\nSo, to proceed, the code must:\n\nWhen the graph is bipartite, and all connected components are single nodes (i.e., n is the number of components, each of size 1):\n\nIf n < 3: then no solution. But according to the problem statement, perhaps such cases are not present in the input. \n\nBut for the code, we need to handle it. \n\nBut given that the problem's third sample input has n=3, which is allowed. So, for the code, when the graph is bipartite and all connected components are single nodes, then:\n\nif n < 3: then t is impossible. But according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. \n\nBut perhaps the code can assume that the input is such that there is at least one way to form a cycle. \n\nSo, proceeding under the assumption that when the graph is bipartite and all components are single nodes, then n ≥ 3. \n\nThus, in that case, the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is C(n,3). \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Check if the graph is bipartite. If not, then output t=0 and w=1. \n\n2. Else, check if there is at least one connected component with size ≥2. \n\n   a. If yes, then t=1, and the number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (C(a,2) + C(b,2)), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions in that component. \n\n   b. If no (all components are single nodes), then:\n\n      i. If n < 3: impossible (but according to the problem, this case may not exist)\n\n      ii. Else, t=3, and the number of ways is C(n, 3). \n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Check if the graph is bipartite. \n\n- For each connected component, perform bipartition and track the sizes of the two partitions. \n\nBut how to check if the graph is bipartite? \n\nImplementing a BFS-based bipartition check for each connected component. \n\nOnce we know that the graph is bipartite, we can proceed to calculate the number of possible edges. \n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n and m. \n\nBuild adjacency list. \n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite. \n\nIf not bipartite: output 0 1. \n\nElse:\n\nCheck if there exists at least one connected component with size ≥2. \n\nIf yes:\n\nCompute the sum over all connected components of (a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2). \n\nOutput t=1 and w=sum. \n\nElse:\n\nIf n < 3: ?\n\nElse:\n\nt=3 and w = n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6. \n\nBut how to check if there's a connected component with size ≥2. \n\nSo during the bipartition check, for each connected component, we can record the size of the component. \n\nSo during the bipartition process, for each connected component, we can track the size, and also the two partitions. \n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nImplement BFS/DFS for each connected component, check if bipartition is possible. \n\nFor each component, if during the BFS, we find a conflict (i.e., the graph is not bipartite), then the overall graph is not bipartite. \n\nOnce the graph is confirmed bipartite, collect for each component the sizes of the two partitions. \n\nThen, check if any component has size ≥2. \n\nIf yes, compute the sum. \n\nElse, compute t=3 and w=C(n,3). \n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs. \n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 4\n\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. \n\nThe graph is connected. Bipartition is {1,4}, {2,3}. \n\nComponent size is 4 ≥2. \n\nsum is (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) = 1+1=2. \n\nSo output is 1 2. Which matches the first sample. \n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges form a triangle. \n\nThe graph is not bipartite. Output 0 1. Which matches the second sample. \n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3 0. \n\nThe graph is bipartite (each node is a component). All components have size 1. So, n=3 ≥3. \n\nSo t=3, w=1. Which matches the third sample. \n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=0. \n\nThe graph is bipartite. All components are size 1. \n\nBut n=2 <3. So according to the code, it would output t=3 and w= C(2,3)=0. Which is invalid. But since the problem says that the input is valid, perhaps such cases are not present. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is given. So perhaps the code needs to handle this case. However, the problem statement says that the answer must be computed. So for n=2 and m=0, the answer would be t=3 and w=0? But that's impossible. \n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, when n=3, m=0, the answer is possible. So perhaps the code can proceed under the assumption that when the graph is bipartite and all components are single nodes, then n ≥3. \n\nThus, the code proceeds. \n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement BFS-based bipartition check. \n\nFor each connected component, during BFS, track the color of each node, and the sizes of the two partitions. \n\nOnce the graph is confirmed bipartite, collect for each component the sizes of the two partitions. \n\nThen, check if any component has size ≥2. \n\nSo, the code:\n\nFirst, for each connected component, we can track the size of the component. \n\nBut during the BFS, we can track the color of each node. \n\nSo, code steps:\n\nInitialize a color array. For each node, if not visited, perform BFS. \n\nFor each component:\n\n- Initialize color as 0 for the starting node. \n\n- For each node in the component, track color (0 or 1). \n\n- Count the number of nodes in color 0 (say, a) and color 1 (say, b). \n\n- The component size is a + b. \n\nSo, for each component, store a and b. \n\nOnce all components are processed, check if any component has a + b ≥2. \n\nIf yes, then compute sum for each component of (a choose 2 + b choose 2). \n\nElse, compute t=3 and w= C(n,3). \n\nNow, implement this. \n\nNow, code in Python. \n\nBut how to handle the BFS. \n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and m. \n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)] \n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    u, v = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[u].append(v)\n\n    adj[v].append(u)\n\ncolor array: colors = [-1]*(n+1)\n\nis_bipartite = True \n\ncomponents = [] \n\nfor each node from 1 to n:\n\n    if not visited:\n\n        perform BFS or DFS. \n\n        during this process, check if bipartition is possible. \n\n        if not possible, set is_bipartite = False. \n\n        else, collect the a and b counts for this component. \n\nSo, during the BFS:\n\nfrom collections import deque \n\ncolors = [-1]*(n+1)\n\ncomponents = [] \n\nfor u in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if colors[u] == -1:\n\n        queue = deque()\n\n        queue.append(u)\n\n        colors[u] = 0 \n\n        cnt0 = 1 \n\n        cnt1 = 0 \n\n        is_valid = True \n\n        while queue:\n\n            node = queue.popleft()\n\n            for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n                if colors[neighbor] == -1:\n\n                    colors[neighbor] = colors[node] ^ 1 \n\n                    if colors[neighbor] == 0:\n\n                        cnt0 +=1 \n\n                    else:\n\n                        cnt1 +=1 \n\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n\n                else:\n\n                    if colors[neighbor] == colors[node]:\n\n                        is_valid = False \n\n        if not is_valid:\n\n            is_bipartite = False \n\n        else:\n\n            components.append( (cnt0, cnt1) )\n\nWait, but this code is not correct. Because during BFS, the initial node is colored 0, and then for each neighbor, we check if they are colored. But the code above may not capture all the nodes. Also, the cnt0 and cnt1 counts may not be accurate. \n\nWait, the code starts with u, colors[u] = 0. Then, for each neighbor, if uncolored, assign color opposite to current node. \n\nBut the code above initializes cnt0 as 1, and cnt1 as 0. But during the BFS, for each neighbor that is colored, it checks if they are same as current node's color. \n\nBut the code for counting the number of nodes in each partition is incorrect. Because for the initial node, cnt0 is 1. Then, when processing neighbors, for each new node added, we increment cnt0 or cnt1 based on their color. But for the initial node, the code starts with cnt0=1, and cnt1=0. \n\nBut during the BFS, for each node added to the queue, we need to track their color and increment the counts. \n\nBut the code above is not tracking the counts correctly. For example, the initial node is added to the queue, and when popped, its neighbors are checked. \n\nBut the code as written would miss some nodes. \n\nAlternative approach: during BFS, for each node, track the color, and after BFS, count how many nodes are in color 0 and color 1. \n\nSo, for each component:\n\nstart with node u. \n\ncolors[u] = 0 \n\nqueue = deque([u])\n\nwhile queue not empty:\n\n    node = queue.popleft()\n\n    for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n        if colors[neighbor] == -1:\n\n            colors[neighbor] = colors[node] ^ 1 \n\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n\nOnce BFS is done, for all nodes in the component, count the number of 0s and 1s. \n\nSo, for the component, collect all nodes in the component. \n\nBut how to collect the nodes in the component? \n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for each node processed, we can track the color. \n\nBut perhaps, for each component, after BFS, iterate through all nodes in the component and count the colors. \n\nBut how to track which nodes are in the component? \n\nAlternative approach: during BFS, collect all nodes in the component. \n\nSo, for each component:\n\nnodes_in_component = []\n\nqueue = deque([u])\n\ncolors[u] = 0 \n\nnodes_in_component.append(u)\n\nwhile queue not empty:\n\n    node = queue.popleft()\n\n    for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n        if colors[neighbor] == -1:\n\n            colors[neighbor] = colors[node]^1 \n\n            nodes_in_component.append(neighbor)\n\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n\nOnce this is done, for all nodes in nodes_in_component, count how many are color 0 and color 1. \n\nBut how to track the colors of the nodes? \n\nWell, the colors array is already filled. \n\nSo, for the component, after collecting nodes_in_component, we can compute cnt0 and cnt1 as:\n\ncnt0 = sum(1 for node in nodes_in_component if colors[node] == 0)\n\ncnt1 = len(nodes_in_component) - cnt0 \n\nBut this is O(k) for k being the size of the component. \n\nBut this is manageable. \n\nSo, the code for checking bipartition and collecting component data would be:\n\ncolors = [-1]*(n+1)\n\ncomponents = [] \n\nis_bipartite = True \n\nfor u in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if colors[u] == -1:\n\n        # Start BFS \n\n        queue = deque()\n\n        queue.append(u)\n\n        colors[u] = 0 \n\n        nodes_in_component = [u]\n\n        is_valid = True \n\n        while queue:\n\n            node = queue.popleft()\n\n            for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n                if colors[neighbor] == -1:\n\n                    colors[neighbor] = colors[node] ^ 1 \n\n                    nodes_in_component.append(neighbor)\n\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n\n                else:\n\n                    if colors[neighbor] == colors[node]:\n\n                        is_valid = False \n\n        # After BFS, check if the component is bipartitioned \n\n        if not is_valid:\n\n            is_bipartite = False \n\n        else:\n\n            # count the number of 0 and 1 colors in this component \n\n            cnt0 = 0 \n\n            cnt1 = 0 \n\n            for node in nodes_in_component:\n\n                if colors[node] == 0:\n\n                    cnt0 +=1 \n\n                else:\n\n                    cnt1 +=1 \n\n            components.append( (cnt0, cnt1) )\n\nWait, but this code has a problem. Because during the BFS, when checking for neighbor colors, the code may not detect conflicts. For example, if a neighbor is already colored, but in the same color as the current node, but that neighbor is not part of the current component. \n\nBut no, because during BFS, the nodes are processed only once. \n\nWait, no. Because the colors are initialized to -1, and once a node is colored, it's not processed again. \n\nSo, during BFS, when a neighbor is already colored, it's part of the same component (since the BFS is for the component). \n\nWait, no. Because the BFS is for the component that u is part of. So, when processing a node, the neighbor could be part of the same component (already processed) or not. \n\nNo, because the BFS is for the component that starts with u. So, during BFS, all nodes in the component are processed. \n\nBut when a neighbor is already colored, but not part of the component? \n\nNo. Because the code starts with u, and processes all nodes reachable from u. So, if the neighbor is already colored, it must have been processed in the same BFS. \n\nBut during the BFS, the code checks if colors[neighbor] is -1. If not, then it's already processed. \n\nBut in that case, the code checks if colors[neighbor] is same as current node's color. \n\nBut this is not sufficient. Because the neighbor could have been processed earlier. For example, in a bipartitioned graph, a node and its neighbor have different colors. But if the code checks during BFS, and finds that a neighbor has same color as current node, then it's a conflict. \n\nBut the code above checks for this during BFS. However, the code may not detect all conflicts. For example, consider a graph with a cycle of even length. \n\nBut the BFS-based approach for bipartition checking is standard. \n\nBut in the code above, the 'is_valid' flag is set to False whenever a conflict is found. However, the code may not check all edges. For example, if during BFS, a node is processed, and its neighbor is already colored and in same color. But this may happen multiple times. \n\nBut the code sets is_valid to False once any conflict is found. \n\nBut the code as written may not check all edges. For example, in the code above, during the BFS processing of node, for each neighbor, if the neighbor is already colored, then we check if colors[neighbor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges required to form a simple cycle of odd length in an undirected graph and the number of ways to achieve this. The solution involves checking if the graph is bipartite and then determining the necessary steps based on that.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Bipartiteness**: A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. If the graph is not bipartite, it already contains an odd-length cycle, so the answer is `0 1`.\n2. **Component Analysis**: If the graph is bipartite, analyze each connected component. For each component, determine the sizes of the two partitions (sets of vertices).\n3. **Determine Minimum Edges**:\n   - If there exists a component with at least two vertices, the minimum number of edges needed is `1`, and the number of ways to add such edges is calculated based on the sizes of the partitions.\n   - If all components are single vertices (each vertex is isolated), the minimum number of edges needed is `3` to form a triangle, and the number of ways is the combination of choosing 3 vertices out of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n    \n    colors = [-1] * (n + 1)\n    components = []\n    is_bipartite = True\n    \n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        if colors[u] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(u)\n            colors[u] = 0\n            nodes_in_component = [u]\n            valid = True\n            \n            while queue:\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                for neighbor in adj[node]:\n                    if colors[neighbor] == -1:\n                        colors[neighbor] = colors[node] ^ 1\n                        nodes_in_component.append(neighbor)\n                        queue.append(neighbor)\n                    else:\n                        if colors[neighbor] == colors[node]:\n                            valid = False\n            \n            if not valid:\n                is_bipartite = False\n            \n            else:\n                cnt0 = 0\n                cnt1 = 0\n                for node in nodes_in_component:\n                    if colors[node] == 0:\n                        cnt0 += 1\n                    else:\n                        cnt1 += 1\n                components.append((cnt0, cnt1))\n    \n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n    \n    has_large_component = False\n    for (a, b) in components:\n        if a + b >= 2:\n            has_large_component = True\n            break\n    \n    if has_large_component:\n        total_ways = 0\n        for (a, b) in components:\n            total_ways += (a * (a - 1)) // 2\n            total_ways += (b * (b - 1)) // 2\n        print(f\"1 {total_ways}\")\n    else:\n        if n < 3:\n            print(\"0 0\")\n        else:\n            ways = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6\n            print(f\"3 {ways}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Bipartite Check**: Using BFS, we check if the graph can be colored with two colors without conflicts.
