He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a' here.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. And there's at least one 'b' here too. So the total string after B's step has both 'a's and 'b's.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, it's possible that the number of 'c's equals both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have:\n\n- All 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c* (where * denotes zero or more, but with the constraints that there's at least one a, one b, and some c's).\n\nWait, but the problem says that when C adds the c's, the count of c's is equal to the count of a's OR the count of b's in the string before adding the c's. Wait, no: the problem says that the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string (before adding the c's?), right?\n\nYes. Because when C appends the c's, the existing string is the a's and b's. Then he appends some number of c's. The number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string (before adding the c's). So for example, if the original a's are 3, and b's are 2, then the c's can be 3 or 2. Then the total string would be a's (3), b's (2), c's (3) or (2).\n\nBut the problem says that the final string is given, and we have to check if it could have been formed in this way.\n\nSo the steps for checking are:\n\nFirst, the string must consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order must be correct. For example, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's invalid. Similarly, any 'b' after a 'c' is invalid. So the string must be in the form of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So the first part is checking that the string is in this order.\n\nSecond, after ensuring that, we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's.\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nNow, according to the process:\n\n- The original string before adding c's was (count_a a's and count_b b's). Then C added count_c c's. And count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the original string before adding the c's had at least one a and one b. Because when B added the b's, he made sure that there was at least one a and one b. So in the original string (before adding c's), count_a >= 1 and count_b >=1.\n\nBut when C adds the c's, the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a_original (which is count_a in the final string) or count_b_original (which is count_b in the final string). Because adding c's doesn't change the count of a's or b's.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order is correct.\n\n2. count_c is equal to count_a or count_b (the original counts before adding the c's, which are the same as the counts in the final string, since adding c's doesn't affect a or b counts).\n\nAdditionally, the original string (before adding c's) must have at least one a and one b. Which is equivalent to count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. But since the original string before adding c's is the a's and b's, which was created by A and B. So in the final string, the count_a and count_b must be >=1. Because the original string (before adding c's) must have at least one a and one b. So the final string's count_a and count_b must be >=1.\n\nBut in the final string, the count_a and count_b are same as before adding the c's, since adding c's doesn't change them. So the count_a and count_b in the final string must be >=1.\n\nSo the steps for checking:\n\nCheck the order of characters. For example, the string must not have any 'b's before 'a's, or 'c's before 'b's, etc.\n\nThen, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, and count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the original string (before adding c's) had count_a = 0? No, because A starts with some number of a's (so count_a >=1) and B appends some number of b's (count_b >=1). So in the original string before adding c's, count_a and count_b are >=1. Therefore, in the final string, count_a and count_b must be >=1.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. How to check this?\n\nWe can check that the string is composed of a's, then b's, then c's. So the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.\n\nSo how to check that?\n\nWe can split the string into three parts. For example, the first part is all a's, then the next part is all b's, then the next part is all c's.\n\nSo the code can check that:\n\n- All characters before the first 'b' are 'a's. Then all characters between the first 'b' and first 'c' are 'b's. Then all characters after the first 'c' are 'c's.\n\nBut perhaps there are no 'b's. Wait, but according to the problem, the original string before adding c's must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So in the final string, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since adding c's doesn't affect them). So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and possibly some 'c's.\n\nSo in the final string, the count of a's and b's must be at least 1. So for example, if the string is 'aabbc', then it's valid. But if the string is 'aacc', then the count of b's is zero, which is invalid. So in that case, the answer is 'NO'.\n\nSo the first step is to check that the string is in the order of a's, then b's, then c's. How to do that?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check that the characters are in non-decreasing order according to their letters. Because 'a' comes before 'b' which comes before 'c'. So the string must be such that each character is not less than the previous one. For example, 'aaabbbcc' is okay. But 'abba' is not, because after the 'b's, there is an 'a'.\n\nWait, but the string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the entire string must be in the order of a's, then b's, then c's. So any occurrence of a 'b' must come after all the a's, and any occurrence of a 'c' must come after all the b's. So the string must be in non-decreasing order of characters. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'.\n\nSo for example, the string 'aabbc' is okay. The string 'abac' is not, because after the first 'a', there's a 'b', then an 'a' again. So the code can check that the string is sorted in non-decreasing order. Because the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the entire string must be in order.\n\nSo checking that the string is non-decreasing is sufficient for the order part.\n\nWait, but for example, the string 'aabbaacc' would have the order a's, then b's, then a's again. Which is invalid. So the code would check that the string is non-decreasing. So in this case, the string is not non-decreasing. So the code would correctly reject it.\n\nYes. So the first check is that the string is in non-decreasing order. Because the only allowed transitions are a to a, a to b, b to b, b to c, c to c. So the entire string must be non-decreasing.\n\nSo the first condition is that the string is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nOnce that is checked, then check that the counts of a, b, c meet the following:\n\ncount_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count_c is the number of c's added by C. Which is equal to the count of a's or count of b's in the original string (before adding the c's). But the original string (before adding the c's) is the a's and b's. So the count of a's in the original string is count_a (same as in the final string) and count of b's is count_b (same as in the final string). So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the code needs to check:\n\ncount_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut also, the count_a and count_b must be at least 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe algorithm steps are:\n\n1. Check that the string is non-decreasing. If not, return 'NO'.\n\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\n3. Check that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\n4. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string has no c's?\n\nBecause according to the problem statement, C appends some number of c's. So the original string (before adding c's) is the a's and b's. Then C appends some number of c's. So the final string must have at least one c. Because C appends some number of c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of c's, which could be zero? Wait no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend... the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\n\nWait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c'. So the number of c's added is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's. So the number of c's added must be equal to count_a or count_b. So the count_c in the final string is equal to count_a or count_b. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But in the case where count_c is zero, that would imply that the original count_a or count_b is zero, but that's impossible because count_a and count_b are at least 1. So the final count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b, which is at least 1. So the count_c must be at least 1. So the final string must have at least one c.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c'. So the number of c's added can be zero? No. Because the problem says \"some number\" which implies that it's a non-negative integer. But the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, the problem says that the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. So the number of c's added is either count_a or count_b. Since count_a and count_b are at least 1, the number of c's added is at least 1. So the final count_c is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, in the final string, count_c must be at least 1. So the code must also check that count_c is at least 1. Because if the string has no c's, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the original string (before adding c's) has at least one a and one b. So the count_a and count_b are at least 1. Then, when C appends c's, he adds count_c which is equal to count_a or count_b, which is at least 1. Therefore, the final string must have count_c >= 1. So in our code, the count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo that's another condition. So in addition to the previous steps, we have to check that count_c >= 1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck:\n\n- The string is non-decreasing.\n\n- count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the original string (before adding c's) has at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a and count_b are same as before adding c's. So they must be >=1. And count_c is added as per the rules, which is at least 1.\n\nSo in the code, the steps are:\n\nCheck that the string is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, count the a, b, c.\n\nCheck:\n\nif count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nand (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b).\n\nIf all these are true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3.\n\nCheck the string is sorted: yes. Then count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. count_c equals count_a. Also count_a and count_b are >=1. count_c is 3 >=1. So YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b','b','a','c','c'? Wait, the input is 'bbacc', which is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. This is not non-decreasing. Because after the two b's, there's an a. So the string is not sorted. So the first check fails. So output is NO. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts a:2, b:1, c:1. The string is a, a, b, c → sorted. count_c is 1. Which equals count_b (1). So yes.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → counts a:2, b:2, c:1. Then count_c is 1. Which is not equal to a (2) or b (2). So answer is NO. But if the string is 'aabbc' → the code would check that the string is sorted. Then check counts. So the code would return NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → the string is sorted. count_c is zero. So the code checks count_c >=1? No. So returns NO. Which is correct, because C added some c's. So the original string (after B) is 'ab', then C added c's. But in this case, the final string would be 'ab' plus some c's. So the input string 'ab' would not be valid, because it's missing the c's. So the code would return NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. The string is sorted. count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → counts a=1, b=2, c=2. So count_c equals count_b (2). So returns YES.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where the string is 'abc' → YES.\n\nCase where the string is 'ac' → not sorted (since a comes before c, but there's no b. So the string is sorted, but count_b is zero. So step 3 would check count_b >=1? No. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2. So count_c equals a (2). So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. Then count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2, which equals a (2) and b (2). So returns YES.\n\nNow, what about the string 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So count_c equals a and b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case where the string is 'aaaabbbbc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=1. So count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nNow, what about the string 'aaaabbbcc' → a=4, b=3, c=2. Then count_c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nSo the plan for the code is:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck if the string is sorted in non-decreasing order. How to do that? For example, for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any of them is not, return NO.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nCheck that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nLet's code this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is a string. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but in the actual problem, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input says: The first and only line consists of a string S. So the input is a single string. But in the example, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably for the sample input. For example, the sample input shows that for the three test cases, the outputs are as given. But in practice, the code will read a single string per test case. But the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So for example, the code should read the input line, process it, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo the code is for a single test case.\n\nSo the code will read S = input().strip()\n\nThen:\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. For example:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef is_sorted(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nThen, count the a, b, c.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nThen check:\n\nif count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1 and (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut also, the string must be sorted.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif not is_sorted(s):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1 and (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is sorted, but the counts are not meeting the conditions?\n\nLike 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2 → count_c equals a and b → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → a=2, b=1, c=2 → count_c equals a → YES.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → sorted? Yes. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So count_c equals count_a → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → check sorted? The string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b' → not sorted → returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → sorted. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1) → YES.\n\nSo the sample outputs are correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → sorted. count_c is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → sorted. count_c is 1. count_a=1, count_b=1. So count_c equals count_a and count_b → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → sorted. count_b is 0 → no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaacc' → not sorted, because after the 'bb' comes 'a's. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → sorted. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2 → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → sorted. count_c=1. count_a=2, count_b=2. 1 is not equal to 2 or 2 → no.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2. Which is equal to count_a (2) and count_b (2). So it's valid. So code returns yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. count_c equals count_a (1). So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaaa' → sorted. count_b is 0 → no.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbb' → sorted. count_c is 0 → no.\n\nSo code returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbc' → sorted. count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which is not equal to 4 or 4 → no.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck if it's sorted.\n\nThen check the counts.\n\nSo the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_sorted(s):\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nif not is_sorted(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1 and (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut let's test for the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2,2,2 → yes.\n\nAnother case where the string is 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So 1 is not equal to 2 or 2 → no.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc' → the code returns no.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc' → the code checks that the string is sorted (yes). Then count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b → returns no.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nWhat about 'abcc'? count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So returns no. But the string is sorted. So code returns no.\n\nBut according to the problem, the C appends some number of c's. So in this case, the original string (before adding c's) was 'ab' (count_a=1, count_b=1). Then C added 2 c's. Which must be equal to count_a or count_b. But count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to 1. So code returns no. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which equals count_a. So returns yes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → sorted. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → not sorted. So no.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → sorted. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b → yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabc' → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabb' → sorted. count_c is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → sorted. count_c is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ac' → sorted. count_b is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'bccc' → sorted. count_a is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → sorted. count_b is 0, count_c is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by following specific rules involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular sequence. The string must be formed by starting with some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and finally some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's appended must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's present before appending the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, meaning all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validation**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, the count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_sorted(s):\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nif not is_sorted(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1 and count_c >= 1 and (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_sorted` checks if the string is in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the string follows the required sequence of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n2. **Character Counting**: Using `count` method, we determine the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validation Checks**: We ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, the count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's to satisfy the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string can be formed according to the specified rules, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
