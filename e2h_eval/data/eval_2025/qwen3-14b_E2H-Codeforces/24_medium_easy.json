She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem gives me n, pos, l, r. Let me think about the steps required here.\n\nFirst, the initial state is that all tabs are open. The cursor is at pos. The goal is to have only tabs from l to r open. So, any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nThe operations allowed are moving left or right (each takes 1 second), or closing all tabs to the left or right of the current position (each takes 1 second). So, closing is an operation that can be done once per second, but you can't close multiple times in a second.\n\nSo, the key is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], and all tabs outside are already closed, then no steps are needed. Like the third example where l=1, r=5, and pos is 2. Since all tabs are already in the desired range, output is 0.\n\nBut when there are tabs to close on both sides, or one side, how to handle?\n\nLet me consider the case where the desired segment is [l, r]. So, the tabs to close are those less than l and those greater than r.\n\nSo, Luba needs to close all tabs to the left of l and all to the right of r. But how to do that efficiently.\n\nBut the closing operations can only be done when the cursor is at a certain position. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the current position. So, if she wants to close all tabs to the left of l, she must be at position l, and then close all to the left. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, she must be at position r, and close all to the right.\n\nWait, but the closing operations are: when you are at position i, you can close all tabs to the left (so [a, i-1]) or to the right (i+1, b). So, for example, if she is at position l, then closing all tabs to the left would close everything up to l-1. Similarly, if she is at position r, closing to the right would close everything from r+1 onwards.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- First, she needs to close all tabs to the left of l. To do that, she must be at position l, then perform a close-left operation. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, she must be at position r, then perform a close-right operation.\n\nBut what if l is already the leftmost tab? Then there's nothing to close on the left. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n1. Determine whether there are tabs to close on the left (i.e., l > 1) and on the right (r < n).\n\nFor each of these, we need to move the cursor to the appropriate position (l or r) and perform the close operation.\n\nBut also, the order in which these operations are done may affect the total time. For example, if she needs to close both left and right, she might have to move from the initial position to l, then to r, or vice versa. Or maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated by considering the positions required for each close operation and the movement between them.\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close on either side. So, output is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs to close. So, she needs to move to l, then close left. How much time does that take?\n\nThe movement from pos to l: the number of steps is |pos - l|. Then, one second to close. So total |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe she can close left from a different position? No, because if she is at position l, then closing left would close everything to the left of l. But if she is at a position to the right of l, say l+1, then closing left would close up to l, but that's not correct. Because the tabs to the left of l are not part of the desired segment. So, she must be at position l to close all tabs to the left. Because, suppose l is 2, and the current position is 3. If she closes left, that would close tabs from a (which is 1) to 2 (i-1 = 2). Which is exactly the tabs to the left of l. So, in that case, maybe she can be at position l+1 and close left. Wait, but that would close all tabs up to l. So, maybe she can be anywhere to the right of l, and close left. But then, that would close all tabs to the left of her current position. So, if she is at l, then closing left would close tabs up to l-1. If she is at l+1, closing left would close up to l. Which is exactly what we need. So, in that case, she can be at l+1, and close left, which would remove all tabs to the left of l+1, which includes all tabs up to l. But that's not correct. Because the desired segment is [l, r]. So, if she closes all tabs to the left of l+1, that would include l. Which is not allowed. Oh no, that's a problem. So, the close operation closes all tabs to the left of the current position. So, if she is at position x, closing left would close all tabs from a to x-1. So, to close all tabs to the left of l (i.e., tabs 1 to l-1), she must be at position l, and then close left. Because that would close tabs from a (which is 1) to l-1. Alternatively, if she is at position l, then closing left would do that. If she is at position l+1, then closing left would close tabs up to l. Which is the same as closing all tabs up to l. But that would include l, which is part of the desired segment. So that's not allowed. Therefore, she must be at position l to close all tabs to the left of l. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, she must be at position r, then close right. Because closing right from r would close all tabs from r+1 to b (which is n). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the steps required for closing the left side is:\n\nIf l > 1, then she must move to l, then close left. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the movement steps for left is |pos - l| steps, then 1 second to close. Same for right.\n\nBut what if she needs to do both left and right? Then, after closing left, she has to move to r. Or, after closing right, she has to move to l. But which order is better?\n\nFor example, suppose she needs to close left and right. Let's say the initial position is pos. She can choose to first go to l, close left, then move to r, close right. Or first go to r, close right, then move to l, close left. Which is faster?\n\nThe total steps would be:\n\nOption 1: (steps from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps from l to r) + 1 (close right) \n\nOption 2: (steps from pos to r) + 1 (close right) + (steps from r to l) + 1 (close left)\n\nWhich option is better depends on the positions. But since l <= r, the distance from l to r is r - l. The distance from r to l is the same. So, the sum of steps would be:\n\nOption 1: (|pos - l| + 1) + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + r - l + 2\n\nOption 2: (|pos - r| + 1) + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + r - l + 2\n\nSo which is better depends on whether |pos - l| is less than |pos - r|. But since l <= r, if pos is to the left of l, then |pos - l| is (l - pos), and |pos - r| is (r - pos). Which is bigger. So, in that case, going to l first would be better.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. Maybe she can move directly to l, then to r, or move to r, then to l. But regardless, the movement between l and r is (r - l) steps. So, the total steps for both left and right is:\n\nTime for moving to l or r (depending on which is closer) plus 2 (for the two closes) plus the movement between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize further. For example, if the initial position is already at l, then moving to l is zero steps, then close left. Then move to r (r - l steps), then close right. Total steps is (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a scenario where she can do something else. But I think the minimal steps would be:\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed, then the minimal steps would be:\n\nTime to move to l (if needed) + 1 (close left) + time to move from l to r (r - l steps) + 1 (close right) \n\nOR \n\nTime to move to r (if needed) + 1 (close right) + time to move from r to l (r - l steps) + 1 (close left) \n\nWhich is better? Well, it depends on which of the two options (moving to l first or moving to r first) requires less steps.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal is to choose the direction that requires the least movement. For example, if pos is closer to l, then go to l first, then to r. If pos is closer to r, then go to r first, then to l.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps for moving to l and then to r is (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2. Similarly, moving to r first is (distance from pos to r) + (r - l) + 2. So the minimal between the two is min( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 ). But since (r - l) + 2 is common, it's equivalent to min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck. For example, moving to l first: steps is (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) steps to get from l to r. Then 2 closes. So total is (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2. Similarly for moving to r first: (distance from pos to r) + (r - l) + 2. So the difference between the two options is the distance from pos to l vs pos to r. So the minimal is the minimal of the two.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Suppose she can move directly from pos to r, then close right, then move to l, then close left. But that's the same as moving to r first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to do both closes with fewer steps. For example, if she can reach a position where she can close both in one move. But that's impossible. Because closing left or right is only possible once per operation.\n\nSo, for example, if she is at l, then she can close left. Then, she can move to r, and close right. So that's two closes, and movement steps between l and r.\n\nSo, the total steps for both left and right is:\n\nIf l > 1 and r < n:\n\ntime = (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps from l to r) + 1 (close right)\n\nOR \n\ntime = (steps to move to r) + 1 (close right) + (steps from r to l) + 1 (close left)\n\nWhich is better depends on which is shorter.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if the initial position is already in between l and r, then moving to l or r could be optimized.\n\nBut regardless, the minimal steps would be the minimal of the two options.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. Let's think of the steps required as follows:\n\n- The steps required to reach the position where you can close left (l) and the steps to reach the position where you can close right (r). And then, after closing left, you need to move to r, and vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute the minimal steps as follows:\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed, then the total steps is:\n\nmin_steps = (steps to reach l or r) + 1 (for close) + steps between l and r + 1 (for the other close).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the steps as:\n\nThe minimal steps is the time to move to l (if needed) plus the time to move to r (from l) plus 2 (for the two closes). But that's the same as the above.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps is:\n\ndistance from pos to l + (r - l) + 2, or distance from pos to r + (r - l) + 2. Take the minimum of the two.\n\nBut wait, what if pos is already in between l and r? For example, pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. Then, moving to l is 1 step, then moving to r is 2 steps (from 2 to 4). So total steps is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can move to r first. The distance from pos (3) to r (4) is 1 step. Then, move to l (2) from r (4) is 2 steps. Then, total steps is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Same as before.\n\nBut what if she can do something else. For example, move to l, close left (1 step + 1 sec), then move to r (2 steps), close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo, in this case, the total steps are 5.\n\nBut what if she can close both in some other way? For example, if she is at l, she can close left, and then move to r and close right. So that's the same as before.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, considering all possibilities:\n\nWe need to check whether the left side needs closing (l > 1) and the right side needs closing (r < n).\n\nSo, let's break down the cases:\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. Then, no need to close anything. Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: l == 1, but r < n. So, need to close right. So steps: move to r, then close right. Time is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: r == n, but l > 1. Need to close left. Steps: move to l, then close left. Time is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 4: Both l > 1 and r < n. Need to close left and right. So steps: min( (|pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 ), (|pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 )) )\n\nWait, why (r - l) + ... ?\n\nBecause, after moving to l, you need to move from l to r, which is (r - l) steps. Then, you close right. So, the total steps is |pos - l| (to get to l) + (r - l) (to get from l to r) + 2 (the two closes). Similarly for moving to r first.\n\nBut is there another scenario where you can do it in less steps?\n\nFor example, suppose pos is somewhere between l and r. Let's say l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, moving to l (2 steps?), no. Wait, pos is 3, l is 2. So |pos - l| is 1. Then, moving from l to r is 2 steps (from 2 to 4). So total steps is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But what if she moves to r first (distance is 1), then moves to l (distance 2 steps), and then closes. That's also 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So same result.\n\nBut what if she can close both in some other way? For example, if she is at l, then closes left (which is done), then closes right. But to close right, she has to be at r. So she must move from l to r. So the movement is necessary.\n\nAnother example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 (as in the first sample input). The answer is 5. Let's see according to the formula.\n\nIn this case, l=2>1, r=4<6. So need to close left and right.\n\nCompute |pos - l| = |3-2|=1. |pos - r| = |3-4|=1. So min(1 + (4-2) + 2, 1 + (4-2) + 2) = 1+2+2=5. Which matches the sample. So that works.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is '6 3 1 3'. So l=1, r=3. So, need to close right (since r=3 < 6). So steps: move to r (3) and close right. But pos is already 3. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: '5 2 1 5' → l=1, r=5. So no closing needed. Output is 0.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n → both need to be closed. So compute the min between moving to l first or moving to r first.\n\nElse, if only left needs to be closed (r ==n), then steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse, if only right needs to be closed (l ==1), steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nWait, but what about when l is 1, but r is less than n. Then, need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if r is n, but l>1, steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCalculate the steps based on the four cases.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\n    right_close_needed = (r < n)\n\n    if left_close_needed and right_close_needed:\n\n        # need to close both left and right\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        total = min(option1, option2)\n\n    elif left_close_needed:\n\n        # only close left\n\n        total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close_needed:\n\n        # only close right\n\n        total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # this is impossible, because if l==1 and r ==n, then handled earlier\n\n        # but for example, if l=1 and r <n, but that is covered in the elif above.\n\n        # but perhaps code can have a default?\n\n    print(total)\n\nWait, but what about when l=1 and r <n. So, left is not needed to be closed (since l=1), but right is needed. So, code would go into the elif right_close_needed. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So l=2>1, r=4<6. So both needed. option1 is |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 =5. option2 is |3-4| + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 +2=5. So min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3 <6. So right_close_needed. steps is |3 -3| +1= 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: input 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case: when l=1, r= n. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So left_close_needed (l=2>1), right_close_needed (r=4 <5). So option1 is |1-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 +2 =5. option2: |1-4| + 2 +2 → 3 + 2 +2=7. So min is 5. So steps is 5.\n\nWhat's the actual steps? She needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5). So:\n\nShe's at pos 1. She needs to move to l=2 (1 step). Close left (tabs 1). Then move to r=4 (2 steps). Close right (tabs 5). Total steps: 1 + 1 (close) + 2 steps + 1 (close) = 1+2+2=5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: pos is already at l. For example, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (no, since l=2. So left is 2. So left_close_needed is (l>1) → yes. So need to close left (tabs 1). So steps is |2-2| +1 = 0 +1=1. Then, close right (r=4 <5). So need to move to r=4 (steps 2 steps from 2 to 4). Then close. So total steps is 1 (close left) + 2 steps +1 (close right) → total 4 steps. Wait, but according to our code, in this case, since both left and right are needed, the code would compute:\n\noption1 is |pos - l| + (r-l) +2 → 0 + 2 +2 =4. option2 is |pos - r| + (r-l) + 2 → |2-4|=2 + 2 +2 =6. So min is 4. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when l is 1 and r is n-1. So, need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nAnother case: when l=3, r=3. So the desired segment is just tab 3. So, need to close left (tabs 1-2) and right (tabs 4-n). So code will process both needed. So steps would be min( |pos -3| + (3-3) +2, |pos -3| + (3-3) +2) → |pos -3| + 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, if pos is 3, then steps is 0 + 2 = 2. Which would be: close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). So total 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. Then l and r must be 1. So output 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1, r=1, pos is 1. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. So need to close tab 2. So steps: move to r=1 (already there) and close right. Which would take 1 sec. So code: since r=1 <n=2. So right_close_needed. steps is |pos -r| +1 → 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input. Wait, the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers n, pos, l, r. But the sample input shows three lines. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nAh, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows three lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is a single line. But the sample input shows three lines. Probably, that's a mistake in the problem statement. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each on their own line. But according to the problem statement, the code should read a single line of input.\n\nBut the user instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and print the output. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement says \"the only line of input\".\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut this seems to indicate that the input is multiple lines, each being a test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not matching. For example, perhaps the sample input is for three test cases, but the code is supposed to read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first input line is '6 3 2 4', which outputs 5. So perhaps the code should read one line, split into four integers, and process that. But the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. But the code should process a single line of input.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from standard input and print the desired outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each on a separate line. But the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So this is confusing.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers, so the code should read one line, split into four integers, and output one integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines, but the sample output shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user intended to present multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects one test case per input line.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should process one line of input. So perhaps the code should process one line, and output one line.\n\nBut the sample input and output shows multiple lines. But perhaps that's a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers. So the code should read one line of input.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is four integers, I think the code is supposed to read one line, split into four integers, and output one integer.\n\nBut the sample input seems to have three lines, but the sample output has three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the original problem has multiple test cases, but the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as a single line. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect. But given that the user provided the sample input as a list of strings, perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the problem statement again, the input is given as four integers. So the code should read one line, split into four integers. So the sample input is probably a mistake. For example, the first sample input line is '6 3 2 4' which outputs 5.\n\nThus, the code should process a single line of input. So the code should read a line from stdin, split into four integers, process them, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into four integers.\n\nThen compute as per the logic above.\n\nNow, coding that.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_close_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_close_needed and right_close_needed:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        total = min(option1, option2)\n\n    elif left_close_needed:\n\n        total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close_needed:\n\n        total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # this case can't happen because if not left and not right, then l=1 and r=n, which is handled earlier.\n\n        total = 0\n\n    print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_close_needed is false (because l=1), and right_close_needed is true. So code would go to elif right_close_needed, and compute steps as |pos - r| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=3, n=5. So, need to close left and right. So, code computes option1 and option2.\n\nBut what if pos is 5, l=2, r=3. Then, option1 is |5-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 3 +1 +2 =6. option2 is |5-3| + 1 + 2 → 2 +1 +2=5. So min is 5.\n\nWhich would be: move to r=3 (steps 2), close right (tabs 4-5). Then move to l=2 (steps 1), close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when l=1 and r= n. So output 0.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r=n, but pos is somewhere else. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=5. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input is 6 3 2 4. So l=2>1, r=4<6. Both needed. option1 is |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2=5. option2 is |3-4| + 2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2=5. min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input is 6 3 1 3. l=1, r=3 <6. So right_close_needed. steps is |3-3| +1=0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: input 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=1, r=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (l=2>1) and right (r=4 <5). option1: |1-2| + (4-2) +2 = 1 + 2 +2=5. option2: |1-4| + (4-2) +2 = 3 + 2 +2=7. min is 5. So steps is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line as four integers.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen proceed with the logic.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif left_close:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    elif right_close:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n\nWait, but what about when l=1 and r <n? Then, left_close is False, right_close is True. So code goes to elif right_close, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r=n? Then the first condition is true, so 0 is printed.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r=n, but the code is in the else block? No, because the first condition is checked.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, r=1. So the first condition is true, print 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Then, print 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. So r <n. So right_close is True. So steps is |1 -1| +1 = 0 +1=1. Which is correct: need to close tab 2. Move to r=1 (already there), close right (takes 1 sec).\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, check the sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3 → output 1. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 5 2 1 5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no operations are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Closures Needed**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left (l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Minimum Steps**:\n   - If both left and right closures are needed, compute the minimum steps required by considering two scenarios: moving to the left segment first or moving to the right segment first.\n   - If only the left closure is needed, calculate the steps to move to the left segment and close it.\n   - If only the right closure is needed, calculate the steps to move to the right segment and close it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif left_close:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    elif right_close:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs, no action is needed.\n- **Left and Right Closures**: When both closures are required, we evaluate the minimum steps by considering moving to either end of the segment first and then proceeding to the other end.\n- **Single Closure**: If only one side requires closure, the steps are calculated based on the distance from the current position to the respective segment end plus one second for the closure operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps by leveraging direct movement and closure operations, considering all possible optimal paths.",
