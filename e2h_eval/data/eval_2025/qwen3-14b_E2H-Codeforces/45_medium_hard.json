There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the question isn't about the total games, but the maximum number of games that the winner can have.\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nFor n=2, there's one game. The winner plays once. Output is 1.\n\nFor n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like first beat player 2, then beat player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) hasn't played any games yet. But according to the rule, the difference in the number of games played must be no more than one. The winner has already played 1 game, and the other has 0. Difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So output is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. The example says that the winner can't play three games. Let's see why. Suppose the winner plays three games. That would require that each time, the opponents meet the condition. Let's think: To play three games, the winner must have three matches. Each time, the opponent must have a number of games played that's within one of the winner's current count. \n\nBut for the first game, the winner has 0 games, opponent also 0. Then after winning, the winner has 1. Next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1. Let's say the winner plays someone who has 0. Then after that, the winner has 2 games. Now, the next opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how can there be someone with 1 game? Well, maybe the winner's previous opponents were in a different part of the bracket. Wait, but maybe the structure requires that the winner can only face players who have a certain number of games. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think recursively. Let's suppose that the maximum number of games the winner can play is k. Then, for that to happen, the winner must have played k games. Each time, the opponent must have a number of games that's either equal to the current number of games of the winner minus one, or same, or plus one. Wait, but the winner's number of games increases by one each time they play. \n\nWait, the winner starts with zero games. Each game they play adds one. So for the first game, they have 0 games, the opponent must have 0. Then after the first game, the winner has 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1. Let's say the opponent has 0. Then after the second game, the winner has 2. The next opponent must have 1 or 2. But how can there be an opponent with 1? Well, maybe that opponent had to win one game before facing the winner. \n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, there must be a way to arrange the tournament so that each time the winner plays, their opponent has either (current games -1), current games, or current games +1. But since the winner is progressing through the tournament, perhaps each of their matches requires that the opponent has a certain number of games. \n\nThis seems similar to building a binary tree. For example, in a standard knockout tournament, the winner plays log2(n) games. But here, the structure is different. The problem allows for a more optimal arrangement. \n\nWait, the sample input for n=3 gives 2 games. Which is more than log2(3) which is about 1.58. So the maximum is higher than the standard binary tournament. So the problem is about arranging the matches in a way that allows the winner to have as many games as possible. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Because, for the winner to play k games, each time they need to have opponents that have a certain number of games. Let's think recursively. Suppose that the maximum number of games is f(n). How can we find f(n)?\n\nFor the winner to play k games, they must have played against k opponents. Each of those opponents must have been in a situation where they had a certain number of games. Let's think about the first match: the winner has 0 games. The opponent must have 0 games. So, that's one game. Then, for the next game, the winner has 1 game. The opponent can have 0 or 1. If the opponent has 0, then the winner can play again. But for that opponent to be in the tournament, they must have not lost yet. So, perhaps the winner's path requires that for each step, there's enough players that can be arranged in such a way. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where each node represents the number of games the winner has played. For example, to reach k games, the winner must have played k matches. For each match, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's model the minimal number of players required to allow the winner to have k games. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that to have a winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is m(k). Then, for the first game, the winner plays against one player. Then, for the second game, the winner must have an opponent who has either 0 or 1 games. But if the opponent has 0 games, then that player must have not played any games before. But that would require that there's another player who hasn't been eliminated yet. However, for the winner to have a second game, the opponent must have a certain number of games. \n\nAlternatively, for the winner to play k games, they must have a sequence of opponents. Let's think about the structure of the tournament. For the winner to play k games, each of their matches must be against players that have a certain number of games. Let's consider that in order to get to the k-th game, the winner must have had opponents in their previous matches that allowed for that. \n\nFor example, to have the winner play 1 game, you need 2 players. \n\nTo have the winner play 2 games, you need 3 players. Because the first game is between the winner and another player. Then, the winner plays against a third player. But in that case, the third player has 0 games. The winner has 1 game, so difference is 1. That's allowed. \n\nBut for the winner to play 3 games, what's the minimal number of players? Let's think. \n\nThe first game: 1 game, 2 players. Then, the second game: the winner has 1 game, opponent has 0. After that, the winner has 2 games. For the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. How can there be an opponent with 1 game? That opponent must have played once before. So, perhaps the tournament structure is such that the winner's path requires that there's a player who has played once. \n\nSo, to get to the third game, the winner must have had an opponent who has 1 game. How many players are needed for that? Let's think. \n\nLet me model this recursively. Let's say that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is f(k). \n\nFor k=1, f(1)=2. \n\nFor k=2, f(2)=3. \n\nFor k=3, the winner needs to play three games. Let's think: the third game requires that the opponent has 1 or 2 games. \n\nSuppose the opponent has 1 game. Then, that opponent must have played once. So, how do we get that? Let's imagine that the winner's path is as follows:\n\nFirst game: winner plays against A (0 games). Winner wins. Now, the winner has 1 game.\n\nSecond game: winner plays against B (0 games). Winner wins. Now, winner has 2 games. But then, for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. However, all other players except the winner have been eliminated. Wait, but there's only 3 players. So for n=3, the winner can't play a third game. So how can we get to k=3?\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the winner to play their k-th game, they need to have an opponent who has played (k-1) games. Because the winner has played (k-1) games before this match. Wait, no. Wait, when the winner plays their k-th game, they have already played (k-1) games. So the opponent must have played (k-1 -1) = k-2 games, or (k-1) games. \n\nAlternatively, think of the winner's k-th game. To get to this game, the winner has already played k-1 games. The opponent must have played either k-1, k-2, or k games? No, because the rule says that the difference between the two players' number of games is at most one. So, the opponent must have played (k-1 - 1) = k-2, (k-1), or (k-1 + 1) = k games. But since the opponent hasn't played the k-th game yet, they can't have played k games. So the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1 games. \n\nBut how can the opponent have k-1 games? That would mean that the opponent has already played k-1 games. Which would require that they have a path of k-1 games. \n\nSo, for the winner to play their k-th game, they need to have an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nSo, to arrange that, the minimal number of players would be the sum of the minimal players required for the winner to have k-1 games (so that the opponent can have k-1 games) and the minimal players required for the opponent to have k-2 games. \n\nWait, maybe this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think again. \n\nLet me define f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. \n\nFor the winner to play k games, the last game requires that the opponent has played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nIf the opponent has played k-1 games, then the opponent must have been in a sub-tournament where they played k-1 games. But since the opponent is now playing against the winner, they must have won all their previous games. So, the number of players required for that is f(k-1). \n\nBut the winner has already played k-1 games. So, the winner's path is such that they had to have a sub-tournament that allowed them to reach k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players. But then, the opponent's sub-tournament requires f(k-1) players. But that would be adding up to f(k-1) + f(k-1) players? But that's not considering that the winner is part of both. \n\nAlternatively, think of the scenario where the winner's k-th game is against an opponent who has played k-1 games. To get that, the winner must have a path that allows them to reach k-1 games, and the opponent must have a path that allows them to reach k-1 games. But then, the total players needed would be f(k-1) + f(k-1) - 1 (since the winner is part of both?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n\nBecause, for the winner to play the k-th game, they need to have an opponent that has played k-1 games (which requires f(k-1) players) or k-2 games (which requires f(k-2) players). But perhaps the minimal is when you combine these two. \n\nLet me check with known values. \n\nFor k=1: f(1)=2. \n\nk=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0). Wait, what is f(0)? Maybe f(0) is 1 (the winner hasn't played any games, but there's only one player? But that's not possible. Maybe the base cases are f(0)=1, f(1)=2. Then for k=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2+1=3. Which matches the example where n=3 gives output 2. \n\nFor k=3, f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=3+2=5. So, if there are 5 players, the winner can play 3 games. \n\nLet me think if that's possible. For example, with n=5 players. Let's imagine the winner plays 3 games. How?\n\nFirst game: winner plays against player 2. Winner wins. Now, winner has 1 game. \n\nSecond game: winner plays against player 3. Winner wins. Now, winner has 2 games. \n\nThird game: opponent must have 1 or 2 games. Let's say the opponent has 1 game. How? Let's think that there's another player who has played once. \n\nBut how to arrange that. Let's think of the structure. \n\nMaybe the winner's path requires that in order to get to the third game, the opponent has a path where they played once. So, for example, the winner's first game is against player 2 (they both have 0 games). Then, the winner's second game is against player 3 (who has 0 games). Then, the third game is against someone who has played once. \n\nBut how can that someone have played once? Let's imagine that in the first round, there are other matches. Like, players 4 and 5 play each other. The winner of that match (say, player 4) has played once. Then, the winner (player 1) plays against player 4. Player 1 has 2 games, player 4 has 1. Difference is 1, allowed. So that's the third game. \n\nYes, that's possible. So with 5 players, the winner can play 3 games. \n\nSo f(3) = 5. \n\nSimilarly, for k=4, f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8. \n\nSo for n=8, the maximum number of games is 4. \n\nSo the pattern here is that f(k) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number? Let's see:\n\nLet me list the Fibonacci numbers. Assuming Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc. \n\nBut our f(k) seems to be like:\n\nk | f(k)\n0 | 1\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n...\n\nWhich looks like f(k) = Fib(k+2). For example:\n\nk=0, Fib(2) = 1. Yes.\n\nk=1, Fib(3) = 2. Yes.\n\nk=2, Fib(4)=3. Yes.\n\nk=3, Fib(5)=5. Yes.\n\nSo yes. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is Fib(k+2). \n\nSo, given n, we need to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n. \n\nBut wait, what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, if n is 4. The Fib sequence for k+2 is:\n\nk=2 → Fib(4)=3 ≤4. k=3 → Fib(5)=5>4. So the maximum k is 2, which matches the sample input where n=4 outputs 2. \n\nAnother example: n=5. Fib(5) is 5. So k=3. Which would be the answer. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nBut how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)? \n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18, then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list of Fibonacci numbers to find the maximum k. \n\nLet me think about generating the Fibonacci numbers. Let's generate them in a list. Starting from Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc. \n\nBut for our purpose, the f(k) is Fib(k+2). So for example, Fib(2) = 1 (k=0), Fib(3)=2 (k=1), Fib(4)=3 (k=2), Fib(5)=5 (k=3), etc. \n\nSo for a given n, the maximum k is the largest integer such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all Fib numbers up to the maximum possible value (which is up to 1e18). \n\nLet me calculate how many Fib numbers are needed. Let's see:\n\nFib(0) = 0\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 1\n\nFib(3) = 2\n\nFib(4) = 3\n\nFib(5) = 5\n\nFib(6) = 8\n\nFib(7)=13\n\nFib(8)=21\n\nFib(9)=34\n\n...\n\nEach Fib number grows exponentially. So even for 1e18, the number of Fib numbers is about O(80) or something. \n\nSo for example, Fib(85) is around 2.1e17, Fib(86) is 3.4e17, Fib(87) is 5.5e17, Fib(88) is 8.9e17, Fib(89)=1.44e18, Fib(90)=2.33e18. \n\nSo for n up to 1e18, the maximum Fib number needed is Fib(90) which is 2.33e18. \n\nSo we can precompute the Fib numbers up to that point. \n\nOnce we have the list of Fib numbers, for a given n, find the largest index m where Fib(m) <=n. Then, the answer is (m-2). Because Fib(m) = Fib(k+2) → k = m-2. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nWe want to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo, for example, if Fib(m) ≤n < Fib(m+1), then the maximum k is m-2. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers. For each n, find the maximum m where Fib(m) ≤n. Then the answer is m-2. \n\nBut what about when n is not exactly a Fib number? For example, n=4. The Fib numbers are 0,1,1,2,3,5,... So for n=4, the largest Fib number less than or equal to 4 is 3 (Fib(4)=3). So m=4. Then answer is 4-2=2, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. Fib(5) is 5. m=5, answer is 5-2=3. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=10. Let's see the Fib numbers:\n\nFib(0)=0\n\nFib(1)=1\n\nFib(2)=1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nFib(6)=8\n\nFib(7)=13. \n\nSo for n=10, the largest Fib number is 8 (Fib(6)=8). m=6. answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 outputs 4. \n\nYes! So the approach is correct. \n\nNow, the problem becomes: generate all Fib numbers up to 1e18, then for input n, find the largest m where Fib(m) <=n, then return m-2. \n\nBut how to generate the Fib numbers? Let's start with Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, and then compute Fib(2) = Fib(1) + Fib(0) = 1, Fib(3) = Fib(2)+Fib(1) = 2, etc. \n\nBut note that for the Fib numbers, the indices start from 0. \n\nSo the code can generate a list of Fib numbers, and then for each n, perform a binary search on this list to find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n. \n\nBut let's think about the list. Let's generate the list until the Fib number exceeds 1e18. \n\nLet me write down the code steps:\n\nFirst, precompute the list of Fib numbers. \n\nInitialize a list fibs = [0, 1]\n\nThen, while the last element is <= 1e18:\n\n   next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n   append to fibs.\n\nBut wait, the initial list is [0, 1]. Then next is 1 (0+1?), no. Let me think:\n\nWait, Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, etc. \n\nSo the initial list is [0, 1], then compute Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, etc. \n\nSo the code would generate the Fib numbers as follows:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next)\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 1e18, this loop will generate all the Fib numbers up to that limit. \n\nOnce we have this list, for a given input n, we can perform a binary search to find the largest m where fibs[m] <=n. \n\nBut note that the list starts with Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. \n\nOnce we find the maximum m, then the answer is m-2. \n\nBut wait, for example, for n=2, the Fib numbers are 0,1,1,2,3,... So the largest Fib number <=2 is 2 (Fib(3)=2). m=3. answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3. The largest Fib number is 3 (Fib(4)=3). answer is 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=1. Wait, but the input constraints say n≥2. So the code doesn't have to handle n=1. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the list of Fib numbers.\n\n- For input n, find the largest m such that Fib(m) ≤n. \n\n- The answer is m-2.\n\nBut what if n is less than Fib(3) = 2? For example, n=2 is Fib(3)=2, answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nBut what about n=1? But the input constraints say n ≥2. \n\nSo the code can proceed. \n\nNow, the problem is to implement this. \n\nBut let's think about the edge cases. For example, n=2: the answer is 1. \n\nAnother case: n=3, answer is 2. \n\nAnother case: n=4, answer is 2. \n\nAnother case: n=5, answer is 3. \n\nNow, let's think about how to perform the binary search. \n\nThe list fibs is sorted in increasing order. So for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the largest element in fibs that is ≤n. \n\nIn Python, the bisect module can be used. For example, using bisect_right. \n\nFor example, bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) gives the insertion point. The index is the first element larger than n. So the largest element ≤n is at index (bisect_right_result - 1). \n\nBut we need to make sure that the index is valid. For example, if n is less than the first element (but since n >=2, and the first elements are 0, 1, etc., for n=2, the bisect_right would find the index for 2, which is in the list. \n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\nprecompute the list of fibs.\n\nfor n in input:\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n\n    if idx < 2: # because Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1. For n=2, idx is 3?\n\nWait, let's take the example of n=2. The fibs list is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...]. \n\nbisect.bisect_right(fibs, 2) returns the index after the last occurrence of 2. For example, in the list [0,1,1,2,3...], the bisect_right for 2 is 4. So idx = 4-1=3. \n\nThen m is 3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3. bisect_right returns index of 4 (since Fib(4)=3 is in the list). So idx is 4-1=3? Wait, no. Wait, the bisect_right returns the insertion point. Let me think. \n\nSuppose the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5...]. For n=3, bisect_right finds the position after the existing 3. So for example, if the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5], then bisect_right(3) returns 5. So idx = 5-1=4. m is 4. answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. \n\nYes. So the code would be:\n\nOnce we have the list of Fib numbers, for each n:\n\nidx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n\nif idx < 2: ?\n\nWait, for n=2, idx is 3. Which is okay. For example, if n is 1, then bisect_right returns 3 (since the list is [0,1,1,2,...], and 1 is found. bisect_right returns the index after the last occurrence of 1. So for n=1, bisect_right returns 3, subtract 1 gives 2. m=2. answer is 2-2=0. But n=1 is not in the input. \n\nBut since n is >=2, this case is not present. \n\nSo the code can proceed. \n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers. Let's generate them in a list called fibs. \n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut wait, 1e18 is a float. For integers, better to use 10**18. \n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut let's check the generated list. \n\nOnce this list is generated, then for input n, we do the bisect. \n\nBut wait, for example, the Fib numbers are:\n\nindex: 0 → 0\n\nindex: 1 → 1\n\nindex: 2 → 1\n\nindex: 3 → 2\n\nindex: 4 → 3\n\nindex: 5 → 5\n\nindex: 6 → 8\n\nindex: 7 → 13\n\nand so on. \n\nNow, for n=2, the bisect_right returns index 4 (as in the list [0,1,1,2,3,5, ...], the value 2 is at index 3. bisect_right returns 4. subtract 1 gives 3. m=3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nBut what about when n is exactly a Fib number? For example, n=5. The answer is 5-2=3. Which is correct. \n\nNow, let's test the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 2 → output 1. \n\nSample Input:3 → output 2. \n\nSample Input:4 → output 2. \n\nSample Input:10 → output 4. \n\nLet's check for n=10. \n\nThe Fib list up to 10 is:\n\n0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...\n\nSo for n=10, the largest Fib number <=10 is 8, which is at index 6. \n\nThen answer is 6-2=4. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n from input, generate the fibs list, then perform bisect. \n\nBut for n=2, the code returns 1. \n\nNow, what about n=1? Well, the input constraints say n >=2, so it's not considered. \n\nNow, let's think about the code. \n\nBut the problem is that for n=2, the Fib list contains 2 at index 3. \n\nSo the code would work. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n\n    # Precompute the fibs list\n\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_fib > 10**18:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n\n    # Now find the largest m where fibs[m] <=n\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n\n    # answer is idx - 2\n\n    print(idx - 2)\n\nWait, but let's check for n=2. \n\nThe fibs list is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...]. \n\nbisect_right(fibs, 2) returns 4 (since the first element after 2 is 3 at index 4). \n\nidx is 4-1=3. \n\nanswer is 3-2=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3. \n\nbisect_right returns index of 5 (since the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5...], and 3 is at index 4. bisect_right returns 5. idx is 5-1=4. answer is 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=4. \n\nbisect_right finds the insertion point after 3 (which is at index 4). The next element is 5. So bisect_right returns 5. idx is 5-1=4. answer is 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. idx is 5 (bisect_right returns 6, idx=5). answer is 5-2=3. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what if the n is less than the first Fib number? Well, since n is at least 2, and the first Fib numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, etc. For example, n=2 is handled. \n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n >=2. \n\nBut what about when n is 1? The code would return idx-2. For example, if n=1, the bisect_right returns 3 (since the list is [0,1,1,2...], and 1 is found. bisect_right returns 3, idx=2. answer is 0. But that's not a problem since n is not allowed to be 1. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nBut let's test the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 2 → output 1. \n\nSample Input:3 → output 2. \n\nSample Input:4 → output 2. \n\nSample Input:10 → output 4. \n\nWhich matches the sample outputs. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nBut wait, let's check the Fib list generation. \n\nInitially, fibs is [0, 1]. \n\nThen next_fib = 0+1=1. Which is added. \n\nThen next_fib is 1+1=2. Added. \n\nThen 1+2=3. Added. \n\nThen 2+3=5. Added. \n\nThen 3+5=8. Added. \n\nThen 5+8=13. Added. \n\nAnd so on. \n\nYes. So the list is generated correctly. \n\nNow, the code can be written. \n\nBut what about when the Fib list is generated up to 1e18? Let me check for the loop. \n\nThe loop appends next_fib as long as it is <= 1e18. \n\nBut the code uses 10**18. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nBut in Python, the code may have to handle very large numbers, but since Python handles big integers well, this is not a problem. \n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_fib > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n    print(idx - 2)\n\nBut wait, what if the Fib list is not long enough? For example, for n=1e18, the code must generate up to that. \n\nBut the loop appends until next_fib exceeds 1e18. So the list includes all Fib numbers up to the largest one that is <=1e18. \n\nBut what if the next_fib is exactly 1e18? It is added. \n\nYes. \n\nBut let's think about the case where n is exactly Fib(m). \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nAnother possible edge case is when n=1e18. \n\nBut the code should handle that. \n\nNow, testing with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2 → output 1. \n\nSample Input 3: n=3 → output 2. \n\nSample Input 4: n=4 → output 2. \n\nSample Input 10 → output 4. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: n=5. Output is 3. \n\nAnother test case: n=8 → output 6-2=4? \n\nWait, Fib(6) is 8. So idx is 6. answer is 6-2=4. Which would be correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code should be correct. \n\nBut let's think about when n=1. \n\nBut since the input is constrained to n≥2, it's not a problem. \n\nNow, the code is written. \n\nBut what about the case where n is less than Fib(3)=2? For example, n=2 is Fib(3)=2. So it's handled. \n\nBut for n=2, the code returns 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: n=1. Not allowed. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nThus, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging properties of Fibonacci numbers to efficiently compute the result even for very large values of n (up to 10^18).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is recognizing that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern related to Fibonacci numbers. This is because each game the winner plays requires opponents who have played a number of games differing by at most one, which naturally leads to a Fibonacci sequence structure.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Thus, for a given number of players `n`, we need to find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Efficient Search**: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (10^18) and use binary search to quickly determine the largest valid Fibonacci number for a given `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_fib > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n    print(idx - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the largest value that does not exceed 10^18. This allows us to handle very large inputs efficiently.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using the `bisect` module, we perform a binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci list to find the largest value that is less than or equal to the input `n`. This index helps determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The index found using binary search is adjusted to determine the maximum number of games by subtracting 2 (as derived from the Fibonacci sequence properties).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and provide the correct result even for the upper limits of the input range.",
