On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The idea is that by reversing any interval [l, r], I can get a new sequence, and I want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of that new sequence. The challenge is to find which reversal gives the best result.\n\nBut how do I approach this efficiently? Because trying all possible intervals and for each checking the LNDS would be O(n^3) or worse, which for n=2000 might not be feasible. Wait, n is up to 2000. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nLet me think: For each possible reversal of [l, r], the original array becomes modified in that interval. But calculating the LNDS for each such modified array directly would take O(n^2) per case, leading to O(n^4) time overall. That's way too slow for n=2000. So that approach is not going to work.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the problem. Since the original array only has 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to model this with dynamic programming or precompute some values.\n\nThe original LNDS can be found easily. But when we reverse a subarray, how does that affect the LNDS?\n\nLet me think: The optimal scenario would be when after reversing a subarray, the entire array becomes non-decreasing. But that's not always possible. However, since the elements are only 1 and 2, the best possible LNDS length is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's something less.\n\nBut how can reversing a subarray help? Let's take the first example: [1,2,1,2]. Reversing positions 2-3 gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So the LNDS is 4. So the maximum possible is achieved here.\n\nIn the second example, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9 because the first 5 elements are 1s, then 5 2s, then a 1. The longest is the first 5 1s plus the next 4 2s (total 9). So the idea is that reversing a part of the array can fix some transitions between 1s and 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is one that connects a block of 1s and 2s in a way that allows for a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. The original array has some runs of 1s and 2s. For example, if there's a part where 2 comes before 1, reversing that part would make it 1 before 2, which could help. But how to find the best such reversal?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the maximum LNDS after any reversal is equal to the original maximum LNDS, or the maximum possible when we reverse a certain interval. So perhaps we can find for each possible reversal what's the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nAnother thought: since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s, and their arrangement. For example, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Or maybe something similar.\n\nWait, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 1s (if all 1s are followed by 2s), but no, that's not right. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc.) but after reversing [2,3], it's [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4.\n\nSo the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence, which can be calculated as follows: the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the LNDS in a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not correct. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2 (the count of 1s is 2, count of 2s is 2). But the actual LNDS is 2 (like 1,2,2) or 2 (like 1,1,2). Wait, but in the example given, after reversing, the array becomes [1,1,2,2], so the LNDS is 4. So the maximum is the total number of elements when the array is non-decreasing.\n\nSo for the general case, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing way. Which for 1s and 2s is the sum of the count of 1s and the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Or wait, maybe the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are in non-decreasing order.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 1s, because you can take all the 1s (they are non-decreasing).\n\n- The number of 2s, same logic.\n\n- Or, the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that appear after the last occurrence of 1. Because you can take all the 1s followed by all the 2s after the last 1. Similarly, the count of 2s plus the count of 1s that appear after the last 2. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the maximum of the following:\n\ncount_1 + count_2_after_last_1, where count_2_after_last_1 is the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the original array.\n\nOr similarly, count_2 + count_1_after_last_2.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum possible LNDS for the original array is the maximum of these two options, or the count_1 or count_2. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the count_1 is 2, count_2 is 2. The count_2_after_last_1 is 1 (since the last 1 is at position 3, and after that there's one 2). So count_1 + count_2_after_last_1 = 3. Similarly, the count_2_after_last_1 is 1, but maybe there's another way. However, when we reverse a subarray, maybe we can find a way to have more 2s after the 1s.\n\nSo the idea is that reversing a subarray can create a situation where the number of 1s followed by 2s increases.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a segment where there's a transition from 2 to 1, and reverse it to make it 1 to 2. But how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. For example, if we can arrange the array such that all 1s come before all 2s, then the LNDS is the total number of elements. So the problem reduces to finding whether there's a reversal that can make the array into such a form. If not, then find the best possible.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible reversals.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that after reversing any interval [l, r], the array will have the same elements, but the order in that interval is reversed. Let's imagine that the best possible LNDS is the original maximum plus some gain from the reversal.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Suppose the original array has some parts where 2s are followed by 1s. Reversing those parts would turn them into 1s followed by 2s, which is good. So the problem may be to find the maximum number of such transitions that can be fixed by a reversal.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum possible LNDS after reversal. Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the modified array. Or, the number of 2s plus the number of 1s after the last 2. But since the array is non-decreasing, the maximum possible is the total number of elements if it's non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and count of 2s, or count_1 + count_2_after_last_1.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal reversal is one that maximizes the count of 1s followed by 2s. Let me think of this as follows:\n\nLet’s say that in the original array, the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s is x. Then, by reversing a certain interval, we can increase this x.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, for any possible reversal [l, r], the modified array will have:\n\n- All elements before l, then reversed elements from l to r, then elements after r.\n\nWe can model the modified array as:\n\noriginal[0..l-1] + reversed(original[l..r]) + original[r+1..n-1]\n\nNow, the LNDS for this modified array is the maximum between:\n\n- The LNDS of the original array (but that's not helpful, since we're looking for the best possible reversal).\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be computed as follows:\n\nThe maximum number of 1s in the entire array plus the maximum number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all possible intervals [l, r].\n\nBut even this seems tricky. Let me think of the problem in terms of the number of 1s and 2s.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\ntotal_ones = number of 1s in the original array.\n\ntotal_twos = n - total_ones.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS is min(total_ones + total_twos, ...). Well, that's n, but only if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, or the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the array.\n\nSo, for the original array, the maximum LNDS is max( total_ones, total_twos, count_ones_before + count_twos_after ), where count_ones_before is the number of 1s up to some point, and count_twos_after is the number of 2s after that point. But how to find the best point.\n\nBut when we reverse a subarray, perhaps we can increase the count_ones_before + count_twos_after.\n\nFor example, suppose in the original array, there is a segment where a 2 is followed by a 1. Reversing that segment would turn it into 1 followed by 2, which contributes to the count_ones_before + count_twos_after.\n\nSo, the idea is that the best reversal is one that increases the number of 1s that are before 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to find for each possible reversal [l, r], the maximum value of (number of 1s before the reversed segment, plus number of 2s in the reversed segment that become after the 1s, plus number of 2s after the reversed segment, plus ... ?) Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the modified array as follows:\n\nThe reversed segment [l, r] becomes reversed. Let's say that in the original array, before l, there are some 1s and 2s. After reversing [l, r], the first part of the reversed segment is the original r-th element, then r-1-th, etc., down to l-th.\n\nSo, the key is to find how many 1s are in the reversed segment and how many 2s are in the reversed segment, and how they are positioned relative to the rest of the array.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each possible reversal [l, r], the modified array can be considered as three parts:\n\nA: elements before l\n\nB: reversed elements from l to r\n\nC: elements after r.\n\nNow, the LNDS of the modified array is the maximum of:\n\n- The length of the LNDS in A, plus the LNDS in B, plus the LNDS in C, but that's not correct because the subsequence can span across parts.\n\nBut since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be determined by how many 1s are in the entire array, and how many 2s are after the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the modified array. Similarly, it's also possible that the maximum is the total number of 2s plus the number of 1s after the last 2. But since the array is non-decreasing, the maximum between these two is the answer.\n\nBut since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1, or the count of 2s plus the count of 1s that are after the last 2.\n\nBut since the array is non-decreasing, the last 1 will be before all 2s. So the maximum is count_1 + count_2_after_last_1.\n\nSo, to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal, we need to find the maximum value of count_1 + count_2_after_last_1, considering all possible reversals.\n\nThus, our problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (number of 1s in the entire array) + (number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the modified array).\n\nSo, how can we compute this for all possible reversals?\n\nLet me think: Let's denote the original array as a.\n\nSuppose after reversing [l, r], the modified array is a'.\n\nLet’s find the position of the last 1 in a'. Then, the number of 2s after that position is the count_2_after_last_1.\n\nThe total LNDS is total_ones + count_2_after_last_1.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the maximum possible value of total_ones + count_2_after_last_1 over all possible reversals.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about what happens when we reverse [l, r]. The elements in this range are reversed. The rest of the array remains the same.\n\nThe last 1 in the modified array could be in any of the following regions:\n\n1. In the part before l (A)\n\n2. In the reversed part (B)\n\n3. In the part after r (C)\n\nSo, for each reversal [l, r], we need to find the last occurrence of 1 in the modified array, then count how many 2s are after that.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible reversal [l, r], we can compute:\n\n- The last occurrence of 1 in the entire modified array.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. However, perhaps we can precompute some prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's precompute for each position i:\n\nprefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in a[0..i-1]\n\nprefix_twos[i] = number of 2s in a[0..i-1]\n\nSimilarly, suffix_ones[i] = number of 1s in a[i..n-1]\n\nsuffix_twos[i] = number of 2s in a[i..n-1]\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, for the modified array, the last occurrence of 1 can be in three parts:\n\nCase 1: The last 1 in the original array is before l. Then, after reversal, the last 1 is still the same as in the original array.\n\nCase 2: The last 1 in the modified array is in the reversed part (B). This depends on the elements in B.\n\nCase 3: The last 1 in the modified array is in part C (after r). Then, the last 1 is the same as the original array's last 1 in part C.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the modified array as follows:\n\nThe reversed part B is the original a[l..r] reversed. Let's denote the reversed part as rev_B.\n\nThe last occurrence of 1 in the modified array is the maximum between:\n\n- The last occurrence of 1 in A (original part before l)\n\n- The last occurrence of 1 in rev_B\n\n- The last occurrence of 1 in C (original part after r)\n\nOnce we find the position of the last 1 in the modified array, we can calculate the number of 2s after that position.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all possible [l, r]?\n\nLet me think about the steps needed for each [l, r]:\n\n1. Find the last occurrence of 1 in the modified array. Let's call this pos.\n\n2. Count the number of 2s in the modified array after pos. Let's call this cnt.\n\nThen, the value we want is total_ones + cnt.\n\nSo, the maximum over all [l, r] of this value is our answer.\n\nBut how to compute this for all [l, r]?\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps we can find a way to compute for each [l, r] the maximum possible cnt.\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nFor the modified array, the last occurrence of 1 is determined by three components: A, B, C.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nlast_A = last occurrence of 1 in A (original part before l)\n\nlast_B = last occurrence of 1 in rev_B (original part l to r reversed)\n\nlast_C = last occurrence of 1 in C (original part after r)\n\nThen, the overall last_1_pos is max(last_A, last_B, last_C).\n\nIf we can compute these three values for each [l, r], then we can find the position of the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nOnce we have this position, the number of 2s after it is the total number of 2s in the entire array minus the number of 2s up to and including that position.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For the entire array, the total number of 2s is total_twos = n - total_ones.\n\nSo, for any position x (0-based), the number of 2s after x is total_twos - (number of 2s up to and including x).\n\nBut how to compute the number of 2s up to and including x in the modified array?\n\nThis seems difficult because the modified array depends on the reversal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the number of 2s after the last 1 in the modified array as follows:\n\nLet's assume that the last 1 is in part A. Then, the number of 2s after it is the number of 2s in B (reversed) + the number of 2s in C, plus the number of 2s in B that come after the last 1 in A. Wait, this seems messy.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the entire modified array. The last 1 can be in any of the three parts. So, for each [l, r], we can compute:\n\n- The last 1 in part A: which is the last occurrence of 1 in the original array before l.\n\n- The last 1 in part B: which is the first occurrence of 1 in the original array's part l..r (since when reversed, the first element of B is the original a[r], then a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So the last occurrence of 1 in B is the original first occurrence of 1 in the original segment [l..r]? No, that's not correct. For example, if the original segment [l..r] is [2,1], then reversed it's [1,2]. The last 1 in B is at position l (original a[r] is 1, which is the first element of B). So the last occurrence of 1 in B is the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B, which is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in the original B (since when reversed, the first element of B becomes the last element of the reversed B? Wait, no. The reversed B is the original B reversed. So the first element of B (original l) becomes the last element of reversed B. The last element of B (original r) becomes the first element of reversed B.\n\nSo, the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in the original B. Because when you reverse the B, the positions are flipped. So for example, if in the original B there are 1s at positions l and r, then after reversal, the first element is a[r], and the last is a[l]. So the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B is the position in the reversed B where the last 1 occurs. Which would be the first occurrence of 1 in the original B, but only if there are no other 1s after that in the original B.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should think of the reversed B as the original B reversed. So, the reversed B has elements [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]. So, the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in the original B. Because when reversed, the first occurrence of 1 in the original B becomes the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B. Wait, no. For example, original B is [2,1,2,1]. Reversed B is [1,2,1,2]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2 (0-based?), which is the third element. In the original B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 1 (original index l+1?), and the last occurrence is at position 3 (original index r). When reversed, the original first occurrence of 1 (position 1) is now at position len(B)-1 - (original position - l) ?\n\nThis seems too involved. Perhaps there's a better way to find the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B.\n\nAlternatively, for the reversed B, the last occurrence of 1 is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in the original B, but only if there are no other 1s after that in the original B. Wait, no. For example, if the original B is [1, 2, 1], then reversed B is [1, 2, 1]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. In the original B, the first occurrence is at position 0, and the last occurrence is at position 2. When reversed, the first occurrence of 1 in original B is at position 0, which becomes the last element of reversed B. The last occurrence in original B is at position 2, which becomes the first element of reversed B. So in reversed B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 0 (original B's last 1), and the last occurrence is at position 2 (original B's first 1). So the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in original B. Wait, no. In this example, the original B is [1,2,1], reversed is [1,2,1]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is position 2, which is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in original B (position 0). So yes, in this case, the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the first occurrence of 1 in original B.\n\nAnother example: original B is [2,1,2,1]. Reversed B is [1,2,1,2]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2 (third element). In original B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 1. So yes, the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the first occurrence of 1 in original B. So this seems to be a pattern.\n\nThus, the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is equal to the first occurrence of 1 in original B. Wait, no. What if the original B contains multiple 1s?\n\nLet me take original B as [1,1,2]. Reversed B is [2,1,1]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. In the original B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 0. So yes, the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in original B. Wait, but in this example, the original B has first occurrence of 1 at position 0, but the reversed B has the first occurrence of 1 at position 1, and the last at 2. So the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in original B? No, in this case, the first occurrence of 1 in original B is 0, and the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is 2. So the positions are different, but the value is the same. Wait, but the position in the array matters for determining where the last 1 is in the modified array. So the actual position of the last 1 in the reversed B is the position in the modified array where the reversed B ends. So, for example, the reversed B starts at position l in the original array. The reversed B has length m = r - l + 1. So the first element of reversed B is at position l in the modified array, and the last element is at position r.\n\nSo the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position r if the original B's first occurrence of 1 is at position l. Or maybe not. It's getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think about the reversed B as a separate array. Let me denote the original segment as B = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]. Reversed B is [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]. The last occurrence of 1 in this reversed B is the last index i in the reversed B where the value is 1. Which corresponds to the first occurrence of 1 in the original B. Because when you reverse, the first occurrence of 1 in the original B becomes the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B. For example, if in original B the first 1 is at position j (relative to B's start), then in reversed B it is at position (m - j - 1), where m is the length of B. So if the first occurrence of 1 in original B is at position x (absolute), then in the reversed B, it is at position (r - x) relative to the start of B. So the absolute position in the modified array is l + (r - x) = r - x + l. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems too involved. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think of the following:\n\nFor each [l, r], the reversed B can contribute to the last_1_pos in the modified array. To find whether the reversed B contains a 1, and if so, where is the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B.\n\nBut perhaps instead of trying to find the exact position, we can compute for the reversed B whether it has any 1s, and what is the maximum between the original last_1 in A, the reversed B's last_1, and the original last_1 in C.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible [l, r], the maximum between the following three values:\n\n1. The last_1 in A.\n\n2. The last_1 in C.\n\n3. The first_1 in B (because when reversed, the first_1 in B becomes the last_1 in reversed B).\n\nWait, no. The first_1 in B is the earliest occurrence of 1 in B. When reversed, this becomes the latest occurrence of 1 in reversed B. So yes, the last_1 in reversed B is the first_1 in original B. Or is it?\n\nLet me take an example. Original B is [2,1,2,1]. The first occurrence of 1 in B is at position 1 (original index l+1). When reversed, the B becomes [1,2,1,2]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2 (value 1). Which corresponds to the original B's position 2 (original index l+2). So the first occurrence of 1 in B is at position 1, and the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. So it's not the first occurrence of 1 in B, but the last occurrence of 1 in B? Or something else.\n\nHmm. This seems complicated. Maybe I should think of the reversed B as a new array and find the last occurrence of 1 in it. But how to do this quickly for all possible [l, r].\n\nAlternatively, for each [l, r], the reversed B has the same elements as B, just reversed. So the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in B. No, that's not true. For example, if B is [1, 2, 1], the reversed B is [1, 2, 1]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. In the original B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 0. So it's not the same as the first occurrence of 1 in B. But the first occurrence of 1 in B is at position 0, and the last occurrence of 1 in B is at position 2. When reversed, the first occurrence of 1 in B becomes the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B. And the last occurrence of 1 in B becomes the first occurrence of 1 in reversed B.\n\nSo the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in B. No, that's not correct. In the example above, the first occurrence of 1 in B is at 0, and the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. Which is the same as the original B's last occurrence of 1 (position 2). So reversed B's last occurrence of 1 is the same as original B's last occurrence of 1. But that's not true. Let me think: original B is [1, 2, 1]. Reversed B is [1, 2, 1]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. In the original B, the last occurrence of 1 is also at position 2. So yes, the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the last occurrence of 1 in original B. So this suggests that the reversed B has the same set of 1s as the original B, just in reverse order. So the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in original B? No, in this example, it's the same as the original B's last occurrence of 1. So perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think of another example. Original B is [2, 1, 2]. Reversed B is [2, 1, 2]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 1. In the original B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 1. The last occurrence of 1 in original B is also at position 1. So yes, in this case, it's the same.\n\nAnother example: original B is [2, 1, 1, 2]. Reversed B is [2, 1, 1, 2]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2. In original B, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 1, and the last occurrence is at position 2. So the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the last occurrence of 1 in original B. So it seems that the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the last occurrence of 1 in original B. Wait, that makes sense. Because reversing the array doesn't change the set of elements, just their order. So the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in the original B? Or no. No, because in the original B, the last occurrence of 1 is at position m-1 (if m is the length of B). When reversed, this becomes the first occurrence of 1 in reversed B. So the last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is the same as the first occurrence of 1 in original B. Or no?\n\nNo, I think I'm getting mixed up here. Let's take the example where original B is [2, 1, 1, 2]. The original B has 1s at positions 1 and 2. When reversed, the B becomes [2, 1, 1, 2]. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2 (third element), which is the same as the original B's last occurrence of 1. So why is that? Because in the original B, the last occurrence of 1 is at position 2 (0-based). When reversed, this becomes the first occurrence of 1 in the reversed B. The last occurrence of 1 in reversed B is at position 2, which was the second occurrence of 1 in original B. So it's not clear.\n\nThis line of thinking seems stuck. Perhaps I need to find another way.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is either:\n\n- The total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (total_ones + number_of_2s_after_last_1_in_modified_array).\n\nSo, how to maximize this value.\n\nLet me think about what contributes to increasing the number_of_2s_after_last_1_in_modified_array.\n\nIf the modified array has the last 1 as early as possible, then there are more 2s after it.\n\nSo, the best scenario is to have the last 1 as early as possible, and as many 2s as possible after it.\n\nSo, for example, if we can have all the 1s in the array before some point, and all the 2s after that point, then the number_of_2s_after_last_1_in_modified_array is the total number of 2s, and the total LNDS is total_ones + total_twos = n.\n\nSo, the question is, can we find a reversal that makes the array non-decreasing? If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the best possible.\n\nBut how to check if such a reversal exists.\n\nAlternatively, think about the original array. The number of 2s after the last 1 is some value. By reversing a segment, we can potentially increase this value.\n\nFor example, suppose in the original array, there is a segment that contains some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which could allow more 2s to be after the last 1.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the maximum number of 2s that can be placed after the last 1 in the array by reversing a single segment.\n\nTo find this, perhaps we can precompute for each possible position where the last 1 is, and then calculate how many 2s are after it.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nThe original array has some number of 1s and 2s. Let's find all possible positions where the last 1 is, and for each such position, calculate how many 2s are after it. The maximum of these values plus total_ones is the original maximum.\n\nNow, by reversing a segment, we can potentially move some 2s to be after the last 1, or move some 1s to be before the last 1.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the optimal way to increase the number of 2s after the last 1 is to find a segment that contains a 2 followed by a 1, and reverse it to make it 1 followed by 2. This would add some 2s to the count.\n\nBut how to find the best such segment.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following:\n\nThe maximum number of 2s after the last 1 is equal to the number of ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can potentially align more 1s before 2s, which maximizes the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The LNDS for such sequences can be maximized by ensuring as many 1s as possible are followed by 2s.\n2. **Key Insight**: Reversing a subarray that contains a transition from 2 to 1 can convert it into a transition from 1 to 2, which helps in forming longer non-decreasing subsequences.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We use prefix and suffix arrays to efficiently compute the number of 1s and 2s up to each position and from each position onwards. This helps in quickly evaluating the impact of reversing any subarray on the LNDS.\n4. **Maximizing the LNDS**: By iterating over all possible subarrays, we calculate the potential increase in the number of 2s that can follow the last 1 after reversing the subarray. This involves checking the contribution of the reversed subarray to the overall count of 2s after the last 1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s and 2s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_twos[i+1] = prefix_twos[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n    total_twos = prefix_twos[n]\n    \n    max_lnds = total_ones + total_twos - max(total_ones, total_twos)\n    # Wait, no, that's not correct.
