For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem says that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Let me check that. Let's see the order:\n\nC to C# is 1 semitone. Then C# to D is another, etc. Let's count from C to E. C to C# (1), C# to D (2), D to D# (3), D# to E (4). Oh right, so that's 4 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? No, wait. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of steps forward. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position) steps? Or perhaps the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Let's see: E to F is 1, F to F# 2, ..., up to C. Let me count. From E to C: E to F (1), F to F# (2), F# to G (3), G to G# (4), G# to A (5), A to B (6?), wait no. Wait the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H is C again. So from E, the next notes are F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), then C (8). So yes, E to C is 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but if that's negative, we add 12? Wait no. Because when Y is higher than X, the distance is Y - X. If Y is lower, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper. So for example, if X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (C's index - E's index) + 12 if it's negative. So maybe the way to calculate the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_pos + 12 - X_pos). But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, since the notes are in a circular order, the distance between X and Y can be computed as (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12. But wait, for example, C is at position 0, E is at position 4. So Y_pos - X_pos is 4, which is correct. For E (position 4) to C (position 0), Y_pos - X_pos is -4. But mod 12 would be 8, which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the formula (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct distance. Because for example, when Y is lower than X, (Y - X) is negative, mod 12 gives the correct positive value. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (C's index - E's index) mod 12? Let's compute. C is index 0, E is index 4. So 0 -4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Yes. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper, perhaps the actual calculation is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12, but since mod can be negative, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, in Python, (-4) % 12 is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is map each note to its index in the list. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order given in the problem is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the problem statement, the list is given as:\n\n\"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\"\n\nWait, but in the example, the third input is 'A B H'. Let me check the sample input and output. For example, the third input is A, B, H. Let's see what the output is 'strange'.\n\nSo, for that case, we need to check all permutations of the three notes and see if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances between X, Y, Z).\n\nBut since the chord is an unordered set, but the problem says that the triad is considered as a set, but when checking for major or minor, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. Because for a major triad, there must be some ordering where X, Y, Z satisfy the distance conditions.\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, check if it meets the major or minor criteria.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For three elements, there are 6 permutations. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all possible permutations and see if any of them meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's create a list called notes_order, which is ordered as per the problem statement. Then, for a given note, we can find its index in this list.\n\nFor example:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the 11th note is B, then H is the 12th. So indexes 0 to 11.\n\nSo, for example, 'H' is index 11. Then, the next note after H is C again.\n\nSo, for each note, we can get its index.\n\n2. For the three input notes, generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if:\n\nFor major: distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Then, the total between X and Z is 7 semitones. But since the problem says that the distance is from X to Y, then Y to Z. So the order is important.\n\nSimilarly, for minor: distance between X and Y is 3 semitones, and Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check if it meets either of these conditions.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, then 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can generate all possible orderings.\n\nSo, for example, given a list of three notes, like ['C', 'E', 'G'], permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nNow, for each permutation (X, Y, Z), we can compute the distance between X and Y, then Y and Z.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two notes. Let's write a helper function:\n\ndef get_distance(note1, note2):\n\n    index1 = note_to_index[note1]\n\n    index2 = note_to_index[note2]\n\n    return (index2 - index1) % 12\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So for example, if note1 is lower than note2, then the distance is index2 - index1. If note1 is higher, then it's (index2 + 12 - index1). Which is exactly (index2 - index1) mod 12. Because, for example, if index2 is less than index1, then (index2 - index1) is negative, and mod 12 would give the correct positive value. So this helper function returns the correct distance.\n\nSo, for a permutation (X, Y, Z), check:\n\ndistance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. Then it's a major.\n\nOr, distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. Then it's a minor.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check these two conditions.\n\nOnce any of the permutations satisfies either condition, we can return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input: the input is three space-separated notes, given as a single line. For example, in the sample input, it's ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] but the actual input is a single line. Wait, no. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the input could be something like 'C E G' (for the first example). So the code needs to read a line, split into three notes.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, we can read the input as:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, the three notes are in the list notes.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of these three notes.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\nElse, check if distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4. If yes, then it's a minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to handle all permutations? Let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe can loop through all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check for major and minor.\n\nOnce any of the permutations meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major' as the answer. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nThen, for the input notes, say, notes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print \"strange\".\n\nWait, but permutations returns all possible orderings. So for example, for the first sample input 'C E G', the permutation (C, E, G) would have d1 = E - C = 4, d2 = G - E = 3. So that's a major. So the code would detect that and return 'major'.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' — the sample says that when ordered as B, C#, F, the distances are 3 and 4. Let's see:\n\nB is note_order[10], C# is note_order[1], F is note_order[5].\n\nSo for the permutation (B, C#, F):\n\nd1 between B and C#: (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Because 1 - 10 = -9, mod 12 is 3. So yes, 3 semitones. Then between C# and F: 5 - 1 = 4. So that's 4. So that's minor. So the code would detect that and return 'minor'.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nBut wait, the code checks for each permutation. However, for a triad, there are 6 permutations. But for example, the major triad can be checked in multiple permutations. For example, if the triad is X, Y, Z, then the permutation (X, Y, Z) would be checked. Also, other permutations may not satisfy the condition. But since the code checks all permutations, once any permutation meets the condition, the code returns.\n\nNow, the code needs to check all permutations. However, for the code, once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we can return immediately.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   compute d1 (distance between first and second note)\n\n   compute d2 (distance between second and third note)\n\n   if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3: return major\n\n   elif d1 is 3 and d2 is 4: return minor\n\nIf none found after checking all permutations, return strange.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, the note_to_index mapping. Let's make sure that the note_order list is correct.\n\nThe problem lists the notes as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the note_order list is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo the note_to_index is built correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # compute distance between x and y\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    d1 = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    # compute distance between y and z\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    d2 = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third example is 'A B H'. Let's check.\n\nNotes are A, B, H.\n\nLet's look at all permutations.\n\nLet me think about one possible permutation: A, B, H.\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\ndistance between A and B: (10-9) mod 12 = 1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\ndistance between B (10) and H (11) is 1. Then between H and A: (9 - 11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\ndistance between B and A: (9 - 10) mod 12 = 11. Which is 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A.\n\ndistance between H (11) and B (10): (10 - 11) mod 12 = 11. Then between B and A: 9 - 10 = -1 mod 12 is 11. Not helpful.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\ndistance between H (11) and A (9): (9 - 11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. Then between A and B: 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\ndistance between A (9) and H (11): 2. Then between H and B (10): (10 - 11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' → the sample says it's minor. Let's check.\n\nNotes are C#, B, F. Let's see permutations.\n\nOne of the permutations is B, C#, F.\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1. So distance between B and C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5 -1 =4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code would detect this.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about cases where the same note appears multiple times? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, but the code would process them regardless.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three notes. So for example, if the input is three same notes, then all distances are zero. So no major or minor.\n\nNow, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations. For three elements, permutations returns 6 possibilities.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. But since the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, and the code checks all possibilities, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the note_order list is correct. Let me check the note_order again.\n\nProblem says the order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So note_order is as written.\n\nNow, for example, the note 'H' is at index 11. Then, the next note is C again.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in the cyclic musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is determined by the difference in their indices modulo 12, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    d1 = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    d2 = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes. Each note is mapped to an index for quick lookup.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the input notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are checked for the triad conditions.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. If the distances between consecutive notes in any permutation match the criteria for a major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) triad, the result is printed immediately.\n4. **Result Determination**: If no valid permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the input notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification of the triad.",
