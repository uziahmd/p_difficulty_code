For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad (three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So, the distance between two notes is the number of semitones when moving from the lower to the higher note. But since the order matters, for example, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C#, D, D#, E: that's four steps). But from E to C would be 8 semitones because you go the other way around. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. Wait, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one.\" So, when calculating the distance between two notes, we need to find the number of semitones when moving upward from the lower note to the higher one. So, for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, since E is higher than C, but if we take the distance as from the lower to upper, then maybe the distance between E and C would be considered as 8 semitones? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So, if you have two notes, say X and Y, then the distance is calculated as the number of semitones when you move from the lower note to the upper note. So, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is calculated as the number of semitones when moving upward from Y to X? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest to the upper. So, for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance would be 8 semitones? Because the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So, if you have X and Y, then the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but multiplied by 1 semitone per step. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So, for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone, between C and D is 2 semitones, etc. But since the notes are cyclic, the distance between H (which is B) and C is 1 semitone. So, how to compute the distance between two notes?\n\nLet me think. The notes are ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So, the order is cyclic. So, each note has an index from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11. Then, the distance between X and Y (when X is lower than Y) is (Y's index - X's index) semitones. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y's index + 12 - X's index) semitones? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. So, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. Wait, but how do we determine which note is lower? For example, if X is C (0) and Y is H (11), then the distance between X and Y is 11 semitones. But if X is H (11) and Y is C (0), then the distance between X and Y is 1 semitone. Because the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y + 12 - X). But how to compute that. Alternatively, the distance can be calculated as (y_index - x_index) % 12, but that's not correct. Because if Y is lower than X, then the distance from X to Y would be (Y + 12 - X) semitones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. So, for example, between X = H (11) and Y = C (0), the distance is 1 semitone. Between X = C (0) and Y = H (11), the distance is 11 semitones.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that? Let me think of the distance between two notes as (y_index - x_index) if that's positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). But that's equivalent to (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Wait, no. Because if y_index is less than x_index, then (y_index - x_index) is negative. Adding 12 gives us the correct distance. So, for example, if X is C (0) and Y is H (11), then the distance is 11 - 0 = 11. If X is H (11) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 - 11) + 12 = 1. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Which is equivalent to (y_index - x_index) % 12, but only if the result is positive. Wait, but (y_index - x_index) mod 12 would give the same as (y_index - x_index + 12) mod 12. But in this case, the distance is exactly (y_index - x_index) if positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). So, for example, for X = C (0), Y = C (0), the distance is 0. For X = C, Y = C#, it's 1. For X = C#, Y = C, the distance is 11. So, the formula for the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Alternatively, this can be written as (y_index - x_index) % 12. Wait, no. Because (y_index - x_index) mod 12 would be the same as the distance. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is C (0), then (0-0) mod 12 is 0. If X is C (0) and Y is H (11), (11-0) mod 12 is 11. If X is H (11) and Y is C (0), (0-11) mod 12 is 1. So yes! The distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, that's not correct. Because the distance between X and Y is supposed to be the number of semitones when moving from X to Y upwards. So, for example, if X is H and Y is C, then moving upward from X to Y is 1 semitone. Which is indeed (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1. So, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. So, that's the way to compute the distance between two notes. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is taken from the lower to the upper. So, if X is lower than Y, the distance is (Y - X). If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So, that's the formula.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is map each note to its index. Let's create a list of the notes in order, and then for each note, get its index. For example:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So, the indexes are 0 to 11. So, for example, 'B' is index 10, 'H' is index 11. So, the list would be:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that after H comes C again. So, the list is correct.\n\nNow, given three notes, I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes, and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nFor a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Similarly, for a minor triad, the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nBut how to check this for all possible permutations of the three notes.\n\nSo, for the three notes, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (for major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, perhaps there are multiple permutations that could satisfy the condition. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so we just need to check if any permutation meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- For the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since order matters for checking the distances).\n\n- For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 → if yes, then it's a major chord.\n\n- Also check if the first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 → if yes, then minor.\n\n- If any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'; if any permutation satisfies minor, then output 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes. Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) would generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nBut since the input is three notes, perhaps the code would read them into a list, then generate all permutations of that list, and check each permutation.\n\nSo, first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a dictionary for that.\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but what about the note names? For example, the input may have 'B' or 'H'? According to the problem statement, the notes are given in the notation as listed. So, the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes in the given notation. So, the note names are as per the list given. So, the note 'H' is present in the list. So, the code should handle that.\n\nOnce I have the three notes, for each permutation of the three, I can check the distances.\n\nLet me think of an example. For example, the first example input is 'C E G'. The permutations would include C, E, G. Let's check the distance between C and E. The index of C is 0, E is 4. So, (4 - 0) mod 12 is 4. Then between E and G: G is index 7. 7 - 4 = 3. So, that's 3. So, this permutation satisfies the major condition. Therefore, the answer is major.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F'. Let's look at the permutation B, C#, F. B is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5. Distance from B to C#: (1 - 10) mod 12 is (1 -10 +12) = 3. Then from C# to F: 5 -1 =4. So, that's 3 and 4. So, minor.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all permutations of the three notes, and for each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nSo, steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input. The input is three notes, e.g., given as a list like ['C E G', 'C# B F', ...]. Wait, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three elements, but perhaps that's just for the example. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo, for example, the input could be something like 'C E G' (as in the first example), and the output is 'major'.\n\nSo, in the code, the input is read as a single line, split into three parts. So, for example, in Python, input().split() would give a list of three strings.\n\nSo, the code would read the three notes into a list, say, notes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each permutation of these three notes, check the conditions.\n\nNow, for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3 → major.\n\nOr check if distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then return 'major'; if any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- Preprocess the note_to_index mapping.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n- For each permutation, compute the distances between first and second, second and third.\n\n- Check for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major' (since the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so there's no need to check further permutations once a major is found). Similarly for minor.\n\nBut since the code needs to check all permutations to see if any of them meet the condition, perhaps we can loop through all permutations, and check for major or minor.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the three notes into a list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the list.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   x, y, z = permutation[0], permutation[1], permutation[2]\n\n   compute d1 = distance between x and y.\n\n   compute d2 = distance between y and z.\n\n   if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3 → major → return 'major'\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor → return 'minor'\n\nIf after checking all permutations none of them meet the conditions, return 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code would have to generate all permutations, check each.\n\nNow, the key is to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo, for two notes, say, a and b, their indices are a_idx and b_idx. Then distance is (b_idx - a_idx) % 12.\n\nWait, but earlier example:\n\nBetween B (10) and C# (1): (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 → which is 3. Which is correct. Because the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. Because B to C is 1, C to C# is 1, total 2? Wait, no. Wait, B is index 10, C is index 0, C# is index 1. So, from B (10) to C# (1): moving upwards, the distance is (1 - 10 + 12) = 3 semitones. Which is correct. Because B to C is 1, C to C# is 1, so total 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the distance between B and C is 1 semitone (since they are consecutive). Then between B and C# is 2 semitones. But according to the calculation, (1 - 10) mod 12 is 3. Hmm, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is 1 semitone. So, for example, between C (index 0) and C# (index 1), the distance is 1. Between C# (1) and D (2) is 1, etc. Between H (index 11) and C (0) is 1 semitone. So, the distance between two notes is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Which can be written as (y_index - x_index) % 12 if the result is positive, but in code, (y_index - x_index) % 12 will give the correct value. Let's test the example where x is B (10) and y is C# (1). So, (1 - 10) = -9. mod 12 is 3. But the actual distance between B and C# is 2 semitones. Because B to C is 1, C to C# is 1. So, total 2. But according to the formula, it's 3. That's a problem. So, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, this suggests that my formula is incorrect. So, why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is 1 semitone. So, between C and C#, it's 1. Between C and D is 2 semitones, etc. So, for example, the distance between B and C is 1 semitone. Between B and C# is 2 semitones. Between B and D is 3 semitones, etc.\n\nBut according to the formula (y_index - x_index) mod 12, when x is B (index 10) and y is C# (index 1), the formula gives (1 - 10) mod 12 = (-9) mod 12 = 3. Which would imply that the distance is 3 semitones. But according to the actual count, it's 2. So, the formula is wrong. What's the mistake here?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the way the distance is calculated. Because the index of the notes is ordered as C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So, B is index 10, H is index 11. Then, the next note after H is C again.\n\nSo, the distance between B (index 10) and C (index 0) is 1 semitone. Between B (10) and C# (index 1) is 2 semitones. So, the formula (y_index - x_index) mod 12 gives 1 - 10 = -9 mod 12 = 3. But actual distance is 2. So, the formula is wrong.\n\nSo, what is the correct way to calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nThe problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you have to move upward from X to reach Y. If X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X).\n\nSo, for example, between X = B (10) and Y = C# (1):\n\nX is higher than Y. So, the distance is (1 + 12 - 10) = 3. But according to the actual count, moving upward from B to C# is B -> C (1 semitone), C -> C# (another semitone), total 2. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the indices. Let me recheck the indices. Let me list all the notes and their indices:\n\nIndex 0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo, the next note after H (11) is C (0). So, the distance between B (10) and C (0) is 1 semitone. Between B (10) and C# (1) is 2 semitones. But according to the formula (Y - X) if Y >= X else (Y + 12 - X), which would be (1 - 10) is -9, so (1 + 12 - 10) = 3. Which contradicts the actual count of 2. So, this suggests that the formula is wrong.\n\nWait, this is very confusing. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the example of X = B (10) and Y = C (0). The distance between X and Y is 1 semitone. So, according to the formula, Y is lower than X. So, the distance is (Y + 12 - X) = 0 + 12 -10 = 2. Which is not correct. Because the correct distance is 1. So, this indicates that the formula is wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y upwards. So, if X is B (10), and Y is C (0), then moving upward from B to C is 1 semitone. But according to the formula (Y + 12 - X) would be 0 + 12 -10 = 2. Which is not correct. So, the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm. How to correctly calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nAlternative approach: the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index > X_index, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Wait, but for X = B (10), Y = C (0), Y_index is 0 < X_index 10. So, the distance would be (0 + 12 - 10) = 2. But the correct distance is 1. So, this is not working.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12. Let's try that.\n\nFor X = B (10), Y = C (0): (0 - 10 + 12) mod 12 = 2 mod 12 = 2. Which is still incorrect.\n\nBut the correct distance is 1. So, this suggests that the formula is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index >= X_index, else (Y_index - X_index + 12). But in this case, for X=10, Y=0: (0 - 10 + 12) = 2. Which is not correct. So why is this happening?\n\nLet me think of the actual positions. The notes are arranged in a circle of 12 steps. The distance between two notes is the minimal number of steps moving forward (clockwise) from X to Y. For example, between B (10) and C (0), moving forward is 1 step. Between B (10) and C# (1), moving forward is 2 steps. Between B (10) and D (2), 3 steps. So, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if we're considering the minimal steps. But that's not the case. Because for example, between X = C (0) and Y = H (11), the distance is 11 steps forward. But the minimal steps would be 11 steps forward, or 1 step backward (but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, it's the forward direction).\n\nBut the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when you go from the lower note to the upper note. Which implies that the distance is the minimal steps in the upward direction. But how to determine which note is lower?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem defines the distance between X and Y as the number of semitones between them when moving upward from X to Y. But that depends on the order of X and Y. For example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12) - X. But this seems to be the case. However, in our example of X=B (10) and Y=C (0), since X is higher than Y, the distance is (0 + 12) - 10 = 2. But the actual distance between B and C is 1 semitone. So this suggests that the formula is wrong.\n\nWait, but how is this possible? Let me think again. Let me imagine the circle of notes:\n\nThe notes are arranged in a circle with 12 positions. Each adjacent pair is one semitone apart. So, for example, moving from C (0) to C# (1) is +1, to D (2) is +2, etc. Moving from H (11) to C (0) is +1.\n\nSo, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you have to add to X to reach Y. So, if X is B (10), then adding 1 semitone brings you to C (0). So, the distance between B and C is 1. So, the formula should be (Y - X) mod 12 if the result is positive, otherwise (Y - X + 12). But in this case, Y - X = 0 - 10 = -10. mod 12 is 2. But the correct distance is 1. So this formula is not working.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is (Y - X) mod 12, but then the distance is the minimum between that and 12 - that. No, because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So, it's not the minimal steps. It's the number of steps when moving upward from the lower note to the upper.\n\nSo, the distance between X and Y is determined by which note is lower. For example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12) - X.\n\nBut how do I determine which note is lower? Well, the lower note is the one with the smaller index. Wait, no. Because if X is B (index 10) and Y is C (index 0), then Y is lower than X. Because the index is smaller. But in the circle, Y comes after X. So, the index doesn't directly indicate which is lower. Wait, this is the problem. How to determine which note is lower? Because the notes are arranged in a circle, there's no absolute lower note. But the problem defines that the distance between X and Y is from the lower to the upper. So, how to determine which is lower?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nSo, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. The distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So, the distance depends on the order of the notes. So, the distance is not symmetric. For example, the distance from X to Y is different from the distance from Y to X.\n\nSo, the distance between X and Y is defined as follows: if you have two notes X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones you have to move upward from X to reach Y. If Y is not higher than X, then you have to wrap around the circle.\n\nSo, for example, the distance from B to C is 1 semitone (since moving upward from B to C is one step). The distance from C to B is 11 semitones (because you have to move upward from C to B via H, G#, etc. which is 11 steps).\n\nSo, to calculate the distance between X and Y (from X to Y), it's (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index >= X_index, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). \n\nLet's test this formula for the example of X = B (10), Y = C (0). Y_index (0) < X_index (10). So, distance is 0 + 12 - 10 = 2. But according to the problem statement, the distance from B to C should be 1. So, this formula is giving 2 instead of 1. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12. Let's compute that. For X = B (10), Y = C (0): (0 -10 + 12) = 2. Which is the same as before. But according to the problem, the distance from B to C is 1. So, this formula is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in how the distance is calculated. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nThe distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\n\nSo, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Which makes sense because C to D is 1, D to D# is 2, D# to E is 3? No, wait. Wait, C to E is four semitones. Let's count:\n\nC to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4. Yes. So, that's four semitones. So, the formula for the distance between X and Y (when X is lower than Y) is Y - X.\n\nNow, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. How does that work? Because E is higher than C. So, the distance from E to C is measured as the number of semitones from E to C when moving upward. Wait, but how can you move upward from E to C? You have to go around the circle. So, the distance from E to C is (C's index + 12 - E's index)? Let's see.\n\nE is index 4. C is index 0. So, the formula would be 0 + 12 - 4 = 8. Which matches the example. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the formula for the distance from X to Y is:\n\nif Y is higher than X (i.e., Y_index > X_index), then Y_index - X_index.\n\nOtherwise, Y_index + 12 - X_index.\n\nBut in the case of X = B (index 10), Y = C (index 0), since Y_index (0) < X_index (10), the distance is 0 + 12 - 10 = 2. But according to the problem statement, the distance from B to C is 1. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, what is the index of B? Let me check the note_order again.\n\nThe note_order is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo, index 10 is B, index 11 is H. Then, the next note after H is C (index 0).\n\nSo, moving upward from B (10) to C (0) is one semitone. So, the distance should be 1. But according to the formula, it's 0 + 12 - 10 = 2. So, why?\n\nAh! Because the formula assumes that Y is the next note after X, but in this case, Y is the next note after H. Wait, no. The index of C is 0. The index of B is 10. So, the next note after B is C (0). So, the distance between B and C is 1 semitone. But according to the formula, it's 0 + 12 - 10 = 2. So, what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh wait, I think I see the problem. The formula is for when Y is not higher than X. But in this case, Y (C) is not higher than X (B)? No, in terms of the circular arrangement, C is higher than B. But in terms of indices, B is 10, C is 0. So, the formula considers Y to be lower than X, but in reality, Y is higher than X in the musical scale.\n\nSo, the formula is based on the indices, but that's not the correct way to determine which note is higher. Because the indices are in a circular manner. So, comparing the indices directly is not sufficient to determine which note is higher.\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. How to determine if Y is higher than X. Because in the circular arrangement, the notion of \"higher\" is ambiguous unless we define it based on the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines the order as follows: the notes are ordered in the sequence given. So, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So, any note that appears earlier in the list is considered lower than those that appear later. So, for example, C is lower than C#, which is lower than D, etc. H is the highest note, and then it wraps around to C again.\n\nIn that case, the distance from X to Y is computed as follows: if Y comes after X in the list, then it's Y_index - X_index. Otherwise, it's Y_index + 12 - X_index.\n\nSo, for example, X is B (index 10), Y is C (index 0). Since Y is not after X in the list (C is before B in the list?), no. Wait, the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So, B is at index 10, and H is at index 11. Then, C is at index 0. So, in the list, C comes after H. So, in terms of the order, C is considered to be higher than H, and H is higher than B. So, in this case, Y (C) is not after X (B) in the list. Because B is at index 10, and C is at index 0. So, the formula would calculate the distance as Y_index + 12 - X_index = 0 + 12 - 10 = 2. But according to the problem statement, the distance from B to C is 1 semitone. This suggests that the formula is wrong.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's see: C is index 0, E is index 4. So, ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad (three musical notes) is a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor chord based on the semitone distances between the notes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in the sequence of 12 musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the number of semitones when moving upward from the first note to the second. If the second note comes after the first in the sequence, the distance is simply the difference in indices. Otherwise, it wraps around using modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor chords:\n   - A **major** chord has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second notes, and 3 semitones between the second and third notes.\n   - A **minor** chord has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second notes, and 4 semitones between the second and third notes.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the major or minor criteria, return the corresponding result. If none do, return \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the order of notes and their corresponding indices\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(x, y):\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    # Calculate the distance from x to y\n    if y_idx > x_idx:\n        return y_idx - x_idx\n    else:\n        return y_idx + 12 - x_idx\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    # Generate all permutations of the three notes\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return \"major\"\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\n# Classify and print the result\nprint(classify_chord(input_notes))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each musical note to its position in the sequence of 12 notes, facilitating quick lookups.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function computes the semitone distance between two notes by checking their positions in the sequence and adjusting for wrap-around if necessary.\n- **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the input notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks all permutations (6 permutations for 3 notes) and uses direct lookups for distances, ensuring optimal performance for the problem constraints.",
