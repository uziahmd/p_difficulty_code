The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the movement. For example, if she is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at a_i, how much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the road is a ring, moving clockwise. So the distance between current_pos and a_i can be calculated as (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, if current_pos is 1 and a_i is 3, then moving clockwise takes 2 steps. If current_pos is 3 and a_i is 1, then moving clockwise would take (n - 3 + 1) steps? Like for n=4, 3 to 1 is 2 steps (3→4→1). So the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next + n - current). Which can be written as (next - current) if next >= current else (next + n - current). Alternatively, (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is smaller than current, then (next - current) is negative. For example, current is 3, next is 1. (1-3) is -2. Mod n (say 4) would be 2. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) if positive, else (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current) % n if we take modulo n. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results. So for example, (1-3) %4 is 2. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, when next is larger than current, (next - current) is positive, mod n is same as the difference. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, for example, if current is 3, next is 2. Then the distance is 1 (since moving clockwise from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2? No, wait, no. Wait, the movement is clockwise. So from 3, moving clockwise to 2? That's not possible. Wait, the ringroad is arranged so that moving clockwise, the houses are 1 → 2 → 3 → ... → n → 1. So moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around. So the distance between 3 and 2 is (n -3 + 1) steps? For example, n=4, 3 to 2: 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (2 -3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n. So that's the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in the order given, compute the distance from the current position to the a_i, add that to the total time, then update current position to a_i.\n\nWait, but the tasks may have consecutive same a_i's. For example, if the tasks are [3, 3], then moving from 3 to 3 takes zero time. So that's handled automatically by the formula.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the distance is zero. So adding that to total time is correct.\n\nSo that's the plan. Let's test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nLet's process each step:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. distance is (3",
