The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. How long does that take? From 1 to 3 clockwise. Since it's a ring of 4 houses, moving clockwise from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2 clockwise, she has to go all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then task 2 is done. Then task 3 is at 3. She's at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the time needed to move from her current position to the next task's position, for each task in order.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two positions. Suppose Xenia is currently at position curr, and the next task is at position next. Since the road is a ring, there are two possible paths. But since movement is only allowed clockwise, the time taken is the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is only allowed clockwise. So the time between curr and next is (next - curr) mod n? Wait, not exactly. Let's think:\n\nIf curr is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house ring. Moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require moving 3 →4 →1 →2. Which is 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + n) % n. For example, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 gives 3. So yes, the formula is (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Which can be written as (next - curr) % n if we take the modulo properly. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results. Let me check:\n\nFor example, (2-3) is -1. -1 % 4 is 3, which is correct. So the time between curr and next is (next - curr) % n. But wait, if curr is 3 and next is 3, then the time is zero. So for each consecutive tasks, we need to calculate the distance from current position to the next task's position, add that to the total time, and then update current position to next.\n\nBut the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the time between them is zero. So, the code should process each task in order, and for each task, calculate the distance from the previous position to the current task's position, add that to the total, and then update the previous position.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1 (since she starts here).\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n    calculate the distance from current_position to a_i, which is (a_i - current_position) % n if the movement is clockwise. Wait, but wait, the movement is clockwise. So, for example, if current is 3 and next is 2, the distance is (2 -3 +n) mod n? Or (next - current) mod n?\n\nYes. For example, when current is 3, next is 2. The distance is (2 -3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So the formula (next - current) % n gives the correct",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as given.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house for the task. Since movement is only allowed clockwise, we use modular arithmetic to compute the shortest path.\n3. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each movement between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_house in a:\n    diff = (next_house - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = next_house\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: For each task, the time to move from the current house to the next task's house is calculated using `(next_house - current) % n`. This ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Accumulation**: The total time is accumulated by summing the time taken for each move between consecutive tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each task in sequence, ensuring that the total time is computed optimally using modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraints. The overall time complexity is O(m), which is efficient given the problem constraints.",
