On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe original array consists of 1s and 2s. The problem allows me to reverse any subarray [l, r], and then compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the modified array. My goal is to find the maximum possible LNDS length over all possible choices of [l, r].\n\nFirst, let's think about the original LNDS. For example, if the array is already non-decreasing, then reversing any subarray would not improve it. But if there are some inversions, maybe reversing a part can help.\n\nBut trying all possible subarrays to reverse and compute the LNDS for each is going to be O(n^2 * n) which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the properties of the array. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed by counting the number of 1s and 2s, but with their order. However, when you reverse a subarray, you might be able to fix some transitions between 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, the longest non-decreasing subsequence for an array of 1s and 2s is simply the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, no. Actually, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not right. Wait, for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 (the whole array is non-decreasing? No, because 2 followed by 1 is a decrease. Oh wait, the LNDS here would be 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). Wait, but in the first example, after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is 4. So the maximum possible for that case is 4.\n\nSo the key is that the optimal reversal would allow as many 1s as possible followed by 2s. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding the best way to reverse a segment to maximize the number of 1s before the 2s.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say the original array has some 1s and 2s. The LNDS of the original array is the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, but that's not exactly correct. Because even if there are more 1s, if they are scattered among 2s, the LNDS could be smaller. Wait, but for an array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1. Wait, no. Maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in an array of 1s and 2s is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 1s (if we take all 1s, ignoring the 2s), or\n- The number of 2s (if we take all 2s, ignoring the 1s), or\n- The number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, no. For example, consider the array [1, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS is 3 (like 1, 2, 2). But the total number of 1s is 2, 2s is 2. So the maximum is 3. Which is more than the count of either. So my previous idea is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum number of elements in a sequence that is non-decreasing. Since 1 ≤ 2, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s and 2s arranged in non-decreasing order. Which would be the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the length of the longest possible sequence that is non-decreasing. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be found by counting the number of 1s and the number of 2s, and then considering the transitions between them. For example, the LNDS can be the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the array as a series of 1s and 2s. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the elements can be 1s and 2s, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the count of 1s, count of 2s, or the count of 1s up to some point plus the count of 2s from that point onward.\n\nAh! For example, the LNDS can be calculated as follows: find the maximum value of (number of 1s up to index i) + (number of 2s from index i onwards) for all i. Because that would represent taking all 1s up to i and all 2s from i onwards. That seems promising. Let me test this with some examples.\n\nTake the first example: [1,2,1,2]. The original array. Let's compute for each i:\n\ni=0 (before first element): 0 (number of 1s up to i) + (number of 2s from i onwards) = 0 + 3 (since there are 3 2s in positions 1,3, etc.)? Wait, maybe I need to think of i as the split point between 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, for the array [1,2,1,2], the number of 1s is 2, 2s is 2. Let's compute for each possible split point:\n\nFor split at position 0 (before the first element), all elements are 2s. So 0 + 2 = 2?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to think of the split as between elements. For example, the split can be between elements, and the maximum is the number of 1s before the split plus the number of 2s after the split. So for each possible split between elements, compute the sum.\n\nLet me think for the array [1,2,1,2]. The splits are between elements 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4.\n\nSplit after 0 elements (all elements are 2s? No, the split is between elements. Let me think of split positions as 0 to n. For split position k, the first part is elements 0..k-1, and the second part is k..n-1.\n\nSo for split position k, the number of 1s in first part plus the number of 2s in the second part.\n\nSo for the array [1,2,1,2], the split positions are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAt split 0: first part is empty (0 1s), second part is all elements (number of 2s is 2). Total is 0+2=2.\n\nSplit 1: first part is [1], 1s count is 1. Second part is [2,1,2], 2s count is 2. Total 1+2=3.\n\nSplit 2: first part is [1,2], 1s count is 1. Second part is [1,2], 2s count is 1. Total 1+1=2.\n\nSplit 3: first part is [1,2,1], 1s count is 2. Second part is [2], 2s count is 1. Total 2+1=3.\n\nSplit 4: first part is entire array, 1s count 2. Second part is empty. Total 2+0=2.\n\nThe maximum of these is 3. Which matches the LNDS of the original array (which is 3). However, when you reverse the [2,3] part (elements 2 and 3, indices 1 and 2?), making the array [1,1,2,2], then the LNDS is 4. Which would be the maximum of (split positions) for that array. For that array, the splits would give:\n\nsplit 0: 0 + 2 (all 2s) → 2.\n\nsplit 1: 1 (number of 1s in first part) + 2 (number of 2s in second part) → 1+2=3.\n\nsplit 2: 2 (number of 1s in first two elements) + 2 (number of 2s in second part) → 2+2=4. That's the max.\n\nSo yes, the maximum of that calculation gives the LNDS. Therefore, the LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is equal to the maximum of (number of 1s up to split k) + (number of 2s from split k onwards) for all possible splits k (from 0 to n).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: find the best subarray to reverse such that this maximum value is maximized.\n\nNow, the question is, how does reversing a subarray affect this value?\n\nLet me think. When you reverse a subarray, the elements inside that subarray are reversed. However, the rest of the array remains the same. How does this affect the counts of 1s and 2s in different splits?\n\nBut since the maximum is calculated as the maximum over all splits, perhaps we can model the effect of reversing a subarray on this maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each possible reversal, what is the maximum split value, and then choose the maximum over all possible reversals.\n\nBut with n up to 2000, trying all possible subarrays (O(n^2)) and for each, calculating the maximum split (O(n)) would be O(n^3) which is 8e9 operations for n=2000. That's way too slow.\n\nWe need a better approach.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that the original maximum is the maximum of (count_1s_before_k + count_2s_after_k) for all k. Now, when we reverse a subarray [l, r], how can this affect the maximum value?\n\nReversing [l, r] will swap the elements in that range. So, for example, any 1s and 2s in that range are flipped. However, the rest of the array remains the same.\n\nBut how can this affect the split points? For example, if the split is before l, after r, or within the reversed subarray.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal reversal is one that increases the number of 1s in some prefix and 2s in some suffix. For example, if there is a segment with more 2s followed by 1s, reversing it would turn those into 1s followed by 2s, which could help.\n\nLet me think of the problem as trying to find a segment [l, r] such that when reversed, the number of 1s in the prefix up to some split point plus the number of 2s in the suffix after that split point is maximized.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's precompute for the original array the count of 1s up to each position, and the count of 2s from each position onwards. Then, for any reversal [l, r], we can compute how the counts change for splits in different regions.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me denote the original array as a. After reversing [l, r], the new array is a' where a'[i] = a[l + r - i] for i in [l, r], and a'[i] = a[i] otherwise.\n\nNow, for any split point k, the value of count_1s_before_k + count_2s_after_k depends on the original counts, modified by the reversal in [l, r].\n\nBut how can I compute this efficiently for all possible [l, r]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible value is achieved by considering all possible ways of merging some 1s and 2s in the array. For example, the optimal reversal could be one that turns a segment with more 2s followed by 1s into a segment with 1s followed by 2s, thereby increasing the count of 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nLet me think about the original maximum. Suppose the original maximum is M. How can reversing a segment increase M?\n\nThe maximum M is determined by the best split. Let's imagine that the best split is between some positions. Reversing a segment may allow us to have more 1s in the prefix and/or more 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut how to find the best reversal?\n\nAnother idea: The maximum possible value of M after reversal is the original M plus the maximum possible gain from reversing a segment.\n\nWhat is the gain from reversing a segment [l, r]?\n\nSuppose that in the original array, the segment [l, r] contains x 1s and y 2s. After reversing, the number of 1s and 2s in the segment remains the same. However, the arrangement changes. So the effect of reversing [l, r] on the split points that cross this segment.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the split points that pass through the reversed segment. For example, suppose that the split is at position k, which is in the middle of the reversed segment. How does the count_1s_before_k and count_2s_after_k change?\n\nThis seems complex. But perhaps we can find that the best way to increase M is to find a segment [l, r] that has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing it would turn those into 1s followed by 2s, which could contribute more to the split.\n\nLet me think of the original array's transitions. For example, in the original array, if there is a segment where there are m 2s followed by n 1s, then reversing that segment would turn it into n 1s followed by m 2s. This would allow that segment to contribute more to the split points that pass through it.\n\nSo, for example, if there is a segment with 2s followed by 1s, reversing it would increase the number of 1s before the split and the number of 2s after the split for certain splits.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the best possible scenario. What is the maximum possible M that can be achieved? Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the maximum possible M is the total number of elements (if the array is non-decreasing) or something close to that.\n\nSo, the maximum possible M is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, which is n. But that's only possible if the array is non-decreasing. If the array is not, then perhaps by reversing a segment, we can make it non-decreasing.\n\nBut how to find such a segment?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say there are c1 1s and c2 2s. The maximum possible M is min(c1 + c2, ...). Well, c1 + c2 is n. So the maximum possible M is n. But only if the array can be made non-decreasing by reversing a segment. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo, for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the original M is 3. But by reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing, so M is 4.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding whether there exists a reversal that makes the array non-decreasing. If yes, then the answer is n. Otherwise, find the maximum M achievable.\n\nBut how to check if such a reversal exists?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum M can be achieved by considering the following:\n\nThe maximum M is equal to the original maximum plus the maximum number of \"bad\" transitions that can be fixed by reversing a segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's consider that after reversing a segment [l, r], the array can be viewed as three parts:\n\n- The part before l (unchanged)\n- The reversed segment [l, r]\n- The part after r (unchanged)\n\nThe reversed segment [l, r] will now be a reversed version of the original. Let's say that in the original segment, there are some 1s and 2s. Reversing them doesn't change their counts, but their order.\n\nSo, for the maximum split calculation, the best split may involve:\n\n- A split before l, so that the entire reversed segment is part of the suffix. In this case, the number of 2s in the suffix would be increased if the reversed segment has more 2s than before.\n\nWait, no. The reversed segment's contents are the same as before, just reversed. So the count of 1s and 2s in the entire array remains the same. Thus, the total number of 1s and 2s is fixed. However, the way they are arranged can affect the split.\n\nBut the maximum M is determined by the best split. So, the maximum M is the maximum over all splits of (number of 1s before split) + (number of 2s after split). The total number of 1s before split plus the number of 2s after split can be rewritten as (total number of 1s) + (number of 2s after split) - (number of 1s after split) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet total_ones = total number of 1s in the array.\n\nLet total_twos = total number of 2s in the array.\n\nFor any split k, the number of 1s before k is c1, and the number of 2s after k is c2. So the value is c1 + c2.\n\nBut the total number of 2s after k is total_twos - (number of 2s before k). So, the value c1 + c2 = c1 + (total_twos - (number of 2s before k)).\n\nBut c1 is the number of 1s before k. The number of 1s before k plus the number of 2s before k is equal to k (assuming the array is 0-based, but depends on the exact definition). So, the value becomes:\n\nc1 + (total_twos - (k - c1)) ) ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, the number of 1s before k is c1, the number of 2s before k is (k - c1). So the number of 2s after k is total_twos - (k - c1). So the value is c1 + (total_twos - (k - c1)) = c1 + total_twos -k + c1 = 2*c1 + total_twos -k.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, the maximum value of c1 + c2 can be rewritten as (total_ones + total_twos) - (number of 1s after k + number of 2s before k). Because:\n\nc1 + c2 = (number of 1s before k) + (number of 2s after k) \n\nBut the total number of elements is n. The number of 1s after k is total_ones - c1. The number of 2s before k is (number of elements before k) - c1 = k - c1. So:\n\nc1 + c2 = total_ones + total_twos - ( (total_ones - c1) + (k - c1) )\n\nWhich simplifies to n - (total_ones - c1 + k - c1) = n - (total_ones + k - 2c1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of 1s and 2s is fixed, the maximum of c1 + c2 is equivalent to the minimum of (number of 1s after k + number of 2s before k).\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum value of c1 + c2 is the same as the maximum of (number of 1s before k) + (number of 2s after k).\n\nNow, back to the problem. How can reversing a segment [l, r] affect this value?\n\nLet me imagine that the reversed segment [l, r] has some 1s and 2s. Reversing it changes the order of elements in this segment, but not their counts.\n\nBut the way they are ordered could allow for better splits. For example, if the original segment had some 2s followed by 1s, reversing it would make it 1s followed by 2s. This could help for splits that cross this segment.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a segment [l, r] such that, after reversing, the maximum value of (number of 1s before k) + (number of 2s after k) is maximized.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each possible segment [l, r], compute the maximum possible value of (number of 1s before k) + (number of 2s after k) for all k. Then take the maximum over all [l, r].\n\nBut again, for n=2000, this is O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: The maximum value after reversing a segment [l, r] is equal to the original maximum plus the maximum possible improvement from reversing [l, r]. So, perhaps we can find the best possible [l, r] that provides the maximum improvement.\n\nBut how to find this improvement?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let me precompute for each position the prefix sums of 1s and 2s. Let's define:\n\nprefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in the first i elements (from 0 to i-1).\n\nSimilarly, prefix_twos[i] = number of 2s in the first i elements.\n\nThen, the number of 1s before k is prefix_ones[k], and the number of 2s after k is total_twos - prefix_twos[k].\n\nSo the original maximum is max over k of (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k])).\n\nNow, when we reverse [l, r], the array changes in that segment. How does this affect the prefix_ones and prefix_twos?\n\nLet me think about how reversing [l, r] affects the prefix_ones and prefix_twos for various k.\n\nFor k < l: the prefix_ones[k] remains the same. Similarly for k > r: the prefix_ones[k] is the same as before, except for the elements in [l, r]. Wait, no. For k < l: the prefix_ones[k] is unchanged. For k between l and r: the elements in the segment [l, r] are reversed. For k >= r: the prefix_ones[k] is the original prefix_ones[k] minus the number of 1s in the original [l, r] segment, plus the number of 1s in the reversed segment up to position k. But since the reversed segment has the same number of 1s as the original, this would be the same as before. So, for k >= r, the prefix_ones[k] is the same as before. Wait, no. Because the elements in the segment [l, r] are reversed. For example, if the original segment has a 1 at position l and a 2 at position r, after reversing, the element at position l is 2 and at position r is 1. So, the prefix_ones for positions between l and r may change.\n\nBut this seems very complicated to model. Perhaps there's a way to find the best possible [l, r] that contributes to the maximum value.\n\nLet me think of the following: the maximum possible value after reversing [l, r] is the original maximum plus the gain from that reversal. The gain can be calculated as follows:\n\nWhen you reverse [l, r], the number of 1s in the segment is the same, but the way they are arranged can allow for better splits. The maximum gain would be achieved by finding a segment that has as many 2s followed by 1s as possible, because reversing it would turn those into 1s followed by 2s, which can help in splits that pass through that segment.\n\nLet me think of the following: the best gain comes from finding a segment [l, r] where the number of 2s in the original segment followed by 1s is maximized. For example, if the segment has x 2s followed by y 1s, then reversing it would add (y) 1s to the beginning of the segment and (x) 2s to the end. This could contribute to splits that occur before the segment (increasing the number of 1s before the split) and splits that occur after the segment (increasing the number of 2s after the split).\n\nBut how to quantify this?\n\nAnother approach: the maximum value after reversing [l, r] is equal to the original maximum plus the difference between the number of 1s in the reversed segment that are now before the split and the original number, plus the difference between the number of 2s after the split and the original number.\n\nBut again, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that after reversing [l, r], the best split can be either:\n\n1. Completely outside the reversed segment. In this case, the value is the same as the original maximum.\n\n2. Crossing the reversed segment. In this case, the value could be improved.\n\nSo, the maximum gain must come from splits that cross the reversed segment. So, perhaps we can focus on finding the best [l, r] and the best split that crosses it.\n\nLet me think of splits that cross [l, r]. For example, splits that are before l, inside [l, r], or after r.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given segment [l, r], the maximum possible contribution to the split value would be when the split is at l (so the entire reversed segment is in the suffix) or at r (entire reversed segment is in the prefix). Or somewhere inside the segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose the original segment [l, r] has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing it makes it 1s followed by 2s. This would allow for a split that is at the end of the segment, where the 1s are in the prefix and the 2s are in the suffix. Thus, this would increase the count of 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nSo for this segment, the maximum gain would be the number of 1s in the reversed segment (which is the same as the original) plus the number of 2s in the reversed segment. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe original segment has x 1s and y 2s. After reversing, the number of 1s and 2s is still x and y. However, if the original segment had a lot of 2s followed by 1s, then after reversing, the segment has 1s followed by 2s. So, for splits that are at the end of the segment (split after r), the number of 1s in the prefix (up to r) would be the original count of 1s up to l-1 plus the x 1s in the reversed segment. And the number of 2s after split r is the original count of 2s after r. But this may not be better than before.\n\nAlternatively, for splits that are inside the segment, like splitting between l and r. For example, if the split is at position k, which is inside [l, r], then after reversing the segment, the number of 1s before k and the number of 2s after k may be improved.\n\nBut this seems too vague to model.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the following: the maximum possible value of M after reversing any segment [l, r] is the original maximum plus the maximum of (number of 1s in the reversed segment that are now before some split point) minus (original number of 1s before that split point) plus (number of 2s after some split point in the reversed segment) minus (original number of 2s after that split point).\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me think about the original array's maximum M. It's the maximum over all splits of (number of 1s before split) + (number of 2s after split).\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the new array's maximum M' is the maximum of:\n\n- The original maximum (if the split doesn't cross [l, r]).\n\n- Or, for splits that cross [l, r], the new values based on the reversed segment.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me imagine that for the reversed segment [l, r], I can calculate for each possible split that crosses it, what the new value would be.\n\nFor example, consider a split at position k, where k is between l and r. Before reversing, the split k would have some value. After reversing, the elements from l to r are reversed. So, the number of 1s before k and the number of 2s after k would depend on how the reversed segment is structured.\n\nBut to compute this for all possible [l, r] and splits k is expensive.\n\nBut perhaps I can find that the best possible gain is achieved when I reverse a segment that has as many 2s as possible followed by as many 1s as possible. For example, the segment with the maximum number of 2s followed by 1s.\n\nLet me think of this: for each possible pair of positions i and j (i < j), where a[i] = 2 and a[j] = 1, and all elements between i and j are 2s and 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. The gain from this would be the number of 2s in the segment followed by 1s.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the original array. Let's find for all possible pairs of positions (i, j), where i <= j, the number of 2s in the segment [i, j] that are followed by 1s in the same segment. Reversing this segment would turn these into 1s followed by 2s, thus improving the maximum M.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following: the maximum possible M after any reversal is equal to the original maximum M plus the maximum number of 2s followed by 1s in any segment [l, r], because reversing that segment would convert those into 1s followed by 2s, which would contribute to the split value.\n\nBut how to calculate this?\n\nLet me define for each segment [l, r], the number of inversions in it, which is the number of pairs (i, j) in [l, r] where i < j and a[i] = 2 and a[j] = 1. Reversing this segment would eliminate these inversions, potentially increasing the M.\n\nBut how to relate this to the M value?\n\nMaybe not directly.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the maximum M after reversal is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the array. So, the best scenario is to have as many 1s as possible at the beginning and as many 2s as possible at the end.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a segment [l, r] to reverse such that after reversing, the number of 1s before some split point plus the number of 2s after that split point is maximized.\n\nLet me think about the following: the best possible scenario is to have all the 1s in the array followed by all the 2s. In this case, the M would be n. So, if the array can be transformed into such a configuration by reversing a single segment, then the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, the answer is the maximum between the original M and some other value.\n\nHow can we check if such a transformation is possible?\n\nWell, the array can be transformed into all 1s followed by all 2s if there exists a segment [l, r] such that reversing it results in this configuration. This would happen if the original array has a segment that is a mix of 2s and 1s, and reversing it would make it all 1s followed by 2s.\n\nFor example, if the original array is [1, 2, 1, 2], then reversing the segment [2, 3] (the 2 and 1) gives [1, 1, 2, 2], which is all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\nSo, how to find such segments?\n\nThe number of 1s and 2s in the array is fixed. Let's say there are c1 1s and c2 2s. The ideal array would have c1 1s followed by c2 2s. To achieve this, the original array must have a segment that can be reversed to make this happen.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Suppose there is a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. If the rest of the array already has 1s before this segment and 2s after, then this would contribute to the overall configuration.\n\nBut how to find the best such segment?\n\nLet me think of the following: find the first occurrence of a 2 that is followed by a 1. Reversing the segment from this 2 to the next 1 would help. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider all possible ways to split the array into a prefix of 1s and a suffix of 2s. The maximum M would be c1 + c2 = n. To achieve this, the array must be transformable into such a configuration via a single reversal.\n\nSo, for example, if the original array has a segment that is a mix of 1s and 2s, and reversing it would turn it into a block of 1s followed by 2s, then this would allow the entire array to be non-decreasing.\n\nTo find this, we can look for the earliest position where a 2 appears before a 1. For example, in the array [1, 2, 1, 2], the first 2 is at position 1, followed by a 1 at position 2. Reversing the segment from 1 to 2 gives [1, 1, 2, 2], which is the desired configuration.\n\nSo, the maximum possible M is n if such a segment exists. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is:\n\n- Compute the original maximum M.\n\n- Check if there exists a segment [l, r] that, when reversed, makes the array non-decreasing. If yes, return n.\n\n- Else, return the original maximum M or some other value.\n\nBut how to check if such a segment exists?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the array is non-decreasing if and only if all 1s come before all 2s.\n\nSo, the array can be transformed into this form by reversing a single segment if and only if there exists a segment that contains all the transitions from 2 to 1.\n\nLet me think of the following: the array has some number of 1s and 2s. The ideal array is all 1s followed by all 2s. The original array may have some 2s followed by 1s. To make it all 1s followed by 2s, we need to reverse a segment that contains all these 2s followed by 1s.\n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]. The transitions from 2 to 1 are at position 2 (element 2 is 2, next is 1). Reversing the segment from position 2 to 3 would give [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], which doesn't help. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the segment that contains all the 2s followed by 1s. For example, if the array has some 2s followed by some 1s, and then followed by 2s again, then reversing the segment that contains the 2s and 1s might not help.\n\nThis suggests that checking for the existence of such a segment is non-trivial.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to find if the array can be made non-decreasing by reversing a single segment, I should focus on calculating the maximum M, which is the original maximum plus the best possible gain from reversing a segment.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help align more 1s before 2s, which maximizes the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Counts**: Precompute prefix sums for the number of 1s and 2s up to each position. This helps in quickly determining the count of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n2. **Original Maximum LNDS**: Calculate the maximum LNDS for the original array using the precomputed prefix sums.\n3. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, evaluate how it affects the LNDS by considering the contribution of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment.
