    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, perhaps 0s can move past 1s and 2s? Wait, not exactly. Because if you have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, maybe you can move them around?\n\nWait, for example, suppose I have 0 and 2 with a 1 in between. Let's say \"012\". Can I swap the 0 and 1 first, making it \"102\", then swap the 0 and 2? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So that's not allowed. So the 0 can't move past the 2 unless there's a 1 in between. Wait, but maybe there's a way to move the 0 past the 2 via some steps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s can be moved to the left of 1s, and 1s can be moved to the left of 2s. But 0s can't be moved past 2s. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 1 between them, perhaps you can move the 0 to the right of the 1 and the 2 to the left of the 1? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"02\". We can't swap them. So they stay as \"02\". If the string is \"012\", can we arrange them as \"021\"? Let's see. The original is 0,1,2. We can swap 1 and 2 first to get 0,2,1. Then, can we swap the 0 and 2? No. So the 0 can't move past the 2. So the final arrangement would be 0,2,1. But if we had \"012\", maybe we can't get the 0 to move past the 2. So the 0 can't be moved past 2s. So the relative order between 0s and 2s is fixed? Because you can't swap them directly, and you can't move them through 1s?\n\nWait, but if there's a 1 between them, maybe you can move the 0 to the right of the 1 and the 2 to the left of the 1. For example, let's say the string is \"0 1 2\". Let's think: the 0 can swap with the 1, so we can get \"1 0 2\". Then, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But the 0 can't move further. Alternatively, the 1 and 2 can be swapped to get \"0 2 1\". So in this case, the 0 is before the 2. But the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So the conclusion is that the 0s can be arranged among themselves and with 1s, and the 1s can be arranged among themselves and with 2s, but 0s and 2s can't be swapped. Therefore, the relative positions of 0s and 2s are fixed. Wait, but that's not entirely correct. Because if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe you can move the 0 to the right of the 1 and the 2 to the left of the 1. Wait, but how?\n\nAnother example: \"0 1 2\" → can we get \"0 2 1\"? Yes, by swapping the 1 and 2. But the 0 is still before the 2. So the 0 can't move past the 2. But if the string is \"2 1 0\", can we get \"0 1 2\"? Well, the 2 and 1 can be swapped to make \"1 2 0\", then the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the 0 can't move past the 2. So in this case, the 0 can't be moved to the front. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. That is, any 0 that comes before a 2 in the original string will remain before it in the final string. Similarly, any 2 that comes before a 0 in the original string will remain before it. Wait, but how can that be?\n\nWait, suppose the original string is \"2 0\". Then, since we can't swap them, the string remains \"20\". So the 0 can't move past the 2. But if the original string is \"0 2\", the 0 can't move past the 2 either. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So the 0s and 2s can't be reordered with respect to each other. So, the problem reduces to:\n\nWe can arrange the 0s and 1s in any order (as long as their relative positions are adjusted via swaps between 0 and 1), and arrange the 1s and 2s in any order (as long as their relative positions are adjusted via swaps between 1 and 2). But the 0s and 2s cannot be swapped. So the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. So, for example, if in the original string, a 0 comes before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 will still come before that 2. Similarly for 2s before 0s.\n\nSo the approach is: the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. The 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. Wait no. Wait, the 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s? Because 1 can be swapped with 0 and with 2. So for example, if you have a 0, then a 1, then a 2, you can move the 1 to the left of the 0 or to the right of the 2. Wait, but the 0 can't move past the 2. But the 1 can be moved between them. So the 1s can be placed anywhere, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the 0s and 2s can't be swapped, but the 1s can be moved freely between them. So for example, the original string is \"0 2\". Then, the 1s can't be inserted between them, but if there's a 1 in the string, it can be moved to between the 0 and the 2. But the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 1s can be arranged in any order, but the 0s and 2s can't be rearranged with each other.\n\nTherefore, the problem becomes: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but insert the 1s in between them in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think again.\n\nThe allowed swaps allow us to sort the 0s and 1s among themselves, and the 1s and 2s among themselves. However, since the 0s and 2s can't be swapped, their relative order is fixed. So the 0s and 2s can be thought of as fixed in their positions, but the 1s can be moved around.\n\nWait, no. For example, consider the string \"0 2 1\". The 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? Let's see. The original string is \"0 2 1\". We can swap the 2 and 1 (since they are adjacent) to get \"0 1 2\". Then, the 0 and 1 can be swapped to get \"1 0 2\". So now the 1 is before the 0. But the 0 and 2's relative order was originally 0 before 2. Now, after moving the 1, the 0 is still before the 2. So the relative order of 0 and 2 hasn't changed. So even though the 1 has been moved around, the 0 and 2 are still in their original relative order.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 at position i and a 2 at position j where i < j, then in the final string, that 0 must still be before that 2. Similarly for any 2 before a 0 in the original string.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached as follows: we need to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. So, the way to get the minimal lex string is to arrange the 1s in the earliest possible positions, but considering the fixed 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Let's think of the original string as a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So for example, suppose the original string has some 0s and 2s. The 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s can't be reordered.\n\nSo the idea is to collect all the 0s and 2s, maintaining their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the process. For example, take the sample input \"100210\" which becomes \"001120\".\n\nOriginal string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThe 0s and 2s in the original string are:\n\nLooking at the original string: positions of 0s and 2s:\n\nIndices (assuming 0-based):\n\nOriginal characters:\n\nIndex 0: 1\n\nIndex 1: 0\n\nIndex 2: 0\n\nIndex 3: 2\n\nIndex 4: 1\n\nIndex 5: 0\n\nSo the 0s and 2s are at positions 1,2,3,5. Their values are 0,0,2,0. So the original order of 0s and 2s is [0,0,2,0]. So in the final string, these must appear in this order. The 1s can be placed in between them.\n\nSo the problem is to arrange the 1s in the positions between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed. How to do this optimally?\n\nThe minimal lex string would be achieved by placing as many 1s as possible to the left as possible, but considering that 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and a 2, between a 2 and a 0, etc.\n\nBut how to arrange them optimally?\n\nSince 1 is larger than 0 but smaller than 2, the optimal approach would be to place as many 1s as possible before the 2s, but after the 0s.\n\nWait, but the 0s and 2s are fixed. Let me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order, and the 1s can be inserted into the available positions.\n\nFor example, the fixed parts are the 0s and 2s. Let's imagine that the original string has some fixed elements. For example, the fixed elements are [0,0,2,0], and the 1s are [1,1].\n\nWe need to insert the 1s into the gaps between these fixed elements. The gaps are:\n\n- before the first fixed element,\n\n- between first and second fixed elements,\n\n- between second and third,\n\n- between third and fourth,\n\n- after the fourth.\n\nEach of these gaps can hold some number of 1s.\n\nBut since we want the lex smallest string, inserting the 1s as early as possible would be better. Because inserting a 1 earlier makes the string lex smaller than inserting it later. For example, inserting a 1 in the first gap (before the first fixed element) would make the string start with 1, which is worse than having 0s first. Wait, but that depends on the actual positions.\n\nWait, the fixed elements are the 0s and 2s. Let's take the example of the fixed elements being [0,0,2,0]. The 1s are [1,1]. How to insert them optimally.\n\nWe can insert the 1s in the gaps. But since 1 is larger than 0, but smaller than 2, inserting them in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without making the string worse.\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as blocks. Between each pair of consecutive blocks, we can insert the 1s.\n\nBut how to decide where to put the 1s. For example, inserting 1s before the first 0 would result in 1s followed by 0s. Which is worse than putting them after the 0s. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting the 1s before the 0s would make the string lex larger. Therefore, the optimal approach would be to insert the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they don't interfere with the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be inserted in any gaps. Let's think of the fixed elements as a sequence of elements, and the 1s can be placed in between them. To minimize the lex order, we need to arrange the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed, but only if that's better.\n\nBut how? Let's think of the following: the 1s can be placed in any of the gaps. But to minimize the lex order, we want to have as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible positions where they are allowed.\n\nBut wait, inserting a 1 in a gap between two fixed elements may be better than inserting it elsewhere. For example, inserting between a 0 and a 2 would allow the 1 to be between them. But inserting between a 0 and 2 would be better than inserting after the 2, because 1 is less than 2.\n\nWait, here's a way to think about it: the fixed elements are a sequence of 0s and 2s. Between these elements, the 1s can be placed. For example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting a 1 would create 0, 1, 2. Which is better than having the 0 followed by 2 and then inserting the 1 after the 2. Because 012 is better than 021.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible gaps where they can be placed, but taking into account that inserting them in certain gaps can lead to a better lex order.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: since the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order, the problem reduces to arranging the 1s in the entire string, but such that they are placed in between the 0s and 2s. However, the 1s can be ordered in any way, but since they are all 1s, their order doesn't matter. So the problem is to insert all the 1s into the gaps between the fixed elements (the 0s and 2s) in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\nBut how to choose which gaps to insert the 1s into?\n\nThe key insight here is that the 1s can be inserted into any of the gaps, and to minimize the lex order, we should insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps that are between elements where inserting 1s would not cause the string to be lex larger.\n\nLet's think of the fixed elements as a list. For example, fixed = [0, 0, 2, 0]. The gaps are:\n\ngap0: before the first element (fixed[0])\n\ngap1: between fixed[0] and fixed[1]\n\ngap2: between fixed[1] and fixed[2]\n\ngap3: between fixed[2] and fixed[3]\n\ngap4: after fixed[3]\n\nNow, inserting 1s into these gaps. For each gap, inserting the 1s there would contribute to the lex order. The question is, where to place the 1s to get the lex smallest string.\n\nThe lex order is determined by the earliest position where the strings differ. So, to minimize the lex order, we want to have as many 0s as possible in the earliest positions, then 1s, then 2s.\n\nSo, for the gaps:\n\n- gap0: inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s. But since the first fixed element is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So we should avoid inserting 1s here unless necessary.\n\n- gap1: between two 0s. Inserting 1s here would create 0,1,0. But since 1 is larger than 0, inserting 1s here would make the string lex larger. So perhaps we should not insert any 1s here. Wait, but maybe inserting them here allows us to have more 0s earlier?\n\nWait, for example, if we have two 0s next to each other. If we insert a 1 between them, the string would be 0,1,0. But that's worse than 0,0,1. So inserting the 1s between two 0s would be worse. So the best is to not insert any 1s in between two 0s.\n\nSimilarly, inserting between a 0 and a 2. For example, inserting 1s between 0 and 2 would make the string 0,1,2. Which is better than 0,2,1. Because 0 followed by 1 is better than 0 followed by 2. So inserting 1s here is better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nInserting between a 2 and a 0. For example, inserting 1s between 2 and 0 would give 2,1,0. Which is worse than 2,0,1. But since the 2 is already fixed, perhaps inserting 1s here is worse than inserting them before the 2. But since the 2 is fixed, perhaps inserting 1s between 2 and 0 is worse than inserting them before the 2.\n\nSo the strategy for inserting the 1s would be to insert them in the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause the lex order to increase. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think that the 1s can be placed in the positions where they are between a 0 and a 2, or between 0s and 2s, etc., but the optimal way is to have as many 1s as possible before the 2s and after the 0s.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let's think of the fixed elements as a list. For each gap between the fixed elements, we can decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\nThe key is that inserting a 1 into a gap that is between a 0 and a 2 (or between a 0 and a 2) is better than inserting it into a later gap.\n\nSo, the priority for inserting 1s is:\n\n- All gaps that are before any 2s. Because inserting 1s in those gaps would allow them to be before the 2s, which is better.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps are before the 2s.\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements. The fixed elements are a list of 0s and 2s. Let's process the fixed elements and for each position, determine whether inserting 1s in that gap would be beneficial.\n\nFor example, in the fixed elements, the earliest gaps that are between 0 and 2, or before any 2, are the best places to insert the 1s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Collect all the fixed elements (0s and 2s) in their original order.\n\n- Collect all the 1s in the original string.\n\n- Then, insert the 1s into the gaps between the fixed elements. The insertion order should be such that the 1s are placed in the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause the lex order to increase.\n\nBut how to decide which gaps to insert into.\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as a sequence. For each gap between the fixed elements, we can determine whether inserting 1s into that gap is better than inserting them into later gaps.\n\nFor example, inserting into a gap between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting into a gap after a 2. Because inserting 1s between 0 and 2 gives 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s.\n\nSimilarly, inserting into a gap between two 0s is worse than inserting into a gap between 0 and 2. Because inserting into between two 0s would have 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than 0 followed by 0 followed by 1s.\n\nSo the priority for inserting 1s is:\n\n- Insert into gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, or before any 2s, and after any 0s.\n\nBut how to find the optimal way.\n\nPerhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where they can be placed between a 0 and a 2, and then between 0s, and then between 2s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the fixed elements as a sequence. For each gap, determine the value of the previous fixed element and the next fixed element. For example:\n\ngap0: previous is nothing, next is fixed[0]\n\ngap1: previous is fixed[0], next is fixed[1]\n\ngap2: previous is fixed[1], next is fixed[2]\n\netc.\n\nFor each gap, inserting 1s here would be optimal if the previous element is 0 and the next is 2, or if the previous element is 0 and next is 0, or if the previous is 2 and next is 0, etc.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nAnother approach: since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the fixed elements, but we want to have as many 1s as possible before the 2s, and after the 0s.\n\nSo, for the fixed elements, we can split them into segments. For example, the fixed elements consist of a sequence of 0s and 2s. The 1s can be placed in between them. The optimal placement is to have all the 1s placed in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not make the string lex larger.\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as a sequence. Let's imagine that the fixed elements are processed from left to right. For each gap between two fixed elements, we can decide whether inserting the 1s here is better than inserting them later.\n\nFor example, between two 0s, inserting 1s would not be optimal. Between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s is optimal. Between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s is not optimal. Between two 2s, inserting 1s is not optimal.\n\nSo, the priority is to insert all the 1s into the earliest gaps that are between a 0 and a 2. Once those gaps are filled, insert into the gaps between 0s, then between 2s, etc.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s can be placed in the gaps where inserting them would not cause the string to be worse. For example, inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting them after the 2. So, for all such gaps between a 0 and a 2, we should insert as many 1s as possible. Then, for gaps between 0s, insert the remaining 1s. Then, for gaps between 2s, etc.\n\nSo here's the algorithm:\n\n1. Split the original string into two parts: the fixed elements (0s and 2s) in their original order, and the 1s.\n\n2. For the fixed elements, generate the list of gaps. For each gap, determine the type (previous and next elements).\n\n3. Iterate through the gaps in order, and insert as many 1s as possible into the gaps that are between 0 and 2 (i.e., where inserting 1s would help reduce the lex order), then between 0s, then between 2s, etc.\n\nWait, but how to prioritize the gaps.\n\nLet me think of the gaps in the order they appear. For each gap, we can decide whether inserting 1s here is better than inserting them later. For example, inserting into a gap that is between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting into a later gap. So, for each gap, we can calculate a priority. For example, the priority is based on the previous and next elements. The priority for inserting 1s into the gap is higher if the previous element is 0 and next is 2 (since inserting 1s here would allow them to be between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting them after the 2). Similarly, inserting between 0 and 0 is worse than inserting between 0 and 2. So, the priority for inserting 1s is:\n\n- Gaps that are between 0 and 2: highest priority.\n\n- Gaps that are between 0 and 0: lower priority than the above.\n\n- Gaps that are between 2 and 0: inserting here would be worse than inserting between 0 and 2. So lower priority.\n\n- Gaps that are between 2 and 2: lower priority.\n\n- Gaps that are before the first element (if it's 0): inserting here would be worse than inserting between 0 and 2.\n\n- Gaps that are after the last element (if it's 2): inserting here would be worse than inserting between 0 and 2.\n\nSo the idea is to process the gaps in order, and for each gap, insert as many 1s as possible if the gap is between 0 and 2. Then, for gaps that are between 0 and 0, insert the remaining 1s, then between 2 and 2, etc.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where they can be placed between 0 and 2. Once all those gaps are filled, insert the 1s into the earliest possible positions where they can be placed between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 2, etc.\n\nBut how to find those gaps.\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as a list. For example, fixed = [0, 0, 2, 0].\n\nThen, for each gap between consecutive elements, check if the previous element is 0 and the next element is 2. In this case, inserting 1s here is optimal.\n\nIn this example, the gaps between 0 (index 1) and 2 (index 2) is such a gap. So inserting all the 1s here would be best.\n\nBut also, the gap between the 2 and the 0 (gap3) is between 2 and 0. Inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them between 0 and 2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCollect all the gaps that are between 0 and 2, and insert the 1s into those gaps first. Then, insert into the gaps between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 0, then between 2 and 2, etc.\n\nBut how to handle multiple such gaps.\n\nFor example, if there are multiple gaps between 0 and 2, like in a fixed list [0, 2, 0, 2], then the gaps between 0 and 2 (gap1) and between 0 and 2 (gap3) are both between 0 and 2. Which one should we insert the 1s into first?\n\nIn this case, inserting into the earliest possible gap (gap1) first would be better, since that would allow the 1s to be placed earlier in the string.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate through all the gaps in order, and for each gap, if inserting 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into later gaps, insert as many as possible.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAn alternative way: for each gap, the best time to insert the 1s is when the current gap is between a 0 and a 2. So, we can process the gaps in order, and for each gap, if the previous element is 0 and the next is 2, insert all the remaining 1s here. Otherwise, if the previous is 0 and next is 0, insert as many as possible here (but since 1 is larger than 0, inserting here would be worse than inserting between 0 and 2). So maybe inserting into the earliest possible gaps that are between 0 and 2, then between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 2, etc.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me think of the code steps.\n\nFirst, separate the original string into the fixed elements and the 1s.\n\nfixed_elements = [c for c in s if c != '1']\n\nones = [c for c in s if c == '1']\n\nThen, the number of 1s is len(ones).\n\nNow, the gaps are the positions where we can insert the ones. There are len(fixed_elements) + 1 gaps.\n\nFor example, for fixed_elements of length n, there are n+1 gaps.\n\nNow, the idea is to distribute the ones into the gaps, with the priority of inserting into the gaps that are between 0 and 2, then others.\n\nSo, for each gap in order, we can decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\nBut how to decide the order.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each gap, compute the priority. The priority is determined by the previous and next elements. The priority for inserting 1s into the gap is higher if the previous element is 0 and the next is 2. Then, if the previous is 0 and next is 0, lower priority. Then, if the previous is 2 and next is 0, lower priority. Then, if previous is 2 and next is 2, lower priority. And for the first gap (before the first element), if the first element is 0, then inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them between 0 and 2. Similarly for the last gap.\n\nSo, for each gap, we can assign a priority. Then, we can process the gaps in the order of their priority, inserting as many 1s as possible into the highest priority gaps first.\n\nBut how to calculate the priority.\n\nLet me think of the priority as follows:\n\nThe priority of a gap is determined by the pair (prev, next). The priority for inserting 1s into the gap is:\n\n- If prev is 0 and next is 2: high priority (say, 2)\n\n- If prev is 0 and next is 0: medium priority (1)\n\n- If prev is 2 and next is 0: low priority (0)\n\n- If prev is 2 and next is 2: low priority (0)\n\n- If prev is nothing (gap 0) and next is 0: low priority (0)\n\n- If prev is 0 and next is nothing (gap after the last element): low priority (0)\n\n- If prev is 2 and next is 0: same as before.\n\nWait, but inserting into the gap between 2 and 0 would be worse than inserting into the gap between 0 and 2. So, inserting into the gap between 2 and 0 would have lower priority than inserting into the gap between 0 and 2.\n\nSo, for each gap, the priority is:\n\nIf the gap is between 0 and 2: high priority (insert first)\n\nElse, if the gap is between 0 and 0 or between 2 and 2: medium priority (insert after high priority gaps)\n\nElse, if the gap is between 2 and 0: low priority (insert after medium priority gaps)\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nAn alternative way is to process the gaps in order, and for each gap, insert as many 1s as possible if the gap is between a 0 and a 2. If there are no more 1s left, break. Then, process the gaps again for the other cases.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think that the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where they can be placed between 0 and 2. Once that is done, insert the remaining 1s into the earliest possible positions between 0s and 0s, and then between 2s and 2s, and finally between 2s and 0s.\n\nSo, for the example of fixed_elements = [0, 0, 2, 0], the gaps are:\n\ngap0: before 0 (prev is None, next is 0)\n\ngap1: between 0 and 0 (prev is 0, next is 0)\n\ngap2: between 0 and 2 (prev is 0, next is 2)\n\ngap3: between 2 and 0 (prev is 2, next is 0)\n\ngap4: after 0 (prev is 0, next is None)\n\nThe high priority gap is gap2 (between 0 and 2). So we insert all the 1s into this gap. Then, the rest of the gaps can be filled with the remaining 1s, but in this case, there are none.\n\nSo the resulting string would be 0,0, followed by the inserted 1s, followed by 2, then 0.\n\nSo for example, if the original string has two 1s, then inserting them into gap2 would give 0,0,1,1,2,0 → which is the sample input's output.\n\nYes, the sample input was '100210' → which is '1','0','0','2','1','0'. So the fixed elements are [0,0,2,0], and the 1s are ['1','1'].\n\nInserting the two 1s into gap2 (between 0 and 2) would produce the string '001120', which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works for the sample.\n\nAnother example: input is '20' → output is '20'. The fixed elements are ['2','0'], and the 1s are empty. So no changes.\n\nAnother example: input is '11222121' → output is '11112222'.\n\nOriginal string is '11222121'. The fixed elements are the 2s and 0s (but there are no 0s). Wait, the fixed elements are 2s and 0s. So in this case, the original string has no 0s. So fixed_elements is [2,2,2,2]. The 1s are the rest. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: '1','1','2','2','2','1','2','1'.\n\nfixed_elements = [2,2,2,2], and the 1s are [1,1,1,1].\n\nThe gaps are:\n\ngap0: before the first 2.\n\ngap1: between first 2 and second 2.\n\ngap2: between second and third 2.\n\ngap3: between third and fourth 2.\n\ngap4: after fourth 2.\n\nNow, the priority for inserting 1s into these gaps is determined by the previous and next elements. Since all fixed elements are 2s, all gaps are between 2s (except for the first and last gaps). So the priority for inserting 1s is between 2 and 2, which is medium priority.\n\nBut inserting 1s into the earliest possible gaps (gap0, then gap1, etc.) would be better. Because inserting into gap0 (before the first 2) would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than inserting into gap1 (between two 2s). But inserting into gap0 would have the 1s before the 2s, which is better than inserting into gap1 (which is between two 2s). Wait, no. Because inserting into gap0 would have the 1s before the 2s, which is better than inserting them between the 2s. Because 1 is smaller than 2.\n\nWait, inserting 1s into gap0 would result",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, so their relative order must remain unchanged. However, '1's can be freely moved between '0's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Elements**: Split the input string into two parts: the fixed elements (which are '0's and '2's) and the movable '1's.\n2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine the gaps where the '1's can be inserted. These gaps are before the first fixed element, between consecutive fixed elements, and after the last fixed element.\n3. **Insert '1's Strategically**: Insert '1's into the gaps in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order. Prioritize inserting '1's between '0' and '2' to leverage the fact that '1' is smaller than '2' and larger than '0'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Prepare the gaps\n    gaps = []\n    for i in range(len(fixed) + 1):\n        prev = fixed[i-1] if i > 0 else None\n        next_val = fixed[i] if i < len(fixed) else None\n        gaps.append((prev, next_val))\n    \n    # Distribute the ones into the gaps\n    result = []\n    # First, process gaps that are between 0 and 2\n    for i in range(len(gaps)):\n        prev, next_val = gaps[i]\n        if prev == '0' and next_val == '2':\n            # Insert all remaining ones here\n            result.append(''.join(ones))\n            ones = []\n            break\n    # If there are still ones left, process other gaps in order\n    if ones:\n        for i in range(len(gaps)):\n            prev, next_val = gaps[i]\n            # Insert as many as possible\n            if i == 0:\n                # Before first element\n                result.append(''.join(ones))\n                ones = []\n            else:\n                # Between elements or after last\n                pass\n        # Wait, no, need to insert into gaps in order\n        # So, append the remaining ones into the gaps in order\n        # We'll distribute them in order of the gaps\n        # Start with the first gap\n        idx = 0\n        while ones:\n            prev, next_val = gaps[idx]\n            if idx == 0:\n                # insert all here\n                result.append(''.join(ones))\n                ones = []\n            else:\n                # insert as much as possible here\n                # but since we can't know, just insert all into the first possible gap\n                # Wait, perhaps we should insert the remaining ones into the earliest possible gaps\n                # So, insert all remaining ones into the first gap that is not already processed\n                result.append(''.join(ones))\n                ones = []\n            break\n    \n    # Now, reconstruct the string by inserting the ones into the gaps\n    # The code above may have some flaws, let me rework it properly\n    # Let's redo the distribution correctly\n    distributed_ones = [0] * (len(gaps))\n    # First, insert into the gaps between 0 and 2\n    for i in range(len(gaps)):\n        prev, next_val = gaps[i]\n        if prev == '0' and next_val == '2':\n            distributed_ones[i] = len(ones)\n            ones = []\n            break\n    # Then, distribute the remaining ones into the gaps in order\n    if ones:\n        for i in range(len(gaps)):\n            if distributed_ones[i] == 0:\n                distributed_ones[i] = len(ones)\n                ones = []\n                break\n    \n    # Now, build the result\n    res = []\n    for i in range(len(gaps)):\n        res.append(''.join(['1'] * distributed_ones[i]))\n        if i < len(fixed):\n            res.append(fixed[i])\n    return ''.join(res)\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(minimum_ternary_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separation of Elements**: The input string is split into fixed elements ('0's and '2's) and movable '1's.\n2. **Gap Identification**: Gaps are identified where '1's can be inserted.
