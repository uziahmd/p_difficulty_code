String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: we can perform modifications on the string, and the final string after these modifications must end up with the character g. Wait, no, the problem says that we can obtain character g from the string s with some modifications. So the original string s must be such that through some number of modifications, it can result in the character g. But how?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe key part is about the modifications. Each modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with one character. The replacement rule is: if the two characters are both 0, then replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0. Wait, no: \"we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So for example, replacing two zeros gives a 1. Any other pair (like 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, or 1 and 1) would be replaced by 0.\n\nSo each modification reduces the length of the string by one. And the process can be done multiple times as long as the string has length ≥ 2. The end goal is that after some number of modifications, the resulting string is just the character g. Because the problem says that we can obtain g from s with some modifications.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string s is beautiful if it meets the criteria (has exactly n zeros and m ones) AND we can obtain g from it via modifications. So the question is to count all such strings s that satisfy those conditions.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of binary strings with exactly n zeros and m ones, such that through some sequence of modifications, you can end up with the character g.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model what possible strings s can be reduced to g via these operations.\n\nLet me think about what the modification process does. Each modification reduces the length by one. For example, starting with a string of length L, after k modifications, the length is L - k. Since the process stops when you can't modify anymore (length < 2), the final string must have length 1. Therefore, the process must end with exactly one character, which must be g. So the original string s must be reducible to g via these operations.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Let's consider that the final character after all possible modifications is determined by some function of the original string. For example, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of 1s or something else. Or maybe it depends on the total number of 0s and 1s in some way.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the original string is \"00\". Then, applying one modification replaces the two 0s with 1. So the final character is 1. If the original string is \"01\", then modifying it would replace the two characters (0 and 1) with 0. So the final character is 0. Similarly, \"10\" would become 0. \"11\" becomes 0. What about longer strings?\n\nTake the example given in the first sample input: \"01\" and \"10\" are the two beautiful strings for n=1, m=1, g=0. Let's see why. Let's take \"01\": applying one modification (since length is 2) replaces the two characters with 0. So the final character is 0, which matches g. Similarly for \"10\".\n\nAnother example from the second sample input: \"0011\" (n=2, m=2). Let's see what happens when we apply modifications. Let's think of the process:\n\nOriginal string: 0 0 1 1. Length 4. Let's perform modifications step by step. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the last two characters are 1 and 1. Replacing them with 0. Now the string is 0 0 0. Length 3. Next, take last two (0 and 0) → replace with 1. Now the string is 0 1. Then replace them with 0. So the final character is 0. Which is correct for the sample input where g is 0. So \"0011\" is valid.\n\nBut how can we model this for any string? It seems that the final character depends on the number of 1s and 0s in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character after all possible modifications is determined by the parity of the number of 1s. Wait, let's think about the example:\n\nIn the first example, \"01\" has one 0 and one 1. The final character is 0. But the number of 1s is 1, which is odd. Hmm. In the case of \"00\" (two 0s), the final character is 1. The number of 1s is 0 (even). So maybe not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a kind of evaluation. Each modification is like combining two characters into one, according to certain rules. Let's think of this as a binary operation. For example, combining two characters a and b into c. The rule is: if a and b are both 0, then c is 1. Otherwise, c is 0. Wait, that's equivalent to c being 1 if a == b == 0, else 0. So the operation is: c = 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0.\n\nBut this is similar to some kind of logical operation. Let's think of the operation as follows: combining two bits into one. Let's consider the result of combining all the bits in the string through this operation. However, the order in which the operations are performed might affect the result. But perhaps for the problem, regardless of the order of operations, the final result is uniquely determined by the count of 0s and 1s?\n\nWait, that seems unlikely. Let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"000\". Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Combine the first two 0s into 1. Now the string is \"10\". Combine them into 0. Final result is 0.\n\nOption 2: Combine the last two 0s into 1. String is \"01\". Combine into 0. Same result.\n\nAnother example: \"0011\" as before. Let's see:\n\nAlternative approach: combine the first two 0s into 1. Then the string is 1 1 1. Then combine the first two 1s into 0. Now the string is 0 1. Combine into 0. So same result.\n\nAnother example: \"0101\". Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0 1 0 1. Let's combine the last two (0 and 1) into 0. Now the string is 0 1 0. Then combine the last two (1 and 0) into 0. Now the string is 0 0. Combine into 1. Final result is 1.\n\nAlternative path: combine the first two (0 and 1) into 0. String becomes 0 0 1. Combine last two (0 and 1) into 0. String becomes 0 0. Combine into 1. Same result.\n\nHmm, seems like the final result may depend on the total count of 0s and 1s. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLet me think about the process as a binary tree. Each operation reduces the string by one character, until it's one character. The order of operations may not matter. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a string S. The final character depends on the entire string. Let's think of the function f(S) that returns the final character.\n\nFor example, for S of length 1, f(S) is S itself.\n\nFor S of length 2, it's the operation applied to the two characters.\n\nFor longer strings, the process is to combine the last two, then proceed. But perhaps the function f(S) depends on the count of 0s and 1s. Let's try to find out.\n\nLet me think about the following: Let’s say the total number of 0s is z and the number of 1s is o. How does combining two characters affect these counts?\n\nEach time we perform a modification, we remove two characters and replace them with one. Let's consider the effect on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nCase 1: The two characters are 0 and 0. They are replaced by 1. So z decreases by 2, o increases by 1. Net change: z-2, o+1.\n\nCase 2: The two characters are 0 and 1 (or 1 and 0). They are replaced by 0. So z decreases by 1 (since one 0 is removed, but the new character is 0, so net z remains same?), wait:\n\nOriginal: one 0 and one 1. So z is decreased by 1 (the 0 is removed), o is decreased by 1 (the 1 is removed). The new character is 0. So z increases by 1. Net change: z remains same (since -1 + 1 = 0), o decreases by 1.\n\nCase 3: The two characters are 1 and 1. They are replaced by 0. So o decreases by 2, z increases by 1.\n\nSo during each operation, the counts of 0s and 1s change depending on the pair being replaced.\n\nBut the final result depends on the initial counts. However, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model the final character based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character can be determined by the parity of the number of 1s. Let me test with examples.\n\nFirst example: \"01\" (n=1, m=1). Final character is 0. The number of 1s is 1 (odd). The result is 0.\n\nAnother example: \"00\" (n=2, m=0). Final character is 1. Number of 1s is 0 (even). Result is 1.\n\nAnother example: \"0011\" (n=2, m=2). Final result is 0. Number of 1s is 2 (even). Hmm.\n\nAnother example: \"000\" (n=3, m=0). Let's see:\n\nCombine two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"10\". Combine → 0. Final result is 0. The number of 1s was 0 (even) initially. Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: \"0000\" (n=4, m=0). Let's combine two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"001\". Combine two 0s → 1. Now string is \"11\". Combine → 0. Final result is 0. Number of 1s was 0 (even). Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: \"0001\" (n=3, m=1). Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0 0 0 1. Let's combine the last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now the string is 0 0 0. As before, combining gives 0. So final result is 0. The number of 1s is 1 (odd). Result is 0.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to fit a simple parity pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the process as a binary operation that combines all the characters. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a string of length L. The final character is determined by combining the first L-1 characters and the last character. But that's not necessarily true, since the order of combining matters. However, maybe there's a way to model the final character based on the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a binary tree. Each combination operation is a node combining two children. The root is the final character. The value of the root depends on the structure of the tree. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to model the final character as the XOR of the number of 1s modulo something. Let's think again of the example where the string is all 0s. For example, n=2: the final result is 1. For n=3: the final result is 0. For n=4: 0. For n=5: ?\n\nn=5: 00000. Combine two 0s → 1. Now the string is 0001. Then combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now string is 000. Combine two 0s → 1. Now string is 01. Combine → 0. So final result is 0. So for n=5, the result is 0. Hmm.\n\nSo for even numbers of 0s: n=2 → 1, n=4 → 0. For odd numbers: n=1 → 0 (original string is 0, but length is 1, so no modifications. So the final character is 0. But according to the problem's note, the string must be modified to reach g. Wait, but in this case, the original string is of length 1. How can you perform any modifications? The problem says that the string s must be modifiable to reach g. But if the string is already of length 1, then you can't perform any modifications. So the only way for this to be valid is if the string s is equal to g. Because you can't perform any modifications, so the final character is the original string.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. So the original string s must be reducible to g. Which means:\n\nIf the original string's length is 1, then it must be equal to g. Otherwise, after performing some modifications, the final character is g.\n\nSo, for example, if the original string is of length 1, then the only way it's valid is if that character is g.\n\nBut for longer strings, the process of modifications will reduce it to a single character, which must be g.\n\nSo, the problem is to count all binary strings with exactly n zeros and m ones, such that either:\n\n- The string has length 1 (i.e., n + m = 1) and equals g.\n\nOR\n\n- The string has length ≥ 2, and through the modification process, it can be reduced to g.\n\nSo, the first thing to do is to handle the case when n + m = 1. In that case, the string is either '0' or '1', and we check if it equals g.\n\nBut for the general case, when the string length is ≥ 2, we need to find whether it can be reduced to g. Now, the challenge is to find for a given n and m, what is the condition that allows the string to be reduced to g.\n\nLet me think again about the process. Let's suppose that the string has length l = n + m ≥ 2. We need to find whether the final character after all possible modifications is g.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Let's imagine that the final character depends on the number of 0s and 1s. Let's denote the total number of 0s as z = n, and the number of 1s as o = m.\n\nLet me think of the process as a series of operations that reduce the number of characters. Each operation reduces the length by 1. So, for a string of length l, after l-1 operations, we get to a single character.\n\nBut how does the process affect the counts of 0s and 1s? Let's think about the entire process. Each operation replaces two characters with one. Let's think about the parity of the number of 1s. Wait, but in the earlier example, when we had two 0s, which were replaced by 1, that increased the count of 1s by 1. So perhaps there's a way to model the final result in terms of the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the entire process as a function f(z, o) which returns the final character (0 or 1) given z zeros and o ones. Let's try to find this function.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nEach operation reduces the total number of characters by 1. So for a string with z zeros and o ones, the process ends with one character. Let's think of the process as follows:\n\nAt each step, the operation is applied to two characters. Let's think of the entire process as combining all the characters into one, according to the rules. However, the order of combining affects the intermediate steps but not the final result. Is this true?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose we have three 0s. Let's combine the first two 0s into 1. Then combine with the third 0. The first operation gives 1 and 0. Combining them gives 0. Alternatively, combine the last two 0s into 1 first, then combine with the first 0. Same result. So the order does not matter here.\n\nAnother example: 0 0 1 1. As before, the final result is 0. What if I combine the first two 0s into 1, then combine with the next 1 and 1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 0 1 1 → combine first two 0s → 1 1 1. Combine the first two 1s → 0 1. Combine → 0. Same as before.\n\nAnother example: 0 1 0 1. Let's see:\n\nIf I combine the first two (0 and 1) → 0. Then combine with the next two (0 and 1) → 0. Then combine the two 0s → 1. Final result is 1.\n\nAlternatively, combine the last two (0 and 1) → 0. Then combine the first two (0 and 1) → 0. Then combine two 0s → 1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: 0 1 1. Let's combine the last two (1 and 1) → 0. Now the string is 0 and 0 → combine to 1. Final result is 1. Alternatively, combine first two (0 and 1) → 0. Then combine with 1 → 0. So the final result is 0. Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the original string is 0 1 1. Let me re-examine the two possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Combine the last two 1s (1 and 1) into 0. Now the string is [0, 0]. Combine into 1. Final result is 1.\n\nOption 2: Combine the first two (0 and 1) into 0. Now the string is [0, 1]. Combine into 0. Final result is 0.\n\nSo different results based on the order of operations. Therefore, the final result depends on the order of operations. Which implies that the function f(z, o) isn't uniquely determined by z and o. Therefore, the problem becomes more complex. How can we determine for a given z and o, whether there exists at least one sequence of operations that leads to g?\n\nBut the problem requires that the original string can be reduced to g. So, even if there exists at least one way to reduce it to g, it's acceptable. Therefore, for a given z and o, we need to know whether it's possible to reduce the string to g, regardless of the order of operations.\n\nBut how can we determine that? Let's think of the possible outcomes based on z and o.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows. Each operation reduces the total number of characters by 1. The final character depends on the entire sequence of operations. However, perhaps there's a way to model the possible final characters based on the parity of the number of 1s or some other property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the original string. Let's check the previous example where the string is 0 1 1. The number of 1s is 2 (even). In one scenario, the final result is 1; in another scenario, it's 0. So this contradicts the idea of parity.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's no simple formula based on z and o. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Let's think recursively: for a string with z zeros and o ones, what are the possible final characters?\n\nBut since the order of operations can lead to different results, this seems challenging. However, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, there's a way to determine whether there exists a sequence of operations leading to g, based on z and o.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a game where each operation reduces the string. The final result depends on the choices made during the operations. But for the problem, we need to know whether there exists at least one way to reach g.\n\nLet me think about the possible final characters for a given z and o. For example:\n\nCase 1: z = 0, o = any. All characters are 1s. Let's see:\n\nIf o is 1, then the string is '1'. So the final character is 1.\n\nIf o is 2, then combining the two 1s gives 0.\n\nIf o is 3: combining two 1s gives 0, then combining with the third 1 gives 0. So final result is 0.\n\nIf o is 4: combine two 1s to 0, then combine with another 1 to 0, then combine with the remaining 1 to 0. Final result is 0.\n\nWait, but for o = 2, the result is 0. For o = 3, the result is 0. For o=1, it's 1. So what's the pattern here?\n\nIt seems that for all o >= 1, the final result is 1 if o is 1, and 0 otherwise. But this is only when there are no zeros. So for example, when o is 1, the string is '1', and can't be modified, so it's 1. For o=2, combining gives 0. For o=3, combining two 1s gives 0, then combining with the third 1 gives 0. So yes, for o >= 2, the final result is 0.\n\nSimilarly, for z=2, o=0: combining two 0s gives 1. So final result is 1.\n\nFor z=3, o=0: combine two 0s to 1. Now we have 1 and 0. Combine to 0. Final result 0.\n\nFor z=4, o=0: combine two 0s to 1. Now we have 1 and 0 and 0. Combine two 0s to 1. Now we have 1 and 1. Combine to 0. Final result 0.\n\nSo for z=1, o=0: final result is 0.\n\nSo for cases with only 0s or only 1s, the final result depends on the count of the single type. For example:\n\n- If there are only 0s:\n\n   if the number of 0s is 1 → final is 0.\n\n   if the number is 2 → 1.\n\n   if the number is 3 → 0.\n\n   if the number is 4 → 0.\n\n   if the number is 5 → 0.\n\nWait, for z=3, the final result is 0. For z=4, it's 0. For z=2, it's 1.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that the final result is 1 if the count of zeros is even and greater than 0, but this isn't consistent. For example, z=2 → 1, z=4 → 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, for only zeros:\n\nThe final result is 1 if the number of zeros is congruent to 2 mod 3? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's define f(z) as the final result when there are z zeros and no ones. We can see:\n\nf(1) = 0 (can't modify).\n\nf(2) = 1 (combine two zeros → 1).\n\nf(3): combine two zeros → 1, then combine with the third zero → 0.\n\nf(4): combine two zeros → 1, then combine with two zeros → 1, then combine the two 1s → 0.\n\nWait, for z=4:\n\nOriginal: 0 0 0 0.\n\nFirst combine last two → 1. Now 0 0 1. Combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now 0 0 → combine → 1. Final result is 1?\n\nWait, earlier thought said for z=4 it's 0. But this calculation shows 1. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let's redo this.\n\nLet me take z=4 (four 0s):\n\nStep 1: Combine last two 0s → 1. Now the string is 0 0 1. Length 3.\n\nStep 2: Combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now the string is 0 0. Length 2.\n\nStep 3: Combine them → 1. Final result is 1.\n\nBut earlier I thought that for z=4, the result was 0. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So this suggests that the pattern is not obvious.\n\nThis indicates that the final result depends on the way the operations are performed. Hence, for a given z and o, it's possible that there are multiple possible final results. However, the problem requires that there exists at least one way to reach g. So, for the given z and o, we need to know if there's at least one way to reach g.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps there's a mathematical way to model this. Let's think of the entire process as a function that depends on the number of 0s and 1s, and the parity of some quantity.\n\nLet me think again about the operation rules. When two characters are replaced, the new character is 1 if they are both 0, else 0. Let's think about this as a binary operation. Let me define the operation between two characters a and b as follows:\n\nop(a, b) = 1 if a == 0 and b == 0, else 0.\n\nNow, the final result depends on the order in which these operations are applied. However, perhaps there's a way to find the possible values of the final result based on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result is determined by the parity of the number of times we have pairs of 0s being combined. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a series of operations that eventually reduces the string to a single bit. Let's consider that each operation reduces the number of characters by one. So for a string of length l = z + o, after l-1 operations, we have one character.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final character is 0 if and only if the number of 1s in the original string is not equal to 1, and some other condition. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of 1s. For example, when the number of 1s is even or odd. Let's look at some examples:\n\nExample 1: string is 00 (z=2, o=0). Final result is 1. Number of 1s is 0 (even). Result is 1.\n\nExample 2: string is 000 (z=3, o=0). Final result is 0. Number of 1s is 0 (even). Result is 0.\n\nExample 3: string is 0000 (z=4, o=0). Final result is 1. Number of 1s is 0 (even). Result is 1.\n\nHmm, no pattern here.\n\nAnother example: string is 0011 (z=2, o=2). Final result is 0. Number of 1s is 2 (even). Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: string is 0001 (z=3, o=1). Let's see:\n\nPossible way: combine the last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now string is 000. Combine two 0s → 1. Now string is 0 1. Combine → 0. Final result is 0. Number of 1s is 1 (odd). Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: string is 011 (z=1, o=2). Let's see:\n\nCombine last two 1s → 0. Now string is 0 0 → combine to 1. Final result is 1. Number of 1s is 2 (even). Result is 1.\n\nAnother example: string is 01 (z=1, o=1). Combine to 0. Number of 1s is 1 (odd). Result is 0.\n\nHmm, this seems to suggest that the final result is 0 when the number of 1s is odd, and 1 when it's even. But wait, in the example of 00 (o=0, even) gives result 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, for the string 00, o=0 (even), result is 1.\n\nFor the string 000, o=0 (even), result is 0.\n\nFor the string 0000, o=0 (even), result is 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the parity of o is not sufficient. \n\nThis is getting really complicated. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For the string to be reducible to g, it must be possible to perform operations such that the final character is g. Let's think about what the final character depends on.\n\nLet's consider that the process of combining the characters is similar to evaluating a binary expression tree, where each node combines two children using the operation described. The root of the tree is the final character. The question is: what is the set of possible roots for a given z and o?\n\nBut since the order of operations can vary, this set can vary. However, perhaps there's a way to determine if g is in this set.\n\nLet me think about the following: the final result can be either 0 or 1, depending on the operations. But for the problem, we need to know if there exists at least one sequence of operations that leads to g.\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of the possible final results for a given z and o.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\nCase 1: z + o = 1. Then, the string is either '0' or '1'. So, it's valid if it equals g.\n\nCase 2: z + o = 2. The string has two characters. The final result is determined by the operation on them. So, for example:\n\n- '00' → 1.\n\n- '01' → 0.\n\n- '10' → 0.\n\n- '11' → 0.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 only if the string is '00'.\n\nThus, for z=2, o=0 → result is 1.\n\nFor z=1, o=1 → result is 0.\n\nCase 3: z + o = 3.\n\nLet's take various possibilities.\n\nExample 1: z=3, o=0 → '000'. Possible sequences:\n\nCombine first two 0s → 1. Now '10'. Combine → 0. Final result 0.\n\nOr combine last two 0s → 1. Now '01'. Combine → 0. Same result.\n\nSo final result is 0.\n\nExample 2: z=2, o=1 → '001'. Possible sequences:\n\nCombine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now '00' → combine → 1. Final result 1.\n\nOr combine first two (0 and 0) → 1. Now '11' → combine → 0. Final result 0.\n\nSo for this case, there are two possible results: 0 and 1. Thus, if g is 0 or 1, it's possible.\n\nSo, for z=2 and o=1, it's possible to get either 0 or 1. Hence, for this case, the string can be reduced to g if g is 0 or 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string must be able to be reduced to g. So, for this case, since it's possible to get both 0 and 1, it would be counted as valid for any g.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the string s must allow obtaining g from it. So, if there's at least one way to reduce it to g, it's counted.\n\nSo, for example, if g is 0, and the string can be reduced to 0 or 1, then it's valid. Similarly for g=1.\n\nSo, in this case, for z=2 and o=1, it's always valid, regardless of g.\n\nSo, this suggests that for some combinations of z and o, it's always possible to get either 0 or 1, and thus the string is valid for any g.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nLet me think about the following: if the total number of characters (z + o) is at least 2, and there are at least one 0 and one 1, then it's possible to choose operations that lead to either 0 or 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the final result can be either 0 or 1, depending on the operations, unless there's some constraint.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps we need to find for given z and o, what is the set of possible final results.\n\nLet me try to think of it recursively. Let's define a function that returns whether it's possible to get 0 or 1 from a given z and o.\n\nLet's call the function possible(z, o, target), which returns True if it's possible to reduce the string to target.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBase cases:\n\n- If z + o == 1: return (target == 0 if z == 1 else target == 1).\n\nFor z + o >= 2:\n\nWe can choose to combine any two characters. But since the choice of which two to combine affects the future steps, it's difficult to model.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of z and o.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: each operation reduces the total number of characters by 1. So, for a string of length l >= 2, the final character is determined by the number of operations and the way they're applied.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think about the problem from another angle. What is the necessary and sufficient condition for a string with z zeros and o ones to be reducible to g?\n\nLet me think of the following: the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the string, but this doesn't hold for all cases. However, in the previous example where z=2, o=1, the string can be reduced to both 0 and 1. So, for this case, the parity of o is 1 (odd), and it's possible to get both 0 and 1. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother observation: every operation reduces the number of characters by 1. The final character is determined by the sequence of operations. However, each operation replaces two characters with one, and the new character is 0 or 1 based on the two replaced characters.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final character is determined by the XOR of some function of the original characters. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a way to compute the number of 0s modulo something. For example, in the case where all operations are combining two 0s, the number of 1s increases by 1 each time, and so on. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: let's think about the total number of 0s and 1s modulo 2. For example, each operation changes the count of 0s and 1s in a certain way.\n\nLet me analyze the change in the number of 0s and 1s for each operation:\n\nCase 1: combining two 0s → new character is 1.\n\n- z decreases by 2, o increases by 1.\n\nSo, the net change for z is -2, for o is +1.\n\nCase 2: combining two 1s → new character is 0.\n\n- o decreases by 2, z increases by 1.\n\nNet change for z is +1, o is -2.\n\nCase 3: combining a 0 and a 1 (in any order) → new character is 0.\n\n- z decreases by 1 (since one 0 is removed), o decreases by 1 (one 1 is removed), and then z increases by 1 (new character is 0). Net change for z is 0, for o is -1.\n\nSo, the net change in z and o depends on the case.\n\nNow, let's think",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specified operations. A beautiful string is defined as having exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and it must be reducible to `g`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Reduction Process**: The reduction process involves replacing the last two characters of the string with a single character based on specific rules:\n   - Replace two '0's with '1'.\n   - Replace any other pair (e.g., '0' and '1', or '1' and '1') with '0'.\n\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - If the total length of the string (n + m) is 1, the string itself must be equal to `g`.\n   - For longer strings, we need to determine if there exists a sequence of operations that reduces the string to `g`.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: Use dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to count valid strings.
