For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C again. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps from the first to the second in this order, considering the cyclic nature.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So for example, between C and E, there are 4 semitones. Let me check: C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). Yes. So the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is before Y, then it's Y - X. But if Y is before X, then it's (12 - X + Y) ? Or maybe we can compute the distance as (y_index - x_index) if positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Wait, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E to C, you can go up by 8 steps (E to F is 1, F to F# 2, etc., up to C). But when you have two notes, the distance between them is the minimal steps in the cyclic order? No, no. The problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale, from the lower to upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones when you go from X to Y by going up (which would be 12 - (X-Y) steps?), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's think: the distance from E to C is calculated as moving upwards from E to C. But since E is before C in the cycle? No. Wait, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So E is at index 4 (assuming starting from 0?), then F is 5, etc. So the distance between E and C would be (C's index - E's index) mod 12? No. Because if you go from E to C, you can go up by 8 steps (since E to F is 1, F to F# 2, ..., H is 12 steps from E? Wait, maybe I need to think of the distance between two notes as the number of semitones when moving forward in the cycle. For example, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But in the example, between C and E, X is C (index 0), Y is E (index 4). So 4-0=4, which matches the example. Between E and C, the distance would be (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8? Which is correct. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Wait, but how do we get that? For example, if X is C (index 0) and Y is H (index 11), then the distance is 11-0=11. Which is correct. If X is H (11), Y is C (0), then (0 - 11) mod 12 is 1, but the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. Wait, no. Because the distance is measured from X to Y along the scale. So if X is H, Y is C, then the distance is 1 semitone. So the formula (y_index - x_index) mod 12 gives the correct value. Because (0 - 11) mod 12 is 1. So yes. So the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper note, perhaps the formula is (y_index - x_index)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Note Representation and Index Mapping**: \n   - First, we map each note to an index in a list that represents the order of the 12 notes in the musical scale.\n   \n2. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - The distance between two notes is calculated using their indices in the list. The formula used is `(y_index - x_index) % 12`, which ensures that the distance is measured along the cyclic scale from the lower note to the upper note.\n\n3. **Permutations Check**:\n   - Since the chord is unordered, we generate all permutations of the three given notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n\n4. **Criteria for Major and Minor Chords**:\n   - A **major chord** requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A **minor chord** requires a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n5. **Result Determination**:\n   - If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, we output \"major\".\n   - If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, we output \"minor\".\n   - If none satisfy either, we output \"strange\".\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = [\"C\", \"C#\", \"D\", \"D#\", \"E\", \"F\", \"F#\", \"G\", \"G#\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"]\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    dist1 = (note_to_index(y) - note_to_index(x)) % 12\n    dist2 = (note_to_index(z) - note_to_index(y)) % 12\n    return dist1 == 4 and dist2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    dist1 = (note_to_index(y) - note_to_index(x)) % 12\n    dist2 = (note_to_index(z) - note_to_index(y)) % 12\n    return dist1 == 3 and dist2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        if is_major(*perm):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(*perm):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function maps each note to its corresponding position in the standard 12-note musical scale.\n- **Distance Checks**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions use the modulo operation to ensure correct distances are computed in a cyclic manner.\n- **Permutations**: The `permutations` function from `itertools` generates all possible orderings of the three notes.\n- **Classification**: For each permutation, we check if it matches the definition of a major or minor chord. If none match, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the triad are checked efficiently, and the correct classification is determined based on the given definitions.",
