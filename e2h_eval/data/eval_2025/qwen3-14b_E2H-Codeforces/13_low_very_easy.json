For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem says that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Let me check that. Let's see the order:\n\nC to C# is 1 semitone. Then C# to D is another, etc. Let's count from C to E. C to C# (1), C# to D (2), D to D# (3), D# to E (4). Oh right, so that's 4 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? No, wait. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of steps forward. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position) steps? Or perhaps the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Let's see: E to F is 1, F to F# 2, ..., up to C. Let me count. From E to C: E to F (1), F to F# (2), F# to G (3), G to G# (4), G# to A (5), A to B (6?), wait no. Wait the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H is C again. So from E to F is one semitone. Then F to F# is another. Then F# to G, G to G#, G# to A, A to B, B to H, H to C. So from E to C, how many steps? Let's think: E is index 4 (assuming 0-based?), let's see:\n\nLet me make a list of the notes with their indices. Let's say the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen the next note after H (index 11) is C again (index 0).\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X. Otherwise, (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Wait, but how do we compute that? For example, between E (index 4) and C (index 0). The distance would be (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given in the problem. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, because if Y is higher than X, then it's Y - X. If Y is lower, then it's (Y + 12 - X). But that's equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12? Well, no. Because if Y is lower than X, then (Y - X) is negative. But (Y - X) mod 12 would give the same as (Y - X + 12) if Y < X. For example, Y=0 (C) and X=4 (E): Y - X is -4. mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? Wait, but the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y > X,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves calculating the distances between the notes in all possible orderings and checking if they meet the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in the cyclic sequence of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, calculate the distance in semitones using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Check All Permutations**: Since the triad is unordered, check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Triad Type**: For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If none match, classify the triad as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\nresult = classify_chord(notes)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note to its corresponding index in the list of musical notes, facilitating distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Using modular arithmetic ensures that distances wrap around correctly for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Classification**: The function `classify_chord` checks each permutation and returns the appropriate classification based on the distances found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the triad and ensures correctness by leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic for distance calculations.",
