The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$.

For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod value. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 500, which is quite large. Let's break down the problem.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q. Since all permutations are considered, the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations choose 2), because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So total_permutations is n! So the total number of pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But then we have to subtract those pairs where the inversion count of p is not greater than that of q.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the inversion counts. For each pair of permutations (p, q) where p < q lex, we need to count how many of them have inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as follows: For all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly half of them will have p < q lex. But since we are considering ordered pairs where p is lex smaller than q, perhaps we can compute the total number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) by considering some symmetry.\n\nWait, but what's the relationship between inv(p) and inv(q) when p and q are different permutations? Let me think. Suppose we consider all pairs (p, q) where p and q are distinct permutations. For each such pair, either p < q lex or q < p lex. Now, if we look at the inversion counts, for each pair (p, q) where p < q lex, we can compare inv(p) and inv(q). The total number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is what we need to compute.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Let's denote that for each pair (p, q) with p != q, we have inv(p) - inv(q) can be positive, negative, or zero. But since the problem requires p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps we can find the total number of such pairs by considering the sum over all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex. Let's call this total_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Now, among these pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q)? Let's denote this as the answer we need.\n\nNow, suppose that for all unordered pairs {p, q}, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p), and the rest are those with inv(p) = inv(q). But this is only true if there are no cases where inv(p) = inv(q). However, there are definitely cases where two different permutations have the same number of inversions. For example, [1,2,3] and [1,3,2] have different inversion counts. Wait, no. Wait, [1,2,3] has 0 inversions. [1,3,2] has 1 inversion. So maybe for some pairs, they have same inv counts. Like [2,1,3] and [1,3,2], both have 1 inversion. So yes, there are pairs with same inversion counts.\n\nSo for the entire set of pairs (p, q), where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), plus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) divided by ... Well, no. Because for each pair (p, q) where p != q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). Let's denote:\n\nA = number of pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q)\n\nB = number of pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) < inv(q)\n\nC = number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q)\n\nThen A = B, because for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds, unless inv(p) = inv(q). So A + B + C = total_pairs * 2 (since for each unordered pair, there are two ordered pairs?), wait no. Wait, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q is n! * (n! - 1). So A + B + C = n! * (n! - 1). Also, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is considered in A and B. If inv(p) > inv(q), then (p, q) contributes to A, and (q, p) contributes to B. So A and B are equal. Therefore, A = B = (total_ordered_pairs - C)/2. \n\nBut since the problem requires counting the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q), which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think: the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. And for each such pair, we can check whether inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nBut how does that relate to A? Because A is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). But for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of ordered pairs where p < q lex. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q lex. \n\nBut since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds, and exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds (if inv(p) != inv(q)), then the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (A - D)/2 + something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's call this X. Similarly, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. And the number of ordered pairs where p < q lex and inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. Then, X + Y + Z = T = (n! * (n! - 1))/2. Also, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So for the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X + Y', where Y' is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p lex and inv(q) < inv(p). Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is A = (total_ordered_pairs - C)/2. And this A includes all ordered pairs (p, q) regardless of their lex order. So, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q) would be equal to (A - S)/2 + ... no, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for all unordered pairs {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. For each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the ordered pair (p, q) where p < q, it contributes to X if p < q. Otherwise, if q < p, then (q, p) contributes to X if inv(q) > inv(p). Wait, but inv(p) > inv(q) implies that inv(q) < inv(p). So for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)) is true. Thus, for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) contributes to X (if inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q) or contributes to Y (if inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p, which is same as inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p). \n\nBut since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. Therefore, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) divided by 1? No, because each unordered pair is counted once in the ordered pairs. Wait, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p != q, divided by 1? No, because for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the ordered pairs, (p, q) is counted once, and (q, p) is not. So the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to A (the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q)). Wait no, because A counts all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). Each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) contributes exactly one ordered pair (p, q) to A. So the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly A. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds, the number of such unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of such unordered pairs multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for each unordered pair, exactly one of the two possibilities holds, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is exactly the same as the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Which is our desired X.\n\nSo, X = (number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q)) * (probability that p < q). But since for each unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), which is A. And the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X. How to relate X and A?\n\nWell, since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So the number of such unordered pairs {p, q} is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q plus the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p. Wait, but inv(q) < inv(p) is equivalent to inv(p) > inv(q). So for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)) holds. Which is the same as saying that exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1. Which is A = number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q). But how does this help us?\n\nBut since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true, the number of such unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q plus the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + Y, where Y is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But since inv(q) < inv(p) is the same as inv(p) > inv(q), and q < p is the same as p > q. So for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. Thus, the total number of such unordered pairs is equal to X + Y, where X is the count of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) and Y is the count of (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)) which is same as (p > q and inv(p) > inv(q)). But since for each unordered pair, exactly one of X or Y holds, then the total number of unordered pairs is X + Y = A. However, since X is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and Y is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is the same as the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is A = X + Y. However, how can we find X?\n\nWe know that the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1))/2. And the same for the ordered pairs where q < p. Now, for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q, we have either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). So X is the number of such ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), Y is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p) (which is the same as X for the opposite direction). But since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is A = X + Y. But since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of X or Y is counted once. But how to find X?\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is T. And the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X, and the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y', and the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. Then X + Y' + Z = T. Also, since for the entire ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is A = X + Y, where Y is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But since the number of ordered pairs where p > q is also T, and for each such ordered pair, inv(p) > inv(q) would contribute to Y. But how to relate this?\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is A = (total_ordered_pairs - C) / 2. And total_ordered_pairs is n!*(n! -1). So A = [n!*(n! - 1) - C]/2. \n\nNow, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X. Similarly, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. And since for each pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or equal. Then X + Y + Z = T. Also, note that for the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X + Y_total, where Y_total is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (p > q) holds, and thus X + Y_total = A. But since the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q is also T (same as the number where p < q), then Y_total is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). Which is same as the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is same as Y, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each such pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where q > p and inv(q) > inv(p). So Y_total = Y. Therefore, X + Y = A. \n\nAlso, since the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y, and the number where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X, then X + Y + Z = T. Also, since the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y, and the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q) is same as the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p), which is X. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y + X. But according to earlier, A = X + Y. Which would imply that X + Y = A, but also that the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) < inv(q) is also equal to (total_ordered_pairs - C - A) ? No. Because A is the number of ordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q), and B is the number with inv(p) < inv(q), and since A = B, then B = A. So total_ordered_pairs = A + B + C = 2A + C. Hence, A = (total_ordered_pairs - C)/2.\n\nBut back to X and Y. Since X + Y = A, and X + Y + Z = T. But T is (n!*(n! -1 )) / 2. Also, since the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. And the same number of ordered pairs where p > q and inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. So the total number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q) is 2Z. But C is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q), which would be equal to Z * 2? No. Wait, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q) is equal to C = number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q) multiplied by 2. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, there are two ordered pairs (p, q) and (q, p). Unless p = q, but in this case p != q. So C = 2 * (number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q)).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Anyway, going back to the problem. We need to find X, which is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nFrom earlier, X + Y = A, and X + Y + Z = T. Also, since Y is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), and since for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y, and the number where inv(p) > inv(q) is X, and the rest are Z. Also, since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is T, and the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. But since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) < inv(q) is B = A, because A = B. So B = Y + (number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q)). Which is Y + X. So B = X + Y = A, which matches earlier equations. \n\nBut how to find X? Well, since X + Y = A, and X - Y = ?\n\nAlternatively, since for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q, the difference between X and Y is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) minus the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let me denote this as D = X - Y. But since for all such pairs, X + Y + Z = T, and X - Y = D. But how to find D?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X, and the number where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. Then X - Y is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) minus those where inv(p) < inv(q). But how can we find this?\n\nBut perhaps we can find that X - Y equals the difference between the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) and those with inv(p) < inv(q). Which is equal to the difference between the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) and the number of pairs (q, p) with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is zero, because for every pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), there is a corresponding pair (q, p) where q < p is false, but inv(q) < inv(p). Wait, this seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X, and the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. Then X + Y + Z = T. Also, since for the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is A = X + Y_total, where Y_total is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But earlier we said that Y_total = Y, because for each (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), there's a (q, p) where p > q and inv(q) > inv(p). So Y_total = Y. Therefore, A = X + Y. But also, since the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) < inv(q) is B = Y + X. Because for the same reason. Wait, but earlier we had that A = B. Which would imply that X + Y = Y + X, which is always true. So that doesn't help.\n\nHmm. This seems stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem requires the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think about generating all pairs (p, q), but that's impossible for n=500. So there must be a mathematical formula or dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me think about the total number of permutation pairs (p, q) with p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me denote this as our answer.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each permutation p, how many permutations q are there such that q > p lex and inv(q) < inv(p). Because for each such pair (p, q), since q > p lex, then (p, q) is not counted, but (q, p) would be counted if inv(q) > inv(p). Wait, but this seems not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each permutation p, let's compute the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). Then the answer would be the sum over all permutations p of this count. Because for each such (p, q), since q > p lex, we have p < q lex, and inv(p) > inv(q) (since inv(q) < inv(p)), so this is exactly what we need.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nBut even if we could compute for each p the number of q > p lex with inv(q) < inv(p), how would we do that?\n\nAnother approach: Let me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs - same_lex_pairs) / 2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe:\n\nLet me think of all pairs (p, q) with p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. And for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nTotal number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q): X\n\nTotal number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex and inv(p) < inv(q): Y\n\nTotal number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex and inv(p) = inv(q): Z\n\nThen X + Y + Z = T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nNow, for the entire set of pairs (p, q) with p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is A = X + Y', where Y' is the number of pairs (p, q) where p > q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). But since for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where q > p and inv(q) > inv(p). So Y' = Y. Hence, A = X + Y. Similarly, the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is B = Y + X. Hence, A = B. Which implies that X + Y = Y + X, which is trivial. \n\nBut since A = (total_ordered_pairs - C) / 2, where C is the number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). And since total_ordered_pairs = 2T = n! * (n! - 1).\n\nSo, A = [n! * (n! - 1) - C] / 2. \n\nBut how does this relate to X and Y?\n\nWe also have X + Y = A. And X + Y + Z = T. So substituting, A + Z = T => Z = T - A. \n\nBut since Z is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), which is part of the problem's constraints. But how does that help us find X?\n\nIf we can find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), then we can find X + Y = A, and X + Y + Z = T. But since Z = T - A, then X + Y = A and X + Y + (T - A) = T, which is correct. But this doesn't help us find X directly.\n\nBut what if we can find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), and also find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), then X = T - Y - Z. But again, not helpful.\n\nWait, but what if we can find the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus something? Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: For all permutations p, let's denote the number of permutations q such that q > p lex and inv(q) < inv(p). Let's call this value f(p). Then the answer is the sum of f(p) over all permutations p.\n\nSimilarly, for each permutation p, the number of permutations q such that q > p lex and inv(q) < inv(p) is equal to the number of permutations q > p lex with inv(q) < inv(p). \n\nBut how to compute this for all p?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can precompute for each possible inversion count k, the number of permutations with that inversion count, and then find for each permutation p with inversion count inv_p, how many permutations q are there with inversion count less than inv_p and are lex greater than p.\n\nBut even that seems difficult. However, perhaps we can find for each inversion count k, the number of permutations with that count, and then find the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q) by considering the product of the number of permutations with inversion count k and the number of permutations with inversion count m < k that are lex greater than p. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: for all pairs of permutations (p, q) with p < q lex, the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_A - same_inversion_pairs)/something. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the following: For all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p != q, exactly half of them have p < q lex. So the total number of pairs where p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Now, for each such pair, the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) for a random pair of distinct permutations. But since for all pairs (p, q), the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs with inv(p) < inv(q), assuming that there are no pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). But since there are some such pairs, the actual number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is (total_ordered_pairs - C)/2 = A. And since the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is T, which is half of the total_ordered_pairs (since for each unordered pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true), then the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (A - D)/something. \n\nAlternatively, since for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is A = (total_ordered_pairs - C)/2. And for these pairs, exactly half of them have p < q lex, and half have p > q lex. Is that possible? No, not necessarily. Because the relation between the lex order and inversion counts may not be symmetric. However, if the lex order and inversion counts are independent, then this might be true. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut if we assume that for each pair (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), the probability that p < q is 0.5, then X = A * 0.5. But this is an assumption. Is this true?\n\nFor example, consider n=2. There are two permutations: [1,2] with 0 inversions, and [2,1] with 1 inversion. The pairs (p, q) where p != q are ([1,2], [2,1]) and ([2,1], [1,2]). For the first pair, p < q is false, since [1,2] < [2,1] is true. Wait, no: [1,2] is lex smaller than [2,1]. So the pair (p, q) where p = [1,2], q = [2,1] satisfies p < q lex. And inv(p) = 0 < inv(q) = 1. So in this case, inv(p) < inv(q). The other pair is (p = [2,1], q = [1,2]), which has p > q lex. Here, inv(p) = 1 > inv(q) = 0. So for this pair, inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q. So in this case, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is 1 (the pair ([2,1], [1,2])), and the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is zero. So X is zero. But according to the assumption that X = A * 0.5, A is 1 (number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q)), so X would be 0.5, which is not possible. Hence, the assumption is incorrect. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nSo, this suggests that the relationship between the inversion counts and the lex order is not symmetric. So, we need another approach.\n\nLet's think about generating functions or dynamic programming for inversion counts. For a given n, we can compute the number of permutations with exactly k inversions. This is a classic problem, and the number can be computed using dynamic programming. For example, dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of length i with j inversions. The recurrence is dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j -k]. This is because inserting the ith element into a permutation of i-1 elements can",
