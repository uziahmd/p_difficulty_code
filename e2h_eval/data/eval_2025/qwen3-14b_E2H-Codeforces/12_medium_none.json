The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For example, if she is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at a_i, how much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the road is a ring, moving clockwise. So the distance between current_pos and a_i can be calculated as (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, but since movement is only clockwise, if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So the distance is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (n - current_pos + a_i). Alternatively, the formula for the minimal steps clockwise is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Wait no, because when a_i is less than current_pos, moving clockwise would require going around the ring. For example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 2. The distance is (n - current_pos + a_i) ?\n\nYes. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time to move from the previous position to the current task's position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in the order they must be done. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So Xenia must do them in order. So the initial position is 1. Then, for each task in the list, we calculate the time from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n    compute the distance from current_pos to a_i, moving clockwise.\n\n    add that distance to total_time.\n\n    set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance?\n\nLet me think: for current_pos and target a_i.\n\nIf current_pos <= a_i: the distance is a_i - current_pos.\n\nElse: the distance is (n - current_pos) + a_i.\n\nAlternatively, the formula can be written as (a_i - current_pos) % n, but wait, no. Because if a_i is less than current_pos, then (a_i - current_pos) is negative. For example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 2. Then (2-3) = -1. Mod n (say n=4) would be 3, which is correct. Because 3 →4 →1 →2 is 3 steps. So (a_i - current_pos + n) % n gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\ncurrent_pos = 3, a_i = 2. (2-3) = -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. Mod n is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: current_pos = 2, a_i = 3. (3-2) = 1, mod 4 is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: current_pos = 4, a_i = 1. (1-4) = -3. Adding 4 gives 1. Which is correct (distance is 1 step: 4→1).\n\nSo yes, the formula for distance between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - current_pos) % n if we take modulo n. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values for negative numbers, maybe we should compute it as (a_i - current_pos + n) % n. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Python, (-1) % 4 is 3. So (a_i - current_pos) % n would work. Because for example, when a_i is 2 and current_pos is 3, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the distance between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, let me check:\n\ncurrent_pos = 3, a_i = 2, n=4: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. Correct.\n\ncurrent_pos = 1, a_i = 3, n=4: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\ncurrent_pos = 4, a_i = 1: (1-4) mod 4 is -3 mod 4 = 1. Correct.\n\nYes. So the formula is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, what if the current_pos is 1, and a_i is 1? Then the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for each task, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, in the problem statement, the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the a_i's are 3, 2, 3.\n\nLet's walk through that.\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. So time is 2. Now current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance is (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. So time adds 3. Now total is 5. Current pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is (3-2) mod 4 = 1. Total time is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 3 with a_i's 2,3,3. Let's see.\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Distance is 1. Time is 1. Current pos is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. Distance is 1. Time is 2. Current pos is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is 0. Total time is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   compute distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   add distance to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nReturn total_time.\n\nBut wait, why is that correct?\n\nBecause the problem says that Xenia must complete all tasks in order, and each task must be done after all previous ones. So the order of processing the a_i's is as given. So the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the input is given as two lines: first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given, the first input is ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] — but perhaps that's a way to represent two test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line being n and m, then the second line being m integers. So the code should read from stdin, which for Python can be done via input().split() or similar.\n\nBut the user provided an example where the input is given as two separate test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. The actual code should read one input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m.\n\nThe second line contains m integers a_1 ... a_m.\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich outputs 6.\n\nSo in Python, the code can read the first line as n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen the second line as list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nBut need to make sure that the second line has exactly m numbers.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm above.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nThen print(total_time)\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. Because the first line says 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total_time = 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. total_time is 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total_time is 6. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3].\n\ncurrent_pos is 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod 4 is 1. total_time is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3) mod 4 is 0. total_time remains 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the a list is [1,1,1], then the total time is 0. Because each step is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a = [1,2]. Then:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1. First a is 1: distance 0. current_pos is 1. Next a is 2: (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total_time is 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [2,1]. Then:\n\nFirst step: from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total_time is 1. current_pos is 2. Next step: from 2 to 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. total_time is 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, since moving from 2 to 1 requires 1 step (clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of a's. Then loop through each a in the list, compute the distance, accumulate, etc.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So the calculation (a - current_pos) % n is correct.\n\nBut let me check for a case where a is 1, current_pos is 2, n=4. (1-2) = -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    delta = (a - current) % n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(time)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, m is 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nSo this should be the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. Output is 6. Which matches.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a = [2,1]. Output is 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a = [1, 5]. The first step is 0 (from 1 to 1). Then from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod 5 = 4. So total time is 4. Which is correct (moving 1→2→3→4→5: 4 steps).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in a specific order, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a ring, moving from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The distance from the current position to the target house is computed as `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This handles both cases where the target house is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the task's house, accumulate this time, and update the current position to the task's house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    delta = (a - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current position to the task's house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Accumulate this distance into `total_time` and update the current position to the task's house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
