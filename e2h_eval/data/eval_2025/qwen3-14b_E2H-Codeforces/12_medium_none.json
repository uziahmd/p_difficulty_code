The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For the first input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Start at 1. First task is at 3. How long does it take? From 1 to 3 clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving from 3 to 2: since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she has to go all the way around. Wait, no. Wait, the movement is clockwise. So moving from 3 to 2 would require going through 4 then 1 then 2? That's 3 steps. But that's not optimal. Wait, but maybe the problem says that movement is only allowed clockwise. So when you move from a house to a neighboring one, you can only go clockwise. So Xenia can't move counter-clockwise. So, for example, if she's at 3 and needs to get to 2, she has to go all the way around the circle: 3 →4 →1 →2. Which takes 3 steps. But in the example, the first task is 3, then the second is 2. So from 3 to 2, she takes 3 steps. Then the third task is 3 again. So from 2 to 3, that's 1 step. So total steps would be:\n\nFirst task: 2 steps (from 1 to 3). Then 3 steps (from 3 to 2). Then 1 step (from 2 to 3). Total is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nThe idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time it takes to get from the current position to the next task's location, moving clockwise.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. Then, for each task in order, we compute the distance from the previous position to the current task's position, adding that to the total.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two positions in a circular road?\n\nLet's think: the houses are arranged in a circle. Let's say current position is curr, next position is next. The distance is (next - curr) mod n? No, wait. Because if next is larger than curr, then moving clockwise is next - curr steps. If next is smaller than curr, then moving clockwise would be (n - curr + next) steps. For example, if curr is 3 and next is 2, in a 4-house setup: 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3 + 2) = 3. So the general formula for the distance from curr to next is (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Alternatively, (next - curr + n) % n. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor next >= curr: (next - curr) is positive. Adding n and mod n would give the same as (next - curr). For example, next=3, curr=1, n=4: (3-1) = 2. (3-1 +4) mod4 is 6 mod4=2.\n\nIf next < curr: say next is 2, curr is 3. (2-3 +4) mod4 = 3 mod4=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula is (next - curr + n) % n. But since in Python, modulo can handle negative numbers, but perhaps we can compute it as (next - curr) if next >= curr else (next - curr + n). But perhaps using (next - curr) % n would be sufficient. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf next is 2, curr is 3. (2-3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So (next - curr) % n gives the correct number of steps. So for the distance between curr and next, it's (next - curr) % n.\n\nWait, but in the first case, when next is 3 and curr is 1, (3-1) mod4 is 2. Correct. So yes, the formula is (next - curr) % n. But wait, what if next is 1 and curr is 4? (1-4) mod4 is (-3) mod4=1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1.\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the distance from current position to a_i, add to total time.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then moving from 3 to 3 takes 0 steps. So the code will handle that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i's.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nThen output total_time.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example input: n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3].\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod4 = (-1 mod4)= 3. total becomes 2+3=5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'.\n\nSo a is [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod4=1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo yes, this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the distance from 1 to 1 is 0. So total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. The first step is (1-1) mod2=0. Then (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=5, current is 5, next is 1. (1-5) mod5 = (-4 mod5) = 1. Which is correct: moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor each a in the list:\n\n    time += (a - current) % n\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(time)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\nSo in Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list has exactly m elements.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the second line contains m integers, so that's correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\n   compute delta = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   add delta to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a_i is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a_i is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 6. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 2: (2-1) mod4=1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a_i is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a_i is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. total remains 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The first step is (2-1) mod2=1. Then (1-2) mod2= -1 mod2=1. Total is 2. So the path is 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n and m can be up to 1e5. So the code must be O(m) time, which this approach is. So it's efficient enough.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation with negative numbers returns a positive result. For example, (-1) %4 is 3. So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let's write it.\n\nThe code should read from stdin, process the input, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as the list of a's.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total += delta\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when the tasks are in order 1,1,1. Then the total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[5,1,5]. The steps:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst step: 5-1=4 mod5 is 4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nSecond step: 1-5 mod5 is (1-5) = -4 mod5 = 1. total is 5. current is 1.\n\nThird step: 5-1=4 mod5. total is 5+4=9. So total time is 9.\n\nWhich is correct: 1→5 (4 steps), 5→1 (1 step), 1→5 (4 steps). Total 4+1+4=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each task must be completed in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. The distance between two houses `current` and `next` on a ringroad with `n` houses is given by `(next - current) % n`.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the task's house using the modulo operation. Accumulate this time for all tasks.\n4. **Update Position**: After computing the time for each task, update the current position to the task's house to prepare for the next task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total += delta\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the house numbers where each task is located.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) and initialize the total time (`total`) to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location in the list:\n   - Calculate the distance from the current house to the task's house using `(num - current) % n`.\n   - Add this distance to the total time.\n   - Update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity.",
