Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending either a 0 or 1. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes that don't correspond to any letters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being counted here. The problem says that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4, not being one of the four forbidden ones) represents a unique letter. So, any substring of S that is a valid Morse code string contributes to the count. However, the count isn't just the number of valid substrings; it's the number of non-empty sequences of letters. Wait, but how does that work? Because a substring can be split into multiple letters. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substring \"111\" can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" (three letters), or \"11\" + \"1\" (two letters), or \"1\" + \"11\" (two letters), or \"111\" (one letter). Each of these splits would count as different sequences. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible ways to split the substrings into valid Morse code letters.\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting some substring of S into valid Morse code letters. For example, if there's a substring that can be split into two valid codes, then that counts as one sequence (the two letters), and also the individual letters (if they are valid). But the problem says that each sequence is considered. So for each possible substring of S, we need to find all possible ways to split it into valid Morse code letters, and count each such split as a distinct sequence.\n\nBut that sounds computationally expensive. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each valid Morse code string (i.e., each valid substring of S) represents a single letter. Then, the number of sequences is the number of valid substrings, because each valid substring represents a single letter. But that can't be right, because the sample input shows that for S = \"111\", the answer is 7. Let's check that. The sample explanation lists 7 sequences. Let's see:\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\n- All substrings of length 1: \"1\" (valid)\n- All substrings of length 2: \"11\" (valid)\n- All substrings of length 3: \"111\" (valid)\nBut also, the substrings of length 2 and 3 can be split into multiple letters. For example, the substring \"11\" can be considered as one letter (M), or as two letters (T and T). But according to the sample explanation, the sequences include \"TT\" (which is two letters, both T's). So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible splits of all valid substrings into valid Morse code letters. Therefore, the problem is asking for the total number of such sequences.\n\nThis seems complicated. How do we model this?\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. For each position in the string S, we can track the number of sequences that end at that position. Let's think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming.\n\nSuppose after adding a new character to S, we have a new string. Let's denote the current string as S of length n. For each position i in the string, we can look back and see if there's a valid Morse code substring ending at i. For example, if the last k characters form a valid code (k=1,2,3,4), then we can add to the count the number of sequences that can be formed by appending this code to previous sequences.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the standard problem of counting the number of ways to decode a string (like the classic \"decode ways\" problem). In that problem, each digit can be part of a 1-digit or 2-digit code, and you track the number of ways to decode up to each position.\n\nSimilarly, here, for each position in the string, we can track the number of sequences that end at that position. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid sequences that end at position i (i.e., sequences that end with a valid Morse code string ending at i). Then, the total number of sequences is the sum of dp[1..n].\n\nBut how to compute dp[i]?\n\nFor each i, we can check the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. The string `S` is built incrementally by appending either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash), and after each append, we must compute the count of valid sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, we identify which Morse code strings are valid. These are all binary strings of length 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at this position (of lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid, we update the DP array by considering sequences formed by extending previous valid sequences or starting new ones.\n4. **Efficient Updates**: After each append operation, we maintain a running total of valid sequences using the DP array, ensuring efficient updates and modulo operations to handle large numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    # Precompute the forbidden codes\n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] represents the number of valid sequences ending at position i (1-based)\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[0] is dummy\n    total = 0\n    s = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        c = ops[i-1]\n        s.append(c)\n        # Check the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters\n        # We need to look back up to 4 steps\n        current = \"\"\n        for j in range(i, max(0, i-4), -1):\n            current = s[j-1] + current\n            if len(current) > 4:\n                continue\n            if current not in forbidden:\n                if j == 1:\n                    dp[i] += 1\n                else:\n                    dp[i] += dp[j-1] + 1\n                dp[i] %= MOD\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the list of operations (each being '0' or '1').\n2. **Forbidden Codes**: A set of forbidden Morse code strings is precomputed for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each new character appended to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position (lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid, we update the DP array by considering both new sequences starting at this position and extensions of previous sequences.\n5. **Running Total**: The total number of valid sequences is maintained and printed after each operation, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required counts using dynamic programming, leveraging the constraints on Morse code lengths (1-4) and avoiding redundant calculations.",
