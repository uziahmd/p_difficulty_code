    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to count the number of arrays of N sets, each containing integers from 1 to K, such that there's a rearrangement of the array where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"child\" set means here. The definition says that for every element x in A (the child set), there must be an x+1 in B (the parent set). So for example, if A has {1}, then B must have 2. If A has {2}, B must have 3, etc. But if A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. \n\nNow, the problem requires that there exists some permutation of the array of sets where each consecutive pair satisfies this child-parent relationship. The challenge is to count all such possible arrays.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the order of the array can be rearranged, perhaps we need to find some way to represent the sets in terms of their dependencies, and then arrange them in a certain order.\n\nBut since the order can be rearranged, maybe the key is to find for each set in the array, some property that allows them to be ordered in a chain where each is a child of the next. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the sets can be arranged in some order where each is a child of the next, perhaps we can model this as a DAG where each node represents a set, and there's an edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem reduces to finding if there's a topological order of the array's elements such that each consecutive pair follows the edge direction. However, since the array can be rearranged in any order, the problem is equivalent to requiring that the sets can be ordered into a sequence where each is a child of the next. \n\nBut how do we count all possible arrays of sets that can be ordered in such a way?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the constraints that the sets must satisfy. For the entire array, there must exist an ordering S_1', S_2', ..., S_N' such that S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}'. \n\nThis implies that for each set in the array, there's a way to arrange them in a chain where each set's elements are \"covered\" by the next set's elements plus one. \n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe we can think of each set as having a certain \"level\" or \"rank\", such that in the ordered sequence, each set's rank is higher than the previous. For example, if we can assign to each set a value (like the maximum element it contains, or something else) such that in the ordered sequence, the next set has a higher value. \n\nWait, let's think about the child relationship. If A is a child of B, then for every x in A, x+1 is in B. So, if A has elements {a1, a2, ...}, then B must contain {a1+1, a2+1, ...}. Therefore, the elements of B must be at least as big as the elements of A plus one. \n\nSo, for example, if A contains elements up to m, then B must contain elements up to m+1. So, if we consider the maximum element in a set, say m, then for a set to be a child of another, the parent set must have a maximum element that's at least m+1. Wait, not exactly. Suppose A has elements {1,3}, then B must have 2 and 4. So the maximum of B is at least 4. But if A has max m, then B must have elements x+1 for each x in A. So the maximum of B must be at least (max of A) +1. Because if A's max is m, then B must contain m+1. So the maximum of B is at least m+1. \n\nTherefore, if we have a sequence of sets S_1', S_2', ..., S_N' where each S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}', then the maximum elements of these sets must form a non-decreasing sequence? No, wait, because each S_i' must have a maximum element that is less than or equal to the maximum element of S_{i+1}' minus 1. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIf S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}', then for every element x in S_i', x+1 is in S_{i+1}'. Therefore, the maximum element of S_i' is m, so S_{i+1}' must contain m+1. Hence, the maximum element of S_{i+1}' must be at least m+1. Therefore,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set is a child of the next set in the sequence. The key insight is to model the problem using dynamic programming and combinatorics to efficiently compute the result under the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Child Sets**: A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there exists an element x+1 in B. This implies that the maximum element in A must be less than the maximum element in B.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to form sequences of length `i` where the last set has a maximum element `j`.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each possible length `i` and maximum element `j`, we consider all previous states where the maximum element was less than `j`. This allows us to build up the solution incrementally.\n\n4. **Combinatorics with Prefix Sums**: To efficiently compute transitions, we use prefix sums to maintain cumulative counts of valid configurations, which helps in reducing the complexity from O(N*K^2) to O(N*K).\n\n5. **Modulo Operations**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo `998244353`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    # dp[i][j] = number of ways to have i sets, with the last set having max element j\n    # We'll use a 1D array since we can process layers iteratively\n    # Initialize dp_prev as the base case for i=1\n    dp_prev = [0] * (K + 2)\n    for j in range(1, K + 1):\n        # For a single set, it can be any subset of {1..j} that includes j (so that max is j)\n        # But wait, actually the max can be j, but the subset can have elements up to j.\n        # However, for the first layer, any set is allowed, but when considering the chain, the order will be handled by the DP.\n        # Wait, no.
