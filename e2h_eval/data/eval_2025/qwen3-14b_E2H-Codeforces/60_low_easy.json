Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of valid English letter sequences that can be formed from substrings of a growing string S. Each time we append a 0 or 1 to S, we have to compute the number of such sequences after each operation.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. The Morse code for letters has lengths from 1 to 4. Each possible string of 0s and 1s of length 1-4 is a valid code except four specific ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So, for any substring of S, if it's one of these four, it's invalid. Otherwise, it's a valid letter. The task is to count all non-empty sequences of letters that can be represented as some substring of S. But how?\n\nWait, the question says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence is a series of letters, each represented by their Morse code. But the way this translates into the string S is that the concatenation of their Morse codes must form a substring of S. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1\", \"11\", \"1\", etc. Each of these substrings (if they are valid) represents a letter, and any combination of these letters in sequence (like \"T\" followed by \"M\") would be considered as a sequence. But how do we count all possible sequences?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note in the example. For S = \"111\", the valid substrings are the three \"1\", \"11\", \"111\". However, the note lists sequences like \"TT\", which is two Ts. That corresponds to the Morse code \"1\" followed by another \"1\", which is the substring \"11\". So each occurrence of a valid Morse code substring contributes to the count. But the problem is to count all possible sequences of letters, where each letter is represented by their Morse code, and the concatenation of those codes forms a substring of S. \n\nBut how do we count all possible such sequences? For example, if there are multiple ways to split a substring into valid codes, each split corresponds to a different sequence. For instance, if a substring is \"11\", it could be a single letter (M), or two Ts. So each possible split counts as a different sequence. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each step, maintaining the current string S, and for each possible substring of S, compute the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters (each part being a valid code). Then sum all these numbers across all substrings.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, and each step appends a character, the length of S can be up to 3000. So for each step, the length of S is i (from 1 to m). The total number of substrings is O(n^2), which for n=3000 would be about 9 million per step. But multiplied by m steps, that's 27 billion operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach here. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me think: For each position in the string, we can track the number of ways to split the substring ending at that position. Let's consider dp[i] as the number of valid sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of S. Wait, but perhaps we need to track for each position, the number of ways to split the substring ending at that position. Because when adding a new character, we can look back up to 4 positions and check if any of those substrings (of length 1-4) are valid. Then for each valid substring ending at position i, we can add the number of ways from previous positions.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's define dp[i] as the total number of valid sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of S. Then, when we add a new character (say, at position i), we can look back up to 4 positions. For each possible k (from 1 to 4), if the substring ending at i of length k is valid, then we can add dp[i - k] to dp[i]. Also, we have to account for the case where the current substring itself is a valid code (so adding 1 for that single letter). Wait, no. Because dp[i]",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented as substrings of a growing binary string `S`, where each character is either a dot (0) or a dash (1). The valid Morse code representations are all binary strings of length 1 to 4, except for four specific invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n2. **Valid Substrings Check**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings of length 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid (i.e., not one of the four invalid strings), update the DP array.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    # Set of invalid codes\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] is the total number of valid sequences considering the first i characters\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    S = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        S.append(operations[i-1])\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]  # Start with previous total\n        \n        # Check for substrings ending at i with lengths 1 to 4\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                substring = current[-l:]\n                if substring not in invalid:\n                    if l == 1:\n                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n                    else:\n                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - l]) % MOD\n        print(dp[i] % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the sequence of operations (each being '0' or '1').\n2. **Invalid Strings**: A set of invalid Morse code strings is maintained for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences up to each position in the string `S`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid, update the DP value by considering the number of valid sequences from previous positions.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Ensure all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required counts using dynamic programming and ensures that we only consider valid Morse code substrings, providing the correct results for each modification step.",
