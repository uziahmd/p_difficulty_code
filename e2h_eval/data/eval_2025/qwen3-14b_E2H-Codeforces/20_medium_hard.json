For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose the c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what conditions the c_s values must satisfy for the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nLet me think about what a beautiful multiset is. For each string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. So each element in the multiset is a string of length n. For example, if a string in the multiset is '01', then for the prefix '0', it contributes 1, and for '01' it contributes 1. Also, for any longer prefixes (like '01' itself, but since the string is length 2, there are no longer ones here).\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is the largest number of elements that can be in such a multiset, given the constraints from all the c_s's. Our goal is to count all possible assignments of c_s's where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two parts:\n\n1. Determine for a given set of c_s's, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset.\n2. Count the number of c_s assignments such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum size?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. Each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, the string '010' (length 3) contributes to the prefixes '0', '01', '010'. So for each such prefix s, the count of how many times it appears as a prefix in the multiset must be <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of the multiset is the largest possible number of strings that can be placed in the multiset without violating these constraints. How can we model this?\n\nThis feels like a problem related to the inclusion-exclusion of constraints. But perhaps there's a way to model this as a tree structure, considering the prefixes.\n\nWait, the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, the count for a longer string's prefix (like '01') can't exceed its c_s. However, the count for '0' (a shorter prefix) must be at least as large as the sum of counts for all its extensions. Because every string that starts with '0' will contribute to the count of '0' as a prefix. So for the multiset to be valid, for each node (binary string s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. However, for any node s, the sum of the counts of all its children (i.e., strings that extend s by adding a bit) must be ≤ c_s. Wait, no. Because each string in the multiset contributes exactly once to each of its prefixes. So for example, if a string is of length n, then it has exactly n prefixes (from length 1 to n). So the count for the root (the empty string?) isn't considered here. Wait, no. The problem says the strings s are of length from 1 to n. So for each string in the multiset (which is of length n), it contributes to exactly n prefixes: the prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each of these prefixes s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, to maximize the size of the multiset, we want to select as many strings as possible while respecting all constraints. So this seems similar to a problem where each node (binary string) has a capacity c_s, and the sum of the capacities of all children must be <= the parent's capacity. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach string in the multiset contributes to all of its prefixes. So for example, if you have a string s of length m, then for each prefix p of s (of length from 1 to m), the count for p increases by 1. Therefore, the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum over all strings in the multiset of 1, which is equal to the sum over all nodes (prefixes) of the number of strings in the multiset that have that node as a prefix multiplied by the number of times they contribute. But that's not helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a trie of all possible binary strings up to length n. Each node represents a binary string. The root is empty, but the problem doesn't consider that. The leaves are the strings of length n. Each node has two children (appending 0 or 1). Now, the constraints are that for each node, the number of strings in the multiset that pass through it (i.e., have it as a prefix) is ≤ c_s. The maximum size of the multiset is the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected such that for every node, the number of selected leaves that pass through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves that can be chosen, such that for every node, the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at that node is ≤ c_s. Because each leaf in the subtree contributes exactly 1 to the count of that node's capacity.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given a trie structure (each node has 0/1 children), and capacities c_s for each node, find the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected such that for each node, the number of selected leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. And then, the question is to count the number of c_s assignments (each c_s is between 0 and k inclusive) such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So how do we compute, for a given set of c_s's, the maximum possible size of the multiset? Well, the maximum is determined by the constraints on the nodes. For example, the root node (but the problem says the strings are of length from 1 to n. Wait, the root would be the empty string, which isn't considered here. So the nodes are all the binary strings of length 1 to n. Each node's capacity c_s limits the number of leaves in its subtree.\n\nBut the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the minimum over all nodes of (the capacity of the node multiplied by the number of leaves in its subtree divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of its children?), no. Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward: the maximum number of leaves is determined by the capacities of the nodes. For example, the root (if we consider the root as the empty string) would have capacity c_root, but the problem doesn't include that. Wait, the nodes in the trie are all the binary strings of length 1 to n. So for example, the node \"0\" (length 1) has two children: \"00\" and \"01\" (length 2), and so on.\n\nFor each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - len(s)}, where len(s) is the length of the string. Because each node of length l has a subtree of size 2^{n - l} (since each path from the node to a leaf adds n - l bits). For example, a node of length l has exactly 2^{n-l} leaves in its subtree.\n\nBut the capacity for that node is c_s. So the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is limited by c_s. However, the same leaves are counted in the subtrees of their ancestors. So the problem is similar to a flow problem where each node imposes a constraint that the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. The maximum possible number of leaves is the minimum of all the constraints that are imposed along the paths from the root to the leaves. But how to model this.\n\nWait, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the minimum value of (c_s * (number of leaves in the subtree of s)) / (number of leaves in the subtree of s's parent?), no. Maybe not. Let me think recursively. For each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - len(s)}. Let's denote this as S(s) = 2^{n - len(s)}.\n\nThe constraint is that the number of leaves in the subtree of s cannot exceed c_s. However, this is also constrained by the constraints of its parent. Because the parent's constraint may be tighter. For example, if a node's parent has a capacity that allows only 1 leaf in its subtree, then the node's capacity can't be more than that. So the actual maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the node's parent? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of s's parent. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the constraints as being hierarchical. For example, the capacity of a node s must be at least the number of leaves in its subtree divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of its parent. Or something else.\n\nAnother approach: For the maximum number of leaves, each node s imposes a constraint that the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s. But since the leaves are part of the subtree of all their ancestors, the constraints from ancestors are also active. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * (S(s)) / S(parent(s))) ? No, perhaps not. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake n=2. The root is not considered. The nodes are of length 1 and 2. For example, node \"0\" (length 1) has two children: \"00\" and \"01\" (both length 2). The subtree of \"0\" has 2 leaves. The subtree of \"00\" has 1 leaf.\n\nSuppose the capacities are c_0 = 1, c_00 = 1, c_01 = 1. Then the maximum number of leaves is 1. Because the subtree of \"0\" can have at most 1 leaf. But the leaves in the subtree of \"0\" are \"00\" and \"01\". So selecting one of them would satisfy the constraints. However, if c_0 is 1, but c_00 and c_01 are larger, then the maximum is 1. But if c_0 is 2, then the maximum is 2, because the subtree of \"0\" can take 2 leaves. However, the capacities of the children may be lower. For example, if c_0 = 2, but c_00 = 1 and c_01 = 1. Then the maximum number of leaves is 2? But the leaves in the subtree of \"0\" are two leaves. Each of those leaves would contribute to their own capacities. For example, choosing both leaves would require that c_00 >=1 and c_01 >=1. Which they are. So the maximum is 2. However, the constraint for \"0\" is 2, which allows that. So in this case, the maximum is 2. But if c_0 is 2, and c_00 is 0, then the maximum number of leaves is 0 (since the subtree of \"00\" can't have any leaves, so the maximum is zero). \n\nSo the constraints are that for any node s, the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. However, the number of leaves in the subtree of s is determined by the choices made for its children. So how do we model this? It seems that the constraints are that for each node s, the sum of the capacities of its children multiplied by their respective subtree sizes must be <= c_s * S(s). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the problem resembles the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves such that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. This is equivalent to the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node s, the count of leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem where the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of s's parent. But perhaps not. Alternatively, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the root. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of (c_s) * 2^{n - len(s)} / 2^{n - len(parent(s))} }, but that's not clear. Let's think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is min( c_s, max_children ). Where max_children is the sum of the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in each child's subtree. But since the children's capacities are constrained by their own c's, this seems like a dynamic programming problem.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the capacity of a node s limits the total number of leaves in its subtree. So, for example, if a node s has two children, left and right. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum number of leaves allowed in left and right's subtrees. But how does that work? Because the sum of the leaves in the left and right's subtrees is the total number of leaves in the subtree of s. So the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is min( c_s, max_left + max_right ). But the max_left and max_right are determined by their own capacities.\n\nBut this seems like a way to compute the maximum possible number of leaves given the capacities. So for each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves allowed in each of its children's subtrees.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's take an example. Suppose node s has two children, left and right. The capacity for s is c_s. The capacity for left is c_left, and for right is c_right. The maximum number of leaves in the left's subtree is min(c_left, ...). Similarly for right. Then the maximum number of leaves in s's subtree is min( c_s, (max_left_leaves + max_right_leaves) ). But this seems recursive. So for the root (assuming we have a root node which is the empty string, but in our problem, the nodes start from length 1). But perhaps the root is not considered here. So for the nodes of length 1, their children are the nodes of length 2. The maximum number of leaves allowed in their subtree is min(c_s, sum of children's maximum leaves). But for the leaves (nodes of length n), their subtree has exactly 1 leaf (themselves). So their maximum allowed is min(c_s, 1). Which is just min(c_s, 1). But since the capacity for a node of length n is c_s, which can be up to k, then the maximum allowed is 1 if c_s ≥ 1, otherwise 0. So for the leaves, the maximum number of leaves in their subtree is min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo the maximum number of leaves in the entire trie (which is the root's subtree, but the root isn't considered here) is the sum of the maximum leaves allowed in each of the root's children (but again, the root isn't part of the problem). Wait, the root would be the empty string. But the problem's nodes start from length 1. So perhaps the root is not considered, and the maximum number of leaves is determined by the nodes of length 1. So for the entire problem, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the maximum allowed in the root's subtree (which is the sum of the max leaves allowed in the root's children, but the root is not part of the problem's nodes. So perhaps the problem is that the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints of the nodes starting from the root of the trie (the empty string) down to the leaves.\n\nBut since the problem's nodes start from length 1, perhaps the root is not part of the problem's variables. So how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire trie as a tree where each node is a binary string of length up to n. The root is the empty string. Each node has two children (appending 0 or 1). The leaves are the nodes of length n. The problem's constraints are on all nodes except the root. So the maximum number of leaves allowed in the entire trie is determined by the constraints of the nodes. But the root's capacity isn't considered here. However, the root's subtree includes all leaves, and the capacity for the root's children (the nodes of length 1) would be constrained by their own capacities and the capacities of their parents (the root). But since the root's capacity is not part of the problem's variables, perhaps we can ignore it. However, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum of (for each node s, the capacity c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the root. But the root's subtree has 2^n leaves. So for a node s of length l, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - l}. So if the capacity c_s is such that the maximum allowed leaves in the subtree is c_s, then the maximum number of leaves in the entire tree is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - l} ), where l is the length of s. Wait, but that can't be right. Because for example, a node s of length l, if its capacity is c_s, then the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, ...). But the sum of leaves in the subtree of s is 2^{n - l}, which is fixed. So if c_s is less than that, then the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is c_s. Otherwise, it's the maximum possible allowed by its children.\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the maximum number of leaves in the entire trie is determined by the minimal value of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the parent of s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow where each node's capacity is a constraint. The maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints of the nodes. For example, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum value of (c_s) for all nodes s multiplied by some factor based on their depth. But this is vague.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the constraints. For the maximum number of leaves to be as large as possible, each node's capacity must be sufficient to allow the maximum number of leaves. However, the constraints are hierarchical. For example, the capacity of a node s must be at least the sum of the capacities of its children divided by the number of leaves per child. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the node's parent. For example, for a node s of length l, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - l}. Its parent is of length l-1, and the number of leaves in the parent's subtree is 2^{n - (l-1)} = 2 * 2^{n - l}. So for the node s, the ratio between the leaves in its subtree and the parent's is 1/2. Therefore, the capacity of s must be at least the capacity of the parent divided by 2. Otherwise, the parent's capacity would be too small. But this seems like a necessary condition for the maximum number of leaves to be achieved.\n\nBut how to formalize this. Suppose that for each node s, the capacity c_s must be at least the capacity of the parent divided by the number of children (which is 2) that s is part of. Because the parent's capacity allows for a certain number of leaves in its subtree, and each child can take up to half of that. So for example, if the parent has capacity c_p, then each child can have capacity at least c_p / 2, otherwise the parent's capacity would be limiting.\n\nBut this is getting into the idea of the capacities forming a \"valid\" configuration. For the maximum number of leaves to be as large as possible, the capacities must be such that for every node, c_s ≥ floor( (capacity of parent) / 2 ), or something like that. But this seems to be a necessary condition for the maximum number of leaves to be equal to the minimum of all c_s multiplied by 2^{n - l} for each node s. Wait, maybe the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s, the capacity c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in its subtree (which is 2^{n - len(s)}) gives an upper bound on the number of leaves that can be allowed in the entire tree. But this upper bound must be compatible with the constraints of the parent nodes.\n\nFor example, take a node s of length l. Its parent is of length l-1. The number of leaves in the subtree of the parent is 2^{n - (l-1)} } = 2 * 2^{n - l} } = 2 * S(s). The upper bound for the parent's capacity is c_parent * 2^{n - (l-1)} }, which must be at least the upper bound of the node s's capacity multiplied by S(s). Otherwise, the parent's capacity is smaller than the node's, which would imply that the upper bound for the entire tree is limited by the parent's capacity. Therefore, for the maximum to be achieved, the capacities must satisfy that for every node s, c_s * S(s) ≤ c_parent * S(parent). Which implies that c_s ≤ c_parent * 2. Because S(s) = S(parent)/2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum value of (c_s * S(s)) over all nodes s. Because for each node s, the capacity multiplied by the number of leaves in its subtree gives an upper bound on the total number of leaves that can be selected. But since this must be compatible with the parent's constraints, the minimum of these values across all nodes gives the maximum number of leaves.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me think with examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nIn this case, the nodes are of length 1. Each node has S(s) = 2^{1 - 1} = 1. So the minimum of c_s * 1 for all nodes is the minimum of c_0 and c_1. The maximum number of leaves (which are the strings of length 1) is this minimum. Because each string is a leaf. So the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of c_0 and c_1. For example, if c_0=2 and c_1=0, then the max is 0. If c_0=2 and c_1=2, then the max is 2.\n\nIn the sample input, the answer is 3. The three ways are when the minimum of c_0 and c_1 is exactly 2. Because the maximum possible is f=2. So the possible c_0 and c_1 must be such that min(c_0, c_1) = 2, and each c is between 0 and k (42). The number of such pairs is:\n\nNumber of pairs where c_0 ≥ 2, c_1 ≥ 2, and at least one of them is exactly 2. Wait, no. Because min(c_0, c_1) = 2 implies that both are ≥ 2, and at least one is exactly 2. Or wait, no. If both are ≥ 2, and the minimum is exactly 2. That is, the minimum is 2. So either one is 2 and the other is ≥ 2, or both are 2. So the total number of pairs is:\n\n(number of pairs where c_0 ≥ 2, c_1 ≥ 2) minus (number of pairs where c_0 ≥ 3, c_1 ≥ 3). Because the first term includes all pairs where min is ≥ 2, and the second term subtracts those where min is ≥3. The difference is the number of pairs where min is exactly 2.\n\nSo for the first sample, n=1, k=42, f=2. The number of valid pairs is ( (k - 1) * (k - 1) ) - ( (k - 2) * (k - 2) )) ?\n\nWait, for the first case, the number of pairs where min(c_0, c_1) ≥ 2 is (k - 1) * (k - 1) ? Because each of c_0 and c_1 can be from 2 to k. But k is 42, so the number is (42 - 1) * (42 -1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the possible values for c_0 and c_1 are from 0 to k. So for the min to be ≥2, both c_0 and c_1 must be ≥2. The number of such pairs is (k - 1) * (k - 1) ? Wait, no. Because the range for each is 2 to k, inclusive. Which is (k - 1) possible values (since 0-based? Or 1-based? Let's see. For example, if k is 42, then the possible values are 2 to 42, inclusive. The count is 42 - 2 + 1 = 41. So the count is (k - 2 + 1) = k -1. So yes, for each variable, the number is (k -1) options. So the total is (k-1)^2. Then the number of pairs where min is ≥3 is (k-2)^2. So the difference is (k-1)^2 - (k-2)^2 = ( (k-1) - (k-2) ) * ( (k-1) + (k-2) )) ) = 1*(2k -3) = 2k-3. For k=42, this is 2*42 -3 = 84-3=81. But the sample output is 3. Wait, that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the first sample input is n=1, k=42, f=2. The sample output is 3. According to this calculation, the answer would be 81. But the sample says 3. Clearly, something is wrong here. So my previous reasoning must be incorrect.\n\nAh, right! Because in the first sample, the maximum number of leaves is the min of c_0 and c_1. But for the maximum to be exactly f=2, this min must be exactly 2. However, the sample explanation says that there are three ways. Let's look at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first example, the three ways are:\n\nc_0=0, c_1=2 → min is 0. But according to the sample explanation, the maximum beautiful multiset is {1, 1}, which has size 2. Wait, but that would require that the min is 2. But in this case, the min is 0. So this contradicts the previous reasoning. So my earlier assumption that the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of c_s * S(s) is wrong.\n\nSo this suggests that my previous approach was incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nLet me take the first sample case:\n\nn=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe sample says that there are three valid ways. Let's look at the explanation:\n\nIn the first case, c_0=0, c_1=2. Then the maximum beautiful multiset is {1,1}. The size is 2. How does this fit with the constraints?\n\nThe multiset has two strings of length 1, which are '1' and '1'. For the prefix '0' (length 1), the number of strings in the multiset that have '0' as a prefix is zero (since the multiset contains only '1's). So 0 ≤ c_0=0. For the prefix '1', the count is 2, which is ≤ c_1=2. Thus, the multiset is valid. The maximum size is 2.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, the maximum number of leaves would be the minimum of c_0 and c_1. Here, min(0, 2) is 0, but the maximum is 2. So clearly, that reasoning was wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct way to model the maximum number of leaves given the capacities?\n\nAlternative approach: The maximum number of leaves is the sum over all leaves (strings of length n) of 1, but subject to the constraints that for each node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to model this. It's a problem of selecting as many leaves as possible such that for every node s, the number of selected leaves that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected, given that for each node s, the count of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics and can be modeled using a trie and constraints. However, how to compute the maximum?\n\nLet me think of it as a flow problem. Each leaf can be selected or not. For each node s, the sum of selected leaves that pass through it must be ≤ c_s. The maximum number of leaves is the maximum number of selected leaves.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum given the capacities.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm. For example, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the root. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is S(s) = 2^{n - len(s)}. For the maximum number of leaves, we want to select as many leaves as possible, but ensuring that for each node s, the number of leaves selected in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since the leaves are part of the subtrees of all their ancestors, the constraints are interdependent.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in each of its children's subtrees. Because the children's subtrees are subsets of the current node's subtree. So the sum of the children's maximum leaves can't exceed c_s. So for the current node, the maximum leaves in its subtree is min( c_s, sum of children's max leaves ). \n\nIf this is the case, then the maximum number of leaves for the entire trie (the root's subtree) would be the sum of the maximum leaves for each of the root's children. But since the root is not part of the problem's nodes, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maximum leaves for each of the nodes of length 1 (since they are the root's children). But for the nodes of length 1, their maximum leaves in their subtree is min( c_s, sum of children's max leaves ). \n\nLet's apply this to the first sample case.\n\nSample case: n=1. So nodes are of length 1. Each node's subtree has 1 leaf (itself). So for a node s (length 1), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min( c_s, sum of children's max leaves ). But since the node's length is 1, and n=1, there are no children (because the length of the children would be 2, which exceeds n=1). So the sum of children's max leaves is zero. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves for the subtree of s is min( c_s, 0 ). Which is zero. But this contradicts the sample, where the maximum is 2. \n\nWait, this suggests that the approach is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because for n=1, the leaves are the nodes of length 1. So for a node of length 1, its subtree is itself. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min( c_s, 1 ), since the subtree contains exactly one leaf (the node itself). So the formula should be min( c_s, 1 ), because the sum of children's max leaves is zero (no children), but the node's own subtree has one leaf. So the formula for the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min( c_s, 1 + sum of children's max leaves ). No, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nLet me think again. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of a node s is the number of leaves that can be selected in that subtree, given the constraints. For a leaf node (length n), the subtree contains exactly one leaf. So the maximum number of leaves is min( c_s, 1 ). For a non-leaf node (length l < n), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves in the left child's subtree plus the maximum leaves in the right child's subtree. \n\nSo for the first sample case (n=1), the nodes are of length 1, which are leaves. Their maximum number of leaves is min( c_s, 1 ). The total maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maximum leaves for each of the root's children (the nodes of length 1). But since the root is not part of the problem's nodes, the total maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maximum leaves for the two nodes of length 1 (0 and 1). \n\nWait, but in the first sample case, the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maximum leaves for each of the two nodes (0 and 1). For example, if c_0 is 0 and c_1 is 2, then the maximum for node 0 is 0, and for node 1 is 1 (since min(2, 1) = 1). Summing gives 0+1=1, but the sample says the maximum is 2. So this approach is still incorrect.\n\nClearly, there's a misunderstanding of the problem. Let me go back to the sample explanation.\n\nSample input: n=1, k=42, f=2. The three valid ways are:\n\nCase 1: c_0=0, c_1=2. The maximum beautiful multiset is {1, 1}, which has size 2.\n\nBut according to the previous logic, the maximum number of leaves would be the sum of the maximum leaves for each node of length 1. For node 0, it's min(0, 1) = 0. For node 1, it's min(2, 1) = 1. Total is 0+1=1. But the sample shows a maximum of 2. So this suggests that the previous logic is incorrect.\n\nWhat's the error here? Let me think about what the constraints are. For the multiset {1, 1}, each string in the multiset is of length 1. For each string s of length from 1 to 1 (i.e., length 1), the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is counted.\n\nFor s = 0: the number of strings in the multiset with prefix 0 is 0. Which is ≤ c_0 = 0.\n\nFor s = 1: the number of strings in the multiset with prefix 1 is 2. Which is ≤ c_1 = 2.\n\nSo the multiset is valid. The size is 2, which is larger than the sum of the max leaves for each node. So why is that?\n\nBecause the sum of the max leaves for each node is 0 + 1 = 1, but the actual maximum is 2. So the previous logic is wrong.\n\nAh! I think I see the mistake. The maximum number of leaves is not the sum of the max leaves for each node, but rather the sum of the leaves selected, which are counted in multiple nodes. For example, selecting the string '1' twice contributes to the count for node '1' (which is allowed up to c_1=2), but also contributes to the count for the empty string (but that's not part of the problem's constraints). Wait, but the problem's constraints are for all strings s of length from 1 to n. So for the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for `c_s` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves understanding the constraints imposed by the binary strings and their prefixes, and using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the required values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string of length from 1 to `n` has a constraint `c_s` which limits how many times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset. The goal is to ensure that the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly `f`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use a DP approach to compute the number of valid configurations of `c_s` values. The key insight is to recognize that each node in the trie of binary strings contributes to the constraints of its parent nodes.\n\n3. **Combinatorics and Modular Arithmetic**: We use combinatorial calculations to count valid configurations efficiently, taking care to handle large numbers using modular arithmetic with modulus `998244353`.\n\n4. **Prefix Constraints**: For each node, we compute the minimum constraint that would limit the maximum size of the multiset.
