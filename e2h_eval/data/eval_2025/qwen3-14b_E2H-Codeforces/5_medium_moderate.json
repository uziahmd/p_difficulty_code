Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to pair them such that each pair has compatible colors. The maximum number of such pairs. And then output those pairs with their indices.\n\nCompatibility rules: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can be compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, a '?' and a 'a' is compatible, and '?' and '?' is also compatible.\n\nThe challenge is to find the maximum number of pairs, and then output the pairs. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a bipartite graph matching problem where each left node (boot) is connected to right nodes (boots) that are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching. However, for n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be too slow, because their time complexity is O(E√V), and E could be O(n²) here. That's not feasible for n=150,000.\n\nSo we need a greedy approach or some way to compute the maximum pairs efficiently without using standard matching algorithms.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Since the compatibility is based on colors, perhaps we can group the boots by their color and then find pairings between them.\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\nFirst, process all the pairs where both the left and right boots are specific colors. For example, if l[i] is 'a' and r[j] is 'a', they can be paired. But how to maximize this?\n\nBut since the question marks can be used as wildcards, maybe we should first pair the specific colors, and then use the question marks to fill in the remaining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to:\n\n1. Pair as many specific color matches as possible. For example, for each color c, count how many left boots have color c and how many right boots have color c. The minimum of these counts is the number of pairs we can make for that color. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\n2. Then, handle the question marks. The remaining left and right boots with question marks can be paired among themselves. Also, the question marks can be used to pair with the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but this seems tricky. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the question marks as being able to match with anything. So, perhaps first pair the non-question marks as much as possible, and then use the question marks to cover the leftovers.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\nFirst, create a mapping for each color (excluding '?') on the left and right. For each color c, the number of left boots with color c is left_counts[c], and similarly for right_counts[c]. For each color c, the number of pairs we can make is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). However, this may not be the case because the same left boot can't be used in multiple pairs. But maybe if we process each color in order, and pair the left and right boots of that color.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already paired?\n\nWait, but the problem requires that we output the actual pairs. So perhaps we need to collect all the pairs for each color, then handle the question marks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me think about the problem as:\n\nEach left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible.\n\nSo, the maximum matching is the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nBut given the constraints, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about grouping the left and right boots by their colors. For example:\n\nFor the left boots, we have:\n\n- For each color c (including '?'), a list of indices where the color is c.\n\nSame for the right boots.\n\nThen, the idea is:\n\nFirst, pair the left boots with color c with the right boots with color c. For each such pair, we can take as many as possible. For example, if there are 5 left boots with color 'a' and 3 right boots with color 'a', we can pair 3 of them. Then, the remaining 2 left boots with 'a' can be paired with right boots that have '?', or other colors?\n\nBut perhaps we need to pair the specific colors first, then use the '?'s for the rest.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between specific colors, then pair the remaining left and right boots with '?'.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nThe total pairs would be:\n\nsum over all colors c (number of pairs between left c and right c) + number of pairs between left '?' and right '?' + number of pairs between left '?' and right non-? (but only if they are not already matched) + number of pairs between left non-? and right '?'.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\nFor each color c (not '?'), the number of pairs between left c and right c, plus the number of pairs between left '?' and right '?', plus the number of pairs between left '?' and right non-? (but after accounting for the ones already used), and similarly for right '?' and left non-?.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of counts:\n\nLet me first count the number of left boots with color c (for each c), and same for right.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nleft_count = a dictionary where left_count[c] is the number of left boots with color c.\n\nright_count = same for right.\n\nNow, for each color c (not '?'), the number of pairs between left c and right c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nBut once we do that, the leftover left and right boots of color c will be left_count[c] - min(...), etc. However, the question is, how to handle the leftover.\n\nBut perhaps the '?' can be used to pair with these leftovers. For example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be paired with right 'a's, they can be paired with right '?'s. Similarly, right boots with color 'a' that couldn't be paired with left 'a's can be paired with left '?'s.\n\nBut how to compute this optimally?\n\nAnother approach: Let's first pair all the left and right boots that have the same color (excluding '?'). Then, collect the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired in the first step) and pair them with '?'s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nStep 1: For each color c (excluding '?'), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Let's say for each c, we pair as many as possible. The number of such pairs is min(left_c, right_c). However, we need to track which specific boots are paired here. For example, for color 'a', we can take the first left 'a's and pair them with the first right 'a's.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, maybe we can first calculate the total possible pairs for each color, then subtract those from the counts, and then proceed.\n\nBut when building the actual pairs, we need to track which indices are used.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), collect the list of left boots with color c, and the list of right boots with color c.\n\n   For example, left_colors = defaultdict(list), right_colors = defaultdict(list).\n\n   Then, for each color c, we can pair the left and right lists. The number of pairs is min(len(left_colors[c]), len(right_colors[c])). We can pair the first k elements of each list, where k is the min.\n\n   Then, add these pairs to our result.\n\n   After that, remove these elements from the left and right lists (so that they are not considered again).\n\n   For example, if left_colors[c] had 5 elements and right_colors[c] had 3, then we pair the first 3 left elements with the first 3 right elements. Then, the remaining 2 left elements are left in left_colors[c], and the right_colors[c] is empty.\n\n2. Then, handle the question marks.\n\n   Now, we have left_question = list of left boots with '?'\n\n   right_question = list of right boots with '?'\n\n   Also, there may be some left boots with specific colors (non-?) that are left unpaired (because their corresponding right color was not enough), and same for right boots.\n\n   Let me call:\n\n   left_remaining = all left boots that are not yet paired (could be specific colors or ?)\n\n   right_remaining = same for right.\n\n   Now, the problem is to pair the left_remaining and right_remaining, considering that ? can be paired with anything.\n\n   How to maximize this?\n\n   Here's an idea: the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between the number of left_remaining and right_remaining, but only if they can be paired. However, since ? can be used as wildcards, perhaps we can pair them as follows:\n\n   First, pair the left_remaining (specific colors) with the right_remaining (specific colors) if possible. But that's probably not necessary, since we already did that in step 1. Wait, no. Because after step 1, the left_remaining for specific colors may have some that could be paired with right_remaining of other colors. For example, a left 'a' that wasn't paired with a right 'a' could be paired with a right 'b' if that's possible? No, because the compatibility requires that the colors are same or one is ?. So in this case, left 'a' can only be paired with right 'a' or right '?'. But in step 1, we already paired all the left 'a's with right 'a's. So after that, any left 'a's that remain can't be paired with any right 'a's (since they are all used up), so they can only be paired with right '?'.\n\n   Similarly for right 'a's that are left unpaired.\n\n   So, after step 1, the remaining left boots with specific colors can only be paired with right '?'s, and vice versa.\n\n   So, the next step is to pair the left_remaining (specific colors) with right '?'s, and the right_remaining (specific colors) with left '?'s, and finally pair the remaining '?'s.\n\n   Let me think of this as:\n\n   Let's collect all left boots that are not paired yet and have specific colors (non-?), call them left_special.\n\n   Similarly, right_special are the right boots not paired yet with specific colors.\n\n   The left_question are the left boots with '?', not yet paired.\n\n   right_question are the right boots with '?', not yet paired.\n\n   Now, the left_special can be paired with right_question, and the right_special can be paired with left_question. Also, the left_question and right_question can be paired among themselves.\n\n   How to maximize this?\n\n   Let's think of the following steps:\n\n   a. Pair as many left_special with right_question as possible. For each left_special (say, color c), it can be paired with any right_question. So the number of such pairs is min( len(left_special), len(right_question) ). So we can pair all left_special with right_question until one of them is exhausted.\n\n   Similarly, pair as many right_special with left_question as possible. The number of such pairs is min( len(right_special), len(left_question) ), but after the previous step.\n\n   Then, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired among themselves. The number of such pairs is min( len(left_question_remaining), len(right_question_remaining) )\n\n   But how to implement this?\n\n   Let me think of the following approach:\n\n   Let's collect:\n\n   left_special = list of left boots with non-? color that are not yet paired.\n\n   right_special = same for right.\n\n   left_q = list of left boots with ? that are not yet paired.\n\n   right_q = same for right.\n\n   Now, the number of possible pairs between left_special and right_q is min( len(left_special), len(right_q) ). Let's pair them. For example, take the first min(...) elements from left_special and pair them with the first min(...) elements of right_q.\n\n   Then, the remaining left_special would be len(left_special) - min(...), but since we took all of them or all of right_q.\n\n   Similarly, for right_special and left_q.\n\n   Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired.\n\n   But how to handle this in code.\n\n   Let's think of the steps:\n\n   After step 1, we have:\n\n   left_special = [all left boots not paired yet, with non-?]\n\n   right_special = [same for right]\n\n   left_q = [left boots with ?, not paired yet]\n\n   right_q = [same for right]\n\n   Now:\n\n   Step 2a: Pair left_special with right_q.\n\n   The number of pairs here is min( len(left_special), len(right_q) )\n\n   So, for each of these pairs, we take a left_special and a right_q.\n\n   Then, subtract these from left_special and right_q.\n\n   Step 2b: Pair right_special with left_q.\n\n   Similarly, min( len(right_special), len(left_q) )\n\n   Step 2c: Pair remaining left_q and right_q. The number is min( len(left_q), len(right_q) )\n\n   So the total pairs from steps 2a, 2b, 2c is the sum of these three.\n\n   This seems manageable.\n\n   Now, how to implement this?\n\n   Let's think about the data structures. For each color, we need to track the list of indices. For example, for left boots, we can have a dictionary mapping color to list of indices. Similarly for right.\n\n   So, during step 1, we process all colors except '?', and pair left and right of same color.\n\n   Then, for the remaining, collect the left_special, right_special, left_q, right_q.\n\n   Then, proceed with steps 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\n   Now, how to collect these lists.\n\n   Let me outline the code steps:\n\n   Read n, l, r.\n\n   Create for left:\n\n   left_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\n   for i in range(n):\n\n       c = l[i]\n\n       left_colors[c].append(i+1)  # since indices are 1-based\n\n   Similarly for right_colors.\n\n   Then, for step 1:\n\n   pairs = []\n\n   for color in left_colors:\n\n       if color == '?':\n\n           continue\n\n       if color in right_colors:\n\n           # get the left list and right list\n\n           left_list = left_colors[color]\n\n           right_list = right_colors[color]\n\n           # number of pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n           num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n           # pair the first num_pairs elements\n\n           for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n               pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n           # remove these from the left and right lists\n\n           # but since we need to process all colors, perhaps we can just delete the color entries?\n\n           # Or, perhaps we can modify the lists. However, since we are processing colors in a loop, perhaps we need to track which have been processed.\n\n           # Wait, but once we process a color, we can delete it from the left_colors and right_colors, or mark them as processed.\n\n           # Alternatively, perhaps after pairing, we can delete the color from left_colors and right_colors. But that's not correct because for example, if a color is processed in step 1, but there are still left boots with that color (if the right had more than left). So perhaps we need to track which left and right boots have been used.\n\n           Hmm. Oh, but the approach above is not correct. Because, for example, if we have left_colors['a'] with 5 elements and right_colors['a'] with 3 elements, then we pair 3 elements from left and 3 from right. But then, the remaining 2 left elements are still in left_colors['a'], but they are not processed. However, since we have already processed the color 'a' in step 1, we need to avoid processing them again.\n\n           Therefore, perhaps after processing a color, we should remove the color from left_colors and right_colors, but only for the ones that have been paired. Wait, no. Because the left_colors and right_colors are being used to collect the data for step 1. Once we pair the left and right of same color, the remaining left and right of that color are not processed again. So, perhaps for the step 1, we can iterate through all colors except '?', and for each, pair as many as possible between left and right, and then remove the color from left_colors and right_colors (but not sure).\n\n           Alternatively, perhaps after pairing, we can remove the paired elements from the left and right lists. But since the lists are stored in the dictionaries, perhaps it's easier to track which ones are used.\n\n           However, this approach is getting complicated. Because for the code, when you process a color, you need to pair as many as possible, and then the remaining left and right boots of that color are not processed again.\n\n           So, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n           For each color c in left_colors (excluding '?'):\n\n               if c is in right_colors:\n\n                   take the left list and right list.\n\n                   pair as many as possible (min of the two lengths)\n\n                   add these pairs to the list.\n\n                   then, remove the paired elements from the left and right lists. But how? Well, for example, if the left list has m elements, and we pair k of them, then we can take the first k elements and keep the rest. But since the code is written in Python, perhaps we can process the lists by popping elements. However, since we need to process all colors, perhaps we need to process each color once.\n\n           Wait, but in the code, after pairing, the remaining elements (if any) in left_colors[c] or right_colors[c] are left. However, in step 1, we process each color once. So, for example, for color 'a', after pairing, the left_colors['a'] may have some elements left, but we don't process them again. Because in step 1, we are processing all colors except '?', and once processed, they are not considered again.\n\n           So, perhaps the code for step 1 is:\n\n           for color in list(left_colors.keys()):  # iterate over a copy of the keys\n\n               if color == '?':\n\n                   continue\n\n               if color in right_colors:\n\n                   left_list = left_colors[color]\n\n                   right_list = right_colors[color]\n\n                   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n                   for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n                       pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n                   # Now, remove the paired elements from left and right lists.\n\n                   # But since we have to process all colors, perhaps after pairing, we can delete the color from the left_colors and right_colors? No, because for example, if there are more left boots than right boots for color c, then the left boots that are left in left_colors[c] are not processed again. So, perhaps we need to delete the color from left_colors and right_colors after processing. Because otherwise, in the next iteration, if the color is processed again, but the lists have already been partially processed.\n\n                   Wait, no. Because the loop is over the original list of keys. For example, if the code is:\n\n                   for color in list(left_colors.keys()):\n\n                       if color != '?', etc.\n\n                   Then, after processing color 'a', the left_colors and right_colors may still have entries for 'a', but in the next iteration, the color 'a' is not processed again, because the loop is over the original list of keys. Wait, no. Because the code is looping through the list of keys at the time of the initial list creation. So, for example, if during processing, the code deletes the color from left_colors, but the loop is over the original list of keys. So, for example, if the code processes color 'a', and deletes it from left_colors, but the loop is over the original list of keys, which includes 'a', then during the loop, the code may process 'a' again. Which is not desired.\n\n                   Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to process each color once, and after pairing, remove the color from left_colors and right_colors. But how to avoid reprocessing the same color again.\n\n                   Alternatively, perhaps during step 1, we can iterate over all colors except '?', and for each, process them once, and then remove them from the left_colors and right_colors. But how?\n\n                   Maybe the code for step 1 is:\n\n                   temp_left = defaultdict(list)\n\n                   temp_right = defaultdict(list)\n\n                   for i in range(n):\n\n                       if l[i] != '?':\n\n                           temp_left[l[i]].append(i+1)\n\n                       if r[i] != '?':\n\n                           temp_right[r[i]].append(i+1)\n\n                   Then, for each color c in temp_left:\n\n                       if c in temp_right:\n\n                           num_pairs = min(len(temp_left[c]), len(temp_right[c]))\n\n                           for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n                               pairs.append( (temp_left[c][i], temp_right[c][i]) )\n\n                           # then, remove the used elements from temp_left and temp_right?\n\n                           # but how?\n\n                           # perhaps, after pairing, we can delete the color from temp_left and temp_right.\n\n                           # but that would not account for the case where there are more left than right.\n\n                           # So, perhaps we can delete the color from temp_left and temp_right only if we have processed all possible pairs. But that would not help.\n\n                           # Alternatively, perhaps after pairing, we can remove the color from temp_left and temp_right. Because any remaining elements in temp_left[c] or temp_right[c] will be handled in the next steps.\n\n                           # But that's not correct. For example, suppose temp_left[c] has 5 elements, temp_right[c] has 3. Then, we pair 3 elements, and the remaining 2 in temp_left[c] are not processed here. But they are still in temp_left[c], so when we process the color again, they would be considered again. But since we are iterating over all colors once, perhaps this is not a problem.\n\n                           # Wait, no. Because in this code, temp_left and temp_right are built once. So, during step 1, the code iterates over all colors in temp_left (which are colors that are not '?'). For each color, it pairs with temp_right. But after that, the temp_left and temp_right are not modified. So, the code would process the same color again, leading to duplicates.\n\n                           This suggests that this approach is wrong.\n\n                           So, perhaps the correct way is to process each color once, and after pairing, remove the color from temp_left and temp_right. But how?\n\n                           Maybe after processing a color, we can delete it from temp_left and temp_right. For example:\n\n                           for color in list(temp_left.keys()):\n\n                               if color == '?':\n\n                                   continue\n\n                               if color in temp_right:\n\n                                   # process as before\n\n                                   # then, after pairing, delete the color from temp_left and temp_right.\n\n                                   del temp_left[color]\n\n                                   del temp_right[color]\n\n                           But that would be incorrect, because for example, if there are more left than right for a color, then after pairing, the left has some elements left. But deleting the color from temp_left would remove them. Which is not correct.\n\n                           So, this approach is not working.\n\n                           Therefore, perhaps the initial idea of tracking which left and right boots are used is not feasible. Instead, perhaps during step 1, we can collect all the pairs, and then for the remaining, collect them into left_special, right_special, left_q, right_q.\n\n                           Let me think again.\n\n                           Let me think of the following approach:\n\n                           For step 1, we can iterate through all colors except '?', and for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right. However, once a pair is made, we need to mark those boots as used and not consider them again.\n\n                           But how to track which boots are used? For that, perhaps we can have two arrays (or sets) for left and right, indicating whether a boot is already used.\n\n                           So, for example:\n\n                           used_left = [False] * n\n\n                           used_right = [False] * n\n\n                           Then, for step 1:\n\n                           for color in all possible colors except '?':\n\n                               for each left boot with color c and not used:\n\n                                   for each right boot with color c and not used:\n\n                                       pair them and mark as used.\n\n                           But this seems inefficient for large n. Because for each color, we have to loop through all left and right boots.\n\n                           However, perhaps we can use the data structures to collect the indices for each color, and then process them in order.\n\n                           For example, for each color c (not '?'):\n\n                               left_list = list of indices (1-based) of left boots with color c.\n\n                               right_list = same for right.\n\n                               for i in range( min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) ):\n\n                                   left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n                                   right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n                                   if not used_left[left_idx-1] and not used_right[right_idx-1]:\n\n                                       pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n\n                                       used_left[left_idx-1] = True\n\n                                       used_right[right_idx-1] = True\n\n                           This way, we process each pair once.\n\n                           But how to collect the left_list and right_list for each color. For that, we can pre-process the left and right into dictionaries.\n\n                           So, let's proceed with this approach.\n\n                           So, first, pre-process:\n\n                           left_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\n                           for i in range(n):\n\n                               c = l[i]\n\n                               left_color_indices[c].append(i+1)\n\n                           Similarly for right_color_indices.\n\n                           Then, create used_left and used_right arrays of size n, initialized to False.\n\n                           Then, for step 1:\n\n                           for color in left_color_indices:\n\n                               if color == '?':\n\n                                   continue\n\n                               if color in right_color_indices:\n\n                                   left_list = left_color_indices[color]\n\n                                   right_list = right_color_indices[color]\n\n                                   num_pairs = min( len(left_list), len(right_list) )\n\n                                   for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n                                       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n                                       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n                                       if not used_left[left_idx-1] and not used_right[right_idx-1]:\n\n                                           pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n\n                                           used_left[left_idx-1] = True\n\n                                           used_right[right_idx-1] = True\n\n                           Wait, but this code would pair the first num_pairs elements of left_list and right_list, but what if some of them are already used? For example, if the left_list contains indices that were already used in previous steps. But in this approach, we are not checking that. Because the left_list is built before any pairing. So, the left_list may contain indices that are already used, but in reality, they were not used yet. Because we are processing the colors in a certain order.\n\n                           Wait, no. Because the left_list is built before any pairing. So, for example, if a left boot is in left_list for color 'a', and during step 1, we process color 'a', and pair it with a right boot. But if later, during processing another color, we try to pair again, but that left boot is already marked as used.\n\n                           But in the code above, for step 1, we are processing all colors, but for each color, the code tries to pair the first num_pairs elements. However, if the left_list contains indices that were already used (because they were processed in a previous color), then this code would try to pair them again, but the used_left check would prevent that.\n\n                           However, the code for step 1 is not efficient. Because for example, if a left boot is processed in multiple colors. But since the code checks used_left and used_right, it will not pair them again.\n\n                           However, this approach would work, but may not be efficient. For example, if the same left boot is in multiple color lists (but that's impossible, since each left boot has only one color). So, each left boot is in exactly one color list (the one corresponding to its color). So, during step 1, for each color, the code would process the left_list and right_list for that color, and pair as many as possible, but only if they are not already used.\n\n                           However, since the code is for step 1, and the used arrays are initially all False, the code would pair the first num_pairs elements of left_list and right_list. But if during processing, some of them are already used, but that's impossible because during step 1, each left boot is in exactly one color list (its own color), and we haven't processed any other color yet. So, during step 1, for a given color, the code processes the left_list for that color, and the right_list for that color. Since the used arrays are initially False, all the elements in the left_list and right_list are unused. Therefore, the code can safely pair them all.\n\n                           Wait, but if the code processes color 'a', then color 'b', then the left boots in 'a' are processed, and the left boots in 'b' are processed. So, during step 1, the code pairs all possible pairs for each color, and the used arrays are updated accordingly.\n\n                           Therefore, this approach is correct for step 1.\n\n                           Once step 1 is done, the used arrays have some True entries.\n\n                           Then, for step 2, collect the left_special, right_special, left_q, right_q.\n\n                           How?\n\n                           left_special is the list of left boots with color not '?', and not used.\n\n                           Similarly for right_special.\n\n                           left_q is the list of left boots with color '?', not used.\n\n                           right_q is the list of right boots with color '?', not used.\n\n                           So, to collect these lists, we can loop through all left boots and check their color and used status.\n\n                           For example:\n\n                           left_special = []\n\n                           left_q = []\n\n                           for i in range(n):\n\n                               if not used_left[i]:\n\n                                   if l[i] != '?':\n\n                                       left_special.append( i+1 )\n\n                                   else:\n\n                                       left_q.append( i+1 )\n\n                           Similarly for right_special and right_q.\n\n                           Once we have these four lists, we can proceed to step 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\n                           Now, step 2a: pair left_special with right_q.\n\n                           The number of pairs is min( len(left_special), len(right_q) )\n\n                           So, for i in 0 to min-1:\n\n                               pairs.append( (left_special[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n                           Then, mark these as used. But since we are collecting the lists, after pairing, we can just take the first k elements of left_special and right_q, and add them to the pairs.\n\n                           However, after this, the remaining elements in left_special and right_q are the ones not paired here.\n\n                           Similarly for step 2b: pair right_special with left_q.\n\n                           Then, step 2c: pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\n                           But how to implement this.\n\n                           Let me think:\n\n                           After step 1, we have:\n\n                           left_special = list of left indices with color not '?', not used.\n\n                           right_special = same for right.\n\n                           left_q = list of left indices with color '?', not used.\n\n                           right_q = same for right.\n\n                           Now, for step 2a:\n\n                           num_pairs_2a = min( len(left_special), len(right_q) )\n\n                           for i in range(num_pairs_2a):\n\n                               pairs.append( (left_special[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n                           # Now, remove these elements from left_special and right_q.\n\n                           # But since we are processing them in order, perhaps we can slice the lists.\n\n                           left_special = left_special[num_pairs_2a:]\n\n                           right_q = right_q[num_pairs_2a:]\n\n                           Then, step 2b:\n\n                           num_pairs_2b = min( len(right_special), len(left_q) )\n\n                           for i in range(num_pairs_2b):\n\n                               pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_special[i]) )\n\n                           # Again, slice the lists.\n\n                           right_special = right_special[num_pairs_2b:]\n\n                           left_q = left_q[num_pairs_2b:]\n\n                           Then, step 2c:\n\n                           num_pairs_2c = min( len(left_q), len(right_q) )\n\n                           for i in range(num_pairs_2c):\n\n                               pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n                           So, adding all these pairs.\n\n                           Now, this seems manageable.\n\n                           However, the problem is that the order in which we pair left_special with right_q and right_special with left_q may affect the total number of pairs. For example, if we pair left_special with right_q first, then there might be more pairs available for step 2b and 2c. But since the total is the sum of min(len(left_special), len(right_q)) + min(len(right_special), len(left_q)) + min( ... ), perhaps this approach gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\n                           Because, for example, pairing left_special with right_q uses up as many as possible of left_special and right_q. Then, pairing right_special with left_q uses as many as possible of the remaining right_special and left_q. Finally, pairing the remaining q's.\n\n                           This seems correct.\n\n                           So, putting it all together.\n\n                           Now, the code needs to:\n\n                           1. Preprocess left and right color indices.\n\n                           2. Initialize used_left and used_right arrays.\n\n                           3. Process step 1, pairing same color non-? boots.\n\n                           4. Collect left_special, left_q, right_special, right_q.\n\n                           5. Process steps 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\n                           Now, the code must also output the pairs, with the indices.\n\n                           Now, let's think about the sample input.\n\n                           For example, the first sample input:\n\n                           Input:\n\n                           10\n\n                           codeforces\n\n                           dodivthree\n\n                           Output is 5 pairs.\n\n                           But I'm not going to check that now. Let's proceed with coding.\n\n                           Now, for Python, handling n up to 150,000. So, the code must be efficient.\n\n                           Let's proceed.\n\n                           Now, the code steps:\n\n                           Read n.\n\n                           Read l and r strings.\n\n                           Preprocess left_color_indices and right_color_indices.\n\n                           Initialize used_left and used_right as lists of booleans.\n\n                           Then, for step 1:\n\n                           for color in left_color_indices:\n\n                               if color == '?': continue\n\n                               if color in right_color_indices:\n\n                                   left_list = left_color_indices[color]\n\n                                   right_list = right_color_indices[color]\n\n                                   num_pairs = min( len(left_list), len(right_list) )\n\n                                   for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n                                       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n                                       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n                                       if not used_left[left_idx - 1] and not used_right[right_idx - 1]:\n\n                                           pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n\n                                           used_left[left_idx - 1] = True\n\n                                           used_right[right_idx - 1] = True\n\n                           Wait, but this code would process all colors in left_color_indices. However, for example, if the same color appears in left and right, but during processing, the code may process the same color multiple times. Wait, no. Because left_color_indices is a defaultdict(list), and for each color in left_color_indices, the code is processed once. However, the code is looping through the keys of left_color_indices. But for example, if a color is present in left_color_indices and also in right_color_indices, then during step 1, the code would process it once.\n\n                           However, the problem is that the code for step 1 may not pair all possible pairs. For example, if the left_list and right_list have more elements than the num_pairs, but they are not processed. Because the code is processing the first num_pairs elements. However, since the used arrays are being updated, the remaining elements will be processed in other steps.\n\n                           Now, after step 1, collect the left_special, left_q, right_special, right_q.\n\n                           Now, the code for collecting them:\n\n                           left_special = []\n                           left_q = []\n                           for i in range(n):\n                               if not used_left[i]:\n                                   if l[i] != '?':\n                                       left_special.append(i+1)\n                                   else:\n                                       left_q.append(i+1)\n\n                           Similarly for right_special and right_q:\n\n                           right_special = []\n                           right_q = []\n                           for i in range(n):\n                               if not used_right[i]:\n                                   if r[i] != '?':\n                                       right_special.append(i+1)\n                                   else:\n                                       right_q.append(i+1)\n\n                           Then, process steps 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\n                           Now, for step 2a:\n\n                           num_pairs_2a = min( len(left_special), len(right_q) )\n\n                           for i in range(num_pairs_2a):\n                               pairs.append( (left_special[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n                           Then, left_special and right_q are sliced.\n\n                           But in code, since lists are mutable, we can just take the first num_pairs_2a elements and leave the rest.\n\n                           However, since the code is adding to the pairs list, we can proceed as follows:\n\n                           Then, for step 2a:\n\n                           for i in range(min(len(left_special), len(right_q))):\n\n                               pairs.append( (left_special[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n                           Then, left_special = left_special[ min(...) : ] ?\n\n                           But since after this, we need to process the remaining elements in left_special and right_q, but the code for step 2b and 2c will use the remaining elements.\n\n                           However, in code, after step 2a, the left_special and right_q lists are",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots based on their colors. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that each pair has compatible colors, with the maximum possible number of such pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing**: First, we preprocess the input strings to group indices of left and right boots by their colors. This helps in efficiently finding compatible pairs.\n2. **Initial Pairing**: We start by pairing boots with the same specific color (excluding '?') from both left and right sides. This ensures that we use up all possible direct matches first.\n3. **Handling Indefinite Colors**: After handling specific color matches, we deal with the remaining boots that have indefinite colors ('?'). These can be paired with any remaining boots (specific or indefinite) from the opposite side.\n4. **Greedy Pairing**: We use a greedy approach to pair remaining specific color boots with indefinite color boots and vice versa. Finally, we pair the remaining indefinite color boots among themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    l = input[ptr]\n    ptr += 1\n    r = input[ptr]\n    ptr += 1\n\n    left_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color_indices[l[i]].append(i + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        right_color_indices[r[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair same color non-? boots\n    for color in left_color_indices:\n        if color == '?':\n            continue\n        if color in right_color_indices:\n            left_list = left_color_indices[color]\n            right_list = right_color_indices[color]\n            num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(num_pairs):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not used_left[left_idx - 1] and not used_right[right_idx - 1]:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n                    used_left[left_idx - 1] = True\n                    used_right[right_idx - 1] = True\n\n    # Collect remaining boots\n    left_special = []\n    left_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            if l[i] != '?':\n                left_special.append(i + 1)\n            else:\n                left_q.append(i + 1)\n\n    right_special = []\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            if r[i] != '?':\n                right_special.append(i + 1)\n            else:\n                right_q.append(i + 1)\n\n    # Step 2a: Pair left_special with right_q\n    min_2a = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_2a):\n        pairs.append((left_special[i], right_q[i]))\n\n    # Update lists after step 2a\n    left_special = left_special[min_2a:]\n    right_q = right_q[min_2a:]\n\n    # Step 2b: Pair right_special with left_q\n    min_2b = min(len(right_special), len(left_q))\n    for i in range(min_2b):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i], right_special[i]))\n\n    # Update lists after step 2b\n    right_special = right_special[min_2b:]\n    left_q = left_q[min_2b:]\n\n    # Step 2c: Pair remaining left_q and right_q\n    min_2c = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_2c):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i], right_q[i]))\n\n    # Output the result\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Preprocessing**: The input strings are processed to group indices of each color for both left and right boots.\n2. **Initial Pairing**: We iterate through each color (excluding '?') and pair as many left and right boots as possible with the same color.\n3. **Handling Indefinite Colors**: After initial pairing, we collect remaining specific and indefinite color boots.
