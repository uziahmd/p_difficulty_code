Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible with another specific same color, or with a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. So, for each left boot and right boot, we need to check if their colors are compatible.\n\nBut since we want the maximum number of pairs, we need an efficient way to match them. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nOne idea is to first pair the specific colors where possible, then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a', we can look for a right boot with 'a' or '?'. Similarly, a right boot with 'a' can pair with a left boot of 'a' or '?'. But since the question marks can be flexible, maybe we should first pair the specific colors, and then use the remaining question marks.\n\nWait, but how to model this? Maybe we can do the following steps:\n\n1. Count the number of each color on the left and right, excluding the question marks. Then, for each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left and right is the minimum of the count of c on left and count of c on right. Then, after that, we can pair the remaining question marks.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because the question marks can be used to pair with any color. So maybe the approach is:\n\n- First, pair all left and right specific colors that match. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, the remaining left and right question marks can be paired among themselves, or with any remaining specific colors?\n\nNo, perhaps not. Because once you pair specific colors, the remaining question marks can be used to pair with any leftover specific colors. But how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nWe can process the colors in two parts:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), pair left c with right c. The number of such pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract those from the counts. Then, for the remaining left and right question marks, we can pair them with each other, but also with any remaining specific colors. Wait, but that might not be optimal. For example, if there are some left '?' and right 'a's that are not paired yet, pairing a '?' with 'a' would be better than pairing '?' with '?' because that uses up a specific color which could have been used elsewhere.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal way is to first pair all possible specific colors, then use the question marks to cover any remaining specific colors. Then pair the remaining question marks with each other.\n\nWait, but that may not be optimal. For example, suppose there are more left '?' than right '?'. Let's think of an example:\n\nLeft: [a, ?]\nRight: [a, ?]\n\nIf we pair the a with a, then the ? with ?, total 2 pairs. Which is optimal.\n\nBut if we pair the a with ?, then the ? with a, that's also two pairs. But the same result.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLeft has 3 'a's and 2 '?'\nRight has 2 'a's and 3 '?'\n\nIf we pair the 'a's first (min(3,2) = 2), then we have 1 'a' left on the left, and 3 '?' on the right. Then, the remaining 'a' can be paired with a '?', and then the remaining 2 '?' on the right can be paired with the left '?'s. So total pairs: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5?\n\nWait, but the total possible pairs would be 2 (a-a) + 3 (the ?s) + 1 (a-?) = 6? No, no. Because each left and right boot can be used once. So in this case, after pairing the two a's, we have left with one a and two ? on left, and three ? on right. Then, the remaining a can be paired with any of the right ?. Then, the two left ? can be paired with two of the right ?. So total 2+1+2=5 pairs. But the total possible maximum is 5, since there are 5 left boots and 5 right boots. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if we had not paired the a's first? Suppose we pair the a with a ?, then the remaining a's can be paired with other ?. But that would still give the same total.\n\nSo the approach of first pairing the specific colors, then using the ? to cover the remaining specific colors, and then pairing the ?s seems correct.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. This is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), collect the left ? and right ?. Then, pair them with each other. But also, perhaps, there are some left ? and right specific colors that are not yet paired. So maybe we can pair the left ? with the right specific colors, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but after step 1, the remaining left and right boots have:\n\nFor left: some left specific colors (if they had more than the right's count) and some ?.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nSo perhaps after step 1, we need to:\n\n- For each color c (not '?') in left, if there are any left, pair them with right ?s. Similarly for right.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, after step 1, we can collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (which are either specific colors or ?), and same for right. Then, for these, we can pair the ?s with any available specific colors. Then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available.\n\nBut considering that the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, not just the count, we need to track which boots are used.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Create two dictionaries: for left and right, track the positions of each color.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For example:\n\nFor the left boots, for each color (including ?), collect the list of indices (positions) of the boots with that color. Same for the right boots.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), we can take the min of the number of left and right c's, and pair them. For example, for each c in left and right, take the first m elements from left_c and right_c, where m is min(len(left_c), len(right_c)).\n\nThen, after that, for the remaining left and right boots, we can process the ?s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAfter that, for the remaining left and right boots, we can:\n\n- Pair left ? with right specific colors (if any), and vice versa. Then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut again, how to do this.\n\nAnother approach: after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be grouped into:\n\nleft_remaining = left boots that are not yet paired (could be specific colors or ?)\n\nright_remaining = same for right.\n\nNow, for the left_remaining, we can collect all the specific colors (non-?) and pair them with the right_remaining's ?s. Similarly, pair the right_remaining's specific colors with left_remaining's ?s. Then pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nLet me think of this as two steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair all possible specific color matches (l[i] == r[j] == same color).\n\nStep 2: For the remaining, pair the left ? with right specific colors, and right ? with left specific colors. Then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, think of all the left and right boots that are not yet paired. Let's collect all the left ?s and right ?s, and the left and right specific colors that are not yet paired.\n\nFor example, after step 1, for the left boots, we have some specific colors that couldn't be matched (because the right didn't have enough). For example, if there were 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, then after pairing, there is 1 left 'a' left. Similarly for other colors.\n\nThese left 'a's can be paired with right '?', and vice versa.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right boots, we can:\n\nFor each left boot that is not a '?', we can pair it with a right '?'.\n\nFor each right boot that is not a '?', we can pair it with a left '?'.\n\nOnce these are done, the remaining left and right '?' can be paired with each other.\n\nThis would maximize the number of pairs.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps could be:\n\n1. Preprocess the left and right strings, grouping the positions by color.\n\n   For example, left_dict[color] = list of indices (starting from 1?), and same for right_dict.\n\n2. For each color c in left_dict and right_dict (excluding '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c])). Then, take the first m elements from both lists and pair them.\n\n   Record these pairs.\n\n3. After that, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), collect:\n\n   - left_rest: list of left boots that are not paired yet. These can be of any color (but not paired yet).\n\n   - right_rest: same for right.\n\n   Now, for these, we can:\n\n   a. Pair left '?' with right non-'?' (specific colors). For each left '?' in left_rest, try to find a right non-? in right_rest. Once paired, remove from both.\n\n   b. Pair right '?' with left non-? in left_rest. For each right '?' in right_rest, try to find a left non-? in left_rest.\n\n   c. Then, pair the remaining left '?' and right '?' as much as possible (each pair is one left and one right ?).\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut since we need to track the indices, perhaps we can process the left_rest and right_rest in a way that allows us to pair them.\n\nLet me think of the data structures. After step 2, for each left and right, we have some remaining elements. Let's say, for left_rest, we have a list of left boots that are not paired yet. Similarly for right_rest.\n\nBut perhaps for efficiency, we can track for left and right:\n\nFor left_rest, we can have a list of positions with color '?', and a list of positions with specific colors (non-?).\n\nSame for right_rest.\n\nSo, for step 3a:\n\nTake all left '?' in left_rest and pair them with right non-? in right_rest. How?\n\nWe can iterate through all left '?' in left_rest, and for each, take a right non-? from right_rest (specific colors) that hasn't been paired yet. Similarly for step 3b.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available. For example, in step 3a, we can process all left '?' and pair them with right non-?.\n\nBut since the right_rest contains specific colors (non-?), perhaps we can collect all the right non-? in a list, and pair them with left '?'.\n\nSo, for example, for the left_rest, collect the list of left '?'s and the list of left specific colors (non-?).\n\nSimilarly for right_rest.\n\nThen:\n\nFor step 3a, pair left '?' with right non-?.\n\nWe can take the left '?' list and the right non-? list, and pair them as much as possible.\n\nThe number of possible pairs is min(len(left_question_marks), len(right_non_question)).\n\nEach such pair would be a left '?' with a right non-?.\n\nSimilarly, for step 3b, pair right '?' with left non-?.\n\nAgain, min(len(right_question_marks), len(left_non_question)).\n\nAfter that, the remaining left and right '?' can be paired between themselves.\n\nSo, the total pairs would be:\n\nstep1_pairs + step3a_pairs + step3b_pairs + step3c_pairs.\n\nBut how to track the actual pairs.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this with the actual indices.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nCreate left_dict and right_dict. Each is a dictionary mapping from color to list of indices (1-based? Probably yes, since the output uses 1-based indices.)\n\nFor example, for l, for each i in 0..n-1, color is l[i], add (i+1) to left_dict[color].\n\nSame for r.\n\nThen, step 1: process all colors except '?'.\n\nFor each color c in left_dict and right_dict (excluding '?'):\n\n   take the min of len(left_dict[c]) and len(right_dict[c]).\n\n   for each pair in 0..m-1:\n\n      take left_dict[c][pair] and right_dict[c][pair], add to the answer list.\n\n   then, remove those elements from left_dict[c] and right_dict[c].\n\nWait, but modifying the lists during iteration might be tricky. So perhaps, for each color c, we can process the existing lists, and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut how to do that without modifying the original lists? Well, perhaps we can create a new list for each color, and track which ones are used.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can take the first m elements of left_dict[c] and right_dict[c], and pair them.\n\nBut after that, we can remove those elements from the lists, so that they are not considered again.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for color c, the left list is left_list = left_dict[c]. The number of pairs is m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list)). So, we can take the first m elements of left_list and the first m elements of right_list, and pair them. Then, we can remove those elements from the left and right lists, leaving the rest (if any) for later steps.\n\nWait, but how to do that. Because for example, if we have left_list = [1,2,3], and right_list = [4,5], then m is 2. We pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5. Then, the remaining left_list is [3], and the right_list is empty.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each color c, after pairing, we can truncate the left and right lists to remove the first m elements.\n\nBut in Python, lists can be sliced. So, for example, after pairing, we can keep the remaining elements in the lists.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the left_dict and right_dict can be modified as follows:\n\nfor c in all colors except '?':\n\n   left_list = left_dict.get(c, [])\n\n   right_list = right_dict.get(c, [])\n\n   m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(m):\n\n       pair (left_list[i], right_list[i])\n\n   # Now, remove the first m elements from left_list and right_list.\n\n   # But since the lists are stored in the dict, perhaps we can replace them with the remaining elements.\n\n   # So, left_dict[c] = left_list[m:]\n\n   # Similarly for right_dict[c] = right_list[m:]\n\nBut this would modify the original lists. However, since we are processing colors in order, this would work.\n\nWait, but for example, if we process color 'a' first, then 'b', etc., and for each, pair as much as possible.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining elements in left_dict and right_dict for each color are those that couldn't be paired.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, the next step is to process the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, for step 3a and 3b, we need to collect the left and right '?'s and the non-?s.\n\nSo, after step 1, the left_dict and right_dict have entries for colors, including '?'.\n\nSo, for left_rest, we can collect:\n\nleft_question = left_dict.get('?', [])\n\nleft_specific = [indices for color in left_dict if color != '?' for indices in left_dict[color]]\n\nWait, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, for the left_rest, after step 1, the left_dict has for each color (including '?') the list of indices not yet paired.\n\nSo, for step 3a:\n\nWe can collect all left '?' in left_question = left_dict['?'], and all right non-? in right_non_question = [indices for color in right_dict if color != '?' for indices in right_dict[color]].\n\nBut again, how to collect this. Alternatively, for step 3a, we can process the left '?' and pair them with right non-?.\n\nSo, for example, take the left_question list and the right_non_question list.\n\nBut how to collect the right_non_question list. Well, for each color in right_dict except '?', we can collect all their elements.\n\nBut perhaps, for step 3a, we can collect all right non-? elements from the right_dict.\n\nSimilarly for step 3b.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nAfter step 1, the left_dict and right_dict have the remaining elements. For step 3a, we can take all left '?' and pair them with right non-?.\n\nSo, for the left_question list, we can take each element and pair it with a right non-? element. How to get the right non-? elements.\n\nWe can collect all the right non-? elements into a list, and then pair as many as possible.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nright_non_q = []\nfor color in right_dict:\n    if color != '?':\n        right_non_q.extend(right_dict[color])\n\nSimilarly for left_non_q.\n\nBut this may take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have right_non_q, we can pair each left '?' with a right_non_q element.\n\nBut how to do this. For example, take the first len(left_question) elements from right_non_q, and pair them.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the right_non_q elements are not already used. Wait, but after step 1, the right_non_q elements are those that are not yet paired. So, for example, if right_dict has color 'a' with some elements, which were not paired in step 1 (because the left had more 'a's than the right, or vice versa), then they are in the right_non_q list.\n\nSo, for step 3a:\n\nTake the left_question list (all left ?s not yet paired) and the right_non_q list (all right non-?s not yet paired). The number of pairs is min(len(left_question), len(right_non_q)).\n\nFor each pair, we can pair a left '?' with a right non-?.\n\nSo, for i in 0 to m-1:\n\npair left_question[i] with right_non_q[i]\n\nThen, we need to remove those elements from the respective lists.\n\nBut again, how to manage this. For example, after pairing, the left_question list can be truncated (since those elements are now paired), and the right_non_q list can be truncated similarly.\n\nBut how to collect the right_non_q list. Because after step 1, the right_dict has for each color (except ?) the remaining elements. So, perhaps, for step 3a, we can collect all right_non_q elements as follows:\n\nright_non_q = []\nfor color in right_dict:\n    if color != '?':\n        right_non_q.extend(right_dict[color])\n\nBut then, after pairing, we can remove the first m elements from right_non_q. However, this would not affect the right_dict, which is needed for step 3b. Wait, but after step 3a, we have paired some elements from the right_non_q, which are part of the right_dict's entries. So, perhaps this approach is not correct, because modifying the right_non_q list doesn't update the right_dict.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the approach of collecting the right_non_q and left_non_q as separate lists is not feasible, because we need to track which elements are used in the right_dict and left_dict.\n\nAlternative idea: after step 1, for the left and right, the remaining elements are stored in their respective dictionaries. So for step 3a, we can process the left '?'s and pair them with the right non-?s.\n\nTo do this, we can iterate through all the colors in the right_dict except '?', and for each color, take the elements in the right_dict[color] and pair them with left '?'s.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor example, for each color in right_dict (excluding '?'), we can take all the elements in right_dict[color], and pair them with left '?'s. For each such element, if there are any left '?'s left, we can pair them.\n\nSo, the code could be something like:\n\nleft_question = left_dict.get('?', [])\nremaining_left_question = list(left_question)  # copy\n\nfor color in right_dict:\n    if color == '?':\n        continue\n    right_list = right_dict[color]\n    for idx in right_list:\n        if remaining_left_question:\n            pair (remaining_left_question[0], idx)\n            remaining_left_question.pop(0)\n        else:\n            break\n\nBut this would pair the right non-? elements with left '?'s, but in the order of the colors processed. However, this may not be optimal, but since the problem allows any valid pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, for step 3b, we can process the right '?'s and pair them with left non-? elements.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left '?'s and right '?'s can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left and right '?'s.\n\nSo, after step 3a and 3b, the left_question list (original) would have some elements left, and the right_question list (from right_dict) would have some elements left.\n\nSo, for step 3c, we can pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to track the remaining elements.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps, instead of trying to modify the dictionaries, we can collect all the remaining elements for left and right into separate lists, and then process them.\n\nBut let's think of the entire process as follows:\n\nAfter step 1, for left and right, we have some unpaired elements. Let's collect all the left unpaired elements into left_unpaired, and all the right unpaired elements into right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for step 3a, process the left_unpaired's '?' with the right_unpaired's non-?.\n\nBut how to collect the left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nWell, after step 1, for each color in left_dict and right_dict, the lists contain the unpaired elements. So, to collect all left_unpaired elements, we can do:\n\nleft_unpaired = []\nfor color in left_dict:\n    left_unpaired.extend(left_dict[color])\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nBut then, the left_unpaired and right_unpaired lists contain all the unpaired elements. However, this would include both '?' and other colors.\n\nBut then, how to process step 3a, 3b, and 3c.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nOnce step 1 is done, collect all left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nThen, create two lists:\n\nleft_questions = [x for x in left_unpaired if l[x-1] == '?']\nleft_others = [x for x in left_unpaired if l[x-1] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_questions and right_others.\n\nWait, but how to know the color of the element in left_unpaired. Because the left_unpaired is constructed from the left_dict, which groups elements by color. So, for example, the left_unpaired list contains elements from left_dict's colors. But when we collect left_questions, we can check the color of each element. However, since the left_unpaired is constructed from the left_dict, which groups by color, perhaps the elements in left_unpaired are from colors that are either '?' or others.\n\nBut perhaps, for the left_unpaired list, the elements are in the left_dict, which is grouped by color. So, for example, if the left_dict has a color 'a', then all elements in left_dict['a'] are 'a's. So, when we collect left_unpaired, which is all elements from left_dict, the elements can be grouped by their color.\n\nBut regardless, for the left_unpaired, each element's color is known based on the original l string.\n\nSo, for example, for each element in left_unpaired, its color is l[element-1].\n\nBut perhaps during step 1, we have already processed the color-specific pairs, and the left_unpaired includes all remaining elements.\n\nBut regardless, to collect the left_questions and left_others, we can loop through the left_unpaired list.\n\nOnce we have left_questions and left_others, and right_questions and right_others, then:\n\nStep 3a: pair left_questions with right_others.\n\nThe number of pairs is min(len(left_questions), len(right_others)).\n\nWe can pair the first m elements of left_questions with the first m elements of right_others.\n\nThen, for step 3b: pair right_questions with left_others.\n\nThe number of pairs is min(len(right_questions), len(left_others)).\n\nThen, for step 3c: pair left_questions (remaining after step 3a) with right_questions (remaining after step 3b).\n\nThe number of pairs is min(len(remaining_left_questions), len(remaining_right_questions)).\n\nBut how to track the remaining elements after each step.\n\nLet me think of the code steps:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nleft_questions = []\nleft_others = []\nfor idx in left_unpaired:\n    if l[idx-1] == '?':\n        left_questions.append(idx)\n    else:\n        left_others.append(idx)\n\nSimilarly for right_questions and right_others.\n\nThen:\n\n# Step 3a: pair left questions with right others\nm = min(len(left_questions), len(right_others))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pair (left_questions[i], right_others[i])\n\n# Now, remaining_left_questions = left_questions[m:]\n# remaining_right_others = right_others[m:]\n\n# Step 3b: pair right questions with left others\nm = min(len(right_questions), len(left_others))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pair (left_others[i], right_questions[i])\n\n# Now, remaining_left_others = left_others[m:]\n# remaining_right_questions = right_questions[m:]\n\n# Step 3c: pair remaining left questions and right questions\nm = min(len(remaining_left_questions), len(remaining_right_questions))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pair (remaining_left_questions[i], remaining_right_questions[i])\n\nBut wait, the order of steps 3a and 3b is important. Because if we pair left questions with right others first, then the right others are reduced, and then pair right questions with left others.\n\nBut this approach may not capture all possibilities, but since the problem allows any valid pairing, it's acceptable.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining elements after each step.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can do:\n\nAfter step 3a, the left_questions is left_questions[m:], and the right_others is right_others[m:].\n\nBut in code, we can create copies of the lists and process them.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining elements.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the lists in-place.\n\nBut perhaps, in code, the steps would be:\n\nleft_questions = list of left '?'s\nright_others = list of right non-?s\n\npair as many as possible between left_questions and right_others.\n\nFor example:\n\npairs = []\ni = 0\nj = 0\nwhile i < len(left_questions) and j < len(right_others):\n    pairs.append( (left_questions[i], right_others[j]) )\n    i += 1\n    j += 1\n\nThen, the remaining left_questions are left_questions[i:], and remaining right_others are right_others[j:].\n\nSimilarly for step 3b.\n\nBut how to collect the right_questions and left_others.\n\nBut the problem is that the right_questions and left_others are not stored as separate lists, but are part of the right_unpaired and left_unpaired.\n\nBut perhaps, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect left_unpaired and right_unpaired as lists.\n\nThen, separate them into left_questions, left_others, right_questions, right_others.\n\nThen, process the steps.\n\nBut how to collect left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nBut after step 1, the left_dict and right_dict contain the unpaired elements for each color. So, for example, for left_unpaired, we can collect all elements from left_dict.values().\n\nIn Python, for example:\n\nleft_unpaired = []\nfor color in left_dict:\n    left_unpaired.extend(left_dict[color])\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nOnce we have left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we can process them as described.\n\nBut this approach may not be efficient for very large n, but given that n is up to 150,000, and each element is processed once, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is how to collect the left_questions, left_others, right_questions, right_others.\n\nBut for each element in left_unpaired, we can check its color. For example, for idx in left_unpaired:\n\ncolor = l[idx-1]\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nBut in the case of left_unpaired, since the elements were collected from the left_dict, which is grouped by color, perhaps the color is already known. However, since after step 1, the left_dict may have been modified, it's safer to check the original l string.\n\nBut for the purpose of code, perhaps the original l and r strings are stored, and for any index, we can check their color.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce step 1 is done, collect all left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for left_unpaired:\n\nleft_questions = [idx for idx in left_unpaired if l[idx-1] == '?']\nleft_others = [idx for idx in left_unpaired if l[idx-1] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired:\n\nright_questions = [idx for idx in right_unpaired if r[idx-1] == '?']\nright_others = [idx for idx in right_unpaired if r[idx-1] != '?']\n\nThen, process step 3a, 3b, 3c.\n\nBut then, after step 3a, the left_questions and right_others are being paired. So, the code can do:\n\ni = 0\nj = 0\nwhile i < len(left_questions) and j < len(right_others):\n    pairs.append( (left_questions[i], right_others[j]) )\n    i += 1\n    j += 1\n\nThen, after this, the remaining left_questions are left_questions[i:], and the remaining right_others are right_others[j:].\n\nBut for step 3b, we need to pair the right_questions with left_others.\n\nSo, we take the right_questions and left_others.\n\nAgain:\n\nk = 0\nl = 0\nwhile k < len(right_questions) and l < len(left_others):\n    pairs.append( (left_others[l], right_questions[k]) )\n    k += 1\n    l += 1\n\nThen, after this, the remaining right_questions are right_questions[k:], and the remaining left_others are left_others[l:].\n\nFinally, step 3c: pair the remaining left_questions and right_questions.\n\nSo, take the remaining left_questions (after step 3a) and right_questions (after step 3b), and pair them as much as possible.\n\nSo, for i in range( min(len(remaining_left_questions), len(remaining_right_questions)) ):\n\npairs.append( (remaining_left_questions[i], remaining_right_questions[i]) )\n\nBut how to track the remaining_left_questions and remaining_right_questions.\n\nIn code:\n\nAfter step 3a, the remaining left_questions is left_questions[i:].\n\nSimilarly, after step 3b, the remaining right_questions is right_questions[k:].\n\nSo, for step 3c:\n\nremaining_left_questions = left_questions[i:]\nremaining_right_questions = right_questions[k:]\n\nm = min(len(remaining_left_questions), len(remaining_right_questions))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pairs.append( (remaining_left_questions[i], remaining_right_questions[i]) )\n\nBut this approach would pair them in order.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut what about the order in which we process the steps. For example, if we first pair left_questions with right_others, then right_questions with left_others, and then the remaining.\n\nThis should cover all possibilities.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n, l, r.\n\n- Create left_dict and right_dict.\n\n- Process step 1: pair specific colors.\n\n- Collect left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\n- Split into questions and others.\n\n- Process step 3a, 3b, 3c.\n\nBut how to implement the step 1 pairing.\n\nLet me think of the code for step 1:\n\nInitialize left_dict and right_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    color = l[i]\n\n    left_dict[color].append(i+1)  # 1-based index\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    color = r[i]\n\n    right_dict[color].append(i+1)\n\nThen, for each color in left_dict and right_dict, except '?', we can process.\n\nBut how to iterate over all colors that are present in both left and right.\n\nWait, but for step 1, we need to process all colors except '?', and for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut for example, for color 'a', if it exists in left_dict and right_dict, then pair min(len(left_dict['a']), len(right_dict['a'])) pairs.\n\nBut if a color exists only in left_dict or only in right_dict, then no pairs.\n\nSo, for step 1, we can iterate through all colors that are not '?', and for each color, check if it's present in both left and right.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color in left_dict:\n\nif color is not '?', and color is in right_dict:\n\nthen process.\n\nBut to avoid processing the same color multiple times, perhaps we can iterate through all possible colors (a-z), but since the input can have any letters, perhaps it's better to collect all colors present in left_dict and right_dict.\n\nAlternatively, for each color in left_dict:\n\nif color != '?', and color is in right_dict:\n\nthen process.\n\nBut in code, for example:\n\nfor color in list(left_dict.keys()):\n\n    if color == '?':\n\n        continue\n\n    if color in right_dict:\n\n        left_list = left_dict[color]\n\n        right_list = right_dict[color]\n\n        m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(m):\n\n            pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n        # Remove the first m elements from left and right lists.\n\n        left_dict[color] = left_list[m:]\n\n        right_dict[color] = right_list[m:]\n\nWait, but in Python, the left_dict[color] is a list. So, after pairing, we can reassign the list to the remaining elements.\n\nBut this is possible.\n\nBut in Python, when you assign left_dict[color] = left_list[m:], you are replacing the list with the remaining elements.\n\nThis way, after step 1, the left_dict and right_dict have the remaining elements for each color.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce this is done, we can collect the left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nleft_unpaired = []\n\nfor color in left_dict:\n\n    left_unpaired.extend(left_dict[color])\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nBut after step 1, the left_dict contains the remaining elements for each color.\n\nOnce we have left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we can split into questions and others.\n\nNow, the code for step 3a, 3b, 3c.\n\nOnce all pairs are collected, the code can print the count and the pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the pairs in the code.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_dict and right_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    left_dict[l[i]].append(i+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    right_dict[r[i]].append(i+1)\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 1: process specific colors.\n\nfor color in list(left_dict.keys()):\n\n    if color == '?':\n\n        continue\n\n    if color in right_dict:\n\n        left_list = left_dict[color]\n\n        right_list = right_dict[color]\n\n        m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(m):\n\n            pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n        # Truncate the lists.\n\n        left_dict[color] = left_list[m:]\n\n        right_dict[color] = right_list[m:]\n\n# Now collect left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nleft_unpaired = []\n\nfor color in left_dict:\n\n    left_unpaired.extend(left_dict[color])\n\nright_unpaired = []\n\nfor color in right_dict:\n\n    right_unpaired.extend(right_dict[color])\n\n# Now split into questions and others.\n\nleft_questions = [idx for idx in left_unpaired if l[idx-1] == '?']\nleft_others = [idx for idx in left_unpaired if l[idx-1] != '?']\n\nright_questions = [idx for idx in right_unpaired if r[idx-1] == '?']\nright_others = [idx for idx in right_unpaired if r[idx-1] != '?']\n\n# Step 3a: pair left questions with right others.\n\ni = 0\n\nj = 0\n\nwhile i < len(left_questions) and j < len(right_others):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_questions[i], right_others[j]) )\n\n    i += 1\n\n    j += 1\n\n# Step 3b: pair right questions with left others.\n\ni = 0",
