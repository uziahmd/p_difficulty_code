For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to represent the notes and calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order. Let me think about the order. The problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, in the problem description, the list is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, and after H comes C again. So there are 12 notes in total.\n\nSo each note can be mapped to an index from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc. Then, H would be 11. Then, when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the scale. For example, the distance between C (0) and E (4) is 4 semitones. But if we have E to C, since it's the other way around, the distance would be 8 semitones? Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So when you have two notes, the distance is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but only if you go forward? Or maybe it's the minimal distance? Wait no, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because the distance is calculated as moving from the lower note to the higher note. Wait, but how do you determine which is lower? Because the notes are arranged cyclically. So perhaps the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is measured as the number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) mod 12? No, because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So maybe the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, otherwise (Y - X + 12). Wait, but how to determine which is higher? Because in the cyclic order, each note has a next note. So for example, the distance between H (11) and C (0) is 1 semitone. Because moving from H to C is one step. So the way to calculate the distance between two notes is (y_index - x_index) mod 12? No, because if x is C (0) and y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. If x is E (4) and y is C (0), then the distance would be (0 -4 + 12) = 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x +12). Which can be written as (y -x) % 12? Wait, no. Because (y -x) mod 12 gives the same as (y -x) if positive. For example, if y is 0 and x is 4, (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between X and Y, the distance is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the scale. So if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So that's the formula.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, the problem says: the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So for example, H is index 11. So I can create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. For example, note_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']? Wait, but what about B and H? Wait, the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, so B is before H. So the order is as follows:\n\nLet me list them:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nYes. So B is index 10, H is index 11. So for example, the distance between B (10) and H (11) is 1 semitone. The distance between H and B is (10 - 11) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11 semitones. Which makes sense, since moving from H to B would require going backwards, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if you have H and B, which is lower? Well, H is index 11, B is 10. So moving from B to H is 1 semitone. Moving from H to B would be 11 semitones. But according to the problem's example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's check that. E is index 4. C is 0. So (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first thing is to create a mapping from note names to their indexes. So I can create a list, and then a dictionary. For example:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, note_to_index = {note: index for index, note in enumerate(note_order)}.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, I can get their indexes, compute the distance between them as (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Wait, but in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y. So for example, X is C and Y is E: 4 semitones. So the distance is (y -x) mod 12. But in that case, (4 -0) mod 12 is 4. Correct. For X being E and Y being C, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So that's the way to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nNow, the problem says that a major triad is when the three notes can be ordered such that X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3 semitones. So the total from X to Z is 7 semitones. Similarly, minor is when X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have a distance of 3. Or for minor, 3 and 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where a chord is both major and minor.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances). For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major triad. Similarly, check for minor (distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4). If none of the permutations satisfy either condition, then it's strange.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. However, for each permutation, the order of the three notes could be checked. But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the distances between X and Y is 4, Y and Z is 3. So the total from X to Z is 7. But since the order is X-Y-Z, the distance from X to Z is 4+3=7. However, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Z is 7 semitones. But that's not directly needed for checking, since the problem defines the major triad based on the distances between X and Y, and Y and Z.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the three notes. Let's say they are stored in a list called notes.\n\n2. For each permutation of the three notes, check if the first two have a distance of 4 and the next two have a distance of 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then return 'major'.\n\n3. Similarly, check for each permutation if the first two have a distance of 3 and the next two have a distance of 4. If any permutation satisfies this, return 'minor'.\n\n4. If neither is found, return 'strange'.\n\nSo the key is generating all permutations of the three notes and checking for these conditions.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) would generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nBut since the three notes are given as a list, perhaps we can generate all possible permutations of the three elements. For example, for notes [A, B, C], the permutations would be all 6 possible orderings.\n\nNow, for each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\nCheck if distance(X,Y) ==4 and distance(Y,Z) ==3 → major.\n\nCheck if distance(X,Y) ==3 and distance(Y,Z) ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met in any permutation, then the answer is accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Create the note_to_index mapping.\n\n- For the given three notes, generate all permutations.\n\n- For each permutation, check for major and minor conditions.\n\n- If any permutation meets the major condition, return 'major'.\n\n- If any permutation meets the minor condition, return 'minor'.\n\n- Else, 'strange'.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nFirst case: C, E, G.\n\nPermutations would include (C, E, G). Let's check:\n\ndistance(C, E) is 4 (correct). distance(E, G) is 2? Wait, E is index 4, G is index 7. 7-4=3. So yes. So the distance between E and G is 3. So this permutation meets the major condition. So the answer is major.\n\nSecond case: C#, B, F.\n\nLooking for permutations. Let's take B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\ndistance(B, C#) → B is index 10, C# is 1. (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3? Let me compute. (1 -10) = -9. mod 12 is 3. So yes, distance between B and C# is 3. Then distance between C# and F: F is index 5. 5 - 1 = 4. So yes. So this permutation (B, C#, F) meets the minor condition. So answer is minor.\n\nThird case: A, B, H.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's see:\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nLet's take permutation A, B, H. Distance between A and B is 1. Between B and H is 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. Distance between B and H is 1. H to A is (9 - 11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. No. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B. Distance A to H is 2 (11-9=2). Then H to B is (10 -11) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. Distance between H and A is (9 - 11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. Distance between B and A is (9 -10) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. Distance between H and B is (10 -11) mod 12 → 11. No. So none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is strange.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code needs to generate all permutations and check for each.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the input for the first sample is \"C E G\".\n\nBut in the example given, the input is a list of three strings, but in reality, the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the input could be something like 'C E G' (as a single line). So in code, we can read the input line, split into three parts.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for example, for the first sample input, notes would be ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nNext, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut wait, what about the note 'H'? In the note_order list, it's the last element, index 11.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the three notes, check the distances.\n\nSo, for each perm in permutations(notes):\n\nX, Y, Z = perm\n\ndistance_xy = (note_to_index[Y] - note_to_index[X]) % 12\n\ndistance_yz = (note_to_index[Z] - note_to_index[Y]) % 12\n\nif distance_xy ==4 and distance_yz ==3 → major.\n\nif distance_xy ==3 and distance_yz ==4 → minor.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check these conditions.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code would:\n\nimport itertools\n\nthen:\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none are found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after checking all permutations, we need to check if any of them triggered the major or minor. So, in code:\n\nWe can loop through all permutations, and check for the conditions. Once any of the conditions is found, we can immediately return the answer.\n\nBut in Python, for the code, perhaps:\n\nOnce we find a permutation that meets the major condition, we can return 'major' immediately. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, after checking all permutations, return 'strange'.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, return 'major'.\n\nIf any permutation meets minor, return 'minor'.\n\nElse, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what about the case where multiple permutations meet the condition? But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So there's no case where a chord is both major and minor. So once any permutation meets the condition, we can return the answer.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # compute distance between x and y\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n    # compute distance between y and z\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input for the second case is 'C# B F'. Let's see:\n\nThe permutation (B, C#, F) would be checked. Let's compute:\n\nx is B (index 10), y is C# (index 1). d1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then z is F (index 5). d2 = (5 - 1) mod 12 = 4. So yes, d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nYes. So the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's test another case. What if the notes are in a different order?\n\nFor example, the first sample input is C, E, G. The permutation (C, E, G) gives d1 = 4, d2=3 → major. So code returns major.\n\nAnother example: the notes are E, G, C. Let's see. Permutation (E, G, C). d1 between E and G is (7-4) = 3 mod 12 → 3. d2 between G and C is (0 -7) mod 12 = 5? Wait, note_to_index[C] is 0, note_to_index[G] is 7. So (0 -7) mod 12 is 5? Wait, no. Wait, for d2, the code computes (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) mod 12. So z is C (0), y is G (7). 0 -7 = -7 mod 12 is 5. So d2 is 5. So that permutation would not trigger any condition. But another permutation (E, C, G) would have d1 between E and C: (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Not 3 or 4. But the correct permutation is (C, E, G) which is checked.\n\nSo the code would find it.\n\nAnother test case: let's say the notes are C, E, G. The code checks all permutations, including (C, E, G) which meets the major condition.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: what if the notes are C, E, G#. Let's see. For any permutation, does it meet major or minor? Let's check:\n\nC, E, G# → distance between C and E is 4. E to G# is (8 -4) = 4. So d1=4, d2=4 → no. So not major. For minor, need 3 and 4. So no. So output strange.\n\nSo code would return strange.\n\nWhat about a minor triad? Let's take B, C#, F. The permutation (B, C#, F) would have d1=3, d2=4. So code returns minor.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same note is repeated? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But for example, if all three notes are same, then the code would check permutations, but the distances would be zero. So code would return strange.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a valid chord. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so perhaps the input will not have duplicates. However, the code can handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nInput: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut the actual input is a single line with three notes. For example, for the first case, the input is 'C E G'.\n\nSo the code would process each of the three cases. But in the sample input, the user provided three test cases, but the problem says that the input is one line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes.\n\nSo the sample input given is probably for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut the output is ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of input. So the code is supposed to read one line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct as written.\n\nBut in the problem statement's example, the input is given as a list of three examples, but that's just for illustration. The actual code is supposed to read a single line of input, which is three notes.\n\nThus, the code as written should be correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code uses itertools.permutations, which is part of the standard library. So we need to import itertools.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, the exit() function may not be the best practice. However, for code submission, using sys.exit() would be better, but in code submission, returning early can be done via break and flags. However, in Python, the code can use return, but since it's a script, perhaps using sys.exit() is better. However, in the code, the code is written as a script. So for example, in the code, after printing, we can exit. However, in Python, the exit() function is in the sys module. So perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nWait, the code as written uses exit(), which in Python is a built-in function, but it's actually from the sys module. However, in some environments, exit() may not be available. To make sure, perhaps using sys.exit() is better. So modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes, that would work.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note is present multiple times? For example, input is C C C. Then, all permutations would have d1 and d2 as 0. So code would print 'strange'.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the notes are C, E, B. Let's see. Let's check permutations. For example, C, E, B. d1 between C and E is 4. d2 between E and B: B is index 10. E is 4. (10 -4) mod 12 = 6. So no. Another permutation: E, B, C. d1 between E and B is (10-4) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation: B, C, E. d1 between B and C is (0 -10) mod 12 → ( -10 ) mod 12 = 2. No. So no match. So output strange.\n\nAnother example: C, E, Bb. Wait, but Bb is not in the note list. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So Bb is not present. So the code doesn't have to handle that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note into an index based on its position in the cyclic musical scale.

For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the semitone distance between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Determine Triad Type**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major triad (distance of 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones), print \"major\". Similarly, check for a minor triad (distance of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If neither is found, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index for quick lookup.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three input notes are generated. Each permutation is checked to see if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly from H back to C.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, the distances between the first and second notes, and between the second and third notes are checked. If they match the criteria for a major or minor triad, the respective result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
