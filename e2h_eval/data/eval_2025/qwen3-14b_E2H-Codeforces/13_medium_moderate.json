For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position in this list, and the distance between two notes is the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the list. For example, from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if the notes are reversed, like E to C, then since it's cyclic, the distance would be 8 semitones (since there's 12 total notes, so 12 - 4 = 8? Or maybe I need to compute the difference modulo 12? Wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper one. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is the number of semitones when you go from X to Y via the cycle. Wait, no. The problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the distance along the musical scale from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance would be 8 semitones because you have to go E -> F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). So that's 8 semitones.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Let me think. Each note can be assigned an index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's say the order is:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo each note has an index from 0 to 11. Then, for two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12? No, wait. Because if X is before Y, then the distance is y_index - x_index. If X is after Y, then the distance would be (12 - x_index + y_index) ? For example, if X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0). Then the distance from E to C would be (0 -4 + 12) = 8? Which matches the example. So yes. So the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) if positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Alternatively, (y_index - x_index) % 12. Wait, but if X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0-4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So perhaps the distance is always the minimal number of semitones when moving upwards. But no, the example says that between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because when you go from E up to C, you have to loop around. So the distance is calculated as the number of steps from X to Y when moving forward in the cyclic order. So regardless of whether Y is higher or lower than X, the distance is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But that's not correct. Because for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. Which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as from the lower to the upper. So maybe the distance is the minimal steps when moving forward. But according to the example given, the distance between E and C is 8, which is the longer path. So perhaps the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the upward direction, not the minimal. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y is after x, otherwise (y_index -x_index + 12). So that's the same as (y_index -x_index) mod 12, but only when considering the direction. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones when you go from X up to Y, which would be (y_index + 12 - x_index) ?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nSo for example, when you have two notes, the distance from X to Y is calculated as follows: if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones when you go from X up to Y, which would be 12 - (X's position - Y's position) ?\n\nWait, for example, X is E (position 4), Y is C (position 0). Since X is higher than Y, the distance is 8 semitones. Which is 12 - (4 - 0) = 8. So that's the formula. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's position - X's position) if Y is higher than X, else (Y's position + 12 - X's position). Which can be written as (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y_pos > X_pos, else (Y_pos - X_pos + 12). Alternatively, (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12? No, because if Y is lower than X, then (Y_pos - X_pos) is negative, and mod 12 would give the same as adding 12. For example, Y is 0, X is 4: 0 -4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is indeed (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So that's correct. So for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12.\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, when checking for major or minor triads, we need to find an ordering of the three notes such that the distance between the first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3 (for major), or between first and second is 3 and between second and third is 4 (for minor).\n\nSo the approach is: given three notes, generate all possible permutations of them (since the triad is unordered), and for each permutation, check if the first to second is 4, second to third is 3 (major), or first to second is 3, second to third is 4 (minor).\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them satisfy either condition.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their indices. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc.\n\n2. Read the three input notes.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the three notes (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n\n4. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\n5. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'; if any satisfies minor, output 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, since there are 3! = 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nSo for example, for the input ['C', 'E', 'G'], the permutations would include (C, E, G), which would have distances between C and E is 4 (correct), E to G is 3 (correct), so it's major.\n\nAnother example: the input is ['C#', 'B', 'F']. One of the permutations is B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\nB's index is 10 (since the list is ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']). Wait, let me make sure of the note order. The problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So indexes 0 to 11.\n\nSo B is at index 10, H is 11. So for B (10), C# is index 1. The distance from B to C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Which is correct. Then from C# (1) to F (5): 5-1=4. So that's 4. So that permutation is minor.\n\nSo for each permutation, check:\n\ndistance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3 → major.\n\nOR\n\ndistance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4 → minor.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- For each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   - compute d1 = distance between first and second.\n\n   - compute d2 = distance between second and third.\n\n   - check if (d1 ==4 and d2 ==3) → major.\n\n   - check if (d1 ==3 and d2 ==4) → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then output major. Similarly for minor. If none, output strange.\n\nNow, how to generate all permutations of the three notes. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nFirst, create a dictionary that maps note names to their indices. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then for each note, its index is the position in the list.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, for a note, say 'C#', its index is 1.\n\nOnce I have that, for each permutation of the three input notes, compute the distances.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the input. The input is three space-separated notes. For example, in the sample input, it's ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but the actual input is a single line with three notes. Wait, the problem says the input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So for example, the first example input is \"C E G\" (but in the sample input given, it's a list of three examples, but the actual input for the code is one line with three notes.)\n\nSo the code needs to read a line, split into three notes. For example:\n\ninput_line = input().strip()\n\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nSo for example, if the input is 'C E G', then notes is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, generate all permutations of these three notes.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\ncompute d1 = distance between x and y.\n\ncompute d2 = distance between y and z.\n\nCheck if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nCheck if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nImplement the note to index mapping.\n\nThen, for the three notes, generate all permutations.\n\nNow, for each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nOnce any of the permutations meets the major or minor condition, return accordingly.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nImplementing the distance function.\n\ndef get_distance(note1, note2):\n\n    index1 = note_to_index[note1]\n\n    index2 = note_to_index[note2]\n\n    return (index2 - index1) % 12\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. But the way we compute here is (index2 - index1) mod 12. Which gives the correct value. For example, between C (0) and E (4): 4-0=4 mod 12 is 4. Between E (4) and C (0): (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes, this function returns the correct distance.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the note_to_index can be built as a dictionary:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut need to make sure that the note names are exactly as given. For example, 'C#' is present, and 'B' is present, etc.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nOnce the three notes are read, generate all permutations of them. For each permutation, check for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, we can return 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = input().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    # generate all permutations of the three notes\n    perms = itertools.permutations(notes)\n    for perm in perms:\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n        d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n        if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So once any permutation meets the condition, we can return. Because the problem says that there are no chords that are both major and minor.\n\nBut for example, if a permutation meets both conditions (which is impossible?), but the problem says that the answer is unique. So the code can check for the first occurrence of major or minor and return.\n\nBut let's think: for a given permutation, can it satisfy both conditions? For example, if d1=4 and d2=3, then it's major. But for the same permutation, can d1=3 and d2=4? No. Because 4 and 3 are different from 3 and 4. So for a permutation, only one of the conditions can be true.\n\nBut in code, for each permutation, check first for major, then for minor. If any permutation meets major, return. Else, check for minor. If any permutation meets minor, return. Else, strange.\n\nBut the code above checks for each permutation, and returns as soon as any permutation meets major or minor.\n\nBut for example, if one permutation is major, and another permutation is minor, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so that can't happen. So the code is safe.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output: ['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's take the first case: 'C E G'.\n\nPermutations include (C, E, G). For this:\n\nd1 = E - C = 4-0=4 mod12=4. d2 = G - E = 7-4=3. So 4 and 3 → major. So returns 'major'.\n\nSecond case: 'C# B F'.\n\nLooking for permutations. One of them is B, C#, F. Let's compute:\n\nB is index 10. C# is index 1. So d1 = 1 - 10 = -9 mod 12 = 3. Then, C# to F: F is index 5. 5 - 1 =4. So d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nThird case: 'A B H'.\n\nNotes are A, B, H. Let's check all permutations.\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nA, B, H: d1 = B - A = 10-9=1. d2 = H - B = 11-10=1. Not 3/4 or 4/3.\n\nA, H, B: d1 = H - A = 11-9=2. d2 = B - H = 10 - 11 = -1 mod12=11. No.\n\nB, A, H: d1 = A - B → 9 -10 = -1 mod12=11. No.\n\nB, H, A: d1 = H - B = 11-10=1. d2 = A - H → 9-11 = -2 mod12=10. No.\n\nH, A, B: d1 = A - H → 9-11 = -2 → 10. No.\n\nH, B, A: d1 = B - H → 10-11 = -1 → 11. d2 = A - B → 9-10 = -1 → 11. No.\n\nOther permutations?\n\nWhat about B, A, H?\n\nd1 is A - B → (9-10) mod12 = 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. d1 is H - B = 1. d2 is A - H → 9-11 = -2 mod12=10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: A, B, H → d1=1, d2=1.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A: d1 is B - H → (10 -11) mod12 = 11. d2 is A - B → 9-10 = -1 mod12=11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the criteria. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about a chord that is both major and minor? According to the problem statement, there are no such cases. So the code can safely check for major first, then minor.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G → major.\n\nAnother test case: C#, B, F → minor.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G# → ?\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nC (0), E (4), G# (8). d1 is 4, d2 is 8-4=4. So 4 and 4 → not major or minor.\n\nAnother permutation: E, G#, C. d1 = G# - E = 8-4=4. d2 = C - G# → (0 -8) mod12 = 4. So 4 and 4 again. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, G#. d1 = C - E → (0 -4) mod12 = 8. Not 3 or 4.\n\nSo no, this would be strange.\n\nAnother example: C, D#, G → check if it's minor.\n\nLet me think. Let's take permutation C, D#, G. d1 is D# (3) - C (0) → 3. d2 is G (7) - D# (3) → 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So this would be minor.\n\nSo code would output minor.\n\nAnother example: C, D#, G → minor.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses itertools.permutations. So for three elements, it generates 6 permutations. For each, check the two conditions.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that the input is read as a single line. For example, if the input is 'C E G', then split into three elements.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n        d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about the case where the same note is repeated? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes, but I guess that they can be same? But according to the problem statement, a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they can be same. However, in that case, the code would check permutations, but for example, if all three are same note, then d1 and d2 would be zero, so output strange.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input. For example, the first input is 'C E G' → code returns major.\n\nAnother sample input is 'C# B F' → the code would generate permutations, and one of them is B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\nx is B, y is C#, z is F.\n\nnote_to_index['B'] is 10, note_to_index['C#'] is 1. So d1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then note_to_index['F'] is 5. d2 = 5 - 1 = 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns minor.\n\nThird example: 'A B H' → code returns strange.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible test case: 'C# E G' → check if it's major or minor. Let's see:\n\nPossible permutation: C#, E, G.\n\nd1 = E (4) - C# (1) → 3. d2 = G (7) - E (4) → 3. So 3 and 3. Not. Another permutation: E, G, C#. d1 is G - E = 3, d2 is C# - G → (1 -7) mod12 = 6. No. Another permutation: C#, G, E. d1 = G - C# = 7-1=6. No. So no. So output strange.\n\nAnother example: 'C E G#'. Let's check. For permutation C, E, G#: d1=4, d2= (G# is 8) - 4 = 4. So 4 and 4. Not. Another permutation: E, G#, C. d1 is 8-4=4. d2 is C - G# → 0 -8 = -8 mod12=4. So again 4 and 4. So no. So output strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C D# G' → as discussed earlier. Permutation C, D#, G. d1 is D# (3) - C (0) = 3. d2 is G (7) - D# (3) = 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So output minor.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, note that the note_order list must be exactly as given in the problem statement.\n\nYes, the note_order is as per the problem description: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a predefined list of notes ordered by their positions in the musical scale.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is computed as the difference modulo 12, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad:\n   - A major triad has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor triad has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, print the corresponding result. If none do, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n        d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Representation**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of notes in the musical scale, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n- **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are considered. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are checked against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n- **Result Determination**: The first permutation that meets the criteria for a major or minor triad determines the result, ensuring efficient checking without redundant computations. If no valid permutation is found, the result is \"strange\".",
