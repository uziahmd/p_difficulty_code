Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn will leave another burned-out candle. So the process is like: burn candles, collect the remains, make new ones, repeat until he can't make any more.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nStart with 4 candles. Burn them all, that's 4 hours. Now he has 4 burned candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. Burn those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned ones. Make 2/2 = 1 new. Burn that, +1 hour. Now he has 1 burned, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 candles. Burn them, 6 hours. Now 6 burned. 6 /3 = 2 new. Burn them, +2 hours. Now 2 burned. Not enough to make another (since 2 < 3). So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours and the number of burned candles. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, total_hours = a. Because he burns all the initial candles. Then, the number of burned candles is a. Then, while the number of burned candles is >= b, he can make new candles.\n\nBut wait, each time he makes new candles, he uses up 'b' burned ones to make 1 new. So for each group of b burned, he gets 1 new. Then, that new candle is burned, adding 1 hour, and then becomes another burned candle.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until burned is less than b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me test this logic with the first example.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4. burned is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total_hours becomes 4+2=6. burned is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new_candles = 2//2=1. total_hours is 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1 =1. Now, 1 <2. Exit loop. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6. burned is 6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. burned is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So exit. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial hours is 5. burned is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burned is 0 +1=1. Now can't make more. So total is 6.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total_hours=5. burned=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//2=2, total becomes 5+2=7. burned is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nNext loop: 3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. burned is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nNext loop: 2//2=1. total is 8+1=9. burned is 0+1=1. Now stop. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually. Initial 5 candles: 5 hours. Burned 5. Make 2 new (using 4), leaving 1. Burn those 2: +2 hours. Now burned is 2 (from those two) +1 (leftover from first step) =3. Then make 1 new (using 2 of them), leaving 1. Burn that 1: +1. Now burned is 1 (from that) +1 (left",
