In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For each input of three tiles, I have to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal draws needed.\n\nLet me break down the problem into steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. How?\n\nFor a triplet: all three tiles must be the same. So check if all three are same. Like 9m 9m 9m.\n\nFor a sequence: they must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. Like 1s 2s 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So, for the three tiles, we need to check if they are in the same suit and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo first, I need to process the three tiles. Let's think about how to represent them. For example, for each tile, extract the number and suit.\n\nSo for the three tiles, maybe I can split them into their components. Let's take each tile as a string. For example, '1s' has number 1, suit 's'.\n\nOnce I have the three tiles, I can check for both possibilities: triplet or sequence.\n\nIf either is true, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then I need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add. So what's the approach here?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios where the three tiles can be extended to a mentsu by adding some tiles.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can form a triplet with one more tile. For example, if two tiles are same, then adding one more would make a triplet. So if there are two same tiles, then need 1 more.\n\nBut wait, the current three tiles might not be a triplet. For example, if two are same, but third is different. Then adding one more same tile would make three. So that's one possibility.\n\nCase 2: The three tiles can form a sequence with adding one or two tiles. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s would form a sequence. So that's one tile. But if the three tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s, then adding 2s and 4s would form a sequence. Wait, but that's two tiles. However, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the three tiles can be part of a sequence, and adding one tile would complete it.\n\nSo for the sequence case, perhaps we need to check for possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nBut how do I approach this?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add, maybe we can consider all possibilities of whether the mentsu is a triplet or a sequence, and compute the minimal required.\n\nLet me think about the possible options:\n\nFirst, check if the current tiles can form a triplet. If not, then how many tiles are needed to make a triplet?\n\nSimilarly, check if the current tiles can form a sequence. If not, how many tiles are needed to make a sequence?\n\nThen take the minimum between the two options.\n\nBut how to calculate these?\n\nLet me think for the triplet case:\n\nFor the triplet, we need three same tiles. So, for the three given tiles, count the frequency of each tile.\n\nFor example, suppose the tiles are [a, a, b]. Then, to make a triplet, you can either add another a (so that there are three a's) or add two b's (but that would require two tiles). So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the existing tiles are two a's and one b. So to form a triplet, you can choose to form a triplet of a's by adding one, or a triplet of b's by adding two. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal required is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the current three.\n\nWait, for example, if the three tiles are all different, then max_count is 1. So 3 - 1 = 2. So you need to add two more tiles of the same type. But that's for forming a triplet.\n\nSo the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet is (3 - max_count). But since the current tiles may have multiple counts, like if two are same, then adding 1.\n\nSo for the triplet option, the required tiles is 3 - max_count.\n\nBut wait, what if the current three tiles have two of one kind and one of another. For example, two a's and one b. Then the max_count is 2. So 3-2=1. So adding one a would make three a's. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the required number is 3 - max_count.\n\nNow for the sequence case. How to compute the minimal tiles needed to form a sequence.\n\nThe sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, the three tiles must be in the same suit. So first, check if all three are in the same suit. If not, then even after adding tiles, you can't form a sequence. Because the sequence must be in same suit. So if the three tiles are in different suits, then forming a sequence is impossible unless you add tiles that are in same suit. Wait, but adding tiles can be in any suit. But to form a sequence, you need to have three consecutive numbers in same suit. So for example, if the three tiles are in different suits, then you can't form a sequence unless you add tiles to create three consecutive in a suit. But how?\n\nSo, for example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add tiles in one of the suits. Let's say you want to form a sequence in m. Then you need 1m, 2m, 3m. So you have 1m already, but need to add 2m and 3m. That would take two tiles. Or maybe in p: you have 2p, need 1p and 3p. Also two. Or in s: 3s, need 1s and 2s. Also two. So the minimal is 2. But maybe there's a better way. But in this case, no. So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut how to compute this for general cases?\n\nSo, for the sequence case, the approach is to check for each possible suit, how many tiles are present in that suit, and what their numbers are. Then determine how many tiles need to be added to form a consecutive sequence.\n\nBut since the original three tiles may have some in the same suit and others not, perhaps we need to consider the possible suits that can form a sequence.\n\nSo first, group the tiles by their suit. For each suit, collect the numbers present. Then, for each suit, check if there's a possible sequence that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nBut since the original three tiles may have some in a suit. For example, if there are two tiles in the same suit, then maybe adding one more tile to form a sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the steps for the sequence case.\n\nFirst, for each suit that has at least one tile in the original three, we can check if we can form a sequence by adding some tiles.\n\nFor example, suppose in a suit, the numbers are [1, 2]. Then, adding 3 would form a sequence. So that's one tile. Or adding 0? No, because numbers are 1-9. So the possible sequences are sequences of three consecutive numbers.\n\nSo for a given suit, let's collect all the numbers present in the original three tiles. Let's call this list S.\n\nThen, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers in that suit.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the possible ways. For example, S could be [1, 2], then adding 3 gives a sequence. So 1 tile. Or if S is [1, 3], then adding 2 gives a sequence. So 1 tile. If S is [1, 2, 4], then adding 3 gives a sequence. So 1 tile. If S is [1, 3, 5], then adding 2 and 4 would give a sequence (like 1,2,3) or (3,4,5), but that would take two tiles. Alternatively, adding 2,3,4, etc. Wait, but the problem is that the existing numbers may allow for some sequences with adding some tiles.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number of tiles to add for a given suit's numbers?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each suit, collect the numbers present in the original three tiles. Let's say the numbers are sorted. Then, for each possible triplet of consecutive numbers, check if the existing numbers can cover some parts of it, and how many tiles need to be added.\n\nBut maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as: what is the minimal number of tiles to add to the current set in a suit to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nFor example, if the current numbers in a suit are [1, 2], then the minimal is 1 (add 3).\n\nIf the current numbers are [1, 3], then the minimal is 1 (add 2).\n\nIf the current numbers are [1, 4], then adding 2 and 3 (for 1-2-3) or adding 5 (for 4-5-6?), but that would require 2 tiles. Wait, but maybe 1,4, and adding 2 and 3 would form 1,2,3. Or adding 5 and 6 to get 4,5,6. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think: the existing numbers are 1 and 4. What is the minimal tiles to add to get a sequence.\n\nWe can form a sequence of 1,2,3 (needs 2 tiles) or 2,3,4 (needs 2 tiles) or 4,5,6 (needs 2 tiles). So minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: current numbers are [2, 3, 5]. What's the minimal tiles to add? Well, 2,3,4 (need 1 tile: 4). Or 3,4,5 (need 1 tile:4). So minimal is 1.\n\nSo how to compute this?\n\nFor a given list of numbers in a suit, sorted, what is the minimal number of tiles to add to get a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9), check how many of the numbers are already present in the current list. The minimal number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count of numbers present in that sequence.\n\nThen, among all possible sequences, take the minimal value.\n\nBut since the current numbers may not have any of the sequences, but adding tiles can form a sequence.\n\nFor example, if current numbers are [1, 4], then for the sequence 1-2-3, the count is 1 (only 1 is present). So need 2 tiles. For sequence 2-3-4, count is 1 (4). Need 2 tiles. For sequence 4-5-6, count is 1 (4). Need 2. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo for each suit, we can generate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers, compute the required tiles for each, then take the minimal.\n\nBut for the current numbers in the suit, which may be 0, 1, 2, or 3 numbers. Let's think:\n\nIf the suit has 0 numbers (i.e., no tiles in that suit), then we can't form a sequence. Because we need three tiles, but adding three tiles (e.g. 1,2,3) would require adding 3 tiles.\n\nIf the suit has one number, then for any sequence that includes that number, we need to add two tiles. For example, if the number is 5, then for the sequence 4-5-6, we need to add 4 and 6. So two tiles.\n\nIf the suit has two numbers, then check if they are consecutive. For example, 1 and 2. Then adding 3 (one tile) gives a sequence. Or if they are 1 and 3, then adding 2 (one tile). If they are 1 and 4, then need to add two tiles (like 2 and 3, or 5 and 6, etc.)\n\nIf the suit has three numbers, check if they form a sequence. If yes, then zero. Else, need to add tiles. For example, 1, 2, 4: can add 3 (one tile) to form 1-2-3, or 2-3-4 (add 3). So one tile.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can process the numbers in that suit, and compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence in that suit. Then, among all suits, take the minimal value.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps for the sequence case:\n\nFor each suit in the original three tiles (maybe multiple suits?), process the numbers in that suit. For example, if the original three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3p, then the suits are s and p. For suit s, the numbers are [1,2], for suit p, [3].\n\nFor each suit, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence in that suit. Then, the minimal among all suits is the minimal required for the sequence case.\n\nSo, for the entire problem, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimum between the triplet case and the sequence case.\n\nBut also, note that the original three tiles may not have any suit with enough numbers. For example, if all three are in different suits, then for the sequence case, each suit has only one number, so the minimal for each suit is 2 (since you need to add two tiles to form a sequence in that suit). So the minimal for the sequence case is 2. Then, compare that with the triplet case (which would be 3 - max_count, where max_count is 1, so 2). So the minimal between 2 and 2 is 2. So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut in that case, the minimal is 2. But perhaps there's a better way?\n\nWait, no. Because for a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, if the three tiles are in different suits, then to form a sequence, you need to add two tiles in one suit (say, choose one suit, add two tiles to get three consecutive numbers in that suit). So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the overall approach for the problem is:\n\nCheck if the current tiles already have a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal between the required tiles for triplet and the required tiles for sequence.\n\nBut how to check if the current tiles already have a mentsu?\n\nSo for the current three tiles:\n\nCheck if they form a triplet (all same) or a sequence (same suit and consecutive numbers).\n\nIf either is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal required tiles.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Parse the three tiles into their numbers and suits.\n\n2. Check if the current tiles form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\n3. Else, compute the minimal number of tiles needed for triplet (3 - max_count) and for sequence (the minimal across all suits, as discussed).\n\n4. Take the minimum between the triplet and sequence options, and return that.\n\nBut how to compute the sequence part?\n\nLet's think of implementing this.\n\nFirst, group the numbers by their suit.\n\nFor example, for the three tiles, create a dictionary where the key is the suit, and the value is a list of numbers in that suit.\n\nThen, for each suit in that dictionary, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nFor each suit, the numbers are in the list. Let's sort them.\n\nFor example, for numbers in a suit, sorted as nums.\n\nThen, for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9), check how many of the numbers in the sequence are already present in nums. The required tiles is 3 - count. Find the minimal required for this suit.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences?\n\nWell, for numbers from 1 to 9, the possible sequences are:\n\n(1,2,3), (2,3,4), ..., (7,8,9). So 7 possible sequences.\n\nFor each of these sequences, check how many numbers are present in nums.\n\nFor example, if nums is [1,2], then for (1,2,3), the count is 2. So required tiles is 1. For (2,3,4), count is 1 (only 2 is present). So required is 2. So the minimal for this suit is 1.\n\nSo, for each suit, the minimal required tiles for a sequence is the minimum over all possible sequences of (3 - count of numbers in the sequence present in nums).\n\nBut if the nums list has less than 3 elements, then the required tiles could be higher. For example, if nums is [1], then for any sequence that includes 1, the count is 1, so required is 2. For example, sequence (1,2,3) requires adding 2 and 3 (two tiles).\n\nBut what if the nums list has 3 elements but they don't form a sequence? For example, [1,2,4]. Then, the minimal required for this suit is 1 (adding 3 to get 1,2,3 or adding 5 to get 2,4,5? No, 2,4,5 is not a sequence. Oh, wait, the sequence has to be three consecutive numbers. So for [1,2,4], the possible sequences are:\n\n(1,2,3): need 1 tile (3).\n\n(2,3,4): need 1 tile (3).\n\n(3,4,5): need 2 tiles (3,5).\n\netc. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for each suit, the code would generate all 7 possible sequences, check for each how many numbers are present in the current nums, and compute the required tiles. Then take the minimum of those.\n\nBut for the case when the nums list has less than 3 elements, the required tiles would be higher. For example, if nums has 2 elements, then for a sequence that includes both, the required is 1. If nums has one element, then required is 2. If nums is empty (but that's not possible here, since we are processing suits that have at least one tile in the original three tiles).\n\nSo, for the sequence part, the code for a given suit's nums list is:\n\nmin_tiles = infinity\n\nfor seq in all possible sequences (like (1,2,3), ...):\n\n    count = number of elements in nums that are in the seq.\n\n    required = 3 - count\n\n    if required < min_tiles:\n\n        min_tiles = required\n\nreturn min_tiles\n\nBut how to generate all the possible sequences?\n\nIn Python, we can generate them as follows:\n\nfor i in range(1, 8):\n\n    seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n\nSo, for each of the 7 sequences.\n\nOnce we have the min_tiles for each suit, then the minimal among all suits is the minimal required for the sequence case.\n\nBut what if there are multiple suits? For example, the original three tiles have two suits. Then, for each suit, compute the min_tiles, and take the minimal between them.\n\nSo, for example, if the original three tiles are [1s, 2s, 3p], then for suit s, the nums are [1,2], which can form a sequence with 1 tile (add 3). For suit p, nums is [3], which requires adding 2 tiles (like 1 and 2, or 2 and 4, etc). So the minimal for the sequence case is 1. So the sequence case requires 1 tile.\n\nSo the overall minimal between triplet and sequence is the minimum between (triplet required and sequence required).\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. For example, in the sample input, the first input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'].\n\nWait, but the input is given as a single line with three strings. For example, in the sample input, the input is written as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], but in reality, the input is a single line with three strings separated by spaces. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, for example, the input is something like \"1s 2s 3s\" (but for the first example, the input is three separate strings, but in the code, the input is read as a single line with three strings separated by spaces. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three strings, but in reality, the input is a single line with three strings, separated by spaces. For example, in the first example, the input is '1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p' — but that's probably the input as a list of three examples. But for the actual code, the input is a single line with three strings, like \"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\"? No, no. Wait, the input is three strings. So the input line is three strings separated by spaces. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because in reality, the input is three tiles, each as a string. So for example, the first sample input is three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\" — which is a single line with three strings. So the input is a single line with three strings, each representing a tile.\n\nSo the code should read a line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nWhich would give a list of three strings.\n\nSo, for each of the three tiles, we can extract the number and suit.\n\nSo, for each tile in tiles:\n\nnumber = int(tile[0])\n\nsuit = tile[1]\n\nThen, we can process these.\n\nSo, first, let's code the functions to check if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles are same. So, check if all numbers are same and suits are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: same suit, and numbers are consecutive. So, the numbers sorted must be [x, x+1, x+2].\n\nSo, for example, numbers [1, 2, 3] → sorted, check if they are consecutive.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # tiles is a list of three (number, suit) tuples.\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if all(t[0] == tiles[0][0] and t[1] == tiles[0][1] for t in tiles):\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # all same suit\n\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # same suit, check numbers\n\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\nSo, if this returns True, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, if not, compute the minimal for triplet and sequence.\n\nFor triplet:\n\ncount the frequencies of each tile. For example, if the three tiles are [a, a, b], then the max count is 2. So required is 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nBut how to count frequencies?\n\nWe can use a dictionary. For example, from collections import Counter.\n\ntiles_list = list of (number, suit) tuples.\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles_list)\n\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\n\ntriplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n\nBut wait, the triplet is made of three identical tiles. So, for example, if the current tiles have two of a certain tile, then adding one more would make a triplet. So triplet_needed is 3 - max_count.\n\nYes.\n\nFor the sequence case:\n\nWe need to check for all suits that are present in the tiles, and compute the minimal required tiles for that suit.\n\nSo, first, group the numbers by suit.\n\nsuit_to_numbers = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor number, suit in tiles_list:\n\n    suit_to_numbers[suit].append(number)\n\nThen, for each suit in suit_to_numbers:\n\nprocess the numbers in that suit.\n\nFor example, for a suit, the numbers are [1,2]. So, for each possible sequence, compute the required tiles.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can compute the minimal required tiles for sequence.\n\nThen, the overall minimal for the sequence case is the minimal among all suits' minimal required.\n\nBut what if there are no suits? Well, the original three tiles must have at least one suit, since each tile is in a suit.\n\nSo, for each suit in suit_to_numbers:\n\nnums = sorted(suit_to_numbers[suit])\n\nthen, for all possible sequences (i, i+1, i+2), compute how many of the numbers in nums are in the sequence.\n\nSo, for each sequence in 1-2-3, ..., 7-8-9:\n\nseq_nums = [i, i+1, i+2]\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor num in nums:\n\n    if num in seq_nums:\n\n        count +=1\n\nrequired = 3 - count\n\nkeep track of the minimal required for this suit.\n\nOnce we have that, then the minimal for the sequence case is the minimal of all these.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nSo, for a given nums list (sorted), the code for the suit is:\n\nmin_seq = infinity\n\nfor i in range(1, 8):\n\n    seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for num in nums:\n\n        if num in seq:\n\n            count +=1\n\n    required = 3 - count\n\n    if required < min_seq:\n\n        min_seq = required\n\nSo, the minimal for this suit is min_seq.\n\nBut what if the nums list has less than 3 elements? Well, for example, if nums has two elements, then the required can be 1 (if they are consecutive, and the third is missing). For example, nums [1,2] → for seq [1,2,3], count is 2, required 1.\n\nSo, this code will handle that.\n\nOnce we compute the minimal for each suit, then the overall minimal for the sequence case is the minimal among all suits' min_seq.\n\nSo, for example, if the original tiles have two suits, then the minimal is the minimum between the min_seq for each suit.\n\nOnce we have the triplet_needed and the sequence_min, the answer is min(triplet_needed, sequence_min).\n\nBut wait, what about if the sequence_min is not possible? For example, if the original tiles have no suits with any numbers (but that's impossible, since the original tiles have three tiles, each in a suit).\n\nSo, the code for the sequence case is:\n\nsequence_min = infinity\n\nfor suit in suit_to_numbers:\n\n    nums = suit_to_numbers[suit]\n\n    # process nums to find the minimal required for this suit\n\n    # as above\n\n    current_min = ... \n\n    if current_min < sequence_min:\n\n        sequence_min = current_min\n\nSo, the overall answer is min(triplet_needed, sequence_min).\n\nBut what if the sequence_min is not possible? Like, for example, the original tiles have three different suits. For example, tiles are [1m, 2p, 3s]. Then, for each suit, the nums list is [1], [2], [3]. For each suit, the minimal required for sequence is 2 (since for [1], the best is to add 2 and 3 to form 1-2-3. So required is 2). So sequence_min is 2. Triplet_needed is 3 - 1 = 2. So answer is 2.\n\nSo, the code would return 2.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: '1s 2s 3s'\n\nProcessing:\n\ntiles_list is [(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]\n\nCheck for mentsu: the sequence is valid. So answer is 0.\n\nSample Input 2: '9m 9m 9m' → triplet, answer is 0.\n\nSample Input 3: '3p 9m 2p' → tiles are [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]\n\nCheck if it's a mentsu:\n\nTriplet? No. All three are different. For sequence, suits are p, m, p. So the suits are not all same. So no. So proceed.\n\nCompute triplet_needed: counts are:\n\ntile 3p: count 1, 9m: 1, 2p: 1. So max_count is 1. triplet_needed is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nFor sequence_min:\n\nsuit_to_numbers is:\n\np: [3, 2]\n\nm: [9]\n\nFor suit p, nums are [2,3], sorted as [2,3].\n\nCheck all sequences:\n\ni=1: [1,2,3] → count is 2 (2 and 3). required is 1.\n\ni=2: [2,3,4] → count is 2 (2 and 3). required 1.\n\ni=3: [3,4,5] → count is 1 (3). required 2.\n\n... etc. So the minimal for suit p is 1.\n\nFor suit m, nums is [9]. For each sequence:\n\ni=7 → [7,8,9] → count 1 (9). required 2.\n\nothers would have higher required. So the minimal for suit m is 2.\n\nSo sequence_min is min(1, 2) = 1.\n\nThus, the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nAnother example: input is 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, triplet_needed is 3-1=2. For sequence, each suit has one number. So for each suit, the minimal required is 2. So sequence_min is 2. So answer is min(2, 2) → 2.\n\nAnother example: input is 1m, 1m, 2m. Check for mentsu: not a triplet (only two 1m and one 2m). Not a sequence (numbers are 1,1,2 → sorted [1,1,2]. Not consecutive. So no. So triplet_needed is 3-2=1. For sequence: suit is m, nums [1,1,2]. Now, for all possible sequences:\n\nCheck for each possible sequence:\n\ni=1 → [1,2,3]. How many numbers in nums? 1 and 2 → count is 2. required 1. So adding 3.\n\ni=2 → [2,3,4]. count is 1 (only 2). required 2.\n\nSo the minimal for this suit is 1. So sequence_min is 1. So the answer is min(1, 1) → 1. Which is correct. Because adding one tile (3m) would make 1, 2, 3. Or adding a 1m to make triplet. Either way, 1 tile.\n\nSo code would return 1.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nThen, process each tile into (number, suit):\n\ntiles_list = []\nfor tile in tiles:\n    num = int(tile[0])\n    suit = tile[1]\n    tiles_list.append( (num, suit) )\n\nThen, check if it's already a mentsu.\n\nIf yes, output 0.\n\nElse, compute triplet_needed and sequence_min.\n\nImplementing the is_mentsu function.\n\nThen, for triplet_needed:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles_list)\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\ntriplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n\nFor the sequence_min:\n\nsuit_to_numbers = defaultdict(list)\nfor num, suit in tiles_list:\n    suit_to_numbers[suit].append(num)\n\nsequence_min = float('inf')\n\nfor suit in suit_to_numbers:\n    nums = sorted(suit_to_numbers[suit])\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, 8):\n        seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n        count = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            if num in seq:\n                count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < current_min:\n            current_min = required\n    if current_min < sequence_min:\n        sequence_min = current_min\n\nThen, the answer is min(triplet_needed, sequence_min).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no suits (which is impossible, since there are three tiles). So, the code should handle that.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, Counter\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = input().split()\n    tiles_list = []\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        tiles_list.append( (num, suit) )\n    \n    # Check if already mentsu\n    # Check triplet\n    is_triplet = all(t[0] == tiles_list[0][0] and t[1] == tiles_list[0][1] for t in tiles_list)\n    if is_triplet:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles_list]\n    if len(set(suits)) == 1:\n        nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles_list])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0]+1 and nums[2] == nums[1]+1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n    \n    # Not a mentsu yet.

Else, proceeds.\n\nBut what about the case where the tiles can form a sequence but the code didn't check it? For example, in the code, after checking for triplet, then check for sequence. But the code checks for the sequence only if all suits are same. Wait, no.\n\nWait, the code checks for the sequence as follows:\n\nsuits = [t[1] for t in tiles_list]\n\nif len(set(suits)) == 1:\n\n   then check if the sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are in same suit but not sorted? For example, 3m, 1m, 2m. Then, sorted becomes [1,2,3], which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are in same suit, but not consecutive? For example, 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, the code would not return 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly checks if the current tiles form a mentsu.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current tiles already form a mentsu and, if not, calculating the minimum number of additional tiles required for either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If the tiles do not form an immediate mentsu, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet by considering the frequency of each tile.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit present in the current tiles, determine the minimum number of tiles required to form a sequence by evaluating all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers within that suit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = input().split()\n    tiles_list = []\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        tiles_list.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check if already a triplet\n    is_triplet = all(t[0] == tiles_list[0][0] and t[1] == tiles_list[0][1] for t in tiles_list)\n    if is_triplet:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check if already a sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles_list]\n    if len(set(suits)) == 1:\n        nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles_list])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n    \n    # Calculate triplet needed\n    counts = Counter(tiles_list)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    triplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # Calculate sequence_min\n    suit_to_numbers = defaultdict(list)\n    for num, suit in tiles_list:\n        suit_to_numbers[suit].append(num)\n    \n    sequence_min = float('inf')\n    for suit in suit_to_numbers:\n        nums = sorted(suit_to_numbers[suit])\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n            count = 0\n            for num in nums:\n                if num in seq:\n                    count += 1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < current_min:\n                current_min = required\n        if current_min < sequence_min:\n            sequence_min = current_min\n    \n    answer = min(triplet_needed, sequence_min)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Immediate Mentsu Check**: The code first checks if the three tiles form a triplet or a sequence directly. This is done by verifying if all tiles are identical (triplet) or if they form consecutive numbers in the same suit (sequence).\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If no immediate mentsu is found, the code calculates how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet by determining the maximum frequency of any tile and subtracting it from 3.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit present in the current tiles, the code evaluates all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers. It calculates how many tiles are needed to complete each potential sequence and takes the minimum value across all suits.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of tiles required by leveraging frequency counts and checking all possible sequences, ensuring an optimal solution.",
