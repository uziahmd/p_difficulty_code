The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They each have a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each of n rounds, we need to determine who wins each round and count how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The input gives n, then the sequence A for Nikephoros, then sequence B for Polycarpus. Each sequence is a string of characters R, S, P. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nThe key problem here is handling the large n. Simulating each round one by one would take O(n) time, which is impossible for n up to 2e9. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since both sequences are cyclic, the moves repeat every m and k steps respectively. So the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same pair of moves will occur again.\n\nSo the idea is to find the number of complete cycles of LCM(m, k) in n rounds, and then compute the number of wins in each cycle, multiply by the number of cycles, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (if any).\n\nBut first, let's compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, say period = LCM(m, k), then for each full period, we can calculate how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply that by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then handle the remaining rounds (n % period) separately.\n\nBut wait, what if n is smaller than the period? Then we just process all n rounds directly.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the period as LCM(m, k).\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and accumulate the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n3. The total number of full periods is total_periods = n // period.\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period.\n5. Multiply the counts from one period by total_periods, then add the counts from the first rem rounds.\n\nBut how do we compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0..period-1, we can compute the moves and check the outcome.\n\nBut since period can be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000, then period could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). So for each period, processing 1e6 rounds is manageable. Because even with 1e6 operations, it's acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut first, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. The first line is n. Then the second line is A, third is B.\n\nThen, compute m = len(A), k = len(B). Compute period = LCM(m, k). Then, for each i in 0 to period-1, compute the moves for A and B. Then, for each of those rounds, determine who wins. Accumulate the counts for a full period.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, multiply by total_periods. Then process the remaining rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and add their counts.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome of a single round?\n\nWe need a helper function that takes a and b (the moves of A and B) and returns who wins. For example:\n\nIf a == b: no one gets a spot.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a beats b) then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's count increases by ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to handle up to 2 billion rounds efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Sequences**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds. The combined pattern of their moves will repeat every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k` rounds.\n2. **Period Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which both sequences repeat their moves simultaneously.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the outcome of each round and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Up**: Multiply the results from one period by the number of full periods in `n` rounds. Then, simulate the remaining rounds after these full periods to get the final counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_outcomes(a, b):\n    # Determine the outcome of a single round between a and b\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    period = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the outcomes for one period\n    nike = 0\n    poly = 0\n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        delta_nike, delta_poly = compute_outcomes(a_move, b_move)\n        nike += delta_nike\n        poly += delta_poly\n    \n    total_periods = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    # Multiply by total periods\n    total_nike = total_periods * nike\n    total_poly = total_periods * poly\n    \n    # Process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        delta_nike, delta_poly = compute_outcomes(a_move, b_move)\n        total_nike += delta_nike\n        total_poly += delta_poly\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is calculated. The number of losses for each player during this period is counted.\n4. **Scaling Up**: The results from one period are multiplied by the number of full periods in `n` rounds. The remaining rounds after these full periods are simulated separately to adjust the counts.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses (red spots) for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle the large number of rounds efficiently by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
