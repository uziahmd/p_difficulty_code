The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences can be up to 1000 characters long each. But n can be as big as 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round step by step is impossible here. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k]. So the moves for each round depend on the current round number modulo the length of their respective sequences.\n\nThe problem is that for n up to 2e9, we can't check each round. So we need to find the total number of rounds where A's move beats B's move (so Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot) and vice versa.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible cycles. The combined cycle of both sequences would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo, if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle of length LCM(m, k), then we can compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, multiply by the per-cycle counts, and then add the counts from the remaining rounds (n mod LCM(m, k)).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n2. For each of the first period rounds, compute the number of times Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a spot) and vice versa. Let's call these countA and countB.\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period.\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period.\n5. The total for each player is then total_periods * countA + countA_rem (for Nikephoros's losses) and similarly for Polycarpus. Wait, no: wait, countA is the number of times Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a spot). So for each full period, Nikephoros's losses are countB (when he loses) and Polycarpus's losses are countA (when he loses). Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIn each round, if A's move beats B's move, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is zero for that round, and Polycarpus's is increased by 1? No, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots are incremented when he loses. So for each round, if Nikephoros loses, his count increases by 1. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo for each round, determine who wins. If A beats B, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Polycarpus's count increases by 1). If B beats A, then Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1. If it's a draw, nothing happens.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check whether A beats B, B beats A, or draw.\n\nSo for the full period, we can precompute how many times each scenario occurs. Let's say in one period, there are:\n\n- winA: number of rounds where A wins (so Polycarpus's count increases by 1)\n- winB: number of rounds where B wins (so Nikephoros's count increases by 1)\n- draws: rounds where it's a draw.\n\nSo for each full period, Nikephoros's losses are winB, and Polycarpus's losses are winA.\n\nSo the total for all full periods is total_periods * winB and total_periods * winA.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, we need to compute how many of them contribute to winB",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a repeating sequence of moves. Directly simulating each round is infeasible due to the potentially enormous number of rounds (up to 2 billion). Instead, we can leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to compute results efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Cyclic Nature of Moves**:\n   - Both players repeat their move sequences cyclically.\n   - The combined pattern of moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where m and k are the lengths of the sequences A and B, respectively.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - We simulate only one full cycle (of length LCM(m, k)) and count the number of wins for each player during this period.\n   - Using this, we can calculate how many full cycles occur in n rounds and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n---\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of the lengths of sequences A and B.\n2. **Simulate One Full Cycle**:\n   - For each round in the LCM-length cycle, determine the outcome (win, lose, draw).\n   - Count the number of wins for each player during this cycle.\n3. **Calculate Full Cycles and Remaining Rounds**:\n   - Use the counts from the full cycle to multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds.\n   - Simulate the remaining rounds to update the final counts.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- We use the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor and derive the LCM as `LCM = m * k // gcd(m, k)`.\n- For each round in the LCM-length cycle, we compute the moves for both players using modulo operations.\n- We define a helper function `get_result(a, b)` to return the result of a single round: `0` for a draw, `1` for player A winning, `-1` for player B winning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # A wins\n    else:\n        return -1  # B wins\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    A = data[1]\n    B = data[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    lcm = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    winA = 0\n    winB = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            winA += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            winB += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_winA = total_periods * winA\n    total_winB = total_periods * winB\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            total_winA += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            total_winB += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_winB} {total_winA}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Output:\n\n- The first number printed is the number of red spots on Nikephoros (i.e., the number of times he lost).\n- The second number is the number of red spots on Polycarpus (i.e., the number of times he lost).\n\nThis approach ensures that even with very large values of `n`, we only simulate up to 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000 rounds at most, which is computationally feasible.",
