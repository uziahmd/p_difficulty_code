Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to create an N x N board such that the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The numbering of the board determines the path the chess piece takes. The movement rules are: at each step, the piece moves to the smallest-numbered unvisited cell it can reach in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. The goal is to arrange the numbers so that the rook's total vuns are less than the queen's.\n\nSo, for a given N, I need to construct such a board. Let's look at the example given. For N=4, the output is a specific arrangement where the rook's path has 1 vun and the queen's has 2. So the key is to design a numbering where the queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's.\n\nLet me think about the movement patterns. The rook moves in straight lines (same row or column), while the queen can move in any direction (including diagonals). So, the queen has more possible moves than the rook. However, the way the numbers are arranged will determine which path is taken.\n\nThe idea is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the queen gets stuck more often, requiring more teleportations. But how?\n\nMaybe arrange the numbers so that the queen's path requires more teleportations. For instance, if the queen's path has to teleport more times because the next number is not reachable by her movement, but the rook's path can reach it through row or column movement.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nLet me think of a pattern. Maybe arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse the board with minimal teleportations, while the queen has to teleport more. For example, if the numbers are arranged in a spiral or some order that allows the rook to move along rows and columns, but the queen has to jump around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers in a specific order where the queen's movement is restricted. For example, if the numbers are placed in a way that after certain steps, the queen can't reach the next number, but the rook can.\n\nBut how to model this? It might be challenging to find a general pattern. However, looking at the sample input for N=4, the output seems to be constructed with a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at the sample output:\n\nThe board is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nWait, the first cell is 1, which is in position (3,2) (assuming 1-based indexing). Then the path for the rook goes through 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → teleport to 14. So the rook had one teleportation.\n\nFor the queen, the path had two teleportations. So the key is that the queen's path required more teleportations.\n\nBut how to create such a scenario?\n\nMaybe the idea is to make the queen's path require more teleportations than the rook's. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's movement options are limited. Perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that after certain steps, the queen cannot reach the next number, but the rook can.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for even N, there's a way to arrange the numbers, but for N=1, it's impossible. Also, for N=2, maybe it's impossible, but for N≥3, possible?\n\nWait, the sample input is N=4, which works. The output for N=1 is -1. So for N=1, the answer is -1. For N=2, maybe there's no solution? Or maybe there is?\n\nBut the problem says that for N=1, output is -1. So the first thing is to check if N is 1, return -1.\n\nNow, for other N, perhaps we can construct a grid where the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\nLet me think of a way to construct such a grid. One approach is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse the entire board without teleporting except once, while the queen requires multiple teleportations.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can follow a snake-like path through rows and columns, visiting all cells in order, but the queen's path would have to jump around and get stuck more often.\n\nBut how to arrange the numbers for that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbering as a sequence where the rook's path can follow the numbers in order, moving along rows and columns, while the queen's path would have to take different steps that lead to more teleportations.\n\nFor example, arrange the numbers in a way that the next number is in the same row or column as the current position for the rook, but not for the queen.\n\nBut how to do this systematically?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: create a grid where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move through the grid in a single path that covers all cells except one, which requires a teleport, but the queen's path would require more teleports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers so that the queen has to teleport more times. For example, place the numbers in a way that after some steps, the queen can't reach the next number, but the rook can.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the example given. Let's look at the queen's path in the sample. The queen starts at 1 (position (3,2)). Then she moves to 3 (which is in the same row? Wait, the board is:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12\n\nRow 2: 7 5 9 15\n\nRow 3: 14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4: 13 8 16 2 \n\nSo the initial position is cell (3,2) which is 1. The next number is 2. But according to the queen's movement, from 1 (row 3, column 2), can she reach 2? The cell with 2 is in row 4, column 4. So queen can move diagonally. From (3,2) to (4,3) to (4,4)? No, but queen can move directly from (3,2) to (4,4) if it's a diagonal. Wait, the distance between (3,2) and (4,4) is 1 row and 2 columns. That's not a diagonal. So the queen can't reach 2 from 1 in one move. So the queen would have to teleport to 2, paying 1 vun. But according to the note, the queen's path is 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → ... So why does she go to 3 first?\n\nAh, because the next available numbers are checked. Let me think again. The process is: at each step, among all not visited cells that can be reached in one move, choose the one with the minimal number. If there are none, teleport.\n\nSo starting at 1 (number 1), the unvisited cells are all others. The rook can move along the same row or column. The queen can move in any direction. So for the queen, the accessible cells from 1 are all cells that are in same row, same column, or diagonal.\n\nSo for the queen's initial position (3,2), which is cell with value 1. The next numbers are 2,3,... etc. So the queen checks which of these numbers are in cells that can be reached in one move. The minimal such number is 3, which is in (1,2) (row 1, column 2). Because the queen can move vertically (from row 3 to row 1, same column 2). So she moves to 3. Then from 3 (cell (1,2)), she looks for the next minimal unvisited number. The next numbers are 2,4,5, etc. Which of those are reachable?\n\nFrom (1,2), the queen can move in any direction. Let's see:\n\nThe cell with 2 is (4,4). Is that reachable? From (1,2) to (4,4): difference of 3 rows and 2 columns. Not a straight line. So no. So the queen can't reach 2 from 3 in one move. What about 4? It's in (1,1). That's same row, so yes. So she moves to 4. Then from 4 (cell (1,1)), the next minimal unvisited number is 2, but can she reach it? From (1,1), the queen can move diagonally to (4,4) (difference 3 rows and 3 columns). Yes. So she can move directly to 2. So why in the note, the queen's path is 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → ... ?\n\nAh, because after 4, the next minimal unvisited number is 2, which is reachable. So she moves there. Then from 2 (cell (4,4)), the next minimal is 5. Let's see where 5 is. It's in (2,2). From (4,4), can the queen reach (2,2)? Yes, via diagonal. So she moves there. Then from 5, the next minimal is 6 (cell (1,3)), which is in same row? No. From (2,2) to (1,3): difference of 1 row and 1 column. Yes, diagonal. So she can move there. Then from 6, next is 7 (cell (2,1)), which is in same column (column 1)? No. From (1,3) to (2,1): difference of 1 row and 2 columns. Not a straight line. So queen can't reach 7. So she has to teleport to the next minimal unvisited cell. Which is 7 (since 7 is the next number after 6). So she teleports to 7, paying 1 vun.\n\nSo, the queen's path requires teleporting here. So the key is that the queen's path may require more teleportations than the rook's.\n\nSo how can I design a grid where the queen has to teleport more often?\n\nPerhaps arrange the numbers such that the queen's path requires more teleportations. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's movement options are limited, but the rook's are not.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find a pattern for the grid that ensures that the queen has more teleportations than the rook. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse the grid with minimal teleportations, while the queen's path has more.\n\nOne possible pattern is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path follows a snake-like pattern through rows and columns, but the queen's path requires jumping around.\n\nBut how to create such a numbering?\n\nAnother idea: Let's arrange the numbers so that the rook can visit all cells in order, moving along rows and columns, while the queen's path requires teleporting more often.\n\nFor example, arrange the numbers in a way that the next number is in the same row or column as the current position (for the rook), but not for the queen.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nLet me think of a specific construction. For example, for even N, arrange the grid in a way that the numbers increase row-wise, but with some modifications.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where the numbers are arranged in a spiral, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach:\n\nPlace the number 1 in the center. Then arrange numbers in a way that each next number is adjacent in a row or column. But the queen can reach them via diagonals. However, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For the rook's path, arrange the numbers in a way that each next number is in the same row or column. For example, arrange numbers in a row-wise manner, but with some adjustments.\n\nFor example, for a 4x4 grid, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can move through each row left to right, then down to the next row. But the queen would have to teleport more often.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the example given. The sample for N=4 has the 1 in position (3,2), which is not the center. The numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move through the grid with minimal teleportations, while the queen has to teleport more.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAnother observation: The rook can reach any cell in the same row or column. The queen can reach any cell in same row, column, or diagonal. So, the queen has more options. However, when the next number is in the same row or column, both can reach it. But if the next number is not in same row/column, but in a diagonal, then the queen can reach it, but the rook can't. However, if the next number is not in same row/column or diagonal, then neither can reach it, and teleport is needed.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the numbers such that the queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's. How?\n\nLet me think: For the rook, whenever the next number is in the same row or column, it can move. For the queen, if the next number is in same row, column, or diagonal, it can move. Otherwise, teleport.\n\nSo, if the next number is in same row/column for rook, but not in same row/column/diagonal for queen, then the queen would have to teleport. But that's impossible, since if the next number is in same row/column, it's also in same row/column for queen. So, the queen can reach it. Therefore, the queen's movement options are always at least as good as the rook's. Thus, the queen will never have to teleport more than the rook. Wait, but that's not the case in the example. How?\n\nIn the example, the queen had to teleport once, and the rook once. Wait, but according to the note, the queen paid 2 vuns and the rook 1. How?\n\nAh, maybe the queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's. Let me recheck the example.\n\nIn the sample, the queen's path is:\n\n1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → teleport to 14 → teleport to 16. Wait, the note says that the queen pays 2 vuns. So, after reaching 15, the next unvisited cell is 14 and 16. The queen can't reach them from 15. So she teleports to the smallest (14), paying 1 vun. Then from 14, the next unvisited is 16. Can she reach it? From 14 (position (3,1)), 16 is in (4,3). The queen can move from (3,1) to (4,3) via diagonal? Difference of 1 row and 2 columns. No, that's not a diagonal. So she can't reach it. So she teleports again, paying another vun. Thus, total of 2.\n\nWhereas the rook's path only had one teleport.\n\nSo the key is that the queen's path requires more teleportations. How to arrange that?\n\nThe idea is that the queen has to teleport more often than the rook. To achieve this, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's path requires more steps where the next number is not reachable, but the rook's path can reach it.\n\nSo, how to arrange the numbers?\n\nMaybe arrange the numbers such that the next number for the queen is not reachable, but for the rook it is. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the current position is (i,j), and the next number is located in the same row or column as (i,j), but not in the same row/column/diagonal. That's impossible. Because if it's in same row or column, then the queen can reach it via that row/column. So the queen would have that option.\n\nTherefore, the queen's movement options are always at least as good as the rook's. Hence, the queen can reach any cell that the rook can reach, plus possibly more. Therefore, the queen's path should have fewer teleportations than the rook's. But in the sample, the opposite is true. How is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nThe queen can reach more cells than the rook. So, during the movement phase (when choosing the next cell), the queen has more options. However, the selection is based on the minimal number. So, if the minimal number is reachable by the rook but not by the queen, then the rook would move to it, while the queen can't. But that's impossible, because if the rook can reach it, the queen can also reach it (since the rook's movement is a subset of the queen's).\n\nWait, that's correct. The rook can move in straight lines (rows and columns), the queen can move in rows, columns, and diagonals. So, any cell that the rook can reach, the queen can also reach. Therefore, during the movement phase, the queen has more options than the rook. Hence, the queen's path should have fewer or equal teleportations compared to the rook's. But in the sample, the queen has more teleportations. How is that possible?\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning was wrong. Let me re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the queen's path includes teleporting twice. The rook's path includes teleporting once. So, the queen has more teleportations. How?\n\nLet me think about the queen's movement steps. Suppose during the queen's path, there are situations where the next minimal number is not reachable by her, but the rook can reach it. But how? Because if the rook can reach it, the queen can also reach it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the queen has more options, so she might choose a different path that leads to more teleportations. For example, the queen could choose a higher-numbered cell that is reachable, but then later get stuck more.\n\nBut the movement rule is that the next cell is the minimal unvisited cell that is reachable. So, the queen will always choose the minimal possible reachable cell. So, if the rook can reach the minimal cell, the queen can also reach it, and thus the queen would choose the same cell as the rook. Therefore, the queen's path would be the same as the rook's path, leading to the same number of teleportations. But that contradicts the sample.\n\nSo why in the sample, the queen's path has more teleportations than the rook's?\n\nLet me re-examine the sample's queen path. Let me trace it step by step.\n\nQueen starts at 1 (position (3,2)).\n\nUnvisited cells: all except 1.\n\nReachable cells for queen: all cells in same row, column, or diagonal. Let's find the minimal number among those.\n\nThe numbers in the same row (row 3) are 14, 1, 11, 10. But 1 is already visited. The others are 14, 11, 10. The numbers in same column (column 2) are 3 (row 1), 5 (row 2), 1 (row 3), 8 (row 4). So 3 and 5 are unvisited. Also, diagonals: from (3,2), the diagonals would include cells like (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3), etc. Let's check the numbers in those cells.\n\nFor example, (2,1) is 7, (2,3) is 9, (4,1) is 13, (4,3) is 16, etc.\n\nSo the minimal number among all reachable cells is 3 (in (1,2)), which is the next step. So queen moves to 3.\n\nThen, from 3 (position (1,2)), the reachable cells are same row, column, or diagonal. The minimal unvisited number is 2 (but can queen reach it?), or 4 (same row, position (1,1))? Let's see.\n\nAt this point, the visited cells are 1 and 3. Unvisited cells include 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. The minimal unvisited is 2. Can queen reach 2 from (1,2)? Cell 2 is at (4,4). The queen can move from (1,2) to (4,4) via diagonal? The difference is 3 rows and 2 columns. No, not a diagonal. So queen cannot reach 2. So the next minimal reachable is 4, which is in (1,1), same row. So queen moves to 4.\n\nFrom 4 (position (1,1)), the reachable cells are same row, column, or diagonal. The minimal unvisited is 2. Can queen reach 2 from (1,1)? Yes: (1,1) to (4,4) is a diagonal (difference of 3 rows and 3 columns). So queen can move there. So she moves to 2.\n\nNow, from 2 (position (4,4)), the minimal unvisited number is 5. Where is 5? At (2,2). Queen can move from (4,4) to (2,2) via diagonal (difference 2 rows and 2 columns). So yes. She moves to 5.\n\nFrom 5 (position (2,2)), the minimal unvisited number is 6 (position (1,3)). Can queen reach it? From (2,2) to (1,3) is a diagonal (difference 1 row and 1 column). Yes. So she moves to 6.\n\nFrom 6 (position (1,3)), the minimal unvisited number is 7 (position (2,1)). Can queen reach it? From (1,3) to (2,1): difference of 1 row and 2 columns. Not a diagonal. Not same row or column. So no. So queen has to teleport to the smallest unvisited cell, which is 7. Pay 1 vun.\n\nSo here, the queen teleports once. Then from 7 (position (2,1)), the minimal unvisited is 8 (position (4,2)). Can queen reach it? From (2,1) to (4,2): difference of 2 rows and 1 column. Not a straight line or diagonal. So no. Teleport again. So she teleports to 8, paying another vun. And so on.\n\nBut for the rook, when it reaches certain points, it may not have to teleport as often. So the key is that the queen's path requires more teleportations because the minimal number is not reachable by her, but the rook can reach it.\n\nBut how to arrange the numbers in such a way?\n\nThis suggests that the queen's path may sometimes have to choose a higher-numbered cell that is reachable, but then later get stuck more, whereas the rook's path can reach the minimal-numbered cell directly.\n\nBut how to create such a scenario?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path can follow a sequence of minimal numbers that are in the same row or column, while the queen's path, due to having more options, chooses a higher-numbered cell that leads to more teleportations later.\n\nBut how to construct this?\n\nMaybe the following approach: create a grid where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move along rows and columns, visiting the numbers in order, while the queen's path sometimes chooses a higher-numbered cell that is reachable, but then later gets stuck more often.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea is to construct a grid where the rook's path requires only one teleport, and the queen's path requires two or more. For example, arrange the numbers so that after visiting most of the cells, the rook can reach the last few in one move, while the queen needs to teleport more.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think of the sample grid. The 1 is placed in a position that allows the rook to move to the next numbers in the same row or column. For example, after 1, the rook moves to 3 (same column?), then to 4 (same row?), etc.\n\nBut how to replicate this for general N?\n\nMaybe the following pattern: Place the numbers in a way that the rook can move along a specific path, such as a row-wise or column-wise traversal, but with some adjustments to ensure that the queen's path diverges.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For the rook's path, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse the entire board without teleporting except once. For the queen's path, arrange the numbers such that she has to teleport more.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's path requires teleporting when the rook can reach the next number. For example, arrange the numbers so that the next number for the queen is not reachable, but the rook can reach it.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the rook can reach any cell in same row or column. The queen can reach any cell in same row, column, or diagonal. So, if the next number is in the same row or column as the current position, then both can reach it. If it's in the same diagonal, the queen can reach it, but the rook can't. However, the rook can't reach it, so the rook would have to teleport if that's the next minimal number.\n\nBut in that case, the queen can reach it, so she would choose it, while the rook can't and would have to teleport.\n\nBut how to arrange this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the current position is (i,j), and the next minimal number is in (i+1, j+1), which is a diagonal. The queen can reach it, while the rook can't. So the queen would move there, but the rook would have to teleport.\n\nBut this would mean that the queen's path has fewer teleportations than the rook's. But in the sample, the opposite is true.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me think about the sample again. The queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's. How is that possible?\n\nBecause the queen has more options, but in some cases, the minimal number is not reachable by her, but the rook can reach it. But how?\n\nWait, the queen's options are more, so she can choose to reach the minimal number that is reachable. But if the minimal number is not reachable by her, then she has to teleport. But the rook may be able to reach it, but if the rook can't reach it either, then both would teleport.\n\nBut how could the rook be able to reach it while the queen can't? That's impossible, since the rook's movement is a subset of the queen's.\n\nSo, the only way the queen has to teleport more than the rook is if, during the queen's path, there are situations where the minimal number is not reachable by her, but the rook can reach it. But how?\n\nThat's impossible, because if the rook can reach it, the queen can also reach it. So the queen would choose to move to it, and not teleport.\n\nThis suggests that the queen's teleport count is less than or equal to the rook's. But in the sample, it's the opposite. This implies that there's a misunderstanding in my analysis.\n\nLet me re-examine the sample's queen and rook paths.\n\nSample for N=4:\n\nRook's path: 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → teleport to 14.\n\nQueen's path: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → teleport to 14 → teleport to 16.\n\nSo the queen has two teleportations, while the rook has one.\n\nBut why does the queen have to teleport more?\n\nLet me look at the queen's path. When the queen is at 15, what happens? Let's see.\n\nAfter the queen reaches 15 (cell (4,3)), what's the next step? The unvisited cells are 14 and 16. Can she reach either from (4,3)?\n\nCell 14 is at (3,1). Can the queen move from (4,3) to (3,1)? That's a difference of 1 row and 2 columns. Not a straight line or diagonal. So no. Cell 16 is at (4,3) to (4,3)? No, 16 is at (4,3)? No, in the sample, the cell with 16 is at (4,3)? Let me check the sample board:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12\n\nRow 2: 7 5 9 15\n\nRow 3: 14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4: 13 8 16 2 \n\nSo cell (4,3) is 16. So when the queen is at 15, which is in row 2, column 4 (cell (2,4)), and then she moves to 15, which is in row 2, column 4? Or wait, the queen's path is 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → teleport to 14 → teleport to 16.\n\nWait, after reaching 15, the unvisited cells are 14 and 16. The queen is at 15, which is at (2,4). Can she reach 14 (at (3,1))? From (2,4) to (3,1): difference of 1 row and 3 columns. No. Can she reach 16 (at (4,3))? From (2,4) to (4,3): difference of 2 rows and 1 column. No. So she teleports to 14 (smaller), pays 1 vun. Now she is at 14, which is at (3,1). The unvisited cell is 16. Can she reach it from (3,1)? 16 is at (4,3). From (3,1) to (4,3): difference of 1 row and 2 columns. Not a straight line or diagonal. So no. So she teleports to 16, paying another vun.\n\nThus, two teleportations.\n\nBut for the rook, after reaching 15, the unvisited cell is 14. Can the rook reach it? The rook is at 15 (position (2,4)). 14 is at (3,1). Can the rook move from (2,4) to (3,1)? No, since it's not in the same row or column. So the rook has to teleport to 14, paying 1 vun. So why does the rook's path have only one teleport?\n\nBecause after teleporting to 14, the rook's path continues. But what's the next step? Let's see.\n\nAfter the rook reaches 15, the next step is to teleport to 14. Then, from 14, the unvisited cell is 16. Can the rook reach it? 14 is at (3,1), 16 is at (4,3). Not same row or column. So the rook must teleport again. But according to the note, the rook pays only 1 vun. Why?\n\nAh, the note says: \"rook goes through cells 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (1 vun) → 14\". So after reaching 15, the rook has to teleport to 14. But what about after that? The next unvisited cell is 16. Can the rook reach it from 14? No. So the rook would have to teleport again. But according to the note, the rook only pays 1 vun. Why?\n\nThis suggests that after teleporting to 14, the rook has no more unvisited cells? No, because 16 is still unvisited. So perhaps the note's description is incomplete or there's a mistake. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the note's example:\n\n\"In the second sample, the rook goes through cells 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (1 vun) → 14.\"\n\nAfter reaching 15, the rook has to teleport to 14, paying 1 vun. Then, the next unvisited cell is 16. From 14 (cell (3,1)), can the rook reach 16 (cell (4,3))? No. So he has to teleport again. But the note says that the rook pays 1 vun. So perhaps the note is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after teleporting to 14, the rook has already visited all cells except 16. But how? Let's count the number of cells. For N=4, there are 16 cells. Let's see the list of visited cells in the rook's path:\n\n1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 5, 7, 13, 2, 8, 16, 11, 10, 12, 15, 14. That's 16 cells. So after teleporting to 14, all cells are visited. So the process stops. So when the rook teleports to 14, it's the last unvisited cell. So why is 16 not in the list?\n\nAh, because after the rook reaches 15, the unvisited cell is 14. So he teleports to 14. Then, all cells are visited. So 16 was already visited earlier. How?\n\nWait, in the rook's path, after 8 comes 16. So 16 is visited before 15. So when the rook reaches 15, the only unvisited cell is 14. So after teleporting to 14, all cells are visited. Hence, no further teleportation needed. So the rook pays 1 vun.\n\nAh, I see! My mistake was thinking that 16 was unvisited after 15, but it was already visited earlier. So the rook's path visits 16 before 15. So the queen's path has 15 as the penultimate step, but the rook's path has 16 visited earlier.\n\nThis shows that the arrangement of numbers is crucial. The key is to arrange the numbers such that the queen's path has more steps where the next number is not reachable, while the rook's path doesn't.\n\nSo, the challenge is to design a numbering where the queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's. How to do this?\n\nThe sample shows that it's possible. Now, how to generalize this for any N ≥ 2?\n\nPerhaps the approach is to create a grid where the queen's path requires more teleportations by arranging the numbers in a way that the queen has to choose higher-numbered cells that are reachable, but later get stuck, while the rook can follow a path that avoids this.\n\nBut how to construct this?\n\nAnother observation: The rook's path can be designed to visit the cells in a way that minimizes teleportations. For example, a spiral or row-wise traversal. The queen's path, due to having more options, might take a different route that leads to more teleportations.\n\nBut how to ensure this?\n\nLet me think of the following construction:\n\n- Place 1 in the middle of the board.\n- Arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can move through the rows and columns in a specific order, ensuring that each next number is in the same row or column.\n- For the queen, the numbers are arranged such that she has to choose a higher-numbered cell that is reachable, but later gets stuck more.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about constructing the board for N=4 as in the sample and try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nIn the sample, the 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N board such that a rook pays strictly fewer teleportation fees than a queen during their traversal based on the given movement rules. The solution involves creating a specific numbering pattern that ensures the rook's path requires fewer teleportations compared to the queen's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Special Case Handling**: For N = 1, it's impossible to have any teleportation as there is only one cell, so we return -1.\n2. **Grid Construction**: For N ≥ 2, we construct the grid in a way that the rook can traverse the board with minimal teleportations while the queen's path requires more.
