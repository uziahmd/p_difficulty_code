При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where one message completely covers the other) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just concatenating them without any overlap isn't considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists some string s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap (but not full overlap). If possible, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping. Let's denote the length of s as len_s. Then the total length of t would be len_s + len_s - overlap_length. So, the length of t must be equal to 2 * len_s - k, where k is the overlap length (which is between 1 and len_s-1).\n\nBut since we don't know len_s, perhaps we can iterate over possible values of len_s and check for possible overlaps.\n\nLet me think: For a possible len_s, the total length of t must be 2*len_s - k, where 1 ≤ k < len_s. So rearranged, len(t) = 2*len_s -k → k = 2*len_s - len(t). But since k must be between 1 and len_s-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2*len_s - len(t) ≤ len_s - 1.\n\nLet me solve for len_s:\n\nLet me denote len_t as the length of t.\n\nSo:\n\nFor k to be in [1, len_s-1], we have:\n\n1 ≤ 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s - 1.\n\nLet me split into two inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: 2*len_s - len_t ≥ 1 → 2*len_s ≥ len_t + 1 → len_s ≥ (len_t + 1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s - 1 → 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1 → len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nSo combining these two, len_s must satisfy (len_t + 1)/2 ≤ len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nBut len_s must also be such that 2*len_s - len_t is between 1 and len_s-1. Wait, but maybe I can find len_s based on the possible k.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible len_s, check if the above conditions hold, and then check if the overlapping is valid.\n\nBut what's the possible range for len_s?\n\nWell, since len_t = 2*len_s -k, and k is at least 1, then len_t must be less than 2*len_s. Also, since k is less than len_s, len_t must be greater than 2*len_s - (len_s -1) → len_t > len_s + 1 - 1 → len_t > len_s? Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for len_s to be possible, the length of t must be between len_s + 1 (if k= len_s -1, then len_t = 2*len_s - (len_s -1) = len_s + 1) and 2*len_s -1 (if k=1, len_t = 2*len_s -1).\n\nSo len_t must be between len_s + 1 and 2*len_s -1.\n\nBut since len_s can vary, perhaps the way to proceed is to iterate over possible len_s values. For example, for each possible len_s, check whether len_t is in the range len_s +1 to 2*len_s -1. If yes, then compute k = 2*len_s - len_t. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. Which it would be because of the previous conditions.\n\nBut how do I find len_s?\n\nLet me think: len_s must be such that len_s ≥ (len_t + 1)/2 and len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nBecause len_t = 2*len_s -k, and k ≥ 1 → len_t ≤ 2*len_s -1 → len_s ≥ (len_t +1)/2 ?\n\nWait, let's take len_t = 2*len_s -k. Since k is at least 1, then len_t ≤ 2*len_s -1 → len_s ≥ (len_t +1)/2 ?\n\nYes, because 2*len_s ≥ len_t +1 → len_s ≥ (len_t +1)/2.\n\nAlso, len_s must be at most len_t -1. Because len_t = 2*len_s -k. Since k is at least 1, len_t = 2*len_s -k ≤ 2*len_s -1 → len_t +1 ≤ 2*len_s → len_s ≥ (len_t +1)/2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nBut regardless, the possible len_s values are in the range from ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ) up to len_t -1.\n\nWait, for example, if len_t is 5, then len_s can be from (5+1)/2 = 3 up to 5-1=4. So len_s can be 3 or 4.\n\nFor each such len_s, compute k = 2*len_s - len_t. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s-1.\n\nBut since len_s is chosen in the range that ensures that, perhaps we can proceed.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each possible len_s in the range [ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ), len_t -1 ]:\n\n   compute k = 2*len_s - len_t\n\n   check that 1 <= k <= len_s -1 (but since len_s is in that range, this should be true)\n\n   Now, check if the first len_s -k characters of t match the last len_s -k characters of t. Because when two s's are merged with an overlap of k, the first s is s[0... len_s -1], and the second s is s[0... len_s -1]. When merged, the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s. So for the merged string to be t, the first s's prefix (up to len_s -k) must be followed by the second s's suffix (from k onwards). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when two s's are merged with an overlap of k, the first s is s, and the second s is s. The overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. So the merged string would be s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s[0 ... len_s -1] ?\n\nNo, wait, the merged string is s concatenated with s, but overlapping the last k characters of the first s with the first k of the second. So the total length is len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k. Which equals len_t.\n\nSo the merged string t should be equal to the first s, but with the last k characters overlapping with the first k of the second s. Therefore, the first part of t is the first (len_s -k) characters of s, followed by the entire s (since the overlapping part is covered once). Wait, no. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake s = 'abcde' (len_s = 5), and overlap k=2. Then the first s is abcde, the second is abcde. They overlap by the last two characters of the first and the first two of the second. So the merged string would be abcdabcde? No, wait. The first s is abcde, the second is abcde. Overlapping the last 2 characters (de) with the first 2 (ab)? No, that's not possible. Wait, the overlapping must be that the end of the first message and the start of the second message have the same characters. So for example, if the first message ends with 'ab', and the second starts with 'ab', then overlapping would merge them into a single string that is the first message's part before the overlapping part, plus the second message's entire string. So for example, if first message is 'xab' and second is 'ab', then overlapping by 2 characters would result in 'xab'.\n\nWait, the problem says that the two messages are merged such that the end of the first message is overlapped with the start of the second. The overlapping part must be same characters. So the first message's last k characters must equal the second message's first k characters. So when merged, the resulting string is the first message's first (len_s -k) characters, followed by the entire second message. Because the overlapping part is merged once.\n\nTherefore, the merged string t must be equal to s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s. Because the overlapping part is the last k of s (the first message) and the first k of s (the second message). Therefore, the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters, followed by the entire s.\n\nSo the length of t is (len_s -k) + len_s = 2*len_s -k, which matches.\n\nBut since t is given, for a candidate len_s, we can check if the first (len_s -k) characters of t are equal to the first (len_s -k) characters of s, and then the rest of t (from len_s -k onwards) is equal to s. But how do we get s?\n\nWait, the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters followed by s. So the entire t is equal to that. So the entire t must be equal to s's first part plus s. Therefore, the entire t must be of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k. Which it is.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, since the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters followed by s, then the entire t must be equal to the first part plus s. So the s must be equal to the substring of t starting from position (len_s -k) to the end. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote that the merged string t is equal to (s[0 ... len_s -k -1]) + s. So the length of t is (len_s -k) + len_s = 2*len_s -k. Therefore, the part of t from position (len_s -k) onwards is s. Therefore, s must be equal to t[len_s -k : ].\n\nBut then, we need to check that the first part of t (before len_s -k) is equal to the first part of s (up to len_s -k). But since s is t[len_s -k : ], then the first part of t (before len_s -k) must be equal to s[0 ... (len_s -k -1)].\n\nBut since s is t[len_s -k : ], then s[0 ... (len_s -k -1)] is equal to t[len_s -k : len_s -k + (len_s -k -1) + 1 ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think with variables.\n\nLet me suppose that for a given len_s, we calculate k = 2*len_s - len_t.\n\nThen, the length of the first part is len_s -k. Let's call this m = len_s -k.\n\nThen, the merged string t is equal to the first m characters of s, followed by s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s's first m characters + s. Which implies that the substring of t starting at position m is equal to s. Therefore, s must be equal to t[m:].\n\nBut then, the first m characters of t must be equal to the first m characters of s. Since s is t[m:], then the first m characters of s are t[m: m + m] ?\n\nWait, no. Because s has length len_s. So m is len_s -k, and k is 2*len_s - len_t. Let's compute m:\n\nm = len_s - (2*len_s - len_t) = len_t - len_s.\n\nSo m = len_t - len_s.\n\nBut len_t = 2*len_s -k → substituting, m = (2*len_s -k) - len_s = len_s -k → which matches.\n\nBut since m is len_t - len_s, and len_t is fixed, for each len_s, m is known.\n\nSo for example, if len_s is a candidate, then m = len_t - len_s.\n\nNow, since the merged string is the first m characters of s followed by the entire s, then the entire t must be equal to (s[0...m-1]) + s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s[0...m-1] + s.\n\nBut the length of s is len_s. So the length of the part after m is len_s. Therefore, the length of t is m + len_s = (len_t - len_s) + len_s = len_t. Which is correct.\n\nSo, given that, the s must be the substring of t starting at m, i.e., t[m:]. But then, we need to check that the first m characters of t are equal to the first m characters of s. Since s is t[m:], the first m characters of s are s[0...m-1], which is t[m: m + m] ?\n\nWait, no. Because s is t[m:], which is a string of length len_s. The first m characters of s are s[0...m-1], which is the first m characters of t[m:].\n\nBut m is len_t - len_s. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose t is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (as in the first example). The correct answer is \"abrakadabra\", which has length 11. Let's see:\n\nlen_t is 19 (the input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" which is 19 letters? Let me count: \"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters. Then the input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" — that's 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? Or maybe I'm getting the example wrong. Let me check the first example's input and output.\n\nIn the first example, input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. The output is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. So len_s is 11. len_t is 21. So len_t = 2*len_s -k → 21 = 22 -k → k=1. So m = len_t - len_s = 21 -11=10. So the first 10 characters of t must be equal to the first 10 characters of s. s is t[m:] = t[10:] which is 'abrakadabra' (from index 10 to end). The first 10 characters of s are 'abrakadabr' (since s is 11 letters, indexes 0-10). The first 10 characters of t are the first 10 letters of the original t. Let me see:\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's say the first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters) and the second is 'abrakadabra', but overlapping by 1 character. So the merged string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — which is 11 + 11 -1 = 21 letters. The first 10 letters of t would be 'abrakadabr' (the first 10 letters of the first s). The first 10 letters of s (which is 'abrakadabra') are 'abrakadabr', which matches. So yes, the check passes.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible len_s in the range [(len_t +1)//2, len_t -1], compute m = len_t - len_s. Then check if the first m characters of t are equal to the first m characters of s_candidate (which is t[m:]). Because s_candidate is t[m:], and the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:m], which is t[m: m + m] ?\n\nWait, no. Because s_candidate is t[m:], which is of length len_s. The first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0...m-1], which is t[m: m + m] if m + m <= len_s. But len_s is len_s = len(t) - m (since m = len_t - len_s → len_s = len_t - m). So len_s = len_t - m → m + len_s = len_t. So m + m = 2m. But len_t = len_s + m. Not sure. But regardless, the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:m], which is t[m : m + m] only if m + m <= len(s_candidate). But len(s_candidate) is len_s = len_t - m. So m + m <= len_t -m → 2m + m <= len_t → 3m <= len_t. Not sure if that's always true.\n\nBut regardless, the check we need to perform is: the first m characters of t must be equal to the first m characters of s_candidate. Since s_candidate is t[m:], the first m characters of s_candidate is the substring from t[m : m + m], but only if m + m <= len_s_candidate. However, len_s_candidate is len_s = len_t - m. So m + m = 2m. We need 2m ≤ len_s → 2m ≤ len_t - m → 3m ≤ len_t → m ≤ len_t /3. But since m is len_t - len_s, and len_s is ≥ (len_t +1)/2, then m = len_t - len_s ≤ len_t - (len_t +1)/2 = (len_t -1)/2. So for example, if len_t is even, len_t = 2k, then m ≤ (2k -1)/2 = k - 0.5 → m ≤ k-1. So 2m ≤ 2(k-1) = 2k - 2. len_s is len_t - m = 2k - m. Since m ≤ k-1, len_s ≥ 2k - (k-1) = k +1. So 2m ≤ 2(k-1) = 2k-2. len_s is at least k+1. So 2m ≤ 2k-2, and len_s is at least k+1. So 2m could be larger than len_s? For example, if len_t is 6, len_s is 3 (since (6+1)/2 is 3.5, so len_s starts from 4?), wait, earlier calculation said len_s must be in [(len_t +1)/2, len_t -1]. For len_t=6, (len_t +1)/2 is 3.5, so len_s must be ≥4. So len_s can be 4 or 5. For len_s=4, m = len_t - len_s = 6-4=2. len_s is 4. So 2m =4, which is equal to len_s. So the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:2], which is t[m: m+2] = t[2:4]. But s_candidate is t[2:], which is of length 4. So 0:2 is correct.\n\nThus, the check is: check if the first m characters of t (t[0:m]) is equal to the first m characters of s_candidate, which is s_candidate[0:m] = t[m: m + m] ?\n\nWait, no. Because s_candidate is t[m:], which is a string of length len_s. So the first m characters of s_candidate is t[m : m + m], but only if m + m <= len_s. But len_s is len_t - m. So m + m <= len_t - m → 3m <= len_t. But for len_s being in the allowed range, is this guaranteed?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, if len_t is 5, len_s is 3. Then m = 5-3=2. 3m =6>5. So 2m=4> len_s (3). So in this case, m=2, len_s=3. So the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:2], which is t[m: m+2] = t[2:4], which is of length 2. That's okay. Because len_s is 3, so the first m=2 characters of s_candidate is indeed t[2:4].\n\nSo regardless of the value of m, the first m characters of s_candidate is t[m : m + m], but only if m + m ≤ len_s. But if m + m > len_s, then the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:m], which is the entire string if m is equal to len_s. But in that case, len_s = m. So len_s = len_t - m → m = len_t - m → 2m = len_t → len_t must be even. For example, len_t is 6, m=3, len_s=3. Then s_candidate is t[3:], which is length 3. The first m=3 characters of s_candidate is the entire s_candidate. So the check would be if the first m=3 characters of t (t[0:3]) equals the first m=3 of s_candidate (t[3:6]).\n\nSo the general check is: t[0:m] == s_candidate[0:m], where s_candidate is t[m:]. So to check that, we can take t[0:m] and compare to t[m: m + m] if that is within the length of s_candidate. Wait, but s_candidate is t[m:], which is of length len_s. So the first m characters of s_candidate is t[m: m + m] if m + m <= len_s. Else, it's t[m: ] (but since len_s = len_t -m, and m + m is 2m, and len_s = len_t -m. So 2m <= len_s → 2m <= len_t -m → 3m <= len_t. But if that's not the case, then m + m > len_s, which would mean that the first m characters of s_candidate is the entire s_candidate (since len_s is less than m). But that's impossible, since m = len_t - len_s. And len_s is at least (len_t +1)/2. So m = len_t - len_s ≤ len_t - (len_t +1)/2 = (len_t -1)/2. For example, if len_t is 5, len_s is 3, m is 2. len_s is 3, m is 2. So 2m =4, which is larger than len_s (3). So the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:2], which is t[m: m + 2] = t[2:4], which is of length 2, which is correct.\n\nSo regardless, the check is t[0:m] == t[m: m + m] ?\n\nWait no. Because s_candidate is t[m:], and the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:m], which is t[m: m + m] if m + m is within the length of s_candidate. But if m + m exceeds the length of s_candidate, then it's t[m: ].\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[:m], which is t[m: m + m] if m + m <= len(s_candidate). Otherwise, it's t[m: ].\n\nBut len(s_candidate) is len_s = len_t - m. So m + m <= len_s → 2m <= len_t - m → 3m <= len_t → m <= len_t /3. But if m is larger than len_t /3, then 2m > len_s, so the first m characters of s_candidate is the entire s_candidate. But since len_s is len_t -m, and m is len_t - len_s, then len_s = len_t -m → m = len_t - len_s. So for example, if len_s is 3, len_t is 5, m is 2. len_s is 3, m is 2. So len_s is 3, m is 2. So the first m=2 characters of s_candidate (t[m:]) is t[m: m + 2] = t[2:4], which is correct. Because len_s is 3, so t[m:] is length 3. So 2 is less than 3, so we can take the first 2 characters.\n\nSo in code, to check if the first m characters of t is equal to the first m characters of s_candidate, which is t[m: m + m] if possible, else t[m:] ?\n\nBut no, the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[:m], which is the same as t[m: m + m] if m + m <= len(s_candidate). Otherwise, it's t[m:] (but that would be shorter than m characters, which can't be since len(s_candidate) is len_s = len_t -m. So len(s_candidate) is len_t -m. So m is len_t - len_s. So len(s_candidate) = len_t -m = len_s. So len(s_candidate) = len_s. So the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[:m], which is of length min(m, len_s). But since len_s = len_t -m, and m is in the range [(len_t +1)/2, len_t -1], let's check if m can be larger than len_s.\n\nWait, m is len_t - len_s. len_s is >= (len_t +1)/2. So m = len_t - len_s <= len_t - (len_t +1)/2 = (len_t -1)/2. For example, if len_t is 5, then (len_t +1)/2 is 3, len_s can be 3 or 4. For len_s=3, m=5-3=2. len_s is 3. So m=2 < len_s. For len_s=4, m=5-4=1 < len_s=4. So m is always less than len_s. Because len_s is at least (len_t +1)/2. So m = len_t - len_s <= len_t - (len_t +1)/2 = (len_t -1)/2. And len_s is at least (len_t +1)/2. So len_s is larger than m. So m is less than len_s. Therefore, the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[:m], which is t[m: m + m] because m + m <= len_s? Not necessarily. For example, len_s could be 4, m=3. Then len_s is 4, m is 3. So m + m =6, which is larger than len_s (4). So s_candidate[:m] is the first 3 characters of s_candidate, which is t[m: m +3]. But since len_s is 4, m +3 = 3 +3 =6, but len(s_candidate) is 4. So t[m: m +3] is t[3:6], but since s_candidate is of length 4, that's t[3:6] is t[3], t[4], t[5]? Wait, but the original t has length len_t. So len_t is len_s + m. For len_s=4 and m=3, len_t is 4 +3=7. So t is of length 7. So t[m: m +3] is t[3:6], which is 3 characters, which is correct. So regardless, the first m characters of s_candidate is t[m: m + m] if m + m <= len_t, but len_t is len_s + m. So m + m = 2m. len_s is len_t -m. So 2m <= len_s → 2m <= len_t -m → 3m <= len_t. But since m is (len_t - len_s), and len_s is in the range [(len_t +1)/2, len_t -1], m can vary.\n\nBut regardless, in code, the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[:m], which is t[m: m + m] if m + m <= len(s_candidate), otherwise t[m: ] (but since m < len_s, and len_s is len_t -m, then m + m can be up to 2m, and len_s is len_t -m. So for example, when m is large, like m is len_t - len_s, but len_s is small. But in any case, in code, the way to get the first m characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[:m], which is t[m: m + m] if that is within the length of s_candidate. But in code, Python slicing handles it automatically. So in code, for s_candidate = t[m:], then s_candidate[:m] is the first m characters of s_candidate. Therefore, the check is t[0:m] == s_candidate[:m].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible len_s in the range from ceil( (len_t + 1)/2 ) to len_t -1:\n\n   m = len_t - len_s\n\n   k = 2*len_s - len_t\n\n   if k is not between 1 and len_s -1 → skip (but according to earlier constraints, it should be)\n\n   s_candidate = t[m:]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) != len_s → which it will be, since m = len_t - len_s, and len_t is len(t), len(s_candidate) is len(t) - m = len_t - (len_t - len_s) = len_s.\n\n   check if t[0:m] == s_candidate[:m]\n\n   if yes → then check if the entire t is equal to s_candidate[:m] + s_candidate → which it should be, because m is len_t - len_s, and len(s_candidate) is len_s. So m + len_s = len_t. So the concatenation of s_candidate[:m] and s_candidate is exactly t. But since we already checked that t[0:m] is equal to s_candidate[:m], then the entire t is equal to s_candidate[:m] + s_candidate → which is the same as s_candidate[:m] + s_candidate. Therefore, if this check passes, then the s_candidate is a valid s.\n\nOnce we find such a len_s and s_candidate, then we can output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nBut also, we need to make sure that the overlapping is not full. The problem says that the full overlap (where one message completely covers the other) is not considered an error. For example, if t is 'abcd', then it's considered as two messages sent normally, not as an error. Similarly, if t is 'abcabc', it's considered as two messages sent normally, not as an error.\n\nWait, the problem says that the error is when two messages are merged with an overlap. But the full overlap (i.e., when the entire first message is overlapped with the entire second message) is not considered an error. How does that fit into our current approach?\n\nThe full overlap would be when the first message is entirely overlapped with the second. For example, if s is 'abcd', then sending two messages would result in 'abcd' (full overlap) which is not considered an error. But according to our code, when would that happen?\n\nIn that case, len_t = len_s. So len_t = len_s. But according to our len_s range, len_s must be between (len_t +1)/2 and len_t -1. But if len_t = len_s, then len_s is len_t, but len_t -1 is len_s -1. So len_s can't be in the range. Therefore, our code would not consider that case. Thus, our code would not generate such cases. Therefore, the code would not consider the full overlap as a possible error scenario.\n\nSimilarly, the case where the two messages are concatenated without any overlap (i.e., k=0) is not considered an error. But in our code, k is 2*len_s - len_t. For that to be zero, len_t = 2*len_s. Which would imply that m = len_t - len_s = len_s. Then, the check would be whether the first m = len_s characters of t is equal to the first m characters of s_candidate. But s_candidate is t[m:] which is t[len_s:], which is len_t - len_s = len_s characters. So s_candidate is of length len_s. Then, the check is if t[0: len_s] == s_candidate[: len_s], which is t[0: len_s] == t[len_s: len_s + len_s] → which is t[0: len_s] == t[len_s: 2*len_s]. But since len_t is 2*len_s, that's the entire string. So the check is whether the first half of t equals the second half. Which would be true if the two messages are concatenated normally. But according to the problem statement, this case is not considered an error. Therefore, our code would generate s_candidate as the second half of t (t[len_s:]) and check if the first half equals the first len_s characters of s_candidate. Which is the same as checking if the first half equals the second half. If that's true, then our code would output YES and the s_candidate. But according to the problem statement, this case should not be considered as an error. Therefore, our code would incorrectly output YES for such cases.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because the problem says that the case where two messages are simply concatenated (no overlap) is not considered an error. So our code must not consider such cases as valid.\n\nSo how to handle that?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the input is 'abcabc', then len_t is 6. Possible len_s ranges from (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → 4 to len_t -1 = 5.\n\nSo len_s can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor len_s =4:\n\nm = 6 -4 =2.\n\nk = 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2.\n\nCheck if 1 ≤k ≤ len_s -1 → 2 ≤3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[2:] → 'cabc'.\n\nCheck if t[0:2] (ab) equals s_candidate[:2] (ca) → no. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=5:\n\nm =6-5=1.\n\nk= 2*5 -6=4. Check if 1 ≤4 ≤4 (since len_s-1=4). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[1:] → 'bcabc'.\n\nCheck if t[0:1] (a) equals s_candidate[:1] (b) → no. So invalid.\n\nThus, for the input 'abcabc', the code would not find any valid len_s, and thus output NO. Which matches the sample input's third example where input is 'abcabc' and output is NO. So that case is handled correctly.\n\nAnother example: if the input is 'aaaaa', len_t=5. Let's see.\n\nPossible len_s ranges from (5+1)/2=3 to 4.\n\nFor len_s=3:\n\nm=5-3=2.\n\nk=2*3 -5=6-5=1 → valid.\n\ns_candidate is t[2:] → 'aaa'.\n\nCheck if t[0:2] (aa) equals s_candidate[:2] (aa) → yes.\n\nSo the code would output YES and s_candidate 'aaa'.\n\nBut wait, what's the scenario here? Two copies of 'aaa' merged with an overlap of 1. The merged string would be 'aaaaa'.\n\nBut the original two messages are 'aaa' and 'aaa'. Overlap of 1: the first message's last 1 character is 'a', the second message's first 1 is 'a'. So merged string is first message's first 2 characters (aa) + second message (aaa) → 'aaaaa' which is correct. So the code would output YES and 'aaa', which is correct.\n\nBut what if the input is 'aaaa', len_t=4. Let's see.\n\nPossible len_s ranges from (4+1)/2=2.5 → 3 to 3 (since len_t-1=3).\n\nSo len_s=3.\n\nm=4-3=1.\n\nk=2*3 -4=2. Check if 1 ≤2 ≤2 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[1:] → 'aaa'.\n\nCheck if t[0:1] (a) equals s_candidate[:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message, and the overlapping part must be at least one character but less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Constraints**: For a valid overlap, the length of the merged string `t` must be such that it can be formed by two identical strings `s` with an overlap. This means the length of `t` must be between `len_s + 1` and `2 * len_s - 1`, where `len_s` is the length of `s`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length of `s` (denoted as `len_s`), check if the length of `t` fits within the valid range for overlap. This range is derived from the constraints on the overlap length.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Overlap**: For each valid `len_s`, compute the potential overlap length and verify if the first part of `t` matches the corresponding part of the candidate string `s`.\n\n4. **Construct Candidate String**: If a valid overlap is found, construct the candidate string `s` and verify that it meets all conditions for being a valid original message.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    t = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    len_t = len(t)\n    found = False\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over possible len_s values\n    for len_s in range((len_t + 1) // 2, len_t):\n        m = len_t - len_s\n        k = 2 * len_s - len_t\n        if k < 1 or k >= len_s:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[m:]\n        if len(s_candidate) != len_s:\n            continue\n        # Check if the first m characters of t match the first m of s_candidate\n        if t[:m] == s_candidate[:m]:\n            # Also ensure that the entire t is s_candidate[:m] + s_candidate\n            # which is guaranteed by construction\n            # Additionally, ensure that the overlap is not full (which is already handled by k < len_s)\n            # and that it's not just concatenation (k=0)\n            # Since k >=1, we are okay\n            result = s_candidate\n            found = True\n            break\n    \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Range of Lengths**: The possible lengths of `s` are determined by iterating from `(len_t + 1) // 2` to `len_t - 1`. This ensures that the overlap length `k` is valid.\n- **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `len_s`, compute the overlap length `k` and check if the first part of `t` matches the corresponding part of the candidate string `s`.\n- **Candidate String Construction**: The candidate string `s` is constructed by slicing `t` starting from `m` (where `m` is derived from `len_t` and `len_s`). This ensures that the candidate string is checked against the overlap conditions.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid overlaps and ensures that the solution adheres to the problem constraints, providing the correct result in optimal time.",
