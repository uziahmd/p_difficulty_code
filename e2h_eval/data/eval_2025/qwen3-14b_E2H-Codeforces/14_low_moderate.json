He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n such that the count of trailing zeros in n! is exactly m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. But how to find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that when you compute the trailing zeros function, you get exactly m. However, there's a catch here. For example, when m is 5, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) which all have exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, why? Because for 5! it's 120 (one zero), but wait no. Wait the example given says that for m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait no, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 numbers. Wait let me check the example again.\n\nWait in the example input, the first case is m=1. The output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but 5! is 120 (ends with one zero). 6! is 720 (also one zero). Similarly for 7!, 8!, 9! — each ends with one zero. But wait, 10! would have two zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. That's five numbers. So why is that?\n\nBecause the count of trailing zeros increases by 1 when n crosses multiples of 5. But when you hit 25, which is 5^2, you get an extra zero. So the function that counts the number of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe some other number?\n\nWait, the key point is that for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or perhaps more? Let me think. Suppose m is such that there's a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. For example, when m is 5, the numbers 24, 25? Wait no, let's calculate.\n\nWait for n=24: count is 24//5 =4, 24//25=0. Total 4. For n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5? Wait that's not possible. Wait what about n=25? No, the count is 6. So for m=5, there's no solution? But that's impossible. Wait maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me think of how the count of trailing zeros increases. For example:\n\nn=5 → count is 1.\n\nn=6 → same count as 5, since 6/5 is 1.2 → floor is 1. So for n=5,6,7,8,9, the count is 1. Then when n=10, count is 2 (since 10/5=2, 10/25=0). So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14. So that's 5 numbers again.\n\nBut for n=25, the count is 25//5 + 25//25 =5+1=6. So for numbers between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25-29). But what about for m=5? There's no n for which the count is 5. Because when n=24, the count is 4 + 0 = 4. When n=25, it's 6. So there's a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must output these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one trailing zero, and higher powers (like 25, 125, etc.) contribute additional zeros.\n\nThe formula to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is **non-decreasing** as $ n $ increases. Hence, for any given $ m $, the values of $ n $ that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeros will form a contiguous range.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Valid Range**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n   - Then check if there are more numbers in sequence where $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If no such $ n $ exists (i.e., the count never reaches $ m $), return `0`.\n   - If such $ n $ exists, collect all consecutive $ n $ values that satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n- Define a helper function `count_zeros(n)` that computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- Use binary search to find the lower bound of $ n $ such that `count_zeros(n) == m`.\n- From this point, continue checking consecutive values until the count changes, collecting all valid $ n $'s.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_with_m_zeros(m):\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) == m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    result = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz == m:\n            result = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if result == -1:\n        return []\n\n    # Now find all consecutive n's starting from result with same count_zeros\n    ans = []\n    while count_zeros(result) == m:\n        ans.append(result)\n        result += 1\n\n    return ans\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_values = [int(x) for x in input_line.split()]\n\n    for m in m_values:\n        ns = find_n_with_m_zeros(m)\n        print(len(ns))\n        if len(ns) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage\n\nFor input:\n\n```\n1 5\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n0\n```\n\nThis reflects that for $ m = 1 $, the valid $ n $ values are 5 through 9, and for $ m = 5 $, there are no $ n $ such that $ n! $ has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The binary search runs in $ O(\\log(5m)) $.\n- The loop after finding the initial match runs in $ O(k) $, where $ k $ is the number of valid $ n $'s (which is typically small, up to 5).\n- Overall time complexity: $ O(\\log m) $ per query.\n\nThis ensures the solution is efficient even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
