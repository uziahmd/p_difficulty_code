He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factorial is divisible by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization. But since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s in the factors of the numbers up to n.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero. Let's call this function Z(n).\n\nThe problem is, given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m. Then output the count and the numbers sorted.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me take the example given. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nZ(5) = 1 (5/5=1). Then for 6, it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then at 10, Z(10) is 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0). So between 5-9, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe other counts?\n\nWait, but how can there be multiple n's with the same Z(n)? Because when you increase n by 1, sometimes Z(n) increases by 1, sometimes more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then Z(n) increases by 1. But when it's a multiple of 25, it increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for example, when you cross 25, Z(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between 25 and 24, the Z increases by 2. So for m=6, there would be numbers from 25 up to some point where Z increases again. Wait, but for numbers between 25 and 29, their Z would be 6. Let's see:\n\nFor 25: 6 zeros. 26: same as 25, because adding 26 doesn't add any 5s. So Z(26) = Z(25) = 6. Same for 27, 28, 29. Then 30: Z(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So for m=6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers again. So that seems like a pattern.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's no n with Z(n) = m? For example, let's say m=5. Let's see. Let's find n where Z(n)=5. Let's compute Z(24) = 24/5=4 + 24/25=0 → 4. Z(25) is 6. So there's no n where Z(n)=5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n such that Z(n) = m. And if so, find all such n's.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For a given m, find the possible n's where Z(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find them?\n\nFirst, we can note that for each m, there can be either 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number that's not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't change the count of 5s. So for example, if n is such that Z(n) = m, then n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 may also have the same Z(n) if they don't cross a multiple of 5. But if n is a multiple of 5, then adding 1 would",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding all such numbers `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial. The formula to count trailing zeros in `n!` is given by:\n   $$\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Range**: For a given `m`, we can use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. This helps in determining the range of valid `n` values.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: After finding the range, we need to check if there exists any `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. If not, the result is zero. If such `n` exists, we collect all valid numbers in that range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    right = -1\n\n    # Find the first n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z == m:\n            left = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if left == -1:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the last n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    low = left\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z == m:\n            right = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # Check if there's at least one n with count_zeros(n) == m\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Now, collect all numbers from left to right\n    return list(range(left, right + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if not input:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    m = int(input)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` using the formula described.\n2. **find_n_values(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. It then checks if such values exist and returns the range of valid `n` values.\n3. **main()**: This reads the input, processes it, and prints the results. It handles edge cases where no valid `n` exists and ensures the output is formatted correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
