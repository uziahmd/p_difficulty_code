The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so the first thing I need to figure out is how to pair the chests and keys efficiently. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. \n\nWait, but for the even chests, they need odd keys. And for the odd chests, they need even keys. So the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nOh right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, but each key can only be used once. Similarly for the other way around. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity.\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1, even_keys = 3.\n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output. \n\nSecond example: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. And odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems solid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the list of chests, count how many are even (even_chest_count) and how many are odd (odd_chest_count).\n- For the list of keys, count how many are even (even_key_count) and how many are odd (odd_key_count).\n- The answer is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a_i, then list of b_j.\n\nThen compute the counts.\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nIn Python, for the a list, we can loop through each element and check if it's even or odd. Same for the b list.\n\nSo:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\n    else:\n        odd_chest +=1\n\neven_key = 0\nodd_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num %2 ==0:\n        even_key +=1\n    else:\n        odd_key +=1\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na: 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So even_chest=3, odd_chest=2.\n\nb: 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So even_key=3, odd_key=1.\n\nmin(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond input:\n\nn=5, m=1. a is all even. even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. b is 5 (odd). So odd_key=1, even_key=0. min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird input: n=1, m=4. a is 10 (even). even_chest=1. b is all even. even_key=4, odd_key=0. So min(1,0)=0. min(0,4)=0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nEdge cases: What if there are zero even chests? Or zero odd keys?\n\nLike, if all chests are odd, and all keys are even. Then min(odd_chest, even_key) would be the number of chests (if even_key is >= odd_chest). So that's handled.\n\nAnother case: if there are more keys than needed. Like, even_chest is 2, odd_key is 5. Then min(2,5) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nYes, this approach should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is straightforward and efficient. Since n and m are up to 1e5, the code runs in O(n + m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Pairs**: \n   - Even chests can be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\n    else:\n        odd_chest += 1\n\neven_key = 0\nodd_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\n    else:\n        odd_key += 1\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Parities**: We iterate through each number in the chests and keys lists to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Matching Pairs**: Using the counts of even and odd numbers from both lists, we determine the maximum possible pairs where the sum of a chest and a key is odd. This is done by taking the minimum of the respective counts for valid pairs (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently processes the input in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements each.",
