After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line is a string of digits. So, for example, if the input is '223', then the first student's marks are 2, 2, 3 for the three subjects.\n\nSo, I need to read the input, parse the marks into a 2D array. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then convert each line into a list of integers. So, for example, the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nSo the successful students are student 0 (has max in subject 0 and 2), student 1 (max in subject 1), and student 2 has no max in any subject. So total is 2.\n\nWait the sample output says 2. Oh right, because student 0 is best in subject 0 and 2, student 1 is best in subject 1. Student 2 isn't. So total 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n- Then, for each student, check if there exists at least one column where their mark in that column is equal to the maximum of that column.\n- The count of such students is the answer.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's see. The input comes as a single string, but in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps in actual code, it's read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given through standard input. So for example, the first input line is n and m, then n lines follow.\n\nSo, in code, I can read the first line as n, m = map(int, input().split()). Then read the next n lines as strings, each of length m.\n\nThen, for each of these strings, we can convert them into a list of integers. So, for example, for the first sample, the marks would be stored as a list of lists:\n\nmarks = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute for each column the maximum.\n\nSo for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_per_subject[j] = max( marks[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have this array, then for each student i, check if any of their marks in any subject j is equal to max_per_subject[j]. If yes, then count them.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string, then convert each into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nInitialize a counter to 0.\n\nFor each student in the list:\n\n   for each subject j:\n\n       if student's mark in j is equal to max_per_subject[j], then mark this student as successful and break.\n\n   if any such j found, increment the counter.\n\nSo, the code.\n\nNow, how to process the columns. For example, for the marks list, for each column j, collect all the values in that column.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert the gradebook data into a 2D list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in at least one subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_per_subject[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful = True\n            break\n    if successful:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved in that subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, increment the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum marks for each subject and check each student's performance against these maxima, resulting in an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
