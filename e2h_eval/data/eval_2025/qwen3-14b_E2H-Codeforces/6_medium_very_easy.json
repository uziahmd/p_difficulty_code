Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If it's impossible, output -1.\n\nSo, the input is n vouchers, each with li (start day), ri (end day), and cost. The duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where the sum of their durations is exactly x. Also, they must not overlap. That means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. Because n can be up to 2e5, so O(n^2) approaches are definitely out of the question. So we need something smarter.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher that can pair with it such that their durations sum to x, and they don't overlap. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say for a voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration x - d. So for each voucher, we can look for vouchers of duration (x - d) that start after this voucher ends, or end before this voucher starts.\n\nBut how to find those quickly?\n\nMaybe pre-process vouchers by their duration. Like, create a dictionary where for each possible duration, we have a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their start and end times. Then, for each voucher, we can check if there's a voucher of duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all vouchers of the required duration might be expensive. However, perhaps we can find the minimal cost for vouchers of a certain duration that start after a certain time or end before a certain time.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for each voucher i, which has duration d_i, we want to find a voucher j with duration (x - d_i). Let's call the target duration as t = x - d_i. So, for each voucher i, we check if there's a voucher j with duration t, and that j does not overlap with i.\n\nNow, for j to not overlap with i, either:\n\n- j's end < i's start (so j ends before i starts)\nOR\n- i's end < j's start (so i ends before j starts)\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can check for vouchers of duration t that end before li (so that they can be before i), or start after ri (so that they can be after i).\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost in these cases?\n\nLet me think about preprocessing for each duration. For example, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by the end time (so that for vouchers of duration d, we can find those that end before a certain time)\n- Another sorted by the start time (so that for vouchers of duration d, we can find those that start after a certain time)\n\nWait, but for vouchers of duration t, if we want to find those that end before a certain value (like li of voucher i), then we can have a sorted list of their end times, and find the minimal cost among those that end before li. Similarly, for those that start after ri, we can have a sorted list of their start times, and find the minimal cost among those that start after ri.\n\nBut how to efficiently get the minimal cost for these ranges?\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can precompute two arrays:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, along with the minimum cost up to that point. So for example, for vouchers of duration d, sorted by end time, we can have a prefix min array. Then, given a query of \"find the minimal cost among vouchers of duration d where end <= some value\", we can binary search the sorted end times to find the latest end time <= that value, and then take the corresponding prefix min.\n\nSimilarly, for the start time. For vouchers of duration d, sorted by start time, we can have a suffix min array. Then, given a query of \"find the minimal cost among vouchers of duration d where start >= some value\", we can binary search the sorted start times to find the earliest start time >= that value, and then take the suffix min from that point onwards.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, where for each duration d, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. A list of vouchers sorted by their end time, and for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost up to that position (prefix min).\n\n   b. A list of vouchers sorted by their start time, and for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost from that position onwards (suffix min).\n\nBut wait, for each duration d, we can create two structures:\n\nFor vouchers of duration d:\n\n- Sorted by end time, and for each voucher in this sorted list, we have a prefix min array. So when we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration d that end before a certain value, we can binary search in this sorted list to find the largest end time <= that value, then take the prefix min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers sorted by start time, and a suffix min array. So for a given start time, we can binary search to find the first voucher with start time >= that value, and then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, with duration d_i, we compute t = x - d_i. If t is not present in our duration dictionary, then skip. Otherwise, for that t, we check two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Find a voucher j of duration t that ends before li. Then, the minimal cost for such j is the minimal cost in the prefix of vouchers of duration t sorted by end time, up to end time < li.\n\nCase 2: Find a voucher j of duration t that starts after ri. Then, the minimal cost for such j is the minimal cost in the suffix of vouchers of duration t sorted by start time, starting from start time > ri.\n\nWe can then take the minimum between these two possibilities (if they exist) and combine with the current voucher's cost.\n\nSo, the overall approach would be:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into the duration dictionary, with the sorted lists and min arrays.\n\n- For each voucher i:\n\n   - Compute d_i = ri - li + 1\n\n   - Compute t = x - d_i. If t is not in the duration dictionary, skip.\n\n   - Else, check for vouchers of duration t that can be placed before or after voucher i.\n\n   - For the before case: find the minimal cost in duration t vouchers that end before li.\n\n   - For the after case: find the minimal cost in duration t vouchers that start after ri.\n\n   - Take the minimum of these two (if available) and add to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut also, we need to make sure that we are considering all possible pairs. However, since we process each voucher once, and for each voucher, check for possible partners in the other duration, this should cover all possible pairs. Because for a pair (i,j), one of them will have duration d and the other t, and when we process i, we look for j, and when processing j, we look for i. However, since we are looking for both possibilities (before and after), we need to make sure that we are not missing any cases.\n\nBut since we process all vouchers, and for each voucher, check both possibilities (before and after), this approach should capture all possible valid pairs.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut how to handle the preprocessing steps?\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nFor each duration d, we need:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end time. Let's call this list 'end_sorted'. Each entry in this list is (end_time, cost). Then, we can compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 elements.\n\nSimilarly, for the same duration d, we need a list of vouchers sorted by start time. Let's call this list 'start_sorted'. Each entry is (start_time, cost). Then, compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i-th element to the end.\n\nWait, but for the start_sorted list, when we want to find the minimal cost among vouchers with start_time >= some value, we can find the first index in the sorted list where start_time >= that value, and then take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nSo, for example, suppose the start_sorted list is sorted in ascending order. For a given target_start, we can binary search to find the first start_time >= target_start. All elements from that index onwards have start_time >= target_start. The suffix_min array for that list will allow us to get the minimum cost in that subarray.\n\nSimilarly for the end_sorted list. For example, if we have a target_end, we can binary search the end_sorted list for the largest end_time <= target_end. All elements up to that index have end_time <= target_end, and the prefix_min array gives the minimum cost up to that index.\n\nSo, the steps for preprocessing:\n\nFor each voucher, compute its duration d. Then, for each duration d, collect all vouchers. Then, for each d, sort the vouchers by end time, and create a prefix_min array. Also, sort the vouchers by start time, and create a suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? Well, the vouchers can have same start and end times, but different costs. But the sorting is based on the start or end times, and the min arrays will take care of the minimal cost.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, for each voucher, read li, ri, cost. Compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a tuple of (end_sorted, prefix_min, start_sorted, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to build this.\n\nFor example:\n\nInitialize duration_dict as a defaultdict. For each duration d, we'll store two sorted lists (for end and start) and their respective min arrays.\n\nBut building these for each duration:\n\nFor each voucher, group by duration. Then, for each group:\n\nSort the vouchers by end time, and create prefix min array.\n\nSort the vouchers by start time, and create suffix min array.\n\nSo, for example, for a group of vouchers with duration d:\n\nend_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.end_time)\n\nthen, prefix_min = [ ... ] where prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted list.\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? Maybe for each duration d, we can have two lists:\n\nend_list: list of (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time.\n\nstart_list: list of (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time.\n\nThen, for end_list, we can create a prefix_min array. For example:\n\nprefix_min[0] = end_list[0].cost\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list, the suffix_min array:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = start_list[-1].cost\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(start_list[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce these are built, then for any query, we can perform a binary search on the appropriate list.\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher i:\n\nCompute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\nt = x - d_i.\n\nIf t is not in duration_dict, then skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for vouchers of duration t that end before li (case 1) and those that start after ri (case 2).\n\nFor case 1:\n\nIn the end_list of duration t, find the largest end_time <= li - 1 (since if voucher j ends before li, then j's end is <= li-1).\n\nIf such a voucher exists, then the minimal cost is the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nIn the start_list of duration t, find the smallest start_time >= ri + 1 (since voucher j starts after ri, so j's start is >= ri + 1).\n\nIf such a voucher exists, then the minimal cost is the suffix_min from that index.\n\nThen, for each case, if found, we take the current voucher's cost plus the found minimal cost, and compare with the global minimum.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search?\n\nFor case 1:\n\nWe have end_list sorted by end_time. We need to find the maximum end_time <= (li - 1). So, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of (li - 1 + 1) ? Wait, let's think.\n\nSuppose the end_list is sorted. For example, the end times are [1,3,5,7]. Suppose we want to find the largest end_time <= target.\n\nWe can use bisect_right to find the insertion index of target + 1, then subtract 1. Or bisect_right for target, and then take index - 1.\n\nWait, for example, target is 4. The end times are [1,3,5,7]. bisect_right returns 2 (since 4 would be inserted after 3). So the index is 2, and the largest element <=4 is at index 1 (value 3). So yes, bisect_right gives us the insertion point, and the index is insertion_point - 1.\n\nBut if the insertion point is 0, that means no elements are <= target.\n\nSo, for case 1, for the end_list of duration t:\n\ntarget_end = li - 1\n\nWe can perform a bisect_right on the end_list's end times (we can extract a list of end times for the binary search). Let me think, for the end_list, which is a list of tuples (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time. So for the binary search, we can create a list of end_times = [v[0] for v in end_list].\n\nBut for efficiency, maybe during preprocessing, we can store the end_list as a list of end times, and the corresponding costs. Or perhaps during the preprocessing, we can separate the end times and the prefix min.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search, we can extract the end times from the end_list.\n\nBut for large n, this could be time-consuming. So perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nFor the end_sorted list, a list of end times (sorted), and the prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted list, a list of start times (sorted), and the suffix_min array.\n\nSo for example, for each duration d, duration_dict[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min).\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d:\n\nCollect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nSort them by end_time, and create end_times list (sorted), and prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly, sort by start_time, create start_times list (sorted), and suffix_min array.\n\nSo, for case 1, during processing voucher i:\n\nWe have target_end = li - 1.\n\nWe look into the end_times list of duration t. Perform a bisect_right to find the insertion point of target_end + 1? No, target_end is the maximum allowed. So, using bisect_right(end_times, target_end) gives us the insertion index. If the index is 0, then no elements. Else, the maximum index is index-1.\n\nIf index is 0, then no such voucher. Else, the minimal cost is prefix_min[index - 1].\n\nSimilarly for case 2: target_start = ri + 1.\n\nWe look into the start_times list of duration t. Perform bisect_left to find the first start_time >= target_start. If the index is beyond the list length, then no such voucher. Else, the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute duration, and group them by duration.\n\nThen, for each duration in the group, process the end_sorted and start_sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher i, compute d_i and t = x - d_i. If t is not in the duration_dict, skip. Else, process the two cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nBut how to handle the grouping. Let's use a defaultdict to map duration to a list of vouchers.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nThen, for each voucher, append to the list for its duration.\n\nOnce all vouchers are grouped, for each duration d in the defaultdict, process the list:\n\nFor the end_sorted:\n\nSort the vouchers by end_time (ri), then create a list of end_times (ri), and prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted: sort by li, then create start_times and suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nFor example, for end_sorted:\n\nvouchers are sorted by end_time. So for each voucher in the list, we can collect their end_time and cost. Then, the prefix_min array is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current cost).\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_min array for start_sorted.\n\nOnce these are built, during the processing of each voucher, we can perform the binary searches.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nImplementing the preprocessing:\n\nfor each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers (each is a tuple (li, ri, cost))\n\n   sort the vouchers by ri (end time) to get end_sorted_vouchers.\n\n   end_times = [voucher[1] for voucher in end_sorted_vouchers]\n\n   prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\n   prefix_min[0] = end_sorted_vouchers[0][2]\n\n   for i in 1 to len(end_sorted_vouchers)-1:\n\n      prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted_vouchers[i][2])\n\n   similarly for start_sorted_vouchers:\n\n   sort vouchers by li (start time)\n\n   start_times = [voucher[0] for voucher in start_sorted_vouchers]\n\n   suffix_min = [ ... ]\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted_vouchers[-1][2]\n\n   for i in range(len(start_sorted_vouchers)-2, -1, -1):\n\n      suffix_min[i] = min(start_sorted_vouchers[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nThen, store in the duration_dict for d, the end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i (original voucher, not grouped), we can process as follows:\n\nCompute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\nt = x - d_i.\n\nif t not in duration_dict, continue.\n\nelse:\n\n   get the end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min from duration_dict[t].\n\n   case 1: find vouchers in t that end before li (voucher i's start).\n\n   target_end = li - 1.\n\n   using bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end) to find insertion point.\n\n   if insertion_point > 0:\n\n      min_cost_before = prefix_min[insertion_point - 1]\n\n      total = current voucher's cost + min_cost_before\n\n      update the global minimum.\n\n   case 2: find vouchers in t that start after ri (voucher i's end).\n\n   target_start = ri + 1.\n\n   using bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start) to find the first index where start_time >= target_start.\n\n   if index < len(start_times):\n\n      min_cost_after = suffix_min[index]\n\n      total = current voucher's cost + min_cost_after\n\n      update the global minimum.\n\nSo, the code would need to import bisect.\n\nBut what about overlapping vouchers? For example, if a voucher j is in the same duration as t, but starts exactly at ri + 1. Then, it's non-overlapping. Because voucher i ends at ri, and voucher j starts at ri + 1. So, that's okay.\n\nNow, what about the case where the voucher i is paired with a voucher j that is processed in the same way? For example, when voucher j is considered, and we check for vouchers of duration x - t, which is d_i. So, the code would capture both possibilities. However, since we are considering all possible pairs, even if we process voucher i and j twice, the minimal cost will be found.\n\nBut since we are looking for the minimal total cost, even if we check both (i,j) and (j,i), the code would find the same pair twice. However, since we are taking the minimum, it's okay. But since we process all vouchers, and for each voucher, check both possibilities, it's possible that some pairs are considered twice. However, since we're tracking the global minimum, that's not a problem.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nWhat if x is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105)\n\nSo x is at least 2. So the duration of each voucher can be anything, but for two vouchers to have sum of durations equal to x, each of them must be at least 1, and sum to x. So, for example, if x is 2, each voucher must have duration 1 and 1.\n\nBut in the code, when processing each voucher, t can be x - d_i. So for example, if x is 2, and a voucher has duration 1, then t is 1, which is valid.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are multiple vouchers with same duration and start/end times. But the code handles that because the min arrays take the minimal cost.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2.\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher, check for t = 5 - d_i.\n\nFor the first voucher (d_i=3), t=5-3=2. So look for vouchers of duration 2.\n\nWhich are the second, third, fourth vouchers.\n\nFor case 1: vouchers of duration 2 that end before li=1. The first voucher's li is 1. So target_end is 0. Are there any vouchers of duration 2 with end time <= 0? No. So case 1 is invalid.\n\nCase 2: vouchers of duration 2 that start after ri=3. The voucher's ri is 3. So target_start is 4. Check the start_times of vouchers with duration 2.\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher2: l=1, r=2, cost5\n\nvoucher4: l=1, r=2, cost4\n\nvoucher3: l=5, r=6, cost1.\n\nSo when sorted by start time, the start_times are [1,1,5]. So for target_start=4, the bisect_left finds the first start >=4. The start_times are [1,1,5]. The bisect_left for 4 would return 2 (since 4 is between 1 and 5). So the index is 2. The suffix_min for index 2 is 1. So adding the current voucher's cost (4) + 1 = 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this is captured.\n\nAnother voucher in the sample is the third one (duration 2). For this voucher, t = 5 - 2 = 3. So looking for vouchers of duration 3. Which is the first voucher. Let's see.\n\nCase 1: vouchers of duration 3 that end before li=5. The first voucher's li is 1, ri is 3. So for voucher3 (li=5, ri=6, cost1), when processing it, t is 3. So looking for vouchers of duration 3. Which is the first voucher. So target_end is 5-1 = 4? Wait, no. Let me think: voucher3's li is 5. So case 1 is looking for vouchers that end before 5. The first voucher ends at 3, which is <=5. So the bisect_right on end_times of duration 3 (which is [3]) for target_end=5-1=4? Wait, no. Wait, the voucher is voucher3, which has li=5, ri=6. So for case 1, we want vouchers that end before li (5). So target_end is li -1 = 5-1=4. So the end_times for duration 3 is [3]. So bisect_right([3],4) returns 1. So insertion_point is 1, which is >0. So prefix_min[0] is 4. So adding 1 (voucher3's cost) +4 =5. Which is the same as before.\n\nThus, the code would find this pair.\n\nSo the code would capture both possibilities.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these steps.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut first, note that for each voucher, during the processing, we need to have access to its li, ri, cost. So during the initial reading, we can store all vouchers as a list.\n\nBut during the preprocessing, the groupings are done by duration.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list()\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, group by duration.\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict( list )\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the end_sorted and start_sorted lists, and their min arrays.\n\nBut how to store them. Perhaps, for each duration d, we can store:\n\nend_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nSo:\n\nprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # sort by end time (ri)\n\n    end_sorted = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in end_sorted]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for v in end_sorted:\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n\n    # sort by start time (li)\n\n    start_sorted = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in start_sorted]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for i in reversed(range(len(start_sorted))):\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, start_sorted[i][2] )\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\n    # store in processed\n\n    processed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nOnce that is done, then for each voucher in the original list, process as follows:\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d_i = ri - li + 1\n\n    t = x - d_i\n\n    if t not in processed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the data for duration t\n\n    end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = processed[t]\n\n    # case 1: find vouchers in t that end before li (voucher's start)\n\n    target_end = li - 1\n\n    # find insertion point using bisect_right\n\n    import bisect\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end)\n\n    if idx > 0:\n\n        min_cost_before = prefix_min[idx-1]\n\n        total = cost + min_cost_before\n\n        if total < answer:\n\n            answer = total\n\n    # case 2: find vouchers in t that start after ri (voucher's end)\n\n    target_start = ri + 1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n\n        min_cost_after = suffix_min[idx]\n\n        total = cost + min_cost_after\n\n        if total < answer:\n\n            answer = total\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if answer is still infinity, output -1 else answer.\n\nBut wait, what about when the same voucher is considered twice? For example, if a voucher is paired with itself? But the problem states that i != j. However, in the code above, when processing voucher i, we look for vouchers of duration t. If t is the same as d_i, then the code may find voucher i itself. But in that case, since we are looking for vouchers that end before li (voucher i's start) or start after ri (voucher i's end), which would not include voucher i itself. Because voucher i's end is ri, and for case 1, target_end is li-1. Since voucher i's start is li, and end is ri >= li. So for case 1, the voucher i's end is ri, which is >= li, which is larger than target_end (li-1). So it's not included. Similarly for case 2, the voucher i's start is li, which is <= ri. So target_start is ri + 1, which is larger than voucher i's start. So voucher i is not included. Thus, the code is safe.\n\nBut what if there are two vouchers with same duration and same start/end times? For example, two vouchers with same li, ri, cost. Then, when processing one, the other is considered as a possible candidate. But since the code checks for i != j, but since the code uses the min cost, even if it's the same voucher, but in reality, the code would not select it. Because for example, if voucher i is being considered, and the code finds a voucher j (same as i) in the processed data, but the code would have to ensure that j is not the same voucher. However, the code does not check for this. So, what if a voucher is paired with itself?\n\nBut the problem requires that i != j. So, in the case where a voucher is paired with itself, the code would count it as a valid pair. However, in reality, this is not allowed. So, how to avoid that?\n\nWait, in the code, for example, if there are two vouchers with same duration and same start and end times. Let's say, voucher A and voucher B. When processing voucher A, the code looks for vouchers of duration t (say, same as d_i). Suppose that during case 1 or case 2, the code finds voucher B (which is different from A). So that's okay. But if there is only one voucher (say, voucher A) with duration t, and during processing voucher A, the code considers that voucher (A) as a possible partner, but since i and j must be different, that would be invalid.\n\nSo, the code as written would allow pairing a voucher with itself if there is only one voucher of that duration. How to prevent that?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because, for example, if x is 2, and there is a single voucher with duration 1. Then, the code would look for another voucher with duration 1. But since there is only one, it can't be selected. However, if there are two vouchers with duration 1, then when processing one, the code would find the other, which is allowed.\n\nSo, the code needs to make sure that when looking for vouchers of duration t, there are at least one voucher (but not the same as the current voucher if it's the only one). How to handle that?\n\nThis is a problem. For example, consider a case where x is 2, and there is one voucher with duration 1. Then, the code would process this voucher, compute t = 1. Then, during case 1 or 2, it would look for vouchers of duration 1. But since the only voucher is the same as the current one, which is not allowed.\n\nBut how can the code detect that?\n\nThis suggests that in the code, when the voucher is processed, and the current voucher is part of the group of vouchers of duration t, then the code must ensure that there's at least one other voucher.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nWell, during the case where the voucher is in the group of duration t, when we find the minimal cost, we need to ensure that the voucher j is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because for example, when processing voucher i, which is part of the duration t, the code may find that the minimal cost in the group includes voucher i itself. However, since we need two different vouchers, this case is invalid.\n\nSo, the code as written may have a bug here.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are two vouchers: voucher A (d=1, cost 1) and voucher B (d=1, cost 2). x is 2. So t = x - d_i = 1 for each voucher.\n\nProcessing voucher A:\n\nt = 1. So look for vouchers of duration 1. The group has both A and B.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers that end before A's li. Let's say A's li is 1. So target_end is 0. No vouchers. Case 2: find vouchers that start after A's ri. A's ri is 1. So target_start is 2. Suppose voucher B's start is 2. Then, the code would find voucher B, and the cost would be 1 + 2 = 3. Which is valid.\n\nProcessing voucher B: same thing. So the code would find voucher A, and the total cost is 2 + 1 = 3. So the minimal is 3.\n\nBut if there is only one voucher with duration 1. Then, during processing, the code would look for vouchers of duration 1, but there's only one voucher (the same as the current one). So the code would think that there's a valid pair, but it's actually invalid.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nThe problem is that when the current voucher is part of the group of duration t, the code may include itself in the min cost.\n\nSo, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers of duration t, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems challenging, especially since the code is using min arrays that aggregate all vouchers of that duration.\n\nOne approach is to check whether the minimal cost comes from a voucher that is different from the current one.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, when we process the vouchers, we can store not only the end_times, prefix_min, etc., but also for each voucher in the group, their indices. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers of duration t, if t is the same as d_i, then the code must ensure that there are at least two vouchers in the group. Otherwise, even if there is one voucher, it cannot be paired with itself.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nSo, for example, during the processing of voucher i, if t is equal to d_i, then the code must check that the number of vouchers in the group is at least 2. Otherwise, even if the code finds a voucher j (which is the same as i), it's invalid.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nSo, during the processing of voucher i, when t is equal to d_i, then:\n\nif the group has more than one voucher, then proceed as before. But when finding the min cost, need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have the list of vouchers. Then, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers in duration t (which is same as d_i), we can check if there are at least two vouchers. If not, then skip this case. Otherwise, proceed to find the minimal cost, but ensuring that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nThis complicates the code. For example, during case 1, when looking for vouchers of duration t (same as d_i), and the group has multiple vouchers, we need to find the minimal cost among vouchers that are not the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems very complex. However, considering that the problem requires two different vouchers, perhaps the code as written would not pass some test cases where a voucher is paired with itself, but the code allows it.\n\nBut how common is this scenario?\n\nFor example, if there is only one voucher with duration t, then during processing, the code would try to find a voucher j of duration t, but there's only one. So, the code would think that there's a valid voucher j, but it's the same as i. Hence, the code would incorrectly consider this as a valid pair.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nPerhaps during the processing of voucher i, when t is equal to d_i, we need to check whether the group has at least two vouchers. If not, then skip this case.\n\nBut even if the group has two vouchers, when looking for the minimal cost, we need to ensure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems complicated.

    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, x, and whose total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing by Duration**: Group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, maintain sorted lists of start and end times along with prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, determine if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration such that they do not overlap. Use binary search on the preprocessed sorted lists to quickly find valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, check both possible non-overlapping scenarios (one voucher ending before the other starts and vice versa) using the preprocessed data structures to ensure efficient lookups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process end_sorted and prefix_min\n        end_sorted = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in end_sorted]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in end_sorted:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process start_sorted and suffix_min\n        start_sorted = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in start_sorted]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(start_sorted)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(start_sorted))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, start_sorted[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        processed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d_i = ri - li + 1\n        t = x - d_i\n        if t not in processed:\n            continue\n        end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = processed[t]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers in t that end before li\n        target_end = li - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end)\n        if idx > 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx - 1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + current_min)\n        # Case 2: find vouchers in t that start after ri\n        target_start = ri + 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + current_min)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookup later.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start times, and prefix/suffix minimum cost arrays are created to allow quick minimum cost queries.\n4. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks for valid non-overlapping vouchers with the required complementary duration using binary search on the preprocessed lists, ensuring efficient and optimal pair checking.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum cost of valid voucher pairs while adhering to the constraints of non-overlapping durations.",
