There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed, and we need to maximize the number of games for the winner under the given rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. The winner plays two games. How does that work? Let's say the winner beats player 2, then player 3. But according to the rule, when the winner plays the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. Since the first game was against player 2 (who had 0 games), then the winner has 1 game. Then the next opponent (player 3) must have played 0 or 1 games. But how does that happen? Maybe the player 3 hasn't played any games yet. So the winner can play against them. So the rule allows that.\n\nWait, but for the third sample input, n=4, the output is 2. Why can't the winner play 3 games? Well, in a normal knockout tournament with 4 players, the winner plays 2 games (since it's a binary tree with two rounds). But maybe there's a way to arrange the matches so that the winner plays more? But according to the example, it's not possible. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the maximum possible number of games the winner can have, given that the tournament structure must follow the rule that any two players can only play if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time they play, they must have an opponent who has played either k-1, k, or k-2 games? Wait, no. Wait, the rule says that when two players play, the difference in their number of games played so far must be no more than one. So when the winner is about to play their m-th game, their opponent must have played either m-1, m, or m-2 games? No, wait: the winner has already played m-1 games before this match. Because the current game is their m-th. So the opponent must have played either m-1 (same as the winner's previous count) or m-2 (so difference is 1). Because the difference between the winner's current count (m-1) and the opponent's count (let's say x) must be <=1. So x can be m-1 (so the opponent has played same as the winner's previous count) or x can be m-2 (so difference is 1). \n\nWait, but the winner's current count before this game is m-1. The opponent's count is x. So |(m-1) - x| <=1. So x can be m-1, m-2, or m? No, because m would be larger than m-1 by 1. Wait, no. Let's say the winner has played m-1 games. The opponent has played x games. The difference must be <=1. So x can be m-1 -1 = m-2, m-1, or m-1 +1 = m. But how can the opponent have played m games? Because the winner is in the process of playing their m-th game. So the opponent must have played m games before this match? That's impossible, because the winner is in their m-th game. So perhaps the opponent's count is m-1 or m-2. Because if the opponent had played m games, that would mean they have already played more games than the winner, which is possible only if the winner is playing their m-th game. But how?\n\nWait, the winner has played m-1 games so far. The opponent has played x games. So |x - (m-1)| ≤ 1. So x can be m-1, m-2, or m. But if x is m, that would imply that the opponent has played one more game than the winner. But how can that happen? Because the winner is about to play their m-th game, which is the first time they are playing that many games. So the opponent must have already played m games. But how? That would require that the opponent has already played m games before this match. Which would require that the opponent has already been through m matches. But in that case, the opponent would have already been eliminated, since in a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific constraint on how matches are arranged. The constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight here is recognizing that the problem can be approached using a recursive method based on Fibonacci numbers. This is because the structure of the tournament resembles a Fibonacci sequence where each player must face opponents in such a way that the difference in their previous game counts is at most one. \n\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The constraint ensures that each match is arranged such that the players have similar numbers of previous games. This leads to a structure similar to a Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n2. **Recursive Relation**: We use a recursive approach to determine the maximum number of games the winner can play. If the number of players `n` is less than or equal to the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number but greater than the k-th Fibonacci number, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed 1e18\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while fib[-1] < 10**18:\n        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])\n    \n    # Find the largest k such that fib[k] <= n\n    k = 0\n    while fib[k] <= n:\n        k += 1\n    k -= 1\n    \n    # The answer is k\n    return k\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The Fibonacci sequence is precomputed up to a value that exceeds the maximum possible input size (10^18). This sequence helps determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Finding the Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, we find the largest index `k` such that the k-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. This index `k` directly gives the maximum number of games the winner can play, as each Fibonacci number represents the minimum number of players required to achieve `k` games for the winner under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` up to 10^18 efficiently.",
