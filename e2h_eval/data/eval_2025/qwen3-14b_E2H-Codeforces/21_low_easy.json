The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because even chests can be paired with odd keys, and odd chests can be paired with even keys. So, the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Compute the sum as described.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's see their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nSo min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. That works.\n\nSecond example: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\nKeys: 5 (odd). So even_keys =0, odd_keys=1. So min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 =1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 =0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i, count even and odd.\n- Read the list of b_j, count even and odd.\n- Compute the result as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as list of integers for a. Then read next line as list for b.\n\nFor the counts:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\neven_key = sum(1 for y in b if y % 2 ==0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nThen result is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nThen print that result.\n\nYes. Let me check edge cases.\n\nWhat if there are zero even chests or something. Like, all chests are odd, and all keys are even. Then min(0, ...) would be zero, but the other term would be min(odd_chest, even_key). For example, if n=1, m=1, a is [3], b is [2]. Then even_chest is 0, odd_chest is 1. even_key is 1, odd_key is 0. So min(0,0) + min(1,1) = 0 +1=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if there are more keys than needed. Like, even_chest is 2, odd_key is 5. So min(2,5) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of the number on a chest and the number on a key must be odd. This can be achieved by pairing even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Count Key Parities**: Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Optimal Pairing**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use the keys to open as many chests as possible based on their parity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for y in b if y % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Parity Counting**: We count the number of even and odd chests and keys using simple list comprehensions.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is computed by summing the minimum values of compatible pairs (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys), ensuring optimal use of available keys and chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of chests and keys.",
