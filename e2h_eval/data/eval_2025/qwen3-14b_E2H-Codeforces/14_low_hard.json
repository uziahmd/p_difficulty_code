He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factorial is divisible by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization. But since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s in the factors of the numbers up to n.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero. Let's call this function Z(n).\n\nThe problem is, given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m. Then output the count and the numbers sorted.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me take the example given. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nZ(5) = 1 (5/5=1). Then for 6, it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then at 10, Z(10) is 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0). So between 5-9, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe other counts?\n\nWait, but how can there be multiple n's with the same Z(n)? Because when you increase n by 1, sometimes Z(n) increases by 1, sometimes more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then Z(n) increases by 1. But when it's a multiple of 25, it increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for example, when you cross 25, Z(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between 25 and 24, the Z increases by 2. So for m=6, there would be numbers from 25 up to some point where Z increases again. Wait, but for numbers between 25 and 29, their Z would be 6. Let's see:\n\nFor 25: 6 zeros. 26: same as 25, because adding 26 doesn't add any 5s. So Z(26) = Z(25) = 6. Same for 27, 28, 29. Then 30: Z(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So for m=6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers again. So that seems like a pattern.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's no n with Z(n) = m? For example, let's say m=5. Let's see. Let's find n where Z(n)=5. Let's compute Z(24) = 24/5=4 + 24/25=0 → 4. Z(25) is 6. So there's no n where Z(n)=5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0. So that's possible.\n\nSo the problem requires checking if there exists any n such that Z(n) = m. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how?\n\nApproach:\n\nFirst, for a given m, find the minimal n such that Z(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have Z(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the possible n's lie in a range where Z(n) equals m. But how to find that range?\n\nAnother idea: For a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n such that Z(n) = m. But how?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. For example, as n increases, Z(n)",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the range of `n` values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times `n!` can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\n2. **Counting Factors of 5**: The function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the quotient is zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given a target number of trailing zeros `m`, we use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) = m`. This helps in determining the range of valid `n` values efficiently.\n\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no such `n` exists for the given `m`, we return 0. Otherwise, we list all such `n` values in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Upper bound for binary search\n    lower = -1\n    upper = -1\n\n    # Find the lower bound\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z == m:\n            lower = mid\n            right = mid - 1\n        elif z < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n\n    if lower == -1:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the upper bound\n    left = lower\n    right = 5 * m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z == m:\n            upper = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n\n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_n_values(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest (`lower`) and largest (`upper`) values of `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) = m`. If no such `n` exists, it returns an empty list.\n\n3. **main()**: Reads the input value `m`, computes the valid `n` values using `find_n_values`, and prints the count followed by the sorted list of valid `n` values.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient searching using binary search, making the solution suitable even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
