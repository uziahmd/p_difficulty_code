Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. Each block is a region divided by the roads (infinite lines). \n\nSo, first, I need to model the problem. The key here is to think about how the blocks are connected. Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are separated by these roads. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but only if they share a common border segment. So, two blocks are adjacent if their common boundary is a line segment (not just a point). \n\nBut how do I represent the blocks and their adjacency? Since there are potentially many blocks, especially with n roads, it's impossible to generate all of them directly. But perhaps there's a smarter way. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For each block, its position relative to each road can be represented as a set of signs. Because each road divides the plane into two half-planes. For example, for a road ax + by + c = 0, any point not on the road will be in either ax + by + c > 0 or < 0. So, the block can be uniquely identified by the signs of each road's equation evaluated at that point. \n\nBut since the home and university are in specific blocks, maybe we can model this as a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges exist between regions that are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's region to the university's region. However, with n up to 300, the number of possible regions is 2^n, which is way too big. So we can't generate all regions explicitly. \n\nHmm, so what's another approach? Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. But how can we represent the regions and their adjacency without enumerating all possibilities?\n\nWait, here's a trick. Each time you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly one road's equation. Because moving across a road changes the sign of that road's equation. So, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because that would mean that they share a common boundary (the road itself). \n\nWait, but that's only true if the regions differ in exactly one road's sign. Because, for example, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are separated by that road. Therefore, their common boundary is that road. Hence, they can be adjacent. \n\nBut if two regions differ in more than one road's sign, then their boundaries are intersections of multiple roads, but they might not share a common border. So, the adjacency is only when they differ in exactly one road's sign. \n\nSo, the problem becomes similar to a hypercube graph. Each node is a binary string of length n (each bit represents the sign of a road's equation evaluated at that point). Two nodes are connected if they differ in exactly one bit. \n\nBut how do we model this? Well, the home and university are two points, each of which has a certain sign configuration. Let's call these configurations S and T. We need to find the minimal number of steps (flips) required to go from S to T, where each step flips exactly one bit. However, this seems like a problem where the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between S and T. But wait, no. Because the Hamming distance is the number of positions where the two configurations differ. However, each step allows you to flip one bit, so the minimal number of steps is exactly the Hamming distance. \n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because each step corresponds to moving across a road, which flips exactly one bit. So, if the home's configuration is S and the university's is T, then the minimal steps needed would be the Hamming distance between S and T. \n\nBut why? Because each step changes exactly one sign. So, if the Hamming distance is k, then you need k steps. \n\nBut that seems too easy. Let me check the examples. \n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (which is y=0), and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1): \n\nFirst road: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0. So sign is +. \n\nSecond road: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1>0. Sign is +. \n\nSo S is [+, +]. \n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one road's equation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that each block can be uniquely identified by the signs of the values obtained by evaluating each road's equation at a point within the block. Moving from one block to another adjacent block involves crossing a single road, which changes the sign of exactly one road's equation.\n\n2. **Sign Configuration**: For both the home and university positions, compute their sign configurations relative to all roads. Each configuration is a list of signs (positive or negative) for each road's equation evaluated at the respective point.\n\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign configurations. This is because each step corresponds to flipping one sign (crossing one road).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            if val > 0:\n                signs.append(1)\n            else:\n                signs.append(-1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    distance = sum(h != u for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs))\n    print(distance)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university positions, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Configuration Calculation**: For each point (home and university), compute the sign of the value obtained by evaluating each road's equation at that point. This gives a tuple of signs representing the block each point is in.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the two sign configurations is computed, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block. Each differing sign indicates a road that needs to be crossed, hence a step in the path.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using the properties of linear equations and Hamming distance, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
