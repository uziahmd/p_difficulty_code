Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads in a plane. The home and university are each in their own blocks. The task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from home's block to the university's block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block through a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks are those that share a segment of a road, not just a single point.\n\nHmm. How can I model this? Well, the key is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block.\n\nBut the problem is that there are infinitely many blocks. So, how do I represent them?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Since each road divides the plane into two parts, and each block is determined by the set of roads that separate it from the home. Wait, perhaps we can model the problem using the concept of regions divided by hyperplanes (in 2D, lines), and use BFS based on the parity of the regions.\n\nAlternatively, think about each block being uniquely determined by the signs of the equations for each road. For example, for each road, a point is either on one side or the other. So, if we have n roads, then each block can be represented by a binary string of length n, where each bit indicates which side of the road the block is on. However, since the roads can be arranged in any way, this might not be unique, but for the purpose of BFS, perhaps we can model the state as the signs of each road evaluated at a given point.\n\nBut here's the thing: the home and university are points not lying on any road. So, for each road, we can determine whether the home is on the positive or negative side of the road. Similarly for the university.\n\nThe problem then becomes: find the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's region to the university's region. Because each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road's equation. But how does crossing roads relate to moving between adjacent blocks?\n\nWait, when you move from one block to another, you cross exactly one road. Because adjacent blocks share a common road. So, each step corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one road's equation. But how can I model this?\n\nLet me think. Each block can be represented by a vector of signs (s1, s2, ..., sn), where si is +1 or -1, depending on which side of the i-th road the block is on. The home's block has a specific sign vector, and the university's block has another. The question is, what's the minimal number of steps (i.e., changes of sign) needed to go from the home's vector to the university's vector, where each step can flip exactly one sign.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. However, the minimal number of steps would be the number of roads where the home and university's sign differ. Wait, no. Because if two regions differ in k roads, then the minimal steps would be k? But that's only if you can flip each differing road once. However, that's not necessarily correct because the order of flipping may affect the path. But maybe in this case, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads where the home and university's sign differ. Because each step flips one road's sign. So, if the home and university differ in k roads, then you need to cross those roads once each. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nBut that's probably not correct. Let's take an example. Suppose there are two roads. The home is in a region that is + for both roads. The university is in a region that is - for both. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you have to cross each road once. But if you cross one road, you get to a region that differs in one road. Then cross the second road. So yes, two steps. But what if the home and university differ in two roads, but there's a way to cross them in one step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So, the minimal steps would be equal to the number of roads where the signs differ between home and university.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if each step can flip exactly one sign. But in reality, the regions are connected through adjacency. So, if two regions differ in exactly one road, then they are adjacent. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads. Because each differing road requires a step. So, the answer is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nBut",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the Crazy Town problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to determining the minimum number of road crossings needed to move from the home block to the university block. Each block can be represented by a sign vector indicating which side of each road it lies on.\n2. **Sign Vector Representation**: For each road, determine whether the home and university points lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This gives us two sign vectors: one for the home and one for the university.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the Hamming distance between these two sign vectors. This is because each differing sign indicates a road that must be crossed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Compute sign vector for home (x1, y1)\n    home_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        sign = 1 if val > 0 else -1\n        home_signs.append(sign)\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for university (x2, y2)\n    uni_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        sign = 1 if val > 0 else -1\n        uni_signs.append(sign)\n    \n    # Count differing signs\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, along with the equations of the roads.\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For each road, we compute the sign (positive or negative) of the value obtained by plugging the home and university coordinates into the road equation. These signs form vectors representing the respective blocks.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The number of differing signs between the home and university vectors gives the minimum number of steps required, as each differing sign corresponds to a road that must be crossed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
