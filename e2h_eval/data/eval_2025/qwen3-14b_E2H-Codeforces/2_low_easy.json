Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check all cells on both diagonals. They should all be the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check all other cells (not on diagonals) are the same character 'o_char', and that 'o_char' != 'd_char'.\n\nHow to check for the diagonals?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid, it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of these two lines.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'y'. Then that's invalid. So the first step is to check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. So collect all the characters from both diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but the two diagonals might overlap. For example, when n is 3, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting all the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates, but in that case, the same cell is counted once. But in the problem statement, the diagonals are considered as both. So for example, in the case where the two diagonals have different characters, that's invalid. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'y', then the overlapping cell (center) would have to be both x and y, which is impossible. So the code can check that all the cells in both diagonals are the same.\n\nSo first, collect all the cells on the two diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then check that all non-diagonal cells are same and different.\n\nSo let's proceed with steps:\n\nFor the given grid:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters (from both diagonals). Let's say the set of these characters is {d_char}. If the length of this set is not 1, return NO.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal characters. Let's say their set is {o_char}. If the length of this set is not 1, return NO. Also, check that d_char != o_char.\n\nBut how to collect these characters?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store them as a list of lists, maybe.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 → no.\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1 → no.\n\n    else:\n\n        o_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if d_char == o_char → no.\n\n        else → yes.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the non-diagonal cells are empty? Like, when n=1? But n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are 9 cells. The diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 (since the center is counted twice) → 5 cells. The non-diagonal cells are 4. So for example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nLet's see:\n\nEach",
