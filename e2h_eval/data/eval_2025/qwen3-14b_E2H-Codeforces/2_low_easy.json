Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the problem says both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, all cells in both diagonals must be the same as each other. So, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must all have the same character. So, first, I need to collect all the characters on both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nThen, for all other cells not on either diagonal, they must be the same as each other, and also different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all diagonal elements are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all non-diagonal elements are the same. Let's call this 'other_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char != other_char.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal elements and non-diagonal elements?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- It is on a diagonal if i == j or i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo, for each cell, check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same.\n\nThen collect all the other characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal. If yes, check if it's equal to the first diagonal character (the one from (0,0)). If any of them differ, then return NO.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal cells. Collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping in the center. So the non-diagonal cells would be 9 - 3 = 6 cells. Wait, no: for n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but the center cell is part of both. So total unique cells on diagonals is 3 + 3 -1 =5. So non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nFirst, find the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as the reference. Then check all other diagonal cells (i,j) where i==j or i +j ==n-1. All of them must be equal to this reference.\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells, check that they are all equal to some other character, which is different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. So, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen:\n\nCheck for all cells on diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n      if i ==j or i +j ==n-1:\n\n          if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n              return NO\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal cells:\n\nother_char = ?\n\nWe need to collect all non-diagonal cells. Let's take the first non-diagonal cell (if any) and check that all others are same as it. But what if all cells are on diagonals? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut how to find the other_char?\n\nWe can collect all non-diagonal cells. If there are none (but n is at least 3, so that's impossible?), but for example, when n=1, but the input constraints say n is >=3. So, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, pick the",
