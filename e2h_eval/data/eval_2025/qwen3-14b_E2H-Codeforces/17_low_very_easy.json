He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives 2n-2 strings, which are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s. But we don't know which is which. Our job is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, the main idea: For each possible candidate string s (but how?), check if the given list of strings can be partitioned into prefixes and suffixes of s. However, since n can be up to 100, trying all possible strings s might not be feasible directly. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the input is guaranteed to be valid. That is, there exists at least one s that fits. So our task is to find any valid assignment of P/S for the input strings.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. For the correct s, the prefixes are all the strings of length 1 to n-1 that are prefixes of s. Similarly for suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Wait, no. Wait, the proper prefixes and suffixes. For example, for a string of length 5, the proper prefixes are of lengths 1-4. The proper suffixes are of lengths 1-4 as well. So for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings in the input: one is the prefix of length l, and one is the suffix of length l. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for each length l, there are two strings. One of them must be a prefix, and the other a suffix. Because for the actual string s, there is exactly one prefix of each length l (from 1 to n-1), and exactly one suffix of each length l. Therefore, for each l, exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for each length l, we need to choose one of the two strings as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nBut how do we know which one is which?\n\nThe key is that for the correct s, the prefix of length l must be the first l characters of s. Similarly, the suffix of length l must be the last l characters of s.\n\nSo, if we can find for each l, which of the two strings of length l is the prefix and which is the suffix, then we can reconstruct s. However, since we don't know s, how do we find this?\n\nWait, but for the correct s, the prefix of length l is the first l characters. The suffix of length l is the last l characters. Also, the prefix of length l+1 must start with the prefix of length l. Similarly, the suffix of length l must end with the suffix of length l-1. Also, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l may have some relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the unique string s that is compatible with the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the correct s must have for each l, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l. So for example, the longest possible prefix is of length n-1. Let's call that prefix_p = s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is suffix_s = s[1..n-1]. So, the prefix_p and suffix_s must be two different strings in the input (since for l = n-1, there are two strings). So, the actual s is the concatenation of the prefix_p (length n-1) and the last character of s. But also, the suffix_s is the last n-1 characters of s. So, the first character of s is the first character of prefix_p, and the last character is the last character of suffix_s. But how do we find this?\n\nAlternatively, for the correct s, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l must be compatible with each other. For example, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l must have overlapping parts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible pair of strings of length n-1, check if they can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, each being an improper prefix or suffix of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` are of length `n-1`. These two strings must be different and can be used to reconstruct `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the String `s`**: For each possible pair of strings of length `n-1`, check if they can form a valid string `s` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once a candidate string `s` is reconstructed, validate all given strings to ensure they match the proper prefixes and suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strs = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strs[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible combinations for the longest (n-1) length\n    # There are two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strs[n-1]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # The full string s would be prefix_candidate + last_char_of_suffix_candidate\n            # But also, the suffix_candidate should be the last n-1 chars of s\n            # So the first char of s is prefix_candidate[0], last char is suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Therefore, the full s is prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed the last n-1 chars of s_candidate\n            if s_candidate[-(n-1):] != suffix_candidate:\n                continue\n            # Now check all other strings\n            valid = True\n            for l in range(1, n):\n                strs = len_to_strs[l]\n                # For each length l, one is prefix, one is suffix\n                # The prefix of length l is s_candidate[:l]\n                # The suffix of length l is s_candidate[-l:]\n                prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n                suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n                found_p = False\n                found_s = False\n                for s_str in strs:\n                    if s_str == prefix_l:\n                        found_p = True\n                    elif s_str == suffix_l:\n                        found_s = True\n                if not (found_p and found_s):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P/S\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    l = len(s_str)\n                    prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n                    suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n                    if s_str == prefix_l:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif s_str == suffix_l:\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # This should not happen as we have validated\n                        pass\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate checking prefixes and suffixes of each length.\n3. **Candidate String Reconstruction**: For each possible pair of strings of length `n-1`, we attempt to reconstruct the candidate string `s` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string is validated against all given strings to ensure they match the proper prefixes and suffixes.\n5. **Result Construction**: Once a valid candidate string is found, the corresponding 'P' and 'S' assignments are determined and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible valid strings and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
