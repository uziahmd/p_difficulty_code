He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of some possible s. But since there are multiple possibilities, how can I find a valid assignment?\n\nLet me think. For any valid s, the prefixes of s are the strings of lengths 1 to n-1. Similarly for suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0:n-1], and the longest suffix is s[1:n].\n\nBut since the input includes all these prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct approach is to find which of the input strings can be the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Because those are unique. Wait, for a string s, the longest proper prefix is s without the last character, and the longest proper suffix is s without the first character. So for example, if the original string is \"ababa\", then the longest proper prefix is \"abab\" (length 4) and the longest proper suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). These two are unique for the string. However, in the input, there are two strings of length n-1. So among the input strings, exactly two of them have length n-1. One of them must be the longest prefix, and the other the longest suffix. But how do I know which is which?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning that there exists at least one s. So perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the longest prefix (so the original string is that string plus one character), and the other must be the longest suffix (so the original string is that string with one character added in front). However, the original string must be such that the longest prefix and longest suffix are those two strings. But how to find which is which?\n\nAlternatively, the correct original string s must have the property that the longest prefix (of length n-1) is present in the input, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) is also present. So for the input, there are two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the original string could be A + c (for some character c), and also B must be the suffix of s. So B must be the suffix of s. Which would mean that s is c + B. Therefore, combining these two, A + c = c + B. Therefore, A must be equal to c + B[0: n-2], but maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the original string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and longest suffix. For example, if the longest prefix is P (length n-1) and the longest suffix is S (length n-1), then s must be P + c, where c is the last character of s. Also, since S is the suffix of s, then S must be the last n-1 characters of s. Which would be s[1:]. So s[1:] = S. Therefore, s must be equal to (s[0] + S). But also, s is equal to P + c. Therefore, combining these two:\n\ns[0] + S = P + c.\n\nBut since s[0] is the first character of s, and c is the last character. Also, S is the suffix of s, so S is s[1:].\n\nTherefore, the first character of s is s[0], and the last character is c. Also, the first n-1 characters of s are P, so s[0...n-2] = P. And the last n-1 characters of s are S, so s[1...n-1] = S.\n\nTherefore, the first character of s is P[0], and the last character is S[-1]. Also, the second character of s is P[1], and the last character is S[-1]. Also, since s[1:] is S,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but not their order. Our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` have lengths `n-1`. Among the given input strings, there are exactly two strings of this length. These must be the longest prefix and suffix of `s`.\n2. **Determine Valid String**: For the identified longest prefix and suffix, check if they can form a valid string `s` by ensuring that the first character of the prefix matches the last character of the suffix.\n3. **Assign Roles to Other Strings**: Once the valid string `s` is determined, check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for which is prefix and which is suffix\n    possible = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Check if they can form a valid s\n        # s would be prefix_candidate + last_char, and also first_char + suffix_candidate\n        # So prefix_candidate[0] must be first_char, suffix_candidate[-1] must be last_char\n        # And the first_char + suffix_candidate must equal prefix_candidate + last_char\n        first_char = prefix_candidate[0]\n        last_char = suffix_candidate[-1]\n        s_candidate = first_char + suffix_candidate\n        if s_candidate[len_n_minus_1:] == prefix_candidate:\n            possible.append((s_candidate, prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate))\n    \n    # Choose the first valid s_candidate\n    s_candidate, prefix, suffix = possible[0]\n    \n    # Now assign P and S to the input strings\n    result = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            if s == prefix:\n                result.append('P')\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # Check if it is a prefix of s_candidate\n            if s == s_candidate[:len(s)]:\n                result.append('P')\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, followed by the list of prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Forming Valid String**: By checking both permutations of these candidates, we determine a valid string `s` that can be formed using these candidates.\n4. **Assigning Roles**: For each input string, we check if it is a prefix or suffix of the determined valid string `s` and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct roles for each input string based on the valid string `s` derived from the given constraints.",
