Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads in a plane. The home and university are each in their own blocks. We need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block if they share a nonzero boundary segment. \n\nThe key here is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, the number of blocks can be huge, but maybe we don't need to represent all of them. Instead, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, perform BFS from the home block to find the shortest path to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Well, since each block can be identified by the sign of the equations of the roads. For example, each road divides the plane into two regions. For each road, the block is on one side or the other. So, for each road, the block can be represented by a binary value (like +1 or -1) indicating which side of the line it's on. However, with n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations. But that's way too big for n=300. That's impossible to handle directly. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be modeled differently. Since each step moves across a road, changing the sign of exactly one road. Wait, no. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. But when you cross a road, you change the sign of that road's equation. So, each block can be uniquely determined by the signs of all the roads. But again, with n=300, that's 2^300 possibilities, which is way too big to handle.\n\nHmm. So that approach is not feasible. So how else can I model this?\n\nAlternative idea: think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges connect regions that are adjacent (i.e., share a common boundary). The problem then becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region. But how do I represent the regions and compute adjacency?\n\nBut how can I even find the regions? Well, maybe we can model the problem using BFS, but instead of tracking regions, track the number of roads that separate the home from the university. Wait, perhaps the key is that each move changes the parity of the number of roads crossed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: since moving from one block to another requires crossing a single road. So, each step crosses exactly one road. Therefore, the minimal steps would be related to the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents the set of roads that are crossed. Wait, that might not help.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. For each road, the home and university are on one side or the other. Let's consider the home's position relative to each road. For each road i, we can compute whether the home is on the positive side (a_i x + b_i y + c_i > 0) or the negative side (a_i x + b_i y + c_i < 0). Similarly for the university. \n\nNow, if two regions (home and university) differ in k roads, then the minimal number of steps required to get from home to university is the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed. But how does that relate to the steps?\n\nWait, suppose that the home and university are in regions that are separated by some roads. Each time you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped (crossed) to go from the home's configuration to the university's configuration. However, this is only possible if the two configurations differ in some way, but the actual adjacency depends on whether the regions are adjacent through a single road.\n\nWait, but the problem states that two regions are adjacent if they share a common border (non-zero length). So, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road. Because crossing that road would take you from one region to another. However, if two regions differ in more than one road, then they are not adjacent. Therefore, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the home and university regions, but perhaps that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the home is in a region that is determined by the signs of all roads. The university is in another region. The minimal steps between them would be equal to the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed. Each step crosses a road. However, each crossing flips the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration, but with the constraint that each step flips exactly one road. However, the problem is that the sign configurations may not be directly connected via flipping one road at a time, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, for example, if the home and university differ in k roads, then the minimal steps would be k. But that's only if each step can flip one road. However, that's only possible if there exists a sequence of roads that can be flipped one by one, leading from the home's configuration to the university's. However, in reality, each flip corresponds to crossing a road. But if the home's configuration and university's configuration differ in k roads, then the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed, which is the Hamming distance between the two configurations.\n\nBut wait, this is only true if the regions are connected through a path where each step flips one road. However, this may not be the case. For example, imagine that two regions differ in two roads. But there's no way to cross one road to reach a region that differs by one road. But perhaps this is not possible. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of the regions as nodes in a graph. Each node is connected to others that differ by exactly one road. So, the graph is a hypercube of dimension n. The problem becomes finding the shortest path between two nodes in this hypercube. The minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two nodes, which is the number of roads where the home and university differ. Because in the hypercube, the shortest path between two nodes is exactly their Hamming distance. So, the answer would be the Hamming distance between the home and university's configurations.\n\nBut wait, that seems too easy. However, the sample input shows something else. Let me check the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nLet's compute the home's position relative to each road:\n\nFor road 1 (y=0): home (1,1) gives 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. So home is on the positive side. For road 2 (x=0): 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1>0. So home is positive on both roads. The university is (-1,-1): for road 1, 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. For road 2, 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1 <0. So the university is negative on both roads. So the Hamming distance is 2 (both roads differ). So according to this logic, the answer would be 2, which matches the sample output. \n\nIn the second sample input, the answer is also 2. Let me check. The home is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are three roads: x=0, y=0, and x+y-3=0. Let's compute for home:\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1>0 → positive.\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1>0 → positive.\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → negative. So home's configuration is (+, +, -).\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 <0 → negative.\nRoad 2: -1 <0 → negative.\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → same as home. So university's configuration is (-, -, -). Comparing to home's (+, +, -), the differences are in roads 1 and 2. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo according to this, the answer is the Hamming distance between the home and university's configurations. So the problem reduces to computing for each road whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides. Then, the number of roads where they differ is the answer.\n\nWait, that seems to fit the samples. But why is that the case? How does that model the movement steps?\n\nBecause each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, to get from the home's configuration to the university's configuration, you need to flip the signs of exactly the roads where they differ. And each flip can be done in one step. However, the order of flipping doesn't matter. For example, if you have two differing roads, you can cross each once, and that's two steps. \n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? For example, if two regions differ in two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and reach a region that is adjacent to the university. But that's impossible because if the university differs in two roads, then any adjacent region (which differs by exactly one road) would have a Hamming distance of 1 from the current region. So, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nWait, that's a very simple solution. So how do I compute that?\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of the home point (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and the sign of the university point (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If the signs are different, increment the count. The answer is that count.\n\nBut why is this correct? Let me think again.\n\nEach road divides the plane into two regions. The home is in one region, and the university in another. The minimal steps required to move between the two regions is the number of roads that separate them. Because each step allows crossing one road, and each such crossing changes the sign for that road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut why is that the case? Suppose there are k roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because you can cross each of those roads once. But how can you cross them in any order? Because crossing a road changes your position relative to that road. But the other roads may not affect the path. \n\nBut this seems to be the case. So the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. Let me test it against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two roads:\n\nFirst road: y=0. Home is 1>0. University is -1 <0. So different. Count +=1.\n\nSecond road: x=0. Home is 1>0. University is -1 <0. Different. Count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nThree roads. Home (1,1) and university (-1,-1). \n\nRoad 1: x=0. Home is positive, university negative. Different. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0. Same as above. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 =0. For home: 1+1-3 = -1 <0. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Same. So no increment. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSo the sample outputs match. \n\nWhat about a case where home and university are on the same side of all roads? Then the answer is zero steps. Which makes sense because they are in the same block. \n\nAnother test case: suppose there's one road. Home is on one side, university on the other. Then answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: suppose two roads. Home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then answer is 2. But what if there's a way to cross one road, then another? Well, that's two steps. Which matches the count.\n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the problem is reduced to, for each road, check if home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nBut why is this correct? Because each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And each such crossing is a step. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's no shorter path? For example, suppose there are two roads that separate home and university. But maybe there's a way to cross one road, and then cross another road, but in such a way that the total steps is less than 2? No, because the minimal steps would be 2. \n\nSo the answer is indeed the count of roads where home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute the value for home and for university. Check if their signs are different. Count the number of such roads. Output that count.\n\nBut wait! What if the home and university are in the same block? Then the count would be zero. Which is correct. \n\nBut how to compute the sign? For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i) for home and for university. If the product of these two values is negative, then they are on opposite sides. \n\nBut since the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road, so the values can't be zero. \n\nSo, for each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, then increment the count. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nLet me test this with the sample input. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 (y=0) and 1 0 0 (x=0).\n\nFor first road: val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0. So count increases by 1.\n\nSecond road: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. Product is -1. Count increases by 1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\nFirst road: 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → product -1. count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0 1 0 → y=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1. product -1. count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0. val1 is 1+1-3 = -1. val2 is (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0. No increment. Total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. Read the two points, read n lines, for each line compute the two values, check if their product is negative, count. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nSo the code can be written in Python as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the sample outputs show that the first example's output is 2, which matches. The second sample's output is 2. So this code would work. \n\nBut why did the problem mention that roads are infinite and that the movement requires crossing a road with a non-zero boundary? Because in this approach, we assume that each road that separates the two regions must be crossed once. But perhaps there are cases where two regions are separated by multiple roads, but the minimal steps is not the count. \n\nWait, but according to the model, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating them. \n\nBut let me think of a case where two regions are separated by two roads. Let's say, for example, two roads that cross each other, forming four regions. Suppose home is in one region, university in the opposite region. Then, the two roads would have their signs opposite. So the count is 2. But to get from home to university, you can cross one road, then cross the other. Which is two steps. Which matches the count. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, arranged so that home and university are separated by three roads. Then the minimal steps is 3. \n\nBut what if there's a scenario where the two regions are separated by two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and reach the university's region? That would require that the two regions are adjacent. But that's only possible if they are separated by exactly one road. \n\nSo the model seems correct. \n\nThus, this approach is correct. \n\nSo the code is simple. Now, let's code it. \n\nBut wait, what about the case where the home and university are in the same region? Then the count is zero. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is as described. \n\nNow, let's test it against the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\nFirst case:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. \n\nSecond case:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. \n\nWhich matches the sample outputs. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nSo this is the solution. The problem is much simpler than it seemed. The key insight was realizing that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nTherefore, the Python code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university are located in different regions, and the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate these two regions. \n\nFor each road, we check if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.

If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps:** The number of such roads where the home and university are on opposite sides is counted, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of roads.",
