Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. Each road divides the plane into regions (blocks). The key is to model these blocks and find the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block. But how do I represent the blocks?\n\nHmm. Since each block is defined by the arrangement of roads, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that share a common border. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's node to the university's node.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? It's impossible to generate all possible blocks directly, especially since there are up to 300 roads, leading to potentially O(2^n) regions, which is way too big. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of representing blocks directly, think about the regions in terms of their position relative to each road. For each road, a point (home or university) lies on one side of the line or the other. So, for each road, we can determine whether the home is on the positive or negative side of the line. Similarly for the university. \n\nIf two blocks are adjacent, they must differ in exactly one road's side. Because when you cross a road, you switch from one side to the other. But if two regions differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent. Wait, maybe that's the case. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a single road. So, each step changes exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the adjacency between blocks is determined by differing in exactly one road's sign. \n\nSo, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a tuple of signs (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line). Then, two nodes are connected if they differ in exactly one road's sign. \n\nBut how do we represent this? For n roads, each node has n bits (or signs), but since each road's sign can be + or -, the total number of nodes is 2^n. However, with n up to 300, 2^300 is way too large to handle directly. So this approach isn't feasible either. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Because the actual problem is to find the minimal number of steps between the home's region and the university's region. Each step corresponds to flipping the sign of exactly one road. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to transform the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector, with the constraint that each flip corresponds to moving through a road. However, this seems similar to the Hamming distance, but with some constraints. \n\nWait, no. Because the Hamming distance would count the number of differing roads. But perhaps the minimal steps required is equal to the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. Because each step allows you to flip one road's sign. However, that's only if each flip can be done in sequence. But is that possible? Let me think. Suppose that two regions differ in k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k. Because each step can change one road's sign. But how can that be possible? Because each step requires moving across a road. So, if two regions differ in k roads, then you need to cross k roads. But is that possible? For example, if the home and university regions differ in two roads, can you cross them in two steps? \n\nBut perhaps the answer is that the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step can flip exactly one road's sign. But why can't there be a case where flipping multiple roads in a certain order might allow for fewer steps? Well, no, because each step can only flip one. So the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. \n\nWait, but maybe that's not correct. Because the regions might not be connected in such a way. For example, suppose that the home is in a region that differs from the university in two roads. However, the regions may not be connected via a path that crosses those roads. But according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed between any two regions that share a common border. So, the question is whether the regions that differ in exactly one road are connected. \n\nSo, if the home's region is represented by a sign vector S, and the university's is T. Then, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to get from S to T, where each step flips exactly one road. Which is the Hamming distance. However, this is only true if the regions can be connected through such steps. \n\nBut how do I know that the regions can be connected through such steps? For example, if two regions differ in two roads, then there's a path that crosses one road at a time. So, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. \n\nBut wait, that's assuming that the regions can be connected by flipping one road at a time. However, perhaps in reality, the regions differ in two roads, but there is no way to reach the target region by flipping one road at a time. For example, imagine that the two regions are separated by two roads, but the roads are arranged such that you can't cross one road without crossing another. But that seems unlikely. Because each road is a line. If you have two regions that differ in two roads, then there must be a way to cross each road once. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. So, the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the two vectors. \n\nLet me check the sample input. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (y=0) and 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck each road. \n\nFirst road: y = 0. The value is 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0. So home is on the positive side. \n\nSecond road: x = 0. Value is 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1>0. Positive side. \n\nSo home's sign vector is (+, +). \n\nUniversity is (-1,-1). For first road, 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So negative. Second road: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So sign vector is (-,-). \n\nThe Hamming distance between (+,+) and (-,-) is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nAnother sample input: \n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFirst road x=0: 1>0 → +. \n\nSecond road y=0: 1>0 → +. \n\nThird road: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -. \n\nSo home's sign vector is (+, +, -). \n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road x=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\nSecond road y=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\nThird road: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is (-,-,-). \n\nHamming distance between (+,+,-) and (-,-,-) is 2 (the first two roads differ). Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo the sample outputs align with the Hamming distance. So perhaps the answer is indeed the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. \n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of home's point and the sign of university's point. Then, count the number of roads where the signs differ. That's the answer. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university differ in their sign. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where you need to cross a road twice? Like, for example, if the home and university differ in two roads, but you have to cross one road twice. But that's impossible, since the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip its sign. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing roads. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that allows you to cross each differing road once, and no others? \n\nWell, considering that the roads are lines. Suppose that the home and university are in regions that differ in k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k. Because you can cross each of the roads that differ once. \n\nBut how can we be sure that such a path exists? For example, imagine that two regions differ in two roads. Then, there's a way to cross each of those roads once. \n\nI think that this is the case because the arrangement of roads forms a planar graph. Each region is connected to others through adjacent regions, and the adjacency is determined by sharing a common edge. So, the problem becomes equivalent to moving through the graph where each node is a region, and edges connect regions that differ by exactly one road's sign. \n\nIn that case, the minimal steps between two regions is the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road, the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. Then, count the number of roads where the signs differ. That's the answer. \n\nWait, but how do we compute the sign for each road? For a given road equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0, the sign of a point (x0,y0) is determined by evaluating the left-hand side. If it's positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other. \n\nBut since the home and university are not on any road, the sign is always non-zero. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- For each road, compute s1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i (for home)\n- Compute s2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i (for university)\n- For each road, check if s1 and s2 have different signs. If so, increment the count. \n- The answer is the count. \n\nWait, but why does that work? Because each differing sign implies that the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. So, to get from home to university, you need to cross that road once. And the minimal steps is the number of roads where they are on opposite sides. \n\nBut why? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign of that road. So, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. \n\nBut how can we be sure that the regions are connected in such a way that you can cross each road once? \n\nWell, in the case of a single road, the home and university are on opposite sides. Then, the minimal steps is 1. Which is correct. \n\nIf there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads, then the minimal steps is 2. \n\nBut how can you cross both roads? Because each step crosses one road. So, you can cross the first road, then cross the second. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's imagine that the two roads are perpendicular. The home is in a region that is, say, above the first road and to the right of the second. The university is below the first and left of the second. To get there, you cross the first road (changing the sign of that road), then cross the second. \n\nSo, the minimal steps would be 2. Which is the Hamming distance. \n\nThis seems to hold. Therefore, the answer is the number of roads for which the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the code would be straightforward. \n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n, then read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i. \n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. \n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0, then the signs are different. Increment the count. \n\nFinally, output the count. \n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because each road that separates the home and university regions contributes to the count, and the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, let's test the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor the first road (0,1,0): val1 is 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 is 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road (1,0,0): val1 is 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input: \n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0 (a=1, b=0, c=0), y=0 (a=0, b=1, c=0), x + y -3 =0 (a=1, b=1, c=-3). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFirst road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1 → val1=1. val2 for university is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. \n\nThird road: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So no count. \n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the code works for samples. \n\nSo, the problem is actually simpler than it seems. The answer is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing increases the step count by one. \n\nSo, the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead x1, y1. Then x2, y2. Then n. Then read n lines. For each line, compute a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i and same for x2, y2. Multiply them. If it's negative, increment the count. \n\nSo, the code in Python would be something like:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1. Second line as x2, y2. Third line as n. Then read n lines of a, b, c. \n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a, b, c in the roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, what about if the home and university are in the same region? Then the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither is on a road, but it's possible that they are in the same block. \n\nBut the problem says that the answer is the minimal steps. So, if they are in the same block, the answer is zero. \n\nBut how can that be? Because if the home and university are in the same block, then there's no need to cross any roads. \n\nSo the code correctly returns zero in that case. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this approach seems correct. \n\nBut why didn't the problem mention anything about this? Because the problem says that the home and university are located in some block, but it's possible that they are in the same block. \n\nSo the code handles that. \n\nThus, the code is simple. \n\nBut why is this problem considered moderately difficult? Maybe because people might overcomplicate it, thinking about graph traversal, BFS, etc., but the actual solution is straightforward once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nBut how to confirm that this approach is correct? Let's think of some other test cases. \n\nTest case 1: \n\nHome (0, 1), university (0, -1). One road: y=0. \n\nval1 = 0*0 + 1*1 + 0 =1. val2 = 0*0 + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1. count is 1. Answer is 1. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: home (0,1), university (1,0). Two roads: y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor home, val1 for y=0 is 1 (positive), val2 for university is 0*1 + 1*0 +0 =0? No, wait the university is (1,0). For the first road (y=0), the value is 0*1 + 1*0 +0 =0? But the problem says that the university is not on any road. So that's invalid. \n\nSo, let's choose a different example. Let's say the university is (1, 1). Road y=0 and x=0. \n\nHome (0, 1) is on the positive side of y=0, and on the positive side of x=0 (since x=0 is the line, and the home's x is 0? Wait no. The home is (0,1). For the road x=0, the equation is 1x +0y +0=0. So val1 is 1*0 + 0*1 +0 =0. Oh but the problem says that the home is not on any road. So that's invalid. So, perhaps the home is (0.5, 1). \n\nBut regardless, the code would work. \n\nSo, in general, the code seems to handle everything. \n\nSo the Python code would be straightforward. Now, implement that. \n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple lines. For example, in the first sample input, the first input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut the actual input is read from stdin. So, the code needs to read from stdin. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains x1, y1. Second line x2, y2. Third line n. Then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input. Then x2, y2. Then n. Then read n lines. \n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what about the case when the home and university are in the same block? Then, the count is zero. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nThis code seems to handle all cases. \n\nLet me test the sample input. \n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nx1=1, y1=1. x2=-1, y2=-1. n=2.\n\nFirst road: a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1=1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2=1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1. product -1 → count becomes 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nval1 for home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works. \n\nTherefore, the solution is as simple as this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road divides the plane into two regions. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate these two blocks. Specifically, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed once. Therefore, the solution involves checking each road to see if it separates the home and university, and counting such roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation:** For each road, we evaluate the position of the home and university relative to the road. This is done by substituting the coordinates into the road equation. If the results have opposite signs, the road separates the two points.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads:** The number of roads that separate the home and university is counted. Each such road corresponds to a step needed to move from one block to another.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
