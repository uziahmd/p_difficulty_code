Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question marks can match any color. I need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, the key is to pair as many as possible. Let's think about how to maximize the pairs. The challenge is handling the question marks, which can be wildcards.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One idea is to first pair the specific colors that match exactly, then use the question marks to cover the remaining.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' and some right boots with color 'a', those can be paired directly. Then, for the remaining left and right boots with question marks, they can be paired with each other or with the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to pair the question marks with specific colors first, to save the question marks for cases where they can be used as wildcards.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. Count the number of left and right boots for each color (excluding question marks). For example, for each color c (from a-z), count how many left boots have color c, and how many right boots have color c.\n\n2. For each color c, the maximum number of pairs between left and right of color c is the minimum of left[c] and right[c]. So we can pair those first. Then, subtract those counts from left and right.\n\n3. After that, we have left and right boots with question marks, and possibly some leftover specific colors. Now, the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining specific colors or each other.\n\nWait, but after pairing the exact matches, the remaining left and right question marks can be paired between themselves. But also, any left question mark can pair with any right non-question mark that hasn't been paired yet, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to model this optimally?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after step 2, there are L_q left question marks and R_q right question marks. Also, there might be some leftover specific colors. Let's say for each color c, there are left_over[c] left boots and right_over[c] right boots. But these would be zero if all exact matches were already paired.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose left has 3 'a's and right has 5 'a's. Then, we can pair 3 of them. So after that, left has 0 'a's, right has 2 'a's. Those 2 'a's in right can be paired with left question marks, if any.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- First, pair exact matches. For each color c, pair min(left[c], right[c]).\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which are either question marks or have some specific colors that couldn't be matched (like if left had more of a color than right, or vice versa).\n\nBut how to pair the remaining? Let's think about the remaining left and right boots:\n\nFor the left boots, the remaining are those that couldn't be matched with their exact color on the right. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, for example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' and some right boots with color 'b', they can't be paired. However, if there are left question marks, they can be used to pair with any right boots (including those that have specific colors).\n\nSo, the next step is to pair as many as possible between the left and right question marks and the remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this as two parts:\n\nA) Pair the remaining specific left boots with right question marks.\n\nB) Pair the remaining specific right boots with left question marks.\n\nC) Pair the remaining question marks between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nAfter step 1 (pairing exact matches), we have:\n\nleft_counts: for each color, the count of left boots not yet paired (could be zero, or some leftover from when there was more on one side than the other).\n\nSimilarly for right_counts.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to track the counts of left and right boots that are not yet paired, and are not question marks. Let's call them left_colors and right_colors.\n\nSo, for example, after pairing exact matches, left_colors is a dictionary where for each color c (not '?'), the count is the number of left boots of color c that are unpaired. Similarly for right_colors.\n\nNow, the idea is to pair as many as possible between left_colors and right_question_marks, and between right_colors and",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the Colored Boots problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be a specific color (lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, using the rules provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Exact Matches**: First, pair boots with exact matching colors. For each color, the number of pairs is the minimum of the count of that color in left and right boots.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After handling exact matches, use the remaining question marks to pair with leftover specific colors. This involves:\n   - Pairing left question marks with remaining right specific colors.\n   - Pairing right question marks with remaining left specific colors.\n3. **Pair Remaining Question Marks**: Finally, pair any remaining question marks with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # We need to process multiple test cases, but the input seems to have multiple test cases in one read.\n    # Wait, looking back at the example input, it's actually multiple test cases.
