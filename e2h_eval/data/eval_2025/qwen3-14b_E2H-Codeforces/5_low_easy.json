Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots based on their colors. The colors can be letters or question marks, which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs. Each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm, how to approach this? Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to find pairs between left and right boots where their colors are compatible. The compatibility rules are:\n- Both are same letter.\n- One is a question mark (so it can match any other).\n\nSo, the challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs, considering that each boot can be used once.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors (non-?) where they match. Then handle the question marks.\n\nBut how to efficiently do this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. For each color (excluding ?), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. For each color c, the number of pairs possible here is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. But since each pair uses one left and one right, we can take min(left, right) for each color. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots with ? can be paired among themselves.\n\nWait, but the ? can also pair with specific colors. So maybe the order matters here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should first pair the non-? boots as much as possible, then use the ?s to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the following plan:\n\n- First, create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts, which count the number of each color (excluding ?) in left and right boots.\n\n- For each color c (not ?), the maximum possible pairs is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). However, once we pair those, we can subtract those from both left and right counts. But wait, this might not be optimal because maybe some of the ?s could be used more effectively.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal way is to pair all possible specific colors first, then pair the ?s with whatever remains.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s?\n\nLet me think again. The ? can be matched with any color, including other ?. So, after pairing the specific colors, we can pair the remaining ?s with each other, but only if there are equal numbers.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n- Pair all specific colors (non-?) that match between left and right.\n\n- Then, for the remaining ?s, pair them with each other. But since each ? can be paired with any other, the maximum possible pairs here is the minimum of the number of left ?s and right ?s.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Suppose after pairing specific colors, there are some left ?s and right ?s. But also, there might be some leftover specific colors. For example, suppose there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's. We pair 2 of them. Then, there's one left 'a' left. Now, that left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', which would be better than leaving it unpaired. So, perhaps the initial approach of pairing specific colors first isn't optimal.\n\nAh, right! Because the ? can be used to pair with specific colors. So maybe the correct approach is:\n\nFirst, pair as many as possible between specific colors. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which include ?s and leftover specific colors), pair the ?s with the specific colors. Then, pair the remaining ?s with each other.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can first process all the pairs where both are specific colors and match. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (including ?s), we can pair the ?s with specific colors. Then, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Create two lists: left and right, each containing the colors (including ?). Also, track the indices so that we can output the pairs later.\n\nBut for the pairing process, perhaps we need to track which boots are already used.\n\nBut since the problem requires that each boot is used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For each left boot, and each right boot, find compatible pairs, but ensuring that each is used once.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use greedy algorithms with counting.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left and right boots where both are specific and same color.\n\nFor example, for each color c (not ?), count the number of left and",
