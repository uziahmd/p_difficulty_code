After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is like 3 3 followed by 223, 232, 112, then the gradebook is:\n\nStudent 1: [2, 2, 3]\nStudent 2: [2, 3, 2]\nStudent 3: [1, 1, 2]\n\nFor each subject (columns), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the columns (subjects) they have that maximum value. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So for each student, we have a list of their marks per subject.\n3. For each subject (each column in the gradebook), find the maximum value. Let's think about how to do that. For example, for the first sample input, the subjects are:\n\nSubject 1: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\nSubject 2: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\nSubject 3: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nSo for each subject, we need to find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the subjects they have that maximum.\n\nBut how to represent the data? Let's think: the gradebook can be stored as a list of lists. For example, students = [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]. Then, for each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value among all students' j-th element.\n\nOnce we have the maximums for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If at least one exists, then count them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute for each subject (column) the maximum value.\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in that column is equal to the max of that column. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nLet's think: for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have that array, then for each student, iterate through their marks and see if any of them is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample:\n\nmax_marks would be [2,3,3].\n\nStudent 1's marks are [2,2,3]. For subject 0, 2 equals max (2). So he is successful. Similarly, subject 2 has 3 which is max. So he is successful. So he counts.\n\nStudent 2's marks are [2,3,2]. Subject 1 has 3 which is max. So he counts.\n\nStudent 3's marks are [1,1,2]. None of them are equal to the max of their respective columns. So he doesn't count.\n\nThus total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's see: the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the input given in the example is a list of two inputs, but the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: first line has n and m, then n lines of m characters each.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows something like:\n\nInput is given as a list of two examples, but that's probably part of the problem's example. But in reality, the code needs to read from stdin. So the code must read the input as per the problem's input format.\n\nWait, the user provided an example where the input is given as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], but that's probably for testing purposes. However, the actual code should read from standard input. So for the code, the input is a single test case. So the code will read n and m from stdin, then read n lines of m digits each.\n\nSo the code will process one test case at a time.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers. So, for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce the data is stored as a list of lists (students), then compute for each column the maximum value.\n\nHow to compute that? For each column j, iterate through all students and collect their j-th element, then take max.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, check if any of their elements in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo, for each student in students:\n\nfor each j in 0..m-1:\n\nif student[j] == max_marks[j], then mark this student as successful and break.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the plan. Let me test this with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nstudents is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for columns:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3.\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3.\n\nso max_marks is [2,3,3].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nstudent 1: [2,2,3]. Check each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count increases by 1. Break.\n\nstudent 2: [2,3,2]. column 1: 3 == 3 → yes. count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,2]. Check column 0: 1 < 2. column 1: 1 <3. column 2: 2 <3. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input: 3 5\n\nstudents are:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8]\n\n[1,1,8,2,8]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nso max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 1: [9,1,7,2,8]. Check each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9 == 9 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,8,2,8]. Check column 2: 8 == 8 → yes. Also column 4: 8 ==8. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,1,1,1]. Check column 1: 1 ==1 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nTotal 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all students have same marks. Like n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then max is 5. Each student has 5, so both are successful. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful. Output 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. max_marks for column 0 is 2, column 1 is 2. Student 1 has 1 in column 0 (not max), but 2 in column 1 (max). So he is successful. Student 2 has 2 in column 0 (max) and 1 in column 1. So he is also successful. Total 2.\n\nSo code would count 2.\n\nAnother case: a student is the best in multiple subjects. But it's counted once. So for example, student 1 has [9,9], and others have lower. Then he is counted once.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when reading the input, the code reads n lines. Each line is a string. For example, for the first sample input, the lines are '223', '232', '112'.\n\nSo, the code for reading the input is:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_marks.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the students.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen count the number of students who have at least one mark equal to the max in that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nstudents is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks is [2,3,3]\n\ncount is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nstudents are:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\ncount is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, what about when a student is the best in multiple subjects? Like, suppose a student has the max in two subjects. But the code counts them once, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Students have 5 and 5. Then max is 5. Both students are counted. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject is defined as having the highest mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines each containing m digits representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list of lists where each inner list represents the marks of a student across all subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This is stored in an array `max_marks` where each element corresponds to the maximum mark of the respective subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students and move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
