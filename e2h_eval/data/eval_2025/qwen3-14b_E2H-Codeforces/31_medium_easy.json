Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card is a single integer. \n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Then, the required sum is the negative of that. Let me think: for example, if the current sum is S, then we need to add some numbers (each between -x and x) such that their total sum is -S. And we want the minimal number of such numbers.\n\nThe key here is to find the minimal number of elements needed to reach a certain target sum. But what's the target? Let's say the sum of the found cards is current_sum. The target is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -current_sum. Let's call this target_sum = -current_sum.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the minimal number of cards needed to get a sum of target_sum, where each card can contribute between -x and x. \n\nLet me think about how to compute that. For example, if target_sum is zero, then no cards are needed. But if it's non-zero, then how?\n\nLet me think of the maximum possible sum per card. Each card can contribute up to x or down to -x. So, for the minimal number of cards, we want to take as much as possible per card. \n\nFor example, suppose target_sum is positive. Then, each card can contribute +x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(target_sum / x). But wait, if target_sum is divisible by x, then exactly target_sum/x cards. Otherwise, one more. Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me think.\n\nWait, the target_sum can be achieved with the minimal number of cards by using as many as possible x (or -x, depending on the sign). So, for example, if target_sum is positive, then each card contributes +x. So the minimal number is ceiling(target_sum / x). But if target_sum is negative, then each card contributes -x, and the same logic applies. \n\nBut wait, let's take an example. Suppose target_sum is 3 and x is 2. Then, 3 / 2 is 1.5, so ceiling is 2. Which would be 2 cards: 2 + 1. But since each card can be up to x, but the maximum is x. So, in this case, two cards: 2 and 1. But the problem allows any integers between -x and x. So, for the target_sum, the minimal number of cards is ceil( (abs(target_sum)) / x ), because each card can contribute up to x. \n\nWait, but if the target_sum is 3 and x is 2, then the minimal number is 2. Because 2 + 1. But 1 is allowed. But if the target_sum is 4, then 2 cards of 2 each. So, yes, the minimal is ceil( (target_sum)/x ). But wait, target_sum could be positive or negative. So the absolute value is what matters.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( (abs(target_sum)) / x ). But wait, let's think again. For example, if target_sum is 5 and x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceil is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. That's correct. \n\nBut what if target_sum is 0? Then zero cards are needed. So the formula would be 0.\n\nSo putting this together: the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (abs(target_sum) / x), but only if target_sum is not zero. Otherwise, zero.\n\nWait, but let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input: the cards are -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So target_sum is -2. So the absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 is 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input: cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target_sum is 4. x is 3. So 4 /3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes! So that seems to be the formula.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the current sum of the given cards.\n\n2. Compute target_sum = -current_sum.\n\n3. If target_sum is zero, return 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( abs(target_sum) / x )\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nWell, for integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nYes. For example, 3 / 2 is 1.5. (3 + 2 -1) // 2 = 4//2=2. Which is correct. Similarly, 4/2 is 2, (4 + 2-1)//2 =5//2=2. Correct.\n\nSo, in code, for the absolute value of target_sum, let's call it s. Then the minimal number is (s + x -1) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute current_sum = sum of the list.\n\ntarget_sum = -current_sum.\n\nif target_sum is 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ns = abs(target_sum)\n\nresult = (s + x -1) // x\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but let's test some cases.\n\nAnother example: if target_sum is 5, x is 3. Then (5 +3-1)/3 = 7//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target_sum is 3, x is 3. Then (3 +3-1)/3 = 5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target_sum is 1, x is 1. Then (1 +1-1)/1 =1. Correct.\n\nWhat if target_sum is 0? Then output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input lines. For example, first line is n and x, then the second line is the list of numbers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nSo, in code, read the first line as n and x. Then read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen compute sum of the list. Then target_sum is -sum.\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line: n, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read the second line: numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(numbers)\n\ntarget_sum = -current_sum\n\nif target_sum == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    s = abs(target_sum)\n\n    print( (s + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1,1,2. sum is 2. target_sum is -2. So s=2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3. numbers are -2,-2. sum is -4. target_sum is 4. s=4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Then output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 5. Then (5+5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 4. (5 +4-1)/4 = 8//4=2. Which is correct (4+1=5, two cards).\n\nYes. So this seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the target_sum is negative? For example, sum of the found cards is 3, target_sum is -3. Then s is 3, and the calculation is same as before. Because we take absolute value. So yes.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nsum_numbers = sum(numbers)\n\ntarget = -sum_numbers\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    s = abs(target)\n\n    print( (s + x -1) // x )\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 3 2, then -1 1 2. Sum is 2. target is -2. So s is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 3, numbers -2 -2. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if sum is 0, output 0.\n\nAnother example: sum is 5, x=5. Output 1.\n\nAnother example: sum is 6, x=5. (6 +5-1)/5 = 10//5=2. Which is correct (5+1=6, two cards).\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input. But note that in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first input line is '3 2\\n-1 1 2' as in the first example. So in code, the first line is read as n and x, then the second line is the list.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(numbers)\ntarget = -current_sum\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    s = abs(target)\n    print( (s + x -1) // x )\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the code. Let me check for possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, x=1, numbers [0]. sum is 0. target is 0. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, x=1, numbers [1]. sum is 1. target is -1. s=1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. So output 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=1. Need one card of -1. So correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=2. s=3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which is correct (2 +1 =3, two cards).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: sum is -5, x=3. target is 5. s=5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. Which is 3+2=5. So two cards. Correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value x. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(numbers)\ntarget = -current_sum\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    s = abs(target)\n    print((s + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Current Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to reach zero.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum is determined as the negative of the current sum. If this target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For non-zero target sums, the minimum number of cards is calculated using integer arithmetic to simulate the ceiling of the division. This ensures we use the fewest cards possible by leveraging the maximum absolute value allowed per card.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
