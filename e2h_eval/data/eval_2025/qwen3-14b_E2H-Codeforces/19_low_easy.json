The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we have to remove exactly k districts. The output should be the list of districts to remove, sorted in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which grows exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more than lower ones. So, the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring the remaining districts are connected.\n\nBut how do we ensure connectivity? Because removing certain districts might disconnect the graph. So, the approach is probably to find a way to keep the highest possible districts, but also make sure they are connected.\n\nWait, since the original graph is a tree (since there's exactly one path between every pair of districts), removing some nodes will leave a subtree. The problem requires that the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i for those nodes is maximum. And then output the k nodes not in this subtree, sorted.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nSince the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers, perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think: The best possible scenario is to keep all the nodes from (n - k + 1) to n. But if those nodes are connected, then that's the optimal. However, if they are not connected, then we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a problem where we want to select a subset of nodes with size (n - k) that is connected, and has maximum sum. Since the sum depends on the nodes' values, which are 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i, the optimal subset must include the largest possible nodes, and the minimal necessary lower ones to keep the connectivity.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Start with the largest nodes and try to include them, but ensure that the selected nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea: Since the sum is maximized by including the largest nodes, we need to find a connected subtree that includes as many of the largest nodes as possible. So perhaps we can start from the largest node (n), and then greedily include the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nWait, but how to do that? Maybe using a priority queue approach.\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to finding a tree with (n -k) nodes, which is connected, and the sum of their values is maximum. Since the values are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the optimal solution is to select the (n -k) largest nodes, but connected. If they are connected, then that's the answer. Otherwise, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes are connected?\n\nWait, but maybe the largest (n -k) nodes are not connected. For example, if the tree is a chain like 1-2-3-4-5-6, and n=6, k=3. Then n -k is 3. The largest three nodes are 4,5,6. Are they connected? Well, 4 is connected to 5 and 6? No, in the chain, 4 is connected to 3 and 5. So 5 is connected to 6 via 5-6? If the tree is 1-2-3-4-5-6, then 5 is connected to 6. So 4,5,6 are connected via 4-5-6. So they form a connected subtree. Then the answer would be to remove 1,2,3. But in the sample input, the first case is n=6, k=3. The output is removing 1,3,4, which implies that the kept districts are 2,5,6. Wait, but why not keep 4,5,6?\n\nWait the sample input's first case:\n\nInput is:\n\n6 3\n\nThe roads are:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So the tree looks like:\n\nLet me draw it:\n\nNodes:\n\n2 is connected to 1, 3, ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, we aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered node and iteratively including the next highest nodes that maintain connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts, which are the largest possible\n    # So we start from the largest node and try to include as many large nodes as possible\n    # We can use a priority queue (max heap) to select the largest nodes, but need to check connectivity\n    \n    # First, find the nodes to keep\n    # The optimal approach is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but they must be connected\n    # However, if they are not connected, we need to include some smaller ones to connect them\n    \n    # To do this, we can use a reverse approach: start with the largest node and perform BFS/DFS to collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n    # But since we need exactly (n -k) nodes, we might need to adjust\n    \n    # Another approach is to realize that the optimal set is the largest (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree\n    # To find this, we can start with the largest node and greedily add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current set\n    \n    # Let's use a priority queue (max heap) to process nodes in descending order\n    # We'll track which nodes are included and ensure they are connected\n    \n    # First, create a list of nodes sorted in descending order\n    nodes = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    nodes.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # We need to select (n -k) nodes\n    target_size = n - k\n    \n    # Use a priority queue to select the largest nodes, but ensure they are connected\n    # We can use BFS to check connectivity\n    \n    # Start with the first node (largest)\n    included = set()\n    included.add(nodes[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append(nodes[0])\n    \n    # Keep track of the nodes we have included\n    count = 1\n    # We need to include (target_size) nodes\n    # We will use a max heap to process the next candidates\n    # But we need to know which nodes are connected to the current set\n    # So, we can use a BFS approach, adding nodes in descending order\n    \n    # Create a priority queue (max heap) of available nodes\n    # Initially, all nodes except the first one are candidates\n    # We need to process nodes in descending order, and add them if connected to the current set\n    # To do this, we can use a priority queue and a visited set\n    \n    # Create a list of all nodes except the first one, sorted in descending order\n    candidates = nodes[1:]\n    # Use a priority queue (max heap) to get the next largest candidate\n    # Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, we can insert negatives\n    pq = []\n    for node in candidates:\n        heapq.heappush(pq, (-node, node))\n    \n    while count < target_size:\n        # Get the next largest node\n        neg_node, node = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if node in included:\n            continue\n        # Check if this node is connected to the included set\n        # To check this, we can perform BFS or DFS from the included set to see if this node is reachable\n        # However, this would be expensive for large n\n        # Alternative approach: during BFS, we can track which nodes are connected to the included set\n        # So, we need to check if the node is connected to the included set through existing edges\n        \n        # To do this efficiently, we can perform a BFS from the included set and see if the node is reachable\n        # However, this could be time-consuming.

If it can, it is added to the set.\n4. **Result Construction**: After selecting the required number of nodes, the remaining nodes (those not included) are collected and printed in sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans while maintaining connectivity among the remaining districts.",
