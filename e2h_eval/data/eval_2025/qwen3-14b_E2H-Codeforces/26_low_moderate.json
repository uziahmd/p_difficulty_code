Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, since it's a triangle, the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe we can find a way to simplify the condition.\n\nFirst, let me think about the ordering of the sides. The problem says x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y and y ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, the order of the sides in the triangle is such that x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that x is between A and B, and then y is between B and C, but the actual triangle sides could be in any order. However, for a triangle, the triangle inequality requires that the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. So if we arrange x, y, z such that x ≤ y ≤ z, then the condition becomes x + y > z. Because if that's true, then the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold since z is the largest.\n\nSo the key condition here is x + y > z. But given the constraints on x, y, z, how do we compute this?\n\nBut the problem says that x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. Wait, the original condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be as small as A and up to B. Then y starts from B (since B ≤ y) up to C. And z starts from C up to D. But also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, then x ≤ y. Similarly, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then y ≤ z. So for any valid x, y, z, we have x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where:\n\n- A ≤ x ≤ B\n- B ≤ y ≤ C\n- C ≤ z ≤ D\n- x + y > z\n\nBut how to efficiently compute this? Since the ranges can be up to 5e5, a brute force approach would be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow. We need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each possible z, find the number of (x, y) pairs such that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, y ≤ C, and x + y > z. But even that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C, perhaps we can precompute for each possible z, the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z. But how?\n\nLet me think of the variables. For a fixed z, the condition x + y > z must hold. Since x can be up to B, and y can be up to C, but with x ≤ B and y ≥ B.\n\nBut for each z, the minimum value of x + y is when x is as small as possible and y is as small as possible. The minimum x is A, and minimum y is B. So x + y can be as low as A + B. If A + B > z, then all possible (x, y) pairs would satisfy the condition. Otherwise, we need to count the pairs where x + y > z.\n\nBut z ranges from C to D. So for each z, we need to calculate the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nSo the overall approach would be:\n\nTotal = sum_{z = C}^D [number of (x, y) pairs for this z]\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each z, the count of (x, y) pairs where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges. For each z, the number of valid (x, y) pairs is equal to the total number of (x, y) pairs minus the number of pairs where x + y ≤ z.\n\nThe total number of (x, y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Let me call this total_pairs.\n\nSo for each z, the count is total",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints based on given integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The constraints are $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we can simplify the condition to checking if $x + y > z$ for all valid $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: The problem requires us to count valid triangles where $x$ ranges from $A$ to $B$, $y$ ranges from $B$ to $C$, and $z$ ranges from $C$ to $D$. Since $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the triangle inequality simplifies to checking if $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Counting**: For each possible value of $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, we need to count the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs such that $x + y > z$. This can be done efficiently by precomputing the total number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs and subtracting those that do not meet the triangle inequality.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: Using prefix sums, we can efficiently compute the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs for each $z$ by iterating through possible values of $x$ and $y$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    A = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    B = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    C = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    D = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    # Precompute the number of x in [A, B]\n    count_x = B -
