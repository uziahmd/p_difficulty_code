    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when we remove one element, we need to find which removal leads to the smallest possible max-min difference.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. In the first example, the array is [1,3,3,7]. If we remove 7, the array becomes [1,3,3], max is 3, min is 1, difference is 2. If we remove any other element, like 1, then the array is [3,3,7], which has max 7 and min 3, difference 4. So removing the 7 gives the best result.\n\nIn the second example, [1, 100000], removing either gives an array with one element, so instability is zero.\n\nSo the key is to find which element to remove such that the new max and min of the remaining array have the smallest difference.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, consider removing it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and track the minimum difference. However, for large n (like 1e5), this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. For example, if n is 1e5, then for each element, computing max and min would take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2) total time, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the array. The original array's max and min are known. When we remove an element, the new max and min can be determined based on whether the removed element was the original max or min.\n\nWait, but if the array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them may not affect the overall max or min.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the original max is 7, min is 1. If we remove 7, the new max is 3. If we remove one of the 3s, the max remains 7 and the min remains 1. So the instability would be 7-1=6, which is worse than removing 7.\n\nSo the idea is that the optimal element to remove is either the maximum or the minimum, but perhaps not always. But maybe the best option is to consider removing the max or the min, but how do we know which one?\n\nAlternatively, think about the sorted array. Suppose the array is sorted. Then, the original instability is max - min. If we remove one element, the new instability would depend on which element we remove. For example, if the array is sorted as [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], then:\n\nIf we remove the first element (a_1), the new min is a_2, and the max is a_n. So instability is a_n - a_2.\n\nIf we remove the last element (a_n), the new max is a_{n-1}, and the min is a_1. Instability is a_{n-1} - a_1.\n\nIf we remove any element in the middle, say a_i, then the min is a_1 and the max is a_n, so the instability is a_n - a_1. Which is the same as the original instability. Wait, but that's only if the array is sorted. So, in this case, removing any element except the first or last would leave the min and max the same. Therefore, the instability would be the same as the original. So in this case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a_n - a_2) and (a_{n-1} - a_1).\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the optimal choice is to remove either the first or last element in the sorted array. But wait, this is only if the array is sorted. So perhaps the approach is to sort the array and then check for each possible element to remove, but in the sorted array, the possible candidates for removal are the first or last elements. But maybe not? Let's think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 5, 7]. The original instability is 7 - 1 = 6. If I remove 1, the instability is 7 - 2 = 5. If I remove 7, the instability is 5 - 1 = 4. If I remove 2, the instability is 7 - 1 = 6. If I remove 5, the instability is 7 - 1 = 6. So the best is to remove 7, giving instability 4.\n\nBut in this case, the sorted array is [1,2,5,7]. So the minimal instability comes from removing the last element. But what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 7]. If I remove 7, the instability is 4-1=3. If I remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. But what if I remove 3? Then the array is [1,4,7], instability is 6. So again, removing the last element is better.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 7, 8]. Original instability is 7. If I remove 8, instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 1, instability is 8-3=5. So here, removing the first element gives a better result. So the minimal instability is min( (a_n - a_2), (a_{n-1} - a_1) ), which in this case is min(7-3=4, 8-1=7) → 4. Wait, but in this case, the array is [1,3,7,8]. If we remove 1, the array becomes [3,7,8], instability is 8-3=5. If we remove 8, the array becomes [1,3,7], instability 7-1=6. But according to the previous idea, the min between a_n - a_2 (which is 8 -3=5) and a_{n-1} -a_1 (7-1=6). So the min is 5, which is correct. So in this case, the minimal instability is achieved by removing the first element.\n\nSo the conclusion is that when the array is sorted, the optimal choice is to remove either the first element or the last element. Because removing any other element would leave the min and max as the original ones, leading to the same instability as before. So the minimal instability is the minimum between (max of the array minus the second min) and (second max minus the min). \n\nWait, but how do we get the second min and second max? Well, when the array is sorted, the second min is the second element, and the second max is the second to last element. So for the sorted array, the options are:\n\n- Remove the first element → new min is a[1], new max is a[-1]. Instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\n- Remove the last element → new min is a[0], new max is a[-2]. Instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut what if there are duplicates in the array?\n\nLet me take the first example: [1,3,3,7]. Sorted array is [1,3,3,7]. If I remove the first element (1), the new array is [3,3,7], instability is 7-3=4. If I remove the last element (7), the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. Which is better. So the answer is 2. Which is min between (a[-1] - a[1]) = 7-3=4 and (a[-2] - a[0]) = 3-1=2. So the minimal is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is the minimum between these two possibilities.\n\nBut what if the array has multiple elements that are the same as the min or max?\n\nLike [1,1,1,1]. If we remove any element, the instability is 0. So the answer is 0. Which would be min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0) and (a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0).\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Removing first element gives instability 5-2=3. Removing last gives 4-1=3. So the answer is 3. But if you remove 2, the instability is 5-1=4, which is worse.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between the two values: (max after removing first element) - (min after removing first element) and (max after removing last element) - (min after removing last element). Which can be calculated as (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is of size 2? Like the second example in the problem statement. For n=2, removing one element leaves one element. So instability is 0. Which is the case. So for n=2, the answer is 0. But according to the formula, a[-1] - a[1] would be a[1] - a[1] = 0 (since for n=2, sorted array is [a0, a1], and removing first element gives [a1], so instability is 0. Similarly for removing last element. So the formula works.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). That's the answer.\n\nWait, but why can't there be a scenario where removing some other element gives a better result?\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. The sorted array is [1,2,4,5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 2, the array becomes [1,4,5], instability is 5-1=4. So in this case, the answer would be min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct. So the answer is 3. Which is achieved by removing the first element (1) or the last element (5). Wait no, if you remove the first element, the array becomes [2,4,5], instability is 5-2=3. If you remove the last element, the array becomes [1,2,4], instability is 4-1=3. So the formula gives the correct answer.\n\nBut what if there's a situation where removing a middle element gives a better result? Let's think of a scenario.\n\nLet me think of a sorted array [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. Now, if we remove 6, the array becomes [1,3,4,7]. The instability is 7-1=6. Which is same as original. But if we remove 3, the array is [1,4,6,7], instability 7-1=6. Same. So no improvement. However, if I remove 4, the array is [1,3,6,7], instability is 7-1=6. Still same. So the best is to remove the first or last element, leading to instability 7-3=4 (if remove first) or 6-1=5 (if remove last). So the minimal is 4. Which is the min between (a[-1] - a[1]) = 7-3=4 and (a[-2] - a[0]) = 6-1=5. So the answer is 4.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: [1, 5, 6, 7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 5, the array becomes [1,6,7], instability 6. If I remove 6, the array becomes [1,5,7], instability 6. If I remove 7, the array becomes [1,5,6], instability 5. Which is better. So according to the formula, the answer would be min(7 - a[1]=7-5=2, a[-2] - a[0] = 6-1=5). So the answer is 2. Which is correct. Because when we remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-5=2. So that's the answer. So the formula works here.\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal instability is the minimum between the two options: removing the first element (so the new min is a[1], new max is a[-1]) or removing the last element (new min is a[0], new max is a[-2]).\n\nTherefore, the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has more than two elements and there's a case where removing a different element gives a better result?\n\nLet me try to think of a scenario where that's possible.\n\nLet's say the array is [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]. The sorted array is [1,2,5,6,7]. The original instability is 6. If I remove 5, the array becomes [1,2,6,7], instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 2, the array becomes [1,5,6,7], instability 7-1=6. If I remove 1, the instability is 7-2=5. If I remove 7, the instability is 6-1=5. So the answer is 5. Which is min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 7-2=5, a[-2] -a[0] =6-1=5). So the answer is 5.\n\nBut suppose there's an array like [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. If we remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,5,7], instability 7-1=6. If we remove 4, the array becomes [1,3,5,7], instability 7-1=6. So again, the minimal is achieved by removing first or last element.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 100]. The original instability is 99. If you remove 100, the instability is 3-1=2. If you remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So the answer is 2. Which is the min between (a[-1] -a[1] = 100-2=98 and a[-2] -a[0] =3-1=2. So the answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSo in all these cases, the formula works.\n\nSo the approach is to sort the array and compute the minimum between the two possibilities: (max after removing first element) - (min after removing first element) = a[-1] - a[1], and (max after removing last element) - (min after removing last element) = a[-2] - a[0]. The answer is the minimum of these two.\n\nBut what about cases where there are multiple elements that are the same?\n\nTake the array [1, 1, 1, 1]. After sorting, the two options are a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0 and a[-2] -a[0] =1-1=0. So answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]. The original instability is 2. If we remove the first element (1), the array becomes [2,2,2,3], instability is 3-2=1. If we remove the last element (3), the array becomes [1,2,2,2], instability 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is the min between 3-2=1 and 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? For example, n=2, array [1, 100000]. Then, after sorting, a[-1] is 100000, a[1] is 100000, so a[-1] -a[1] is 0. Similarly, a[-2] is 1, a[0] is 1, so a[-2] -a[0] is 0. The answer is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it, then compute min between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if n is 3?\n\nFor example, n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. After sorting, the options are:\n\nremove first element: array [2,3], instability 1.\n\nremove last element: array [1,2], instability 1.\n\nso the answer is 1. Which is min(3-2=1, 2-1=1). Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=3, array [1, 3, 5]. The answer is min(5-3=2, 3-1=2) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for all n >= 2.\n\nThus, the solution is to sort the array and compute the minimum between the two options.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, then list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nIf n == 2: the answer is 0 (since after removing one element, the array has one element, so instability is 0).\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult = min(option1, option2)\n\nPrint result.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] which is a[1] - a[1] = 0, and a[-2] -a[0] is a[0] -a[0] = 0. So the code would return 0 even without handling n=2 as a special case. So the code can be written for all n >= 2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 0, and a[-2] - a[0] = a[0] - a[0] = 0. So the code can handle it even without the n==2 check. So the code can be written as:\n\nsort the array, then compute min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut for n=2, a[-1] is a[1], and a[1] is the same as a[-1], so the first option is 0. Similarly for the second option. So the code can be written for all n >= 2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute the correct value. Let me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 = 7 - a[1] = 7-3=4\n\noption2 = a[-2] (3) - a[0] (1) → 3-1=2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted is [1, 100000]. code returns min(100000 - a[1] (which is 100000 - 100000 = 0), and a[-2] (1) - a[0] (1) → 0. So min(0,0) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1,2,3]. code returns min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1,1,1]. code returns min(1-1=0, 1-1=0) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, array [1,2,3,4,5]. option1 is 5 - a[1] =5-2=3. option2 is a[-2] (4) - a[0] (1) =3. So min is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut wait, what about when the array has multiple elements, but the best option is not to remove the first or last element?\n\nWait, let's think of a scenario where removing a middle element gives a better result than removing the first or last.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me try to think of such a case.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. Sorted array. The original instability is 99.\n\nIf we remove 100, the instability is 5-1=4.\n\nIf we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98.\n\nBut what if we remove 5? Then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,100]. The instability is 100-1=99. Which is worse than removing 100.\n\nSo the best is to remove 100.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 100, 101]. Sorted array. If we remove 100, the array becomes [1,2,101], instability 100. If we remove 101, the array becomes [1,2,100], instability 99. If we remove 1, the instability is 101-2=99. If we remove 2, the instability is 101-1=100. So the best is to remove 101, which gives 99. Which is the min between option1 (a[-1] - a[1] = 101-2=99) and option2 (a[-2] - a[0] =100 -1=99). So the code returns 99, which is correct.\n\nBut suppose we have an array like [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]. The original instability is 9. If we remove 1, the instability is 10-3=7. If we remove 10, the instability is 9-1=8. So the best is 7. Which is option1. But what if there is a scenario where removing a middle element gives a better result?\n\nLet me think of a case where the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The original instability is 6. If I remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,5,6,7], instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 1, the instability is 7-4=3. If I remove 7, the instability is 6-1=5. So the best is to remove 1. Which is handled by option1 (a[-1] - a[1] =7-3=4? Wait, no. Wait the array is [1,3,4,5,6,7]. a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3. So option1 is 7-3=4. Option2 is a[-2] (6) - a[0] (1) =5. So the code returns min(4,5) → 4. But when we remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. Which is correct. So the code returns 4, which is the correct answer.\n\nBut what if there's a case where removing a middle element gives a better result than both options?\n\nLet me think of such a case. Let's imagine the array is [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The original instability is 7. If I remove 5, the array becomes [1,2,6,7,8], instability is 8-1=7. If I remove 6, same. But if I remove 8, the instability is 7-1=6. Which is option2 (a[-2] is 7, a[0] is 1, 7-1=6). Which is handled by the code. So the code returns min(8-2=6, 7-1=6) → 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10]. The code computes option1: 10 -4 =6, option2: 7-1=6. So the answer is 6. But what if we remove 10 and 7? No, we can only remove one element. So if we remove 10, the instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 1, it's 10-4=6. So the code returns 6, which is correct.\n\nIs there any scenario where the code would not find the correct answer?\n\nLet me think of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100]. The code would compute option1: 100 - a[1] = 100-2=98. option2: a[-2] is 6, 6 - 1 =5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct. Which is achieved by removing the last element (100), which gives instability 6-1=5. So the code returns the correct answer.\n\nAnother scenario: [1, 2, 3, 100, 200, 300]. The code would compute option1: 300 - a[1] =300-2=298. option2: a[-2] is 200 - a[0] =199. So the answer is 199. Which is achieved by removing the last element (300), leading to instability 200-1=199. But what if there's a better option? For example, if we remove 100, the array becomes [1,2,3,200,300]. The instability is 300-1=299, which is worse than 199. So the code is correct.\n\nHmm. So I can't think of any case where the code would fail. Thus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut note that for n=2, the code will compute a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] =0, and a[-2] -a[0] =a[0] -a[0] =0. So the code can handle it even without the n==2 check. So the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] → a[1] - a[1] =0. And a[-2] - a[0] is a[0] -a[0] =0. So the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut for n=2, the code is correct. So the code can be written as such.\n\nBut what about n=3?\n\nYes, for example, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1], which is the max after removing first element minus the second min. And a[-2] -a[0], which is the second max minus the min.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort, then compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the array is [a0, a1, a2]. So when you remove the first element, the array is [a1, a2], instability is a2 -a1. Which is a[-1] - a[1] (since a[-1] is a2, a[1] is a1). So that's correct. When you remove the last element, the array is [a0, a1], instability is a1 - a0. Which is a[-2] -a[0] (a[-2] is a1, a[0] is a0). So yes.\n\nSo the code works for all n >=2.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort, compute the min between those two options.\n\nSo the Python code is as follows:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but let's check the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\na[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3 → 7-3=4.\n\na[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1 → 3-1=2. min(4,2)=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. a[-1] -a[1] is 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] -a[0] is 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1,2,3]. code outputs min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, array [1,2,3,4,5]. code outputs min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,3,3,7]. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has multiple elements and after removing one of the middle elements, the instability is lower than both options?\n\nBut according to the previous reasoning, that's not possible. Because when you remove any element that is not the first or last in the sorted array, the min and max of the remaining array are the same as the original array's min and max. So the instability is the same as the original instability. Which is (a[-1] - a[0]).\n\nBut when you remove the first element, the new instability is (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWhen you remove the last element, it's (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nSo the code considers those two options. But what if there's another option where removing a different element gives a better result?\n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So the code returns min(100-2=98, 6-1=5) →5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 100, 101, 102]. The code computes:\n\na[-1] -a[1] =102-2=100.\n\na[-2] -a[0] =101-1=100.\n\nBut if you remove 100, the array becomes [1,2,101,102], instability is 102-1=101, which is worse than 100. So the code returns 100, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100, 101, 102]. The code returns min(102 - a[1] (100) → 2, a[-2] (101) -a[0] (1) → 100. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. Which is achieved by removing the first element (1), leaving [100, 101, 102], instability 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n2. **Optimal Element Removal**: By removing one element, we aim to minimize this instability. The key insight is that sorting the array allows us to efficiently determine the optimal element to remove.\n3. **Sorted Array Analysis**: After sorting the array, the optimal removals to consider are either the first or the last element. This is because removing these elements can potentially reduce the range (difference between max and min) more effectively than removing any other element.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Once sorted, the minimum instability after removing one element can be determined by evaluating two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element, which results in the instability being the difference between the last element and the second element.\n   - Removing the last element, which results in the instability being the difference between the second-to-last element and the first element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate efficient calculation of potential instability values after removing elements.\n3. **Instability Calculation**:\n   - **Case 1**: Removing the first element results in the instability being `a[-1] - a[1]` (difference between the last element and the second element in the sorted array).\n   - **Case 2**: Removing the last element results in the instability being `a[-2] - a[0]` (difference between the second-to-last element and the first element in the sorted array).\n4. **Result**: The minimum value from the two calculated instabilities is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \\log n)$, making it suitable for large input sizes up to $10^5$.",
