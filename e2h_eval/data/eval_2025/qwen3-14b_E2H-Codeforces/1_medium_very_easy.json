The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge. The second is two cells away from the edge. Wait, maybe the way to think about it is that each ring is a border around a rectangle. For example, the first ring is the outermost border. Then the next ring is inside that, but how?\n\nThe formal definition says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take a rectangle that's smaller by 4*(i-1) in both width and height. But how does that translate into the perimeter?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Alternatively, for a rectangle of size W x H, the number of cells in the perimeter (the border) is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Or wait, maybe it's 2*(W + H) - 4, since each side has length W or H, but the four corners are counted twice. So for example, for a 3x3 rectangle, the perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Which matches the first example input where the output is 8 for 3 3 1. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1) and height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, the ring is the border of that rectangle. So for each i, the number of cells in that ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). But we have to make sure that the rectangle is valid. For example, if the rectangle becomes 0 or negative, but according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the rectangles will be valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So i=1, rectangle is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14 = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is 7 - 4*(2-1) = 3, 9 - 4*(2-1) = 5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6 = 12. Total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is to sum for each i from 1 to k, 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ) ?\n\nSimplify that: 2*( (w + h - 4*(i-1)*2 - 2 ) )\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nFor each i, the perimeter is 2*( (width_i) + (height_i) - 2 ), where width_i = w - 4*(i-1), height_i = h -4*(i-1).\n\nSo that's 2*( (w -4*(i-1) + h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ) = 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ?\n\nYes. So simplifying further, 2*(w + h - 2 - 8*(i-1)).\n\nAlternatively, 2*(w + h - 2) - 16*(i-1) ?\n\nBecause 8*(i-1) multiplied by 2 is 16*(i-1). So for each ring, the perimeter is the initial perimeter (for i=1) minus 16*(i-1). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for the first ring (i=1), the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). For the second ring (i=2), it's 2*(w + h - 8*(1) - 2) = 2*(w + h - 2) - 16*1. So yes, each subsequent ring's perimeter is 16 less than the previous one. Wait, because 8*(i-1) is 8*(i-1) for each term. So when you expand for i-th ring, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2 - 8*(i-1)).\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern here. So for each i from 1 to k, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2) - 16*(i-1). So the total sum would be sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [ 2*(w + h - 2) - 16*i ] ?\n\nWait, because for i starting at 1, the term is 2*(w + h -2) - 16*(i-1). So when i=1, it's 2*(...) - 0, then for i=2, it's 2*(...) - 16*1, etc.\n\nSo the sum is sum_{m=0}^{k-1} (2*(w + h -2) - 16*m) ?\n\nYes. So that's an arithmetic sequence. The first term is a = 2*(w + h -2), the next term is a - 16, then a - 32, etc., for k terms.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is (number of terms) * (first term + last term)/2.\n\nSo the last term is a - 16*(k-1).\n\nSo the sum is k*(a + (a - 16*(k-1)) ) / 2.\n\nWhich can be simplified as k*(2a - 16(k-1)) / 2 = k*(a - 8(k-1)).\n\nBut a is 2*(w + h -2). So substituting:\n\nsum = k * ( 2*(w + h -2) - 8*(k-1) )\n\nWait, let me check with the first example:\n\nExample 1: w=3, h=3, k=1. So sum is 1*(2*(3+3-2) - 8*(0)) = 1*(2*4) = 8. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 7 9 1. sum is 1*(2*(7+9-2) - 0) = 2*(14) = 28. Correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So sum is 2*(2*(7+9-2) - 8*(1)) = 2*(2*14 -8) = 2*(28-8) = 2*20=40. Which matches. So yes, this formula works.\n\nSo the formula for the total number of cells is k*( 2*(w + h - 2) - 8*(k-1) ) ?\n\nWait, but how did we get here? Because the sum of the arithmetic sequence is k*(a + l)/2, where a is the first term and l is the last term. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal sum is sum_{i=1 to k} [ 2*(w + h -2 - 8*(i-1)) ].\n\nWhich equals sum_{i=1 to k} [ 2*(w + h -2) - 16*(i-1) ].\n\nLet me denote a = 2*(w + h -2). Then the sum is sum_{i=1 to k} [ a - 16*(i-1) ].\n\nWhich is sum_{m=0}^{k-1} [a - 16*m ] where m = i-1.\n\nSo that's sum_{m=0}^{k-1} a - 16 * sum_{m=0}^{k-1} m.\n\nWhich is a*k - 16 * ( (k-1)*k ) / 2 )\n\nWhich is a*k - 8*k*(k-1)\n\nSubstituting a = 2*(w + h -2):\n\nTotal = 2*(w + h -2)*k - 8*k*(k-1)\n\nWhich can be factored as 2k [ (w + h -2) - 4(k-1) ]\n\nOr 2k (w + h -2 -4k +4) = 2k (w + h +2 -4k )\n\nWait, but earlier we had the formula as k*( 2*(w + h -2) - 8*(k-1) ), which is same as 2k*(w + h -2) - 8k(k-1) ?\n\nYes. Which is the same as the above.\n\nBut regardless, the formula can be calculated as 2*k*(w + h - 2) - 8*k*(k-1) ?\n\nLet me compute for the third example again:\n\nk=2, w=7, h=9.\n\n2*2*(7+9-2) = 4*(14) = 56\n\n8*2*(2-1) = 16*1=16\n\nso 56 - 16 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes, so this formula works.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cells is 2*k*(w + h -2) - 8*k*(k-1).\n\nBut wait, perhaps even more simplified:\n\nLet me compute 2k(w + h -2) - 8k(k-1) = 2k(w + h -2 -4(k-1)) )\n\nWhich is 2k(w + h -2 -4k +4) = 2k(w + h +2 -4k).\n\nBut perhaps that's not necessary. The formula can be written as 2*k*(w + h -2) - 8*k*(k-1).\n\nSo the code can compute this directly.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing this formula.\n\nBut how do I make sure that this formula is correct?\n\nLet me test another case. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. Then the perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is 2*1*(5+5-2) - 8*1*0 = 16. Correct.\n\nAnother case: k=2. Let's see. For w=5, h=5, k=2. The first ring is 5x5, perimeter 16. The second ring is (5-4*(2-1)) = 1, 5-4*(1) = 1. So 1x1. The perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0 = 0? Wait that can't be. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input constraints for k are such that k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, min(w,h) is 5, so floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be 2. So this case isn't allowed. So the formula is safe.\n\nSo for allowed values of k, the formula works.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nCompute total = 2*k*(w + h -2) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\nBut wait, what if the rings are not possible? Well, the input constraints ensure that k is valid. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nCompute the formula and print it.\n\nBut let me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 2*1*(3+3-2) - 8*1*0 → 2*(4) = 8. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1 → 2*1*(7+9-2) - 0 → 2*14 = 28. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 7 9 2 → 2*2*(7+9-2) - 8*2*(1) → 4*14 = 56 - 16 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input line, split into w, h, k. Then compute the formula.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three integers. So for example, the input could be '3 3 1' etc.\n\nIn Python, the code can be:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the formula.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nresult = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Let's take a case where k=2, say, w=7, h=9. Which is the third example. Which gives 40. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's imagine w=5, h=5, k=1. Then result is 2*1*(5+5-2) - 0 = 2*8=16. Which is correct, as the perimeter of 5x5 is 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\nAnother case: Let's take w=4, h=4, k=1. Then the perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 12. Which is 2*1*(6) = 12. Correct.\n\nSo yes, this formula seems to work.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. So the Python code is:\n\nRead the three numbers, compute that formula, print.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n",
