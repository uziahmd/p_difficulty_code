The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, like the first one, the perimeter of the rectangle. But how is that calculated? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, 3x3: the perimeter cells are the outermost layer. So for a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W or H cells, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So yes, 2*(W + H - 2) equals that. So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w' x h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that each subsequent ring is possible. For example, if the current dimensions are such that the rectangle is too small to have a ring. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), which ensures that each ring can be formed. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, then sum them all.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output of 8.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So the first ring is perimeter of 7x9. 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1) = 9-4=5. So the rectangle is 3x5. Its perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop from i=1 to k:\n\nFor each i, compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h - 4*(i-1).\n\nCompute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2).\n\nSum all these perimeters.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    sum += perimeter\n\nprint sum\n\nBut wait, let me check for another case. Let's say for i=2, the current_w and current_h must be at least 3? Well, according to the constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead input as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, inclusive.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → sum is 2*(3+3-2) = 8 → correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28 → correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)= 16.\n\nSecond ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Wait, but 1x1? Then perimeter would be 2*(1+1-2) = 0? That's not possible. But according to the constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, min(w, h) is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not have such cases.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 24.\n\nSecond ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop i in range 1 to k+1 (since in Python, range is exclusive on upper bound). Wait, for i from 1 to k inclusive.\n\nSo for i in range(1, k+1):\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → i=1: 7,9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3+5-2=6 → 12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nYes. So this should work.\n",
