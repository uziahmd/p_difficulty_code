The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. How many steps? Well, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then task 2 is done. Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the time taken to move from her current position to the next task's house, considering the clockwise direction.\n\nBut how to compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's think: if current position is pos, and next target is a_i, then the number of steps needed is (a_i - pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, if pos is 3 and target is 2, then the steps would be (n - pos + a_i) ?\n\nWait, for example, n=4. If current is 3, target is 2. Moving clockwise, you have to go 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let's see: 2 -3 is -1, mod 4 is 3. Yes. So the formula is (target - current) mod n? Wait, but when target is larger than current, like current is 1, target is 3. Then (3-1) = 2 steps. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n, but since in Python, modulo can return negative values, maybe not. Wait, in Python, (target - current) % n would give the correct value. Let me check.\n\nFor example, target=2, current=3, n=4. (2-3) is -1. -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, what if target is same as current? Then steps is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1.\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the steps needed to get from current to a_i: (a_i - current) % n. But wait, no. Wait, because if the current is 3 and a_i is 2, then (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes.\n\n   - Add that to the total time.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the steps between them is zero. So the code would handle that correctly.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of a_i's, and for each, compute the steps from current position to a_i, add to total, then update current position.\n\nBut let's test the example.\n\nFirst example: n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nInitial current is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: steps (3-1) mod 4 = 2 → add 2. Current becomes 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: steps (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod4=3 → add 3. Total is 5. Current becomes 2.\n\nThird task is 3: steps (3-2) mod4=1 → add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is input '4 3\\n2 3 3' → output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial current is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod4=1 → total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2)=1 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps 0 → total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read n and m, then read the list of a's.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read the first line as n, m. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, initialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nThen loop through each a_i in the list:\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    delta = (a - current) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current = a\n\nThen print total_time.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nWait, the problem says 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5. So n is at least 2. So no division by zero or anything.\n\nBut let's test another case. Suppose n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the steps are (1-1) mod 2 =0. So total is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Steps from 1 to 1 is 0. Then from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input. Let me think about the input format. The input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, there are two examples. Wait, the user provided two examples. But in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So for the first example, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich outputs 6.\n\nThe code should read from stdin. So in Python, we can read the first line as input().split(), then the second line as input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when there are multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and m. The second line contains m integers. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for illustration. The actual code should read one input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nCompute the total time as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    delta = (a - current) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but let's test the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a_list = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3. (3-1) mod4 is 2 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2. (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4=3 → total 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3. (3-2) mod4=1 → total 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: input 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod4=1 → total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2)=1 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: 0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if the a_i is 1, and current is 1? Then delta is 0. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about when the current is 4, and a_i is 1. Then (1-4) mod4 is -3 mod4 = 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1]. The total time is 0.\n\nCase 2: Tasks require moving around the ring multiple times. For example, n=5, m=2, a = [3, 1]. The first move is 3-1=2 steps. Then from 3 to 1: (1-3) mod5 is -2 mod5=3. So total is 2+3=5. Which is correct: 1→2→3 (steps 2), then 3→4→5→1 (3 steps).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where the movement wraps around. So the code seems to handle it.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code accordingly.\n",
