The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. How many steps? Well, since it's a ringroad, the distance between current position and target can be calculated as (target - current) mod n, but since movement is only clockwise, maybe it's (target - current) if target >= current, else (n - current + target). Wait, but for example, from 1 to 3 in a 4-house ringroad: 1→2→3 is two steps. Which is (3-1) = 2 steps. But if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + target) steps. For example, 3 to 2: 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3? Or maybe (target - current + n) % n? Let me think: (target - current) can be negative. So for current position c and target t, the number of steps is (t - c) if t >= c, else (t - c + n). Which can also be written as (t - c) % n if we take modulo n. But wait, if t is less than c, then (t - c) is negative. For example, t=2, c=3, n=4: (2-3) = -1, mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the steps between c and t is (t - c) mod n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nBut in the example, the first task is 3. Starting at 1, steps needed is (3-1) = 2 steps. Then, the next task is 2. Now, current position is 3. So steps from 3 to 2: (2 -3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 is 3. So 3 steps. Then the next task is 3. Current position is 2. Steps from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example. So that's how the calculation works.\n\nSo the approach is to track Xenia's current position, and for each task in order, compute the steps needed to get from current position to the target a_i, add that to the total time, and then update current position to a_i.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple tasks in the same house? Like, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house. Then the steps between them would be zero. So for example, if the tasks are [3,3], then the first move is from 1 to 3 (2 steps), then from 3 to 3 (0 steps). So total is 2 steps.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute steps from current_position to a_i (using (a_i - current_position) mod n if positive, else (a_i - current_position + n) ? Or just (a_i - current_position) % n ?\n\nWait, for example, when current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2 -3) = -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So steps between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, (target - current) could be negative. So using mod n ensures it's positive. So for each task, compute (a_i - current_position) mod n, add to total_time, then set current_position to a_i.\n\nWait, but why mod n? Because the minimal steps required. Because the ringroad is a circle. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each task, the time added is (a_i - current) % n. Then current becomes a_i.\n\nBut wait, let's test the first example:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2 → correct.\n\ncurrent is now 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3 → correct.\n\ncurrent is now 2.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1 → correct. Total 2+3+1=6.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, tasks [2,3,3].\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: (2-1) mod 4 is 1 → add 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1 → add 1. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0 → add 0. Total is 1+1+0=2 → which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that's the way to compute it.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n    delta = (a_i - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = a_i\n\nAt the end, print total.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because for each task, you have to move from your current position to the a_i, and the minimal steps is (a_i - current) mod n. Because the movement is clockwise.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=2, m=1, a_1=1. So initial position is 1. Steps needed is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. So first move from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Then from 2 to 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. Total is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nAnother case: n=5, current is 1, target is 1. Steps is 0.\n\nAnother case: current is 5, target is 1. (1-5) mod 5 is -4 mod5 = 1. Which is correct: moving clockwise from 5 to 1 is 1 step (since it's a ringroad, 5→1 is one step).\n\nYes. So the formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nLoop over each a in the list:\n\n    total += (a - current) % n\n\n    current = a\n\nPrint total.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results if the numerator is negative. Wait, no. Wait in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3. So (a - current) could be negative, but when modded by n, gives the correct positive steps.\n\nYes. So for example, (2 - 3) %4 is (-1) %4 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2 → total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3 → total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → total is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1 → total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3) mod4=0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these samples.\n\nNow, what about when the list has multiple same elements?\n\nLike, m=5, a = [1,1,1,1,1]. Then the total steps is 0, since all are same. But initial position is 1. So yes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a = [5, 1]. So steps:\n\nFirst step: (5-1) mod5 =4 → total 4. Then (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 =1. So total 4+1=5. Which is correct: moving from 1 to 5 (4 steps), then 5 to 1 (1 step).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead input: first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the input examples, the first input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] — but perhaps that's a way to represent multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains m integers a1...am.\n\nSo for each test case, the input is two lines. However, the sample input shows two different test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nOutput: 6\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nOutput: 2.\n\nSo the code needs to process one test case. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is two lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the user has given two test cases. But perhaps that's just for illustration. The actual code needs to read one test case. Because the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as per the problem's input format.\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nThen read the second line, split into m integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of a's.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor each ai in a:\n\n    total += (ai - current) % n\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation can be done as (ai - current) % n. But since ai and current are between 1 and n, inclusive, then (ai - current) can be between -(n-1) and n-1. But mod n will make it correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing for n=2, m=1, a=[1], the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code computes:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst ai=2: (2-1) mod2=1. total=1. current=2.\n\nSecond ai=1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2=1. total=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when m is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the problem statement, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. Wait, no: looking back, the input says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5). So m can be 1. So the code handles m=0? No, but the problem says m ≥1. So no problem.\n\nBut what if m is zero? Well, the problem says m is at least 1. So the code is okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe code processes:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2 → total 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4=3 → total 5.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod4=1 → total 6. Output 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod4=1 → total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod4=1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod4=0 → total 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. The code gives (5-1) mod5=4, then (1-5) mod5=1. Total 5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. Which is handled correctly, since if the current is same as the next a_i, the delta is zero.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between houses while adhering to the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time. Since the houses are arranged in a ring, movement is clockwise only.\n2. **Calculating Steps**: For each task, calculate the minimum steps required to move from Xenia's current position to the target house. This can be done using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Track Xenia's current position and accumulate the total time required for each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the steps required to move from the current house to the target house using `(target - current) % n`. This ensures that the movement is calculated correctly even when moving around the ringroad.\n4. **Update Position and Total Time**: After calculating the steps for each task, update the total time and the current position to the target house.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
