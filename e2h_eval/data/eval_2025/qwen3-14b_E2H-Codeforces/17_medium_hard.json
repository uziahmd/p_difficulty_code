He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nSo how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of some possible s. But since there are multiple possibilities, I need to find an assignment that works for at least one s.\n\nBut how do I find that s? Well, the correct s must have all the prefixes and suffixes provided. So maybe the approach is to try to reconstruct s based on the input strings, and then check which assignments are valid.\n\nBut how can I reconstruct s? Let's think: For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their combination gives the full string. Because the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So if I have those two, then combining them would give s. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then the full string would be P + last character of S. Or wait, the longest prefix is of length n-1. The longest suffix is also of length n-1. So the full string s is the prefix of length n-1 plus one character. But the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. So the first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1].\n\nSo if I have the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), then the full string s can be determined as follows: the first n-1 characters are the prefix, and the last n-1 characters are the suffix. Therefore, the first character of the suffix must be the second character of the prefix. So the full string s would be prefix + (last character of suffix). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the full string is s of length n. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s are the longest prefix. The last n-1 characters are the longest suffix. Therefore, the first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last character of the suffix is s[n-1]. The prefix ends at s[n-2], so the full string is prefix + [s[n-1]].\n\nBut the suffix starts at s[1], so the suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the prefix is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first character of the suffix is s[1], which is the second character of the prefix. So combining the prefix and suffix, the full string would be prefix[0] + suffix[0] + ... + suffix[n-2] ?\n\nWait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose the full string is ababa (as in the first example). The longest prefix is abab (length 4), the longest suffix is baba (length 4). The full string is ababa. So the prefix is abab (positions 0-3), the suffix is baba (positions 1-4). So combining the prefix (abab) and the suffix (baba), the full string is the prefix's first character (a) followed by the suffix (baba)? No, because that would be ababa, which is correct. Wait, the prefix is abab, and the suffix is baba. So the first character of the suffix is b, which is the second character of the prefix. So the full string is the prefix (abab) plus the last character of the suffix (a) — which is the same as the prefix's first character plus the suffix. Wait, the full string is prefix + [last character of suffix]? No, the prefix is length n-1, and the suffix is length n-1. The full string is of length n. So the first n-1 characters are the prefix. The last n-1 characters are the suffix. Therefore, the first character of the suffix is the second character of the prefix. Therefore, the full string is the prefix's first character, followed by the suffix. Because the prefix is of length n-1, and the suffix is of length n-1. So the full string is (prefix) + (suffix's last character). But the suffix's first character is the prefix's second character. So the full string is:\n\ns = prefix[0] + suffix[0] + suffix[1] ... suffix[n-2] ?\n\nBut the suffix is of length n-1. So the full string is prefix concatenated with the last character of the suffix. Wait, no. Because the prefix is length n-1, and the suffix is length n-1. The first n-1 characters are the prefix. The last n-1 characters are the suffix. Therefore, the full string is prefix[0...n-2] + suffix[-1], because the suffix's first character is the second character of the prefix. So for example, in the first example, prefix is abab (length 4) and suffix is baba (length 4). Then the full string is abab + a (the last character of the suffix) → ababa. Which is correct.\n\nSo, if I can find which of the input strings are the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), then I can combine them to get the full string s. Once I have s, I can check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of s. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that there are two strings of length n-1. So for each possible pair of those two strings, one as prefix and one as suffix, we can generate a candidate s. Then check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of that s. If so, then we can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find all strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible assignment of one as prefix and one as suffix:\n\n   a. Generate the candidate s by combining the prefix and the suffix's last character.\n\n   b. Check if the generated s is consistent with all the input strings (i.e., each input string is either a prefix or suffix of s).\n\n   c. If such a candidate s exists, then proceed to assign 'P' and 'S' to the input strings based on whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do I check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nOnce we have s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with that string) or a suffix (s ends with that string). However, note that some input strings may be both a prefix and suffix of s. For example, in the second sample input, the string is \"aaa\", so all input strings (like \"a\", \"aa\") are both prefixes and suffixes. However, in that case, the problem allows us to choose any assignment as long as the counts are correct.\n\nBut the problem requires that for the given assignment, there exists at least one s that is consistent. So even if multiple assignments are possible, we just need to find one that works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible candidate s (generated by taking the two strings of length n-1, trying them as prefix and suffix):\n\n   Check if all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nIf such a candidate exists, then proceed to assign the labels.\n\nOnce we have such an s, we can go through all the input strings and for each, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly. However, there might be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. In such cases, we can choose either 'P' or 'S' as needed, but we need to ensure that the total number of 'P's and 'S's is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, so total 2n-2 strings, with n-1 P and S each).\n\nWait, the output requires that the number of P's equals the number of S's. Since there are exactly 2n-2 strings, and each is either P or S. And since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, the count must be equal. So when generating the labels, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or suffix of s. So once we find an s that satisfies this, we can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how do I handle the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s? For example, in the sample input 2, the string is \"aaa\". All input strings are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"a\". So for each input string, it's both a prefix and a suffix. So in that case, we can assign any combination of P and S as long as the counts are correct.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer can be any valid one. So for the assignment, we can choose for each string to be P or S as long as the counts are correct. However, in our approach, when we generate the labels for the input strings, we have to make sure that for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So even if a string is both, we can choose to assign it as P or S.\n\nBut how do I decide which one to choose when there's ambiguity? For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but in the input, there are two instances of it. How do I assign them?\n\nBut the problem states that the answer can be any valid one. So perhaps for such cases, we can assign them as P or S as needed, but ensuring that the total number of P and S is correct.\n\nBut in practice, once we have the candidate s, we can process all the input strings and for each, check if it is a prefix or a suffix. Then, for each input string, we can mark it as P if it is a prefix, else S. However, if it is both, we can choose either. However, when building the output, we need to make sure that the counts are correct. For example, if there are two strings that are both prefix and suffix, but we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Well, since the candidate s is such that all input strings are either prefix or suffix, and the number of prefixes is exactly n-1 and suffixes exactly n-1, then the number of input strings that are prefixes (including those that are both) plus those that are suffixes (but not prefixes) must be exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. So when there's overlap, we need to choose for each overlapping string whether to count it as P or S such that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, in our approach, the candidate s is constructed from the two longest strings. Once we have that s, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or a suffix. Then, for the assignment, we can choose to assign it as P if it's a prefix, else S. However, if a string is both, then we need to decide which one to assign. But how?\n\nBut perhaps, when generating the candidate s, the input strings are all prefixes and suffixes of s. So for each input string, it must be a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each input string, it's either a prefix (possibly also a suffix) or a suffix (possibly also a prefix). So, during the assignment, for each input string, we can assign it as P if it is a prefix (regardless of whether it is also a suffix) and S otherwise. But this may lead to some cases where the counts are not correct. However, since the candidate s is valid, the total number of prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) must be exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. Therefore, the counts of P and S will automatically be correct.\n\nWait, no. Because each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. But for example, suppose a string is both a prefix and a suffix. Then, when we assign it as P, it contributes to the count of P, and when we assign it as S, it contributes to the count of S. However, the total number of P's must be exactly n-1, and S's exactly n-1. So if we have some strings that are both, we need to assign them in such a way that the counts balance.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? For example, suppose there are m strings that are both prefix and suffix. Then, when assigning them, we can choose how many to assign as P and how many as S. However, the total number of prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) must be n-1, and the same for suffixes.\n\nBut how can we know how many of these overlapping strings to assign as P or S?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the way the candidate s is built ensures that the counts are correct. For example, the candidate s has exactly n-1 prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1) and exactly n-1 suffixes. So for each input string, it is either a prefix (and possibly a suffix) or a suffix (and possibly a prefix). However, the total number of prefixes (counted as all the input strings that are prefixes of s) is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. Therefore, if we assign all input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) as P, and the rest as S, then the count of P will be exactly n-1, and S exactly n-1. Because the input strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s. So, for example, the number of input strings that are prefixes of s is exactly n-1 (since the original problem says that the input consists of all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s). Therefore, if we assign all input strings that are prefixes of s as P, and others as S, then the count will be correct.\n\nWait, but the input is all the prefixes and suffixes. So the input contains exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. However, some of them may be both. So the total number of unique strings may be less than 2n-2, but the problem says that the input has exactly 2n-2 strings. However, the input may contain duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input strings are a, aa, aa, a. So for the string \"aaa\", the prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 and 2 are a, aa, aa, a. So the input has four strings, which is 2*3-2=4. So in that case, the number of prefixes is 2 (for length 1 and 2), and suffixes is 2. But the input has duplicates. So when we check for each input string, whether it is a prefix or suffix of s, the count of prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1 (since the input is exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s). Therefore, the number of input strings that are prefixes of s is exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. But since some strings are both, the total number of input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is n-1. Therefore, if we assign all such input strings as P, then the count of P would be n-1, and the rest (which are suffixes but not prefixes) would be assigned S, which would be n-1. Therefore, this approach would work.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each possible candidate s (generated by trying the two strings of length n-1 as prefix and suffix):\n\n   Check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\n   If yes:\n\n      For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. Assign 'P' if yes, else 'S'.\n\n      Then, output the resulting string.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, we can proceed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n2. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\n3. For each possible permutation of these two (i.e., one as prefix, one as suffix):\n\n   a. Generate s_candidate as prefix + (suffix[-1]).\n\n   b. Check if the s_candidate is valid (i.e., the prefix is indeed the first n-1 characters of s_candidate, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s_candidate).\n\n   Wait, because the prefix is supposed to be the first n-1 characters of s_candidate, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters. So when we generate s_candidate as prefix + (suffix's last character), then the first n-1 characters are the prefix, and the last n-1 characters are the suffix. But how do we know that the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s_candidate?\n\nLet me think. The s_candidate is of length n. The prefix is of length n-1. The suffix is of length n-1. So the s_candidate is prefix concatenated with the last character of the suffix. Let me check:\n\ns_candidate = prefix + [suffix[-1]]\n\nThen, the last n-1 characters of s_candidate would be the suffix (of length n-1) ?\n\nNo. Because the suffix is of length n-1. The last n-1 characters of s_candidate would be the (n-1)th character (the last one) of the prefix plus the suffix's last character?\n\nWait, the s_candidate is of length n. Let's take the example where prefix is abab (length 4), suffix is baba (length 4). Then s_candidate is abab + a (the last character of the suffix) → ababa (length 5). The last 4 characters are baba, which is the suffix. So that works.\n\nIn general, the s_candidate is prefix (length n-1) + last character of suffix. So the last n-1 characters of s_candidate are (prefix[1:] + last_char_of_suffix). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe s_candidate is prefix (length n-1) + last_char_of_suffix. So the entire string is of length n. The last n-1 characters of s_candidate are:\n\ns_candidate[1:] → which is prefix[1:] + last_char_of_suffix. But the suffix is supposed to be the last n-1 characters of s_candidate. So the suffix should be equal to prefix[1:] + last_char_of_suffix. But the suffix is a string of length n-1. So for the suffix to be the last n-1 characters of s_candidate, the suffix must be equal to prefix[1:] + last_char_of_suffix. Which is the case only if the suffix is equal to prefix[1:] + last_char_of_suffix. But the suffix is given as one of the input strings. So when we generate s_candidate, we have to check that the suffix is indeed the last n-1 characters of s_candidate.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause the way we generate s_candidate is by taking the prefix and adding the last character of the suffix. Then, the last n-1 characters of s_candidate would be (prefix[1:] + suffix[-1]). So the suffix (the input string) must be equal to that. Otherwise, this combination is invalid.\n\nSo for example, if the suffix is not equal to prefix[1:] + suffix[-1], then the generated s_candidate would not have the suffix as its last n-1 characters. Therefore, this combination is invalid.\n\nSo, for the candidate s_candidate, we need to check that the suffix is indeed the last n-1 characters of s_candidate. How?\n\nWell, the suffix is supposed to be the last n-1 characters of s_candidate. So:\n\nsuffix == s_candidate[1:]\n\nBecause s_candidate is of length n. s_candidate[1:] is the substring starting from index 1 to end, which is length n-1. So yes.\n\nSo, when generating s_candidate as prefix + suffix[-1], the last n-1 characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[1:] = prefix[1:] + suffix[-1]. Therefore, for the suffix to be valid, it must be equal to this.\n\nThus, for the candidate s_candidate, we must check that the suffix is equal to s_candidate[1:].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate) among the two length n-1 strings:\n\n   s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n\n   if s_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate:\n\n       then proceed to check if all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nSo, this is an important check. Because even if you take the two length n-1 strings as prefix and suffix, the generated s_candidate may not have the suffix as its last n-1 characters. So this check is necessary.\n\nOnce that is done, then we can proceed to check all input strings against s_candidate.\n\nOnce we find such a valid s_candidate, then we can generate the output as follows:\n\nfor each input string in the original list:\n\n   if it is a prefix of s_candidate → assign 'P'\n\n   else → assign 'S'\n\nBut how to check if it's a prefix? Well, for a string t, check if s_candidate starts with t. Similarly for suffix.\n\nOnce we have that, then the output is generated.\n\nNow, the problem is to find such a candidate s_candidate. Because there may be multiple possibilities, but we need to find any one that works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input.\n\nCollect all the input strings.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1.\n\nFor each possible permutation (there are two possibilities: first as prefix, second as suffix, or vice versa):\n\n   generate s_candidate as prefix + suffix[-1]\n\n   check if the suffix is s_candidate[1:]\n\n   if yes:\n\n       check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n       if yes:\n\n           generate the output string as per the assignment.\n\n           return this output.\n\nIf none of the permutations work, then what? But the problem statement says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., there exists at least one string s that is consistent with the given input. Therefore, there must be at least one valid candidate.\n\nBut perhaps there are multiple candidates. So the code needs to check all possibilities until it finds one that works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read n, then read the 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. Let's say there are exactly two of them. Let's call them candidates = [s1, s2].\n\nThen, for each possible assignment of which is prefix and which is suffix:\n\nfor prefix_candidate in candidates:\n\n   for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n\n       if prefix_candidate is not suffix_candidate:\n\n           generate s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n\n           check if s_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate.\n\n           if yes:\n\n               then check all other input strings.\n\n               for each string in strings:\n\n                   check if it is a prefix of s_candidate or a suffix.\n\n               if all are either:\n\n                   then generate the output.\n\nSo, but since there are two candidates, there are two possibilities: (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix) and (s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix).\n\nWait, but for the two candidates, we need to check both possibilities. For example, for the two candidates, s1 and s2, we can try (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix) and (s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix).\n\nOnce we find one that works, proceed.\n\nOnce that is done, then generate the output.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is found, then for each input string in the original list, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate, and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate?\n\nFor example, for a given input string t, check if t == s_candidate[:len(t)] (prefix) or t == s_candidate[-len(t):] (suffix).\n\nOnce that is done, then assign 'P' if it's a prefix, else 'S'.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? Then, it can be assigned as P or S. However, the code will assign it as P, since the check is first for prefix.\n\nBut this may lead to a situation where the total number of P's and S's is not correct. However, earlier reasoning suggests that this is not a problem. Because the input strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, so the number of input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. Therefore, when we assign all prefixes as P and others as S, the counts will be correct.\n\nWait, but the input strings include all prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. However, in the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, it's possible that it's counted in both. But the input has exactly two strings for each length. So the code must have exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. However, when the input includes duplicates (like in the second example), the code must assign them correctly.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So when we generate the candidate s_candidate, the input strings must be exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. Therefore, the number of input strings that are prefixes of s_candidate is exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. However, some of them may be both. But when we assign all prefixes as P, the count will be exactly n-1, and the rest will be S, which is exactly n-1.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. For example, the first line is n, then 2n-2 lines.\n\nThen, collect the list of strings.\n\nThen, collect the two candidates of length n-1.\n\nOnce that is done, loop through the two possibilities for prefix and suffix.\n\nFor each possibility, generate s_candidate, check if the suffix is s_candidate[1:], then check all input strings.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, generate the output.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read 2n-2 strings. For example:\n\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\nThen, collect the candidates:\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThen, for each possible permutation of the two candidates as prefix and suffix.\n\nBut since there are two candidates, we can loop through all possible permutations (two possibilities):\n\nfor prefix, suffix in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n\n   generate s_candidate = prefix + suffix[-1]\n\n   check if s_candidate[1:] == suffix. If yes:\n\n       then check for all strings in the list if they are prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\n       if yes:\n\n           generate the output.\n\n           print the output string.\n\n           exit.\n\nOnce this is done, return the output.\n\nNow, the checking for all strings:\n\ndef is_valid(s_candidate, strings):\n\n    for t in strings:\n\n        is_prefix = (s_candidate.startswith(t))\n\n        is_suffix = (s_candidate.endswith(t))\n\n        if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut wait, this function returns True if all strings are either prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then proceed to generate the output.\n\nNow, generating the output:\n\noutput = []\n\nfor t in strings:\n\n    if s_candidate.startswith(t):\n\n        output.append('P')\n\n    else:\n\n        output.append('S')\n\nreturn ''.join(output)\n\nBut this may assign some strings as 'S' even if they are both prefix and suffix. However, since the code checks that all are either, and the count is correct, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe candidates are the two strings of length 4 (n-1 = 4). Looking at the input, the strings are:\n\nLooking at the input, the 2n-2 = 8 strings. The input is:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nSo the strings of length 4 are 'abab' (length 4?), let's check:\n\nn is 5. So n-1 is 4. So the strings of length 4 are:\n\nLooking at the input:\n\n\"abab\" (length 4), \"baba\" (length 4). Are there others? Let's check:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\n\"ba\" (length 2), \"a\" (1), \"abab\" (4), \"a\" (1), \"aba\" (3), \"baba\" (4), \"ab\" (2), \"aba\" (3). So yes, two strings of length 4: 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nSo candidates = ['abab', 'baba'].\n\nTrying the first permutation: prefix = 'abab', suffix = 'baba'.\n\ns_candidate = 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'.\n\nCheck if s_candidate[1:] is 'baba'? s_candidate is 'ababa', so [1:] is 'baba', which is equal to the suffix. So yes.\n\nNow, check all input strings against 'ababa'.\n\nCheck each of the input strings:\n\n\"ba\": is it a prefix or suffix of 'ababa'?\n\nprefix: 'ababa' starts with 'ba'? No. The first two letters are 'ab'. So no. Suffix: does 'ababa' end with 'ba'? The last two letters are 'ba'. Yes. So yes.\n\n\"a\": starts with 'a' → yes. Also ends with 'a'.\n\n\"abab\": length 4. 'ababa' starts with 'abab'? Yes. So yes.\n\n\"a\": same as before.\n\n\"aba\": starts with 'aba'? Yes. Ends with 'aba'? The last three letters are 'aba' (positions 2-4). Yes.\n\n\"baba\": check if it is a prefix or suffix. 'ababa' starts with 'baba'? No. Ends with 'baba'? The last four letters are 'baba' → yes. So yes.\n\n\"ab\": starts with 'ab'? Yes. Ends with 'ab'? The last two letters are 'ba', so no. So yes.\n\n\"aba\": same as before.\n\nSo all input strings are either prefix or suffix. So this candidate is valid.\n\nThen, the output is generated by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix of 'ababa'.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput strings:\n\n1. 'ba' → is it a prefix? No. So 'S'.\n\n2. 'a' → yes (prefix). 'P'.\n\n3. 'abab' → prefix. 'P'.\n\n4. 'a' → prefix. 'P'.\n\n5. 'aba' → prefix. 'P'.\n\n6. 'baba' → not a prefix. Check if it's a suffix. Yes. So 'S'.\n\n7. 'ab' → prefix. 'P'.\n\n8. 'aba' → prefix. 'P'.\n\nSo the output would be S P P P P S P P → which is SPPPPSP P? Wait, the sample output for the first case is 'SPPSPSPS'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the sample input for the first case is:\n\nThe input is:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nWhich is 8 strings. The output is 'SPPSPSPS'.\n\nBut according to my previous analysis, the code would assign 'P' to all strings that are prefixes. Let's check each string in order.\n\nOriginal input strings:\n\n1. 'ba' → is it a prefix of 'ababa'? No. So 'S'.\n\n2. 'a' → yes → 'P'.\n\n3. 'abab' → yes → 'P'.\n\n4. 'a' → yes → 'P'.\n\n5. 'aba' → yes → 'P'.\n\n6. 'baba' → not a prefix. Is it a suffix? Yes. So 'S'.\n\n7. 'ab' → yes → 'P'.\n\n8. 'aba' → yes → 'P'.\n\nSo the output would be S P P P P S P P → SPPPPSPP. Which is not matching the sample output of SPPSPSPS.\n\nHmm. So there's a discrepancy here. What's wrong?\n\nWait the sample output is 'SPPSPSPS' which is 8 characters. Let me count:\n\nSample output for first input is S P P S P S P S.\n\nSo in this case, the code's approach would not generate this. But why?\n\nAh! Because the code assigns 'P' to all input strings that are prefixes of s_candidate. However, some of the input strings may be both prefix and suffix, but in the sample output, some of them are assigned as S. So why?\n\nBecause the code's approach of assigning 'P' if it's a prefix may not be the only way. However, the problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the only possible string is 'ababa'. The sample output is SPPSPSPS. Let's see what that implies for each input string.\n\nLet's look at the input strings in order:\n\nInput order:\n\n1. ba → S\n\n2. a → P\n\n3. abab → P\n\n4. a → S ?\n\nWait, the sample output is S P P S P S P S.\n\nLet me check each input string:\n\nOriginal input strings:\n\nInput strings in order:\n\n1. 'ba' → S\n\n2. 'a' → P\n\n3. 'abab' → P\n\n4. 'a' → S\n\n5. 'aba' → P\n\n6. 'baba' → S\n\n7. 'ab' → P\n\n8. 'aba' → S\n\nSo for the fourth input string (a), which is a prefix of 'ababa' (yes), but in the sample output, it is assigned S. How is that possible?\n\nAh, because the code's approach of assigning P if it's a prefix is not the only valid way. The problem allows any assignment that is consistent with some s. So in this case, the code's approach would generate a different output, but the sample output is another valid one.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any valid output is acceptable. So why does the code's approach not generate the sample output?\n\nBecause the code's approach chooses to assign 'P' whenever the string is a prefix, but the sample output has some strings that are prefixes assigned as 'S'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code can output any valid assignment. So why does the sample output have that?\n\nBecause there are multiple valid assignments. For example, the sample explanation says that the only possible string is 'ababa', but the output can be any that is consistent with that string. So the code's approach may generate a different output than the sample, but it's still valid.\n\nBut in the first sample, the code's approach would generate SPPPPSPP. However, the sample output is SPPSPSPS. Both are valid. However, the code's approach may not pass the sample test case if the judge expects a particular output. But the problem says that any valid output is acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the code's approach would generate a different output than the sample. So why is that?\n\nBecause the code's approach may not be considering all possibilities. For example, the code assigns 'P' to all prefixes, but there may be multiple ways to assign the labels as long as the counts are correct.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is not sufficient. For example, in the first sample, the code's approach would generate an output where the fourth 'a' is assigned 'P', but in the sample output, it's assigned 'S'. However, this is allowed, as long as the counts are correct.\n\nBut how can the code's approach generate a valid output?\n\nBecause the code's approach assigns 'P' to all prefixes. The number of 'P's would be the number of input strings that are prefixes of s_candidate, which is exactly n-1 = 4. Let's count in the first sample:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\nFor s_candidate 'ababa', the prefixes are:\n\nAll strings that are prefixes of 'ababa' (length 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nThe prefixes of 'ababa' are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'ab'\n\nlength 3: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nSo the input strings that are prefixes are:\n\n- 'a' (appears twice)\n\n- 'ab' (once)\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidates**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Generate Candidate String**: For each permutation of these two candidates (one as prefix, one as suffix), generate a candidate string `s_candidate` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n3. **Validation**: Check if the generated candidate string `s_candidate` is valid by ensuring that the suffix part matches the last `n-1` characters of `s_candidate`.\n4. **Check Consistency**: Verify that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s_candidate`.\n5. **Generate Output**: If a valid candidate string is found, assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether each input string is a prefix or suffix of `s_candidate`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Find the two candidates of length n-1\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nfound = False\nfor prefix in candidates:\n    for suffix in candidates:\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            continue\n        # Generate s_candidate\n        s_candidate = prefix + suffix[-1]\n        # Check if the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s_candidate\n        if s_candidate[1:] == suffix:\n            # Now check all input strings\n            valid = True\n            for t in strings:\n                is_prefix = s_candidate.startswith(t)\n                is_suffix = s_candidate.endswith(t)\n                if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Generate the output\n                output = []\n                for t in strings:\n                    if s_candidate.startswith(t):\n                        output.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        output.append('S')\n                print(''.join(output))\n                found = True\n                break\n    if found:\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list of strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Generating Candidate String**: For each permutation of the candidates, a potential string `s_candidate` is generated by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n4. **Validation Check**: The generated candidate string is validated to ensure it meets the criteria for both the prefix and suffix.\n5. **Consistency Check**: Each input string is checked to see if it is either a prefix or suffix of the candidate string.\n6. **Output Generation**: Once a valid candidate string is found, the result is generated by assigning 'P' or 'S' based on whether each input string is a prefix or suffix of the candidate string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine a valid configuration of prefixes and suffixes for the unknown string `s`, leveraging the properties of prefixes and suffixes to validate and construct the solution.",
