Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position divided by two would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, we can't easily check consecutive pairs. \n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. The required d for this part is (first lantern's position - 0)/2. Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach from 0 to the first lantern's position. Wait, no. Wait, if the first lantern is at position a, then the coverage extends from a - d to a + d. But since the street starts at 0, the leftmost part is 0. So to cover from 0 up to a + d. But if the lantern's coverage must include 0, then the distance from 0 to a must be <= d. Because the lantern's coverage is up to d away. So for example, if the first lantern is at position a, then the leftmost point that needs to be covered is 0. The distance from the lantern to 0 is a. So d must be at least a. But wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is a radius d. So the lantern at a can cover from a -d to a +d. So to cover 0, we need that a -d ≤ 0 ≤ a +d. Since a is positive, the left side is a -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. But that would mean that the left end is covered. But if the lantern is at a, then the distance from 0 to a is a. So the radius must be at least a. But then, the coverage would be from a -d to a +d. If d is a, then that's from 0 to 2a. So that covers 0. But maybe there's a better way. Wait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the radius must be at least 3 to cover 0. But that would make the coverage from 0 to 6. But if the next lantern is at 5, then the gap between them is 2 units. The middle of that gap is at 4, which is 1 unit away from 3 and 1 unit away from 5. So the required d for that gap is 1. But the initial part requires d to be 3. So the maximum of those would be 3. \n\nBut wait, maybe the first lantern is not at 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a1. Then, the required d for that part is a1. Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. Similarly, for the end of the street. If the last lantern is at position a_n, then the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So the required d for that part is l - a_n. \n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is between two consecutive positions. Let's say two lanterns are at positions a and b (sorted), then the gap between them is b - a. The middle of that gap is at (a + b)/2. The distance from this middle point to either lantern is (b -a)/2. So the required d for this gap is (b -a)/2. \n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum between the initial part (distance from 0 to first lantern), the end part (distance from last lantern to l), and the maximum of (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance: first_lantern = a[0], so initial_d = first_lantern - 0.0. But wait, no. Wait, the initial part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the distance is a[0]. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the radius needs to be at least a[0], because the distance between 0 and the lantern is a[0], and the radius has to cover that. So the required d for that part is a[0].\n\nWait, but if the lantern is at position 0, then the initial distance is zero. So that part doesn't contribute anything. \n\nSimilarly, for the end part. If the last lantern is at position a[-1], then the distance from that lantern to l is l - a[-1]. So the required d for that part is l - a[-1].\n\nThen between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (current - previous). For each pair, compute the gap, divide by two, and take the maximum.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- initial_d (a[0])\n- end_d (l - a[-1])\n- max_gap / 2 (for all consecutive pairs)\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nInitial_d is 0 (since first lantern is at 0). End_d is 15 -15=0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 =3 → 3/2 =1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 →1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 5\n\nlanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. \n\ninitial_d is 2 (distance from 0 to 2). end_d is 5 -5 =0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: if there's only one lantern. For example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial_d is 5, end_d is 5. The max between them is 5. So d is 5. Which makes sense because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (radius 5).\n\nAnother test case: lanterns are at 0 and 10, l=10. Then the initial_d is 0, end_d is 0. The gap between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So the answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0 and 3, l=5. Then initial_d is 0, end_d is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2. So the answer is 2.0.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute initial_d as a[0] (but wait, no, a[0] is the first lantern's position. So the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], so initial_d is a[0]. But if the first lantern is at 0, then initial_d is zero. Similarly for end_d.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial_d = a[0]\n\nend_d = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nthen, the required d is the maximum between initial_d, end_d, and (max_gap / 2)\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? Then, the max_gap is zero, but the initial and end_d are considered. For example, n=1, a = [5], l=10. Then initial_d is 5, end_d is 5. So the max between 5, 5, 0/2=0 → 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code-wise, that seems manageable.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and l. The second line is n integers. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich after reading, the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Then sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo code steps in Python:\n\nRead n and l from input. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, the input may have multiple lines. So for example, in the first sample input, the first line is '7 15', the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So the code can read the first line as n, l, then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'] — but that's probably for testing purposes. So the actual code should read from stdin.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nThen read the second line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines. For example, when the second line is split into multiple lines? Probably not. The problem says that the next line contains n integers. So in code, read the first line, split into n and l. Then read the next line, split into list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, for reading from stdin, perhaps using input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when the input is given with multiple lines, but for code submission, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list a has exactly n elements. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce we have a, sort it.\n\nThen compute initial_d = a[0], end_d = l - a[-1], and max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nThen compute the maximum between initial_d, end_d, and max_gap / 2.\n\nBut wait, the initial_d is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So the required d for that is a[0], because the lantern's radius must cover from 0 to a[0] + d. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern is at a[0]. The radius d must be such that 0 is within the coverage. So the distance from the lantern to 0 is a[0], so d must be >= a[0]. Because the lantern's coverage is a radius d. So the leftmost point covered by the lantern is a[0] - d. To cover 0, a[0] -d <=0 → d >= a[0]. So the required d is at least a[0].\n\nSimilarly for the end. The last lantern is at a[-1]. The right end of the street is l. The distance from the lantern to l is l - a[-1]. So d must be >= l - a[-1].\n\nSo the initial_d is a[0], end_d is l - a[-1].\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter sorting a:\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nThen, the required d is max( a[0], l - a[-1], max_gap / 2 )\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo, for example, when n is 1, then the max_gap is 0, so the code will take max( a[0], l - a[0], 0 ). Which is correct.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial_d = a[0]\n\nend_d = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    current gap is a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if that's larger than max_gap, update.\n\nthen compute the maximum between initial_d, end_d, and max_gap / 2.\n\nThen output that maximum with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the initial_d is 0, end_d is 0, and max_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14). So 5/2 is 2.5, which is the answer.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for example, when n is 1, then the loop for i in 1..n-1 is not executed. So max_gap remains 0.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\ninitial_d = a[0]\n\nend_d = l - a[-1]\n\nrequired_d = max(initial_d, end_d, max_gap / 2)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(required_d))\n\nWait, but what if the max_gap is zero? Like when all lanterns are at same position. For example, n=2, l=5, a=[3,3]. Then max_gap is 0. So required_d is max(3, 5-3=2, 0) → 3. Which is correct. Because the first lantern is at 3, so the initial_d is 3. The end_d is 2. The max_gap is 0. So the required d is 3. Which would cover from 3 -3 =0 to 3+3=6. So the entire street (length 5) is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then initial_d is 0, end_d is 0, max_gap is 5. So required_d is 5/2 = 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is 2.5 away from each lantern.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the list [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The max_gap is 14 -9 =5. So 5/2=2.5. initial_d is 0, end_d is 0. So required_d is 2.5. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5, list [2,5]. sorted [2,5]. initial_d is 2, end_d is 0. max_gap is 3. 3/2=1.5. max(2, 0, 1.5) is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial_d is 5, end_d is 5. max_gap is 0. required_d is max(5,5,0) →5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. max_gap is 5 (between 0 and 5, and between 5 and 10). So max_gap /2 is 2.5. initial_d is 0, end_d is 0. So required_d is 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle between 0 and 5 is 2.5, and between 5 and 10 is 2.5. So the maximum is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. initial_d is 0, end_d is 0. max_gap is 3-0=3 (gap between 0 and 3) and 10-3=7. So the max_gap is 7. 7/2=3.5. So required_d is 3.5. Because the gap between 3 and 10 is 7, so the middle is at 3 + 3.5 = 6.5. Which is 3.5 away from 3 and 3.5 away from 10. So the required d is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to print the required_d with 10 decimal digits. So in Python, formatting with .10f.\n\nBut what about when the required_d is an integer? Like in the second sample, 2.0. The code outputs 2.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut need to make sure that when n is 1, the code works. Also, when the lanterns are at the ends.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=0. But according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then initial_d is 0, end_d is 1-0=1. So required_d is 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nNow, write the code in Python.\n\nWait, but in the code, when n is 1, the for loop runs from 1 to n-1, which is 1 to 0, which is not executed. So max_gap remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\nmax_gap = 0\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    if gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = gap\ninitial_d = a[0]\nend_d = l - a[-1]\nrequired_d = max(initial_d, end_d, max_gap / 2)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(required_d))\n\nBut wait, what if the initial_d is zero? Like when the first lantern is at 0. Then initial_d is zero, which is correct. Because the lantern covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. So for d=0, it covers 0. But if the next lantern is at 5, then the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, so max_gap is 5. So required_d is max(0, ... , 5/2=2.5). Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
