Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we have to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be checked properly. For example, if lanterns are at positions 5, 3, then after sorting they are 3,5. The gap between them is 2, so the maximum required d for that gap would be 1 (since each lantern covers up to d distance. So between 3 and 5, the middle point is 4, which is 1 unit away from both. So the maximum required d for that gap is (5-3)/2 = 1.)\n\n2. After sorting, check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position. The required d for that is (a[0] - 0) because the lantern's light has to reach the start of the street. Wait, no. Suppose the first lantern is at position a. Then the distance from 0 to a is a. But the lantern's light can cover up to d. So to cover 0, the lantern must be within d distance. So the maximum distance between 0 and the first lantern is a[0]. So d must be at least a[0]. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the last lantern is at position a[-1], then the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance between them is a[i+1] - a[i]. The worst case is the middle point between them. So the required d for that gap is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Because the middle point is (a[i] + a[i+1])/2. The distance from that point to either lantern is half the gap. So the maximum d needed for that gap is half the gap.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- the last lantern's distance from l (if it's not at l)\n- the maximum of (gap/2) between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCheck the first position. If it's not zero, then the initial d is that value. Similarly for the last position.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference, divide by two, and check if that's larger than the current maximum.\n\nThe maximum of all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the lantern is at some position a. Then the distance from 0 to a is a, and from a to l is l -a. The maximum of these two is the required d. Because the lantern's coverage has to reach both ends.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. \n\nThen:\n\nFirst lantern is at 0, so no problem there. Last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street. So the end part is zero.\n\nNow check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n2 5\n\npositions 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5].\n\nFirst lantern is at 2. So the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end. So the end distance is zero. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3. Divided by two is 1.5. So maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo yes, the approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nInitialize max_d to zero.\n\nCheck the first element. If a[0] > 0, then the initial max_d is a[0]. Similarly for the last element: if a[-1] < l, then the max_d is max(current max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if there are zero lanterns? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase when n=1, l= something. For example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the max_d is max(5, 5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the gap between them is 10, so required is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 5]. Then the first part is 0, the last part is 5. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5, so required is 2.5. The max between 5 and 2.5 is 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct because the second lantern is at 5, so the end of the street is 10. The distance from 5 to 10 is 5. So the d must be 5.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Then next line is list of a_i.\n\nBut note that in the input examples, the first input is given as a string like '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', but in actual code, the input is read from stdin. So for the code, we can read the first line as n, l. Then the second line as list of integers.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and l from input. Then read the next line as list of a_i.\n\nThen sort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first element: if a[0] != 0, then the initial max_d is a[0]. Similarly for the last element.\n\nWait, but for example, if the first element is 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is zero. So no problem. So the initial max_d is 0. Then, for the last element, if it's l, then the distance is zero. Else, l - a[-1].\n\nSo code steps:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nif a[-1] < l:\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nthen for each consecutive pair in the sorted list:\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nBut in Python, we need to read the input correctly.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nIn Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, for multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l, the second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the example shows two different inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So the code should handle a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and l, the second line has the list of a_i. So the code should read that.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. However, the user probably expects that the code reads one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input shows two test cases, but the problem says that the code should process one input. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the input will be given as follows\" and gives examples. But in the problem, the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. But maybe that's for the example. For example, in the sample input, the first input is for the first test case, and the second is for the second test case. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... \n\nSo the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's part of the example. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSample Output:\n\n2.5...\n\nThen another sample input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput: 2.0...\n\nBut in programming competition problems, the code is supposed to process exactly one test case. So perhaps the sample input shows two separate test cases. But the code should read one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code is written for one test case.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead first line as n, l.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nThen compute the max_d as discussed.\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to handle possible leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nOnce sorted, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif sorted_a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = sorted_a[0]\n\nif sorted_a[-1] < l:\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - sorted_a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_a)-1):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i+1] - sorted_a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsorted_a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nsorted_a[0] is 0, so no change. sorted_a[-1] is 15, which equals l=15. So no change. Then check the gaps:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: gap is 3 → 1.5. Current max_d is 0 → becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 3-5: 2 → 1.0. No change. Then 5-7: 2 → 1.0. No change. Then 7-9: 2 → 1.0. Then 9-14: 5 → 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Then 14-15: 1 → 0.5. So the final max_d is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5. a is [2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. \n\nsorted_a[0] is 2. So max_d is 2.0. sorted_a[-1] is 5, which is l. So no change. Then check the gap between 2 and 5: 3 → 1.5. So max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then sorted_a is [5]. sorted_a[0] is 5. So max_d is 5.0. sorted_a[-1] is 5 < 10 → l - a[-1] is 5. So max_d is max(5,5) =5. Then no gaps. So output 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then sorted_a is [0,10]. First check: a[0] is 0. Then a[-1] is 10. So no changes. The gap is 10, divided by 2 → 5. So max_d is 5.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the gaps are 5 and 5. Each divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then the first part is 0. The last part is 0. The gaps are 3-0=3 → 1.5, and 10-3=7 → 3.5. So the max is 3.5. Which would be the answer. So the code would output 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for the print statement, we need to format it with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, for example, 2.5, it would be printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut in Python, when using floating points, there might be precision issues. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating point calculations should be okay.\n\nBut in Python, the division is done as floating point.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l, then the list.\n\nBut what if the list has multiple elements, but after sorting, the first element is 0 and the last is l. Then the code checks the gaps between the lanterns. For example, if the lanterns are at 0 and l, then the gap is l - 0. So the required d is (l)/2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code should be as follows.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a segment of the street within a radius `d` from its position. Our task is to find the smallest possible `d` such that the entire street is illuminated.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are potential candidates for the radius `d`.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as the worst-case scenario is the midpoint between two consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern's distance from 0\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = a[0]\n    \n    # Check the last lantern's distance from l\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Checks**: The initial checks ensure that the start and end of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination radius.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions of the lanterns, we calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns and determine the required radius to cover these gaps. The maximum of all these values gives the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required by considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street. The complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it efficient even for the upper constraint of `n = 1000`.",
