He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must satisfy certain conditions. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because A added some 'a's (so at least one), B added some 'b's (so at least one), and C added some 'c's (so at least one). So if the input string doesn't have all three, it's automatically a 'NO'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when C appends the 'c's, the count of 'c's equals the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before adding the 'c's. Wait, no: the problem says that the number of 'c's he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. Wait, the string at that point is the original string (with a's and b's) plus the c's. Or is it?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. The number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. So the string before appending the 'c's is the one that has the a's and b's. Because when C appends the 'c's, the count of 'c's added is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in the string before adding the c's. Because the 'c's are added after the a's and b's.\n\nSo the final string has:\n\ncount_a (original a's) + count_b (original b's) + count_c (added c's) = total length.\n\nBut the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). Because when C appends the c's, the existing a's and b's are the ones from A and B's steps. So, for example, if the original string before adding c's had 3 a's and 2 b's, then the number of c's added would be either 3 or 2. So the final string would have count_c = 3 or 2.\n\nSo, the steps for checking the input string S:\n\n1. Check that S contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these is missing, return NO.\n\n2. Then, the string must be composed of a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. Because A added a's first, then B added b's, then C added c's. So the order must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. Otherwise, the order is wrong. For example, if the string is 'abbaacc', that's invalid because the b's are not all after the a's, and the c's are not all after the b's.\n\nWait, but what about if the string is something like 'aabbc'? That's okay. But if the string has a 'c' in the middle, like 'abcb', then that's invalid. So the entire string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo step 2: check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the order must be correct. So, for example, in the sample input 'bbacc' is invalid because the order is 'b's followed by 'a's, which is not allowed. Because A's string was only a's, then B added b's. So the original string before adding c's was a's followed by b's. So the entire string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So any deviation from this order is invalid.\n\nSo first, check that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo how to check that? We can check that all a's come before any b's, and all b's come before any c's. So for example, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, for the string, we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The operations are as follows:\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's to the end of the string.\n3. C appends some number of 'c's to the end of the string, where the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must be in the form of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Count of 'c'**: The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string before the 'c's were added. This means the count of 'c's should match the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string excluding the 'c's themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    # Check presence of a, b, c\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check the order: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # Check that there are no a's after the first occurrence of b\n    # Check that there are no a's or b's after the first occurrence of c\n    a_seen = False\n    b_seen = False\n    c_seen = False\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if b_seen or c_seen:\n                return \"NO\"\n            a_seen = True\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if c_seen:\n                return \"NO\"\n            b_seen = True\n        elif char == 'c':\n            c_seen = True\n    \n    # Now check the counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # The count of c must be equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(check_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Presence Check**: The function first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these are missing, it returns \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The function then ensures that all 'a's come before any 'b's and all 'b's come before any 'c's. This is done by tracking when each character is first encountered and ensuring no subsequent characters violate the order.\n3. **Count Check**: Finally, the function checks if the count of 'c's matches the count of 'a's or 'b's. If it does, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints of the problem are checked efficiently, leading to an optimal solution.",
