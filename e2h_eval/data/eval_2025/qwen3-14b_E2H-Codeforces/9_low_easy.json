Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nFirst, since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think about grouping all items by their weight. For each weight group, I can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, I can precompute the prefix sums so that for any number of items taken from that group, I can quickly get the total cost.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, if I take k items, the total cost is the sum of the top k items. Same for weights 2 and 3.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, the problem becomes how to select the number of items from each weight group such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's say I have:\n\n- count_1 items of weight 1, sorted by cost descending.\n- count_2 items of weight 2, same.\n- count_3 items of weight 3, same.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken, I can compute how many weight 1 and 2 items can be taken with the remaining weight. But even that might be tricky. Alternatively, since there are three weight types, perhaps I can iterate over one of them and compute the optimal for the other two.\n\nBut considering that for each weight group, the maximum number of items possible is m divided by the weight. For example, for weight 3, the maximum possible is m//3. However, since m can be up to 3e5, iterating through all possibilities for each group might be feasible.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to iterate through the number of weight 3 items taken, then for the remaining weight, decide how to optimally take weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), maybe we can use a dynamic programming approach optimized for these weights.\n\nWait, but the standard knapsack DP would be O(m) time. However, with m up to 3e5, that's manageable? Let's think: for each item, we process it and update the DP. But with n up to 1e5, that would be O(nm) which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that's not going to work. So we need a better approach.\n\nLet me think again. Since the items have weights 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can process each group separately. For example, for each weight group, we can take as many as possible, but in a way that allows us to combine them optimally.\n\nAnother idea: for each weight group, we can precompute the best possible value for taking k items. Then, the problem reduces to selecting a combination of k1 items from weight 1, k2 from weight 2, k3 from weight 3 such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 ≤ m, and the sum of their values is maximum.\n\nBut how to find this combination efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges for k3. Suppose we have all the items sorted for each weight. For each possible k3 (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the remaining weight, and then find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThe maximum possible k3 is min( (m)//3, count_3 ). So for each possible k3 (up to around 1e5?), we can compute the remaining weight, then compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items given a certain remaining capacity?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*k3. Now, we need to choose some number of weight 1 and 2 items. How can we do this optimally?\n\nFor this, we can precompute for weight 1 and 2 items the best possible values for any given capacity. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have for weight 1 items, a list of prefix sums (sum1), and for weight 2 items, a list of prefix sums (sum2). Now, for a given rem, we can try to take x weight 2 items and y weight 1 items such that 2x + y ≤ rem",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we leverage the fact that each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3. This allows us to use optimized strategies for each weight group and combine them in a way that avoids the high complexity of a general knapsack solution.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Overview:\n\n1. **Group by Weight**: Separate souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, 3).\n2. **Sort and Precompute Prefix Sums**:\n   - Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n   - Compute prefix sums for each group so that we can quickly determine the maximum cost for taking any number of items from that group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Numbers of Weight 3 Items**:\n   - For each possible number of weight 3 items taken (up to the maximum allowed), calculate the remaining capacity.\n   - Use a two-pointer approach to find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fits within the remaining capacity.\n4. **Maximize Total Cost**: Track the maximum total cost across all combinations of weight 3, 2, and 1 items.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(data[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ci = int(data[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order of cost\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    sum1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        sum1.append(sum1[-1] + c)\n    \n    sum2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        sum2.append(sum2[-1] + c)\n    \n    sum3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        sum3.append(sum3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_cost = 0\n    len3 = len(sum3) - 1\n    # Try all possible numbers of weight 3 items\n    for k3 in range(len3 + 1):\n        weight_used = 3 * k3\n        if weight_used > m:\n            continue\n        rem = m - weight_used\n        \n        # Now find best combination of weight 1 and 2 items in rem weight\n        # Using two pointers\n        i = len(sum2) - 1\n        j = len(sum1) - 1\n        best = 0\n        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n            weight = 2 * i + j\n            if weight <= rem:\n                best = max(best, sum2[i+1] + sum1[j+1])\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                i -= 1\n        # Also check the cases where only weight 1 or 2 is used\n        # Max weight 1 items\n        max1 = min(rem, len(sum1)-1)\n        best = max(best, sum1[max1+1])\n        # Max weight 2 items\n        max2 = min(rem // 2, len(sum2)-1)\n        best = max(best, sum2[max2+1])\n        \n        total = sum3[k3+1] + best\n        max_cost = max(max_cost, total)\n    \n    print(max_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Complexity Analysis:\n\n- **Sorting**: Each weight group is sorted in $ O(n \\log n) $ time.\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Linear in size of each group.\n- **Main Loop**: Iterates up to $ O(\\min(m/3, n)) $ times.
