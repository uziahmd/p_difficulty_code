При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part must be a positive number of characters but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two messages are completely overlapping (so the merged string is same as s) or just concatenated without overlapping (like s + s) are not considered errors. So, for example, if t is 'abcd', it's considered as no error. Similarly, 'abcabc' is considered as no error because it's just two copies of 'abc' concatenated.\n\nOur task is to check if t could have been formed by such an error. If yes, output YES and a possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the original string t must be formed by merging two copies of s. So the length of t must be equal to 2 * len(s) - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k is between 1 and len(s) - 1.\n\nBut since t is formed by overlapping two s's, the total length would be len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) -k. So the length of t must be between len(s) + 1 (when k is len(s)-1) and 2*len(s) -1 (when k is 1). Wait, but len(s) can vary here. So perhaps we can find possible lengths of s.\n\nLet me think: Let's say the original string t is formed by two s's overlapping by k characters. Then the length of t is 2 * len(s) - k. Also, since k is between 1 and len(s) - 1, then len(t) must be between 2*len(s) - (len(s) -1) = len(s) + 1 and 2*len(s) -1. Which implies that len(t) must be in the range [len(s)+1, 2*len(s)-1]. But since len(s) is unknown, how can we find possible values?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the original s must be a substring of t. Let's suppose that the correct s is such that when you take two copies of it and overlap them by some k, you get t. So, for example, if t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the first sample input, then the correct s is 'abrakadabra'. Because when you overlap two copies of s by 1 character, you get the longer string.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a possible s such that:\n\n- The length of t is 2 * len(s) - k, where 1 ≤ k < len(s).\n\nBut since k is the overlap, the first s ends with some k characters that match the beginning of the second s.\n\nSo, for example, if the original s is length L, then t must be of length 2L -k. But since k is between 1 and L-1, the length of t must be between L+1 and 2L-1. So for each possible L, we can check if there exists a k such that len(t) equals 2L -k. Rearranged, k = 2L - len(t). And since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting gives:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve for L.\n\nLet me denote len(t) as n.\n\nSo:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nBreaking into two inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n +1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L-1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining these two:\n\n(n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1.\n\nBut L must be an integer. So possible L values are integers between ceil((n+1)/2) and n-1, inclusive.\n\nBut wait, for example, if n is even. Let's say n=4. Then (n+1)/2 is 2.5, so ceil(2.5)=3. So L ranges from 3 to 3 (since n-1 is 3). So possible L is 3.\n\nFor n=5: (5+1)/2 = 3, so L ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nSo for each possible L in that range, we can check if there exists a k (which is 2L -n) such that the first L -k characters of t match the last L -k characters of s. Wait, no. Wait, the overlapping part is k characters. So the first s is of length L, and the second s is also of length L. When overlapping by k characters, the merged string is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which is n.\n\nSo, the merged string t should be equal to s[0...L-1] + s[k...L-1], but since the first s ends with the overlapping part, and the second starts with that overlapping part. So, the first L characters of t must be s, and the next part must be s starting from position k. But how do we check that?\n\nAlternatively, the entire t must be formed by overlapping two copies of s. So, the first s is of length L, and the second is also of length L. The overlapping part is k characters. So, the first s's last k characters must be equal to the second s's first k characters. So, the first s is s, and the second s is s. So, the overlapping part is the last k of s and the first k of s. Therefore, the entire t is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nSo, the t must be s concatenated with s[k:]. Which means that the length of t is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. So, for each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], we can compute k = 2L -n. Then, check if the first L characters of t (s_candidate) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of s_candidate. Then, the entire t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each possible L in the valid range (ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1):\n\n   compute k = 2L - n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1 (which it should be, since L is chosen based on the constraints):\n\n      take s_candidate as the first L characters of t.\n\n      check if the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n      also check that the entire t is equal to s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\n      if this is true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the possible L's work, then return NO.\n\nWait, but why do we need to check that the entire t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]? Because the overlapping may not be exactly that. For example, maybe the first s is not the first L characters of t. But according to the problem statement, the merged string is formed by overlapping two s's. So, the merged string must be s followed by s with the first k characters overlapping. So the merged string should be s concatenated with s[k:], which is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Therefore, the entire t must be exactly s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how do we know that the s_candidate is the correct one? Well, the s_candidate is supposed to be the original message. So, the first L characters of t must be s_candidate, and then the rest of the t must be the s_candidate with the first k characters removed. So, the entire t must be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how can we check that? For example, take the first sample input:\n\nInput is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (let's count the length). Let me check:\n\nOriginal sample input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's see, the output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. The input length is 21. Let's check: 2L -k = n. Here, L is 11, n is 21. Then k = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. So k is 1. Then, the first L characters is 'abrakadabra', and the rest of the string should be s_candidate[k:] which is 'brakadabra'. So the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which matches the input. So yes.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nLoop through all possible L values in the range (ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1). For each L, compute k = 2L -n. Check if k is between 1 and L-1. Then, take s_candidate as the first L characters of t. Check if the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Also, check that the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf any such L is found, output YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut why do we need to check that the entire t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]? Because maybe the first L characters are not the correct s_candidate. For example, suppose that the merged string is formed by overlapping two s's, but the first part isn't s_candidate. But how could that be?\n\nNo, because the merged string is formed by two s's. So the first s is s, and the second s is s. So the merged string is s + s[k:]. Therefore, the first L characters of the merged string must be s. So the s_candidate must be the first L characters of t. Hence, checking that the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] is necessary.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible L in the valid range:\n\n   k = 2L -n\n\n   if k is not between 1 and L-1 → skip (but according to our earlier calculation, L is chosen such that this is true)\n\n   s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n   check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[0:k]\n\n   check if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n   if both conditions are true → return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's satisfy this, return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible L's. For example, for the input 'acacacaca' (second sample input), the output is 'acaca'.\n\nLet me compute n = len('acacacaca') = 9.\n\nPossible L's are between ceil((9+1)/2) = 5 and 9-1=8. So L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nCheck for each L:\n\nCase L=5:\n\nk = 2*5 -9 = 10-9=1.\n\nCheck if s_candidate (first 5 chars: 'acaca') has last 1 char equal to first 1 char. Last 1 char is 'a', first is 'a' → yes.\n\nThen check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[1:]. s_candidate[1:] is 'caca'. So s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] is 'acaca' + 'caca' = 'acacacaca' which is the input. So yes. So this is a valid case. So output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother possible L is 6. Let's see:\n\nk=2*6 -9 = 3. So k=3. Check if the first 6 chars is 'acacac'. Check if last 3 chars of this (cac) equals first 3 (aca)? No. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly for L=7: k=2*7 -9=5. Check if s_candidate is first 7 chars: 'acacaca'. Last 5 chars are 'acaca' (positions 2-6?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca' (length 7). last 5 chars would be positions 2 to 6 (assuming 0-based). Let me see:\n\ns_candidate[-5:] is the last 5 characters. For 'acacaca' (indices 0-6):\n\nlast 5 is positions 2-6: 'acaca'.\n\nFirst 5 characters of s_candidate are 'acaca' (positions 0-4). So compare 'acaca' vs 'acaca' → same. Then check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[5:].\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca' (7 letters). s_candidate[5:] is 'ca'. So the concatenation is 'acacaca' + 'ca' → 'acacacaca' which is the input. So this would also be valid. So in this case, the answer could be 'acacaca' as well. But the sample output says 'acaca' is acceptable. So the code can return any of them.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any possible s is acceptable. So in our code, once we find any valid L, we can return the corresponding s_candidate.\n\nBut how to handle multiple possibilities? The code can return the first one found.\n\nSo, the code needs to iterate through possible L's in some order. Let's think about the order. For example, in the sample input, for L=5 and L=7, both are valid. So the code may return either.\n\nNow, the question is: How to generate the possible L's. For example, for n=9, L ranges from 5 to 8. So in the code, we can loop L from (n+1)//2 to n-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, for (n+1)/2, since L must be integer. For example, if n is even, like 8, then (n+1)/2 is 4.5 → ceil(4.5) is 5. So for n=8, L starts at 5, up to 7.\n\nSo in code, for L in range( (n+1)//2 , n ), but wait, for example, when n is even:\n\nn=8, (n+1)//2 is (8+1)//2 = 9//2=4 (in Python, integer division). Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, (n+1)/2 for n=8 is 4.5. So the minimal L is 5. So how to compute the lower bound correctly.\n\nWait, the lower bound for L is ceil( (n+1)/2 ). How to compute that in Python.\n\nFor example, (n+1)/2 can be written as (n+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, for integer division, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for (n+1)/2, ceil((n+1)/2) can be written as (n+1 + 1) // 2 = (n+2)//2.\n\nWait, let me test with n=9:\n\n(n+1)/2 = 10/2=5 → ceil(5) is 5. (n+2)//2 is 11//2=5. Correct.\n\nn=8: (n+1)/2 is 9/2=4.5 → ceil(4.5)=5. (n+2)//2 = (8+2)//2=10//2=5. Correct.\n\nSo the lower bound is (n+2)//2.\n\nSo for L in range( (n+2)//2 , n ), inclusive? Because n-1 is the upper limit.\n\nWait, the upper limit for L is n-1. So for example, for n=9, L can be from 5 to 8 (inclusive). So in code, for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ). But in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So to include n-1, the code should be:\n\nfor L in range( lower_bound, n ):\n\nBut lower_bound is (n+2)//2. For example, n=9, lower_bound is 5, and the upper limit is 9. So the loop runs L from 5 to 8 inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2: then it's impossible. Because two messages would have to be merged, but for example, if n=1, then len(s) would have to be such that 2L -k =1. But since k is at least 1, 2L -k >= 2L - (L-1) = L+1. So for L+1 <=1 → L must be 0, which is impossible. So for n=1, output is NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor L in range( (n+2)//2 , n ):\n\n   k = 2*L - n\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L: continue? Well, according to our earlier constraints, L is chosen such that k is between 1 and L-1. Let me check.\n\nBecause for L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], and k=2L -n.\n\nWe can check for L in the range (n+2)//2 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nSo for example, L can be up to n-1.\n\nLet me compute k for L = n-1:\n\nk = 2*(n-1) -n = 2n-2 -n = n-2.\n\nSince L is n-1, then k must be between 1 and (n-1)-1 = n-2. So for L =n-1, k =n-2. Which is exactly the upper bound. So for L in the range [(n+2)//2, n-1], k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo in code, for each L in that range:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n   check if s_candidate ends with the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n   check if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\nIf both conditions are true, then output YES and s_candidate.\n\nOnce any such L is found, output and exit.\n\nIf none found after checking all possible L's, output NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: Input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → length is 21.\n\nn=21. (n+2)//2 = (21+2)//2 = 23//2=11. So L ranges from 11 to 20 (since n is 21, the upper limit is n-1=20).\n\nFor L=11:\n\nk=2*11 -21=22-21=1.\n\ns_candidate is first 11 characters: 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char of s_candidate (a) equals first 1 char (a) → yes.\n\nCheck if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[1:].\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra', so concatenation is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is the input. So yes.\n\nThus, output YES and s_candidate.\n\nSample 2: 'acacacaca' → len 9. L ranges from (9+2)//2=11//2=5 (since 5.5 is 5.5, integer division in Python is 5.5? Wait no, (9+2) is 11, divided by 2 is 5.5, but in Python 3, 11//2 is 5. So the code would have L in range(5, 9). So L=5,6,7,8.\n\nAs discussed, for L=5, it works.\n\nSample 3: 'abcabc' → len is 6. Output is NO.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=6. (6+2)//2 = 8//2=4. So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nCheck L=4:\n\nk = 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2.\n\nCheck if the first 4 characters (s_candidate = 'abca') has last 2 chars 'ca' equal to first 2 chars 'ab'? No. So invalid.\n\nCheck L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -6 =10-6=4. Check if k < L (5). 4 <5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 chars: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars of s_candidate: 'bcab' (positions 1-4?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'abcab' (length 5). last 4 characters are positions 1-4: 'bcab'.\n\nFirst 4 characters are 'abca'. Are they equal? No. So invalid. Thus, no solution. Output is NO.\n\nSample 4: 'abababab' → len is 8. Output is YES and 'ababab'.\n\nLet me check:\n\nn=8. (8+2)//2 = 10//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -8 = 2 → 2.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 characters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck last 2 chars of s_candidate: 'ba' (positions 3-4). First 2 chars are 'ab'. Not equal. So invalid.\n\nCheck L=6:\n\nk= 2*6 -8 = 4. Check if 4 <6 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 chars: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 characters of s_candidate: 'abab' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). last 4 characters are positions 2 to 5: 'abab'.\n\nFirst 4 characters are 'abab' → same. So yes.\n\nCheck if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[4:] → s_candidate is 'ababab', s_candidate[4:] is 'ab'.\n\nSo concatenation is 'abababab' → which is the input. So yes. So output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother possible L is 7:\n\nk = 2*7 -8 =6. Check if 6 <7 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 characters: 'abababa'.\n\nCheck last 6 characters of s_candidate: 'bababa' (positions 1-6). First 6 characters of s_candidate are 'ababab'. Are these equal? 'bababa' vs 'ababab' → no. So invalid.\n\nThus, the code would find L=6 and return YES.\n\nSample 5: 'tatbt' → len is 5. Output is NO.\n\nCheck possible L's: (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5? Wait, in Python (5+2)//2 is 3 (since 7//2 is 3). So L ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor L=3: k=2*3 -5 =1. Check if s_candidate is first 3 chars 'tat'.\n\nCheck last 1 char of 'tat' is 't', first 1 char is 't' → yes.\n\nCheck if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' which is not equal to input 'tatbt'. So invalid.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -5=3. Check if 3 <4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 chars: 'tatb'.\n\nCheck last 3 chars of s_candidate: 'atb' (positions 1-3). First 3 chars are 'tat' → not equal. So invalid. Thus, no solution.\n\nSo output is NO.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead t as input.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2: print NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor L in range( (n+2)//2 , n ):\n\n   k = 2*L - n\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L: continue? Well, according to previous analysis, it shouldn't happen. But perhaps due to integer division, maybe?\n\nBut since L is in the range [(n+2)//2, n-1], and k=2L -n, then for L >= (n+1)/2, k = 2L -n >= 2*( (n+1)/2 ) -n = n+1 -n = 1. So k >=1. Also, since L is up to n-1, k = 2L -n <= 2(n-1) -n = n-2. Since L is at least (n+2)//2, but for k < L?\n\nLet me check for k < L:\n\nk = 2L -n < L → 2L -n < L → L <n → which is true since L is up to n-1. So yes, k < L. So for all L in the loop, k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo no need to check.\n\nSo proceed.\n\ns_candidate = t[:L]\n\nif s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]:\n\n   print YES and s_candidate.\n\n   exit.\n\nIf after checking all L's, no such case found, print NO.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase 1: t is 'aa' → len 2. Possible L?\n\nn=2.\n\n(n+2)//2 = (2+2)//2=2. So L ranges from 2 to n-1=1 → which is invalid. So the loop doesn't run. So output NO. But wait, what's the correct answer here?\n\nThe original problem says that the error is when two messages are merged with an overlap. But for t='aa', possible scenarios:\n\nIf s is 'a', then two messages would be merged with overlap of 1 character (since len(s) is 1, but overlap must be less than len(s) (i.e., 1). So overlap must be less than 1, which is impossible. So the case where t is 'aa' cannot be formed by overlapping two s's. So the answer is NO.\n\nAnother example: t is 'aaa' (len 3). Possible L?\n\n(n+2)//2 = (3+2)//2 = 5//2=2. So L ranges from 2 to 2 (since n-1=2). So L=2.\n\nk= 2*2 -3 = 1. Check if k is 1 < 2 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 2 chars: 'aa'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char (a) equals first 1 char (a) → yes.\n\nCheck if t equals 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa' → yes. So output YES and 'aa'.\n\nSo the code would output YES for 'aaa'.\n\nAnother edge case: t is 'aaaaa' (len 5). Possible L's are (5+2)//2=3.5 → 3.5? In Python, (5+2)//2 is 3. So L ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nk=2*3 -5=1. s_candidate is first 3 chars 'aaa'. Check last 1 char is 'a' and first 1 is 'a' → yes. Check if t equals 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa' → yes. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: t is 'abababab' (len 8). As in sample 4.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input. For example, input is read via input().strip()\n\nThen:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n        k = 2 * L - n\n\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n        # check if the last k chars of s_candidate equals first k chars\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n            # check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n            if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, for strings, slicing beyond the length is handled. For example, if k is 0, but in our case, k is at least 1. So for the code, the slices are valid.\n\nBut let's test for L=5, k=1, s_candidate is length 5. s_candidate[-1:] is last 1 character, s_candidate[:1] is first 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when k is 0? Well, our code ensures that k is at least 1.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check sample input 2: 'acacacaca' (len 9). For L=5, k=1. s_candidate is 'acaca'. s_candidate[-1:] is 'a', s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → yes. Then check if s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] is 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which matches. So returns YES.\n\nAnother possible L=7, which would be checked later. But since the code breaks on the first found, it would return the first possible L.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first possible L is 5, so code returns that.\n\nNow, what about the case where there are multiple possible s_candidates? The code returns the first one found, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the sample input 3: 'abcabc' → len 6. The code checks L=4 and 5. For L=4, k=2*4-6=2. s_candidate is 'abca'. Check if last 2 chars 'ca' equals first 2 'ab'? No. For L=5, k=4. s_candidate is 'abcab'. Check last 4 chars 'bcab' vs first 4 'abca' → no. So output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa' → len 3. (3+2)//2 = 2.5 → 2 in integer division. So L ranges from 2 to 2. So L=2. k= 2*2-3=1. s_candidate is 'aa'. Check last 1 char is 'a' equals first 1 → yes. Then check 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa' → yes. So output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaa' (len 4). Possible L is (4+2)//2=3. So L=3. k= 2*3 -4 = 2. Check s_candidate is 'aaa'. Check last 2 chars 'aa' equals first 2 chars 'aa' → yes. Then check 'aaa' + 'a' → 'aaaa' → yes. So output YES and 'aaa'.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaaa' (len 5). L ranges from 3 to 4. For L=3, k=1. s_candidate is 'aaa'. Check last 1 char 'a' equals first 1 → yes. Check 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa' → yes. So output YES.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the entire string is s + s. For example, t is 'abcabc', which is s='abc' concatenated. According to the problem statement, this is not considered an error. So the code should not output YES for this case.\n\nIn this case, len(t) is 6. For L in (6+2)//2=4, so L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4, k= 2*4 -6 = 2. Check if s_candidate is 'abca'. Check if last 2 chars 'ca' equals first 2 'ab' → no.\n\nFor L=5, k= 2*5 -6 =4. Check s_candidate is 'abcab'. Check last 4 chars 'bcab' vs first 4 'abca' → no. So code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: t is 'ababab' (len 6). What's the possible L?\n\n(n+2)//2 = (6+2)/2=4. So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4, k= 8-6=2. s_candidate is 'abab'.\n\nCheck last 2 chars 'ab' equals first 2 chars 'ab' → yes. Then check if t equals 'abab' + s_candidate[2:] → 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab' → yes. So output YES and 'abab'.\n\nWhich is correct. Because the original s is 'abab', and two copies are merged with overlapping 2 characters. So the original two messages would be 'abab' and 'abab', overlapping by 2 characters (the 'ab' at the end of first and beginning of second). So merged string is 'ababab'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this is considered an error. So the code outputs YES.\n\nBut what about the case where the merged string is s + s? For example, t is s + s. The code would not output YES because for L = len(s), the code would check for k = 2L - n. Since n = 2L, k = 2L - 2L = 0. Which is not allowed. So in this case, the code would not find any L in the valid range. So the code returns NO, which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this code in Python.\n\nBut note that for the case where the code returns YES, but the s_candidate is such that the entire t is formed by overlapping. However, the problem says that the case where the two messages are completely overlapped (so t equals s) is not considered an error. But in our code, for example, if t is s, then len(t) is L. For the code to process, n = L. The valid L's are in range (n+2)//2 to n-1. But for n = L, the upper bound is n-1 = L-1. So (n+2)//2 is (L+2)//2. For example, if L is 3, then (3+2)//2=2.5 → 2. So L ranges from 2 to 2 (n-1=3-1=2). So for L=2, k=2*2 -3=1. Then, the code checks if the first 2 characters of t (which is s_candidate) has last 1 character equal to first 1. But if t is s, which is length 3, then the code would not find any solution. So the code correctly ignores this case.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be a positive number of characters but less than the length of the message `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: For a string `t` to be formed by merging two identical messages `s`, the length of `t` must be such that it can be derived from overlapping two instances of `s`. This means the length of `t` (denoted as `n`) must satisfy specific constraints based on the length of `s` (denoted as `L`).\n\n2. **Range for Length of `s`**: The valid range for the length of `s` (denoted as `L`) is determined by the formula `(n + 2) // 2` to `n - 1`. This ensures that the overlap `k` (calculated as `2 * L - n`) is a positive integer less than `L`.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Overlap**: For each valid length `L`, check if the first `L` characters of `t` (denoted as `s_candidate`) can form the original message `s` such that the last `k` characters of `s_candidate` match the first `k` characters of `s_candidate`. Additionally, verify that concatenating `s_candidate` with the substring starting from `k` gives the original string `t`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    # Iterate over possible lengths L\n    for L in range((n + 2) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        # Check if the overlap part matches\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            # Check if combining s_candidate and s_candidate[k:] gives t\n            if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, it's impossible to have two messages, so we immediately output \"NO\".\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of the original message `s`, we calculate the overlap `k` and check if the overlap conditions are met.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `L`, we check if the overlap part of the candidate message matches and if combining the candidate message with its substring from `k` gives the original string `t`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid message `s` is found, we print \"YES\" followed by the message. If no valid message is found after checking all possible lengths, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for the original message `s` and ensures that the overlap conditions are met, providing a correct solution to the problem.",
