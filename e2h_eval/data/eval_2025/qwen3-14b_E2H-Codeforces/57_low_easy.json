His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points, but they are not linked to names. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but we don't know which a and b belong to the same person. Wait, no. Wait, the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour is b_i? Or are the a and b arrays separate, and each participant has one a and one b? Oh, the problem says that the second line is the first tour's points, third line is the second tour's points. But the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for example, participant 1 has a_1 in first tour and some b_j in second tour. But the problem says that the teacher knows that there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >= x. So, Vasya's total is at least x, but we need to find the best and worst possible positions he could have.\n\nThe task is to find the best possible rank (minimum possible) and worst possible rank (maximum possible) that Vasya can have, considering that his total is at least x. \n\nSo, how to approach this?\n\nFor the best possible rank: We want to maximize Vasya's total points. Because higher total means better rank. But since the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x, but we can choose any possible pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x. For the best case, we need to select the maximum possible a_i + b_j, and then determine how many people have a higher total than that. Because if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he can be first. But maybe others can have higher totals. Wait, no. If we choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, then others can't have higher than that. Because if someone else has a sum of a_i + b_j, but if we choose for Vasya the maximum possible sum, then others can't have higher than that. Wait, no. Because other participants are using their own a and b. Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that each participant has exactly one a and one b. But the problem is that the a and b arrays are not paired. So for example, the first participant's a is a_1, but their b could be any of the b's. But the actual pairing is such that each participant has exactly one a and one b. However, the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to which participant. So when trying to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, we can assume that the actual pairings of a and b for other participants can be arranged in a way that is most favorable or unfavorable to Vasya.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour but they are not linked to names. So, the teacher knows all the a's and all the b's, but doesn't know which a and b belong to the same person. But the actual pairings are such that each participant has one a and one b. So, the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, given that there exists some pairing (for all participants) where Vasya's a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, we can arrange the pairings of a and b for other participants in a way that helps or hurts Vasya's rank.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we want to assign Vasya's a_i and b_j such that his total is as high as possible. Then, arrange the other participants' pairings so that as few as possible have a higher total than him. For the worst possible rank, we want to assign Vasya's a_i and b_j such that his total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants' pairings so that as many as possible have higher totals than him.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that for the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for the best possible rank, we want this pair to be as large as possible. Because that way, the number of people who can have a higher sum is minimized.\n\nSo the best possible rank is determined by choosing the maximum possible sum for Vasya (so that he can be as high as possible), and then count how many other possible pairs (from the a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the given points from both tours and considering all possible pairings of these points to find optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To determine the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total points. This is done by finding the maximum possible sum of any pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. Once we have this maximum sum, we count how many other participants can have a higher total than this sum. This count will give us the best possible rank (which is the count + 1).\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total points while still meeting the condition a_i + b_j >= x. This is done by finding the minimum possible sum of any pair (a_i, b_j) that meets the condition. Once we have this minimum sum, we count how many other participants can have a higher total than this sum. This count plus one will give us the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort the arrays\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # Best possible place: maximize Vasya's score\n    # Find the maximum a_i + b_j >= x\n    max_vasya = -1\n    for ai in a:\n        # binary search for the largest bj such that ai + bj >= x\n        left, right = 0, n-1\n        best_b = -1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if b[mid] + ai >= x:\n                best_b = b[mid]\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        if best_b != -1:\n            current_sum = ai + best_b\n            if current_sum > max_vasya:\n                max_vasya = current_sum\n    \n    # Now count how many pairs (a_i + b_j) can be greater than max_vasya\n    # To find the best rank, we need the number of pairs with sum > max_vasya\n    # But since max_vasya is the maximum possible, there are none.\n    # So best rank is 1\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst possible place: minimize Vasya's score (but still >=x)\n    min_vasya = float('inf')\n    for ai in a:\n        # binary search for the smallest bj such that ai + bj >=x\n        left, right = 0, n-1\n        best_b = -1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if b[mid] + ai >= x:\n                best_b = b[mid]\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        if best_b != -1:\n            current_sum = ai + best_b\n            if current_sum < min_vasya:\n                min_vasya = current_sum\n    \n    # Now count how many pairs (a_i + b_j) can be greater than min_vasya\n    # To find the worst rank, we need to find how many pairs have sum > min_vasya\n    # But since the other participants can be arranged to have as many as possible sums greater than min_vasya\n    # We need to compute the maximum number of pairs that can be greater than min_vasya\n    # How to do that?
