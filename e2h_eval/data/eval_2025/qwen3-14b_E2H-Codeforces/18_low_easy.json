The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical formula or pattern to calculate the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the movement possibilities. Since the frog can only jump forward by a or backward by b, perhaps the positions are determined by some linear combinations. However, since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the reachable positions depend on x.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this as a graph problem where each position is a node and edges represent jumps. However, for large x, this approach isn't feasible. So, we need another way.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. The key here is to find all positions k such that k can be expressed as a combination of a and b steps, but considering that the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nWait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. For example, if a=5 and b=3, then starting from 0, the frog can jump to 5. From there, it can jump to 5+5=10, or 5-3=2. Then from 2, it can jump to 2+5=7 or 2-3=-1 (but that's invalid). So, the frog can reach positions like 0, 5, 2, 7, 10, etc., but only if they are within the allowed range.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the positions the frog can reach are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), but that's when there's no restriction on the range. However, since the frog can't go beyond x or below 0, the reachable positions are limited.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts: first, determine which positions are reachable in general (without considering the x limit), and then for each x, count how many of those positions are within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the set of reachable positions is all numbers that can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients for a and some coefficients for b, but I'm not sure. Wait, the frog can jump forward a steps any number of times, but backward steps (b steps) can be done as long as it doesn't go below 0. So the problem is similar to the classic coin problem but with a twist.\n\nWait, the classic problem says that if you have coins of denominations a and b, the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab - a - b, assuming a and b are coprime. But that's when you can use any combination of the coins. However, here the frog can only add a steps or subtract b steps. So the reachable positions are different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the frog's movement as being able to move forward by a steps any number of times, and also move backward by b steps any number of times, but only as long as the position remains within [0, x]. So the positions reachable are those that can be written as 0 + k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is between 0 and x.\n\nBut how to find all such positions?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a, b). Because each jump adds a or subtracts b, so the total displacement must be a multiple of d. Let me check that. Suppose a and b have gcd d. Then any combination of adding a and subtracting b will be a multiple of d. So the positions reachable must be multiples of d. Also, since the frog starts at 0, which is a multiple of d.\n\nSo, the first thing is that all reachable positions are multiples of d, where d = gcd(a, b). Therefore, for any x, the positions reachable are multiples of d that are within [0, x], and can be reached through some sequence of jumps.\n\nBut even then, not all multiples of d may be reachable. For example, if a and b are 5 and 3, their gcd is 1. So all integers can be reachable?",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on the number line given constraints on its jumps and then compute the sum of these values for all positions from 0 to a given integer $ m $. The solution involves leveraging number theory concepts, particularly the greatest common divisor (GCD), to derive an efficient formula.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Reachable Positions**:\n   - The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `+a` or `-b`. All reachable positions must be congruent modulo $ \\text{gcd}(a, b) $, because any combination of steps will result in a displacement that is a multiple of the GCD of `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Modulo Class**:\n   - Let $ d = \\text{gcd}(a, b) $. All reachable positions must be multiples of $ d $, i.e., they are of the form $ k \\cdot d $, where $ k \\geq 0 $.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The frog cannot go below 0 or above `x`. So, for each $ x $, the number of reachable positions is the number of such multiples of $ d $ within the interval $[0, x]$.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - For a given `x`, the number of reachable positions is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{d} \\right\\rfloor + 1 $, since we start counting from 0.\n   - However, there's a special case: if $ a > x $, the frog can't even make a forward jump, so it can only reach position 0.\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm:\n\nFor each input $ m, a, b $, we do the following:\n\n1. Compute $ d = \\text{gcd}(a, b) $.\n2. If $ a > m $, then the frog can only reach 0 for all $ x \\leq m $, so the total sum is $ m + 1 $.\n3. Otherwise, for each $ x \\in [0, m] $, the number of reachable positions is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{d} \\right\\rfloor + 1 $.\n4. Sum these values over the range $ [0, m] $.\n\nWe use the formula for the sum of floor division over a range:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{x=0}^{m} \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{d} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\right) = \\sum_{x=0}^{m} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{d} \\right\\rfloor + (m + 1)\n$$\n\nThe sum of floor divisions can be computed efficiently using arithmetic series properties.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        m = int(data[idx])\n        a = int(data[idx+1])\n        b = int(data[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        \n        if a > m:\n            print(m + 1)\n            continue\n        \n        # Compute the sum of floor(x/d) for x from 0 to m\n        q = m // d\n        r = m % d\n        sum_floor = q * (q - 1) * d // 2 + q * r + (r * (r + 1)) // 2\n        \n        # Add (m + 1) for the +1 term\n        total = sum_floor + (m + 1)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Efficiency:\n\n- The algorithm runs in constant time $ O(1) $ per test case.\n- It avoids iterating through all $ m $ values, which would be infeasible for large $ m $ up to $ 10^9 $.\n- It uses mathematical formulas to compute the required sums directly.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution works efficiently even for the largest inputs.",
