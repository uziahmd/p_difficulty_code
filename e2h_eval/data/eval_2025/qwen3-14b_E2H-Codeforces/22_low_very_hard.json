After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, the input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line is a string of digits. So for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for 3 subjects.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string represents a student's marks.\n- For each subject (column index from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value among all students' marks in that column.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n\nBut how to process the columns? Because the data is stored as rows. For example, the first row is student 1's marks for all subjects. So for column j, we need to look at the j-th character of each row.\n\nSo, let's think about creating a list of lists. Each row is a list of integers. For example, for the input '223', it becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have that, for each column j, collect all the values in that column across all students, find the max, and then note which students have that value in that column.\n\nBut how to track which students are successful. Let's create a set of student indices (starting from 0 or 1?) who are successful. For each student, if they have at least one subject where their mark is the maximum for that subject, add them to the set. The size of the set is the answer.\n\nSo, the plan:\n\n1. Read the input into a 2D array of integers. Let's say students is a list of lists. Each sublist is the marks of a student.\n\n2. For each subject (column) j in 0..m-1:\n\n   a. Find the maximum value in column j.\n\n   b. For each student i, check if their mark in column j is equal to this maximum. If yes, add this student to the successful set.\n\nOnce all columns are processed, the size of the successful set is the answer.\n\nYes. Because even if a student is the best in multiple subjects, they are counted once.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, processing the input. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\nThen the lines are '223', '232', '112'.\n\nSo students would be:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2. So students 0 and 1 have this. So they are added to the set.\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3. Only student 1 has this. So add him.\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3. Only student 0 has this. Add him.\n\nSo the successful set is {0,1} → size 2. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines. For each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each column j:\n\n- collect all the values in that column (students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1)\n\n- find the max of that column.\n\n- for each student i, check if students[i][j] == max_val. If yes, add i to the set.\n\nOnce all columns are processed, the answer is the length of the set.\n\nSo, code steps in Python:\n\nRead the input. Let's see, the input can be read via input() function, but for multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first example, but in the sample input, there are two test cases. Wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook entries.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert each row of the gradebook into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Column-wise Analysis**: For each subject (column), determine the maximum grade.\n4. **Successful Students Identification**: Track students who have the maximum grade in any subject using a set to avoid duplicates.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The size of the set of successful students gives the required result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    results = []\n    \n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        students = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            row = input[idx].strip()\n            students.append([int(c) for c in row])\n            idx += 1\n        \n        successful = set()\n        \n        for j in range(m):\n            max_val = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\n            for i in range(n):\n                if students[i][j] == max_val:\n                    successful.add(i)\n        \n        results.append(str(len(successful)))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. This helps handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Data Conversion**: Each student's grades are converted from strings to lists of integers to facilitate numerical comparisons.\n- **Column-wise Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column), the maximum grade is determined across all students.\n- **Tracking Successful Students**: A set is used to keep track of indices of students who are the best in at least one subject. This ensures each student is counted only once even if they are the best in multiple subjects.\n- **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end to minimize I/O operations, enhancing efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging set operations and column-wise analysis, resulting in an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
