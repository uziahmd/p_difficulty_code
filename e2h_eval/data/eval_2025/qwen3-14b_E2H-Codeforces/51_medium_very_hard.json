Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the pile should contain exactly all the letters from both names combined, no more, no less. Any extra letters or missing letters would make the answer \"NO\".\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the guest and host names match exactly with the letters in the pile. How to do that?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, take the first two input lines: guest and host. Combine their characters. Then, check if the third line (the pile) has exactly those characters, in any order, with the same counts.\n\nSo, for example, if guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAU\", then combined letters are S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S. Wait, but the actual example given in the first input is SANTACLAUS and DEDMOROZ. Let me not get confused here.\n\nThe way to check is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest and host names, and compare it with the frequency in the pile.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines (guest + host) into a single string.\n3. Check if the count of each character in this concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third line (the pile).\n4. If they match, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, we can use the collections.Counter class for this. Because Counter will count the frequency of each character in a string.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\ncount_combined = Counter(combined)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif count_combined == count_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if the counts are the same, the order doesn't matter.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 10 and the pile is 9 letters. Then, the counts can't be equal, so the code would return NO. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would handle that automatically because the Counter objects would have different elements. For example, if one has a letter that the other doesn't, the counts would differ.\n\nSo this approach should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters.\n\nLet me count the letters in the combined string:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nWait, maybe I should count each letter:\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think that the combined length is len(guest) + len(host). Let's compute that.\n\nOriginal guest: SANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) → let's count: S (2), A (3?), etc. But the exact counts aren't important here. The pile's length must be equal to the combined length.\n\nIn the first example, the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the length.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare the counts.\n\nIn the first example, the code would return YES because the counts match.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL (length 9)\nhost: JOULUPUKKI (length 10)\npile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI (let me count the letters here. Let me see, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters:\n\nBut according to the note, there's a missing 'P' and an extra 'L'. So the code would catch that.\n\nSo, the code would compare the counts of the combined guest and host (PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI) with the pile. Let's see:\n\nThe combined guest and host would have:\n\nPAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI → let's count letters.\n\nBut perhaps the pile has an extra L and missing a P. So the code would detect that.\n\nSo the code would return NO, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nguest: BABBONATALE\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS\npile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nThe note says there's an extra L. So the code would check the counts. The combined guest and host would have certain letters, and the pile has an extra L, so the counts would differ.\n\nThus, the code would return NO.\n\nTherefore, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All letters are same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then code returns YES.\n\nEdge case 2: guest is empty? No, according to the input description, all lines are non-empty. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when the pile has exactly the same letters as combined, but in different order. Which is allowed, since the code checks counts, not order.\n\nAnother case: when the pile has some letters that are not present in the combined. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABX\". Then code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo the plan is to read the three lines, combine the first two, create Counters for both, and compare.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the Counter is from collections. So I need to import that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but sometimes, when reading lines, there might be issues with trailing newlines. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters. So using strip() is safe here.\n\nWait, but the input is three lines. So, for example, if the input is given as three lines, then using readline() three times would get each line. However, sometimes, when using online judges, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input lines are correct. So the code should read the three lines correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that when reading via stdin, after reading the first line, the next readline() would read the second, etc. So yes.\n\nBut in some cases, when the user inputs via a file, perhaps there are trailing newlines. But the problem says that all lines are not empty. So the code should be safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nBut perhaps the code would compare the counts correctly.\n\nSo the code should return YES for the first case.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's count letters.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see:\n\nThe combined has:\n\nLetters in guest (PAPAINOEL): P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3? Wait guest's P is 2, host's P is 1? Wait guest is PAPAINOEL: letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → P appears twice. Host is JOULUPUKKI → letters J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → P appears once. So combined P count is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nIn the pile, JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count letters:\n\nLet me think: the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\nJ:1\n\nO: ?\n\nLet me write down the letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the letters in the pile.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare. According to the note, there's a missing P and an extra L.\n\nSo the combined counts would have P: 3, but the pile has P: 2 (since the pile has 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let's count P's here. Let me look:\n\nLooking at the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some letters. Let me count the letters in the pile:\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nJ:1\n\nO: appears in positions 2, 9? Let me think:\n\nThe pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo O occurs at position 2 (O), then later at position 9 (O?), maybe. Let me count O's:\n\nIn the string, the letters are:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo O occurs at position 2, then again at position 9 (assuming the string is as written). So O count is 2.\n\nBut in the combined guest and host, the O count is guest has O:1 (from PAPAINOEL) and host has O:1 (JOULUPUKKI). So combined O count is 2. Which matches the pile's O count.\n\nBut the note says that there's a missing P. Let me check.\n\nIn the combined guest and host, the P count is 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3.\n\nIn the pile, how many P's?\n\nLooking at the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLooking for P's:\n\nThe letters are J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. So there are two P's? Let me see:\n\n- The 6th character is P (JOULNAP...), then later, after 'LUP' — the 'P' is there. So positions 6 and 15 (assuming the string is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI). So two P's. So the pile has 2 P's, but combined has 3. Therefore, the code would detect that, and return NO. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code works for this case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: third example.\n\nguest: BABBONATALE (letters B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E)\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS (F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S)\n\nCombined letters: guest + host.\n\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me check the counts. According to the note, there's an extra L. So the code would find that.\n\nSo the code would compare the counts and find that the pile has an extra L, hence return NO.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you read lines via stdin, sometimes you might get trailing newlines. However, the problem says that each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So using .strip() is safe. Because, for example, if a line is read as 'SANTACLAUS\\n', then .strip() would remove the newline and leave 'SANTACLAUS'.\n\nBut perhaps the input lines are read correctly with sys.stdin.readline().strip().\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is given via a file, the third line may have a trailing newline. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty. So the code should be safe.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about the sample input given as a list? For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but the actual input is three lines. So for each test case, the code reads three lines. But the sample input shows that the input is three lines, but the sample input is given as a list of three strings. But in reality, the input is three lines, each being the guest, host, and pile.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code reads three lines, each with readline().strip().\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nAfter reading, guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'.\n\nLet me count the letters in combined and pile.\n\nBut perhaps the code would compare them correctly.\n\nSo the code returns YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nThe code returns NO.\n\nSample 3:\n\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nThe code returns NO.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when the combined and pile have same letters but different counts. For example, guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' → YES. If pile is 'A', then NO.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB' → YES. If pile is 'BA' → same counts, YES.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and the host. The solution involves checking if the character counts in the pile exactly match the combined character counts of the guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts of the combined string with those of the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()`, ensuring that each line is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated to form a single string, which is then used to count the frequency of each character.\n- **Character Counting with Counter**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module efficiently counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile of letters.\n- **Comparison**: By comparing the two counters, we check if the pile contains exactly the same characters with the same frequencies as the combined names. If they match, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names, resulting in \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters, considering both their presence and frequency, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.",
