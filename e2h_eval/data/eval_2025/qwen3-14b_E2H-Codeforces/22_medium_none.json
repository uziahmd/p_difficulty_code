After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, the gradebook is like a 2D array. For example, in the first sample input, it's 3 students and 3 subjects. The first student's marks are 2, 2, 3. Second is 2,3,2. Third is 1,1,2.\n\nThe steps I need to take:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read the next n lines as the gradebook. Let's think about storing the gradebook as a list of lists. Each row is a student, each column is a subject.\n\nBut perhaps we can process the columns first. For each column (subject), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the maximum of that column.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample input:\n\nThe subjects are columns 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor column 0: the values are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. So any student with 2 in column 0 is considered best in that subject.\n\nFor column 1: values are 2,3,1. Max is 3. Only student 2 has 3 here.\n\nFor column 2: values are 3,2,2. Max is 3. Only student 1 has that.\n\nSo, student 1 has max in column 0 and 2. Student 2 has max in column 1. Student 3 has none. So total successful is 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in that column equals the max of that column. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each column.\n\nLet me think. For each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max(gradebook[i][j] for i in 0..n-1)\n\nOnce we have that array, then for each student i, check if any of their marks in j is equal to max_marks[j].\n\nSo, for each student, loop through their marks. For each mark, check if it's equal to the max of that column. If any of them is, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. Convert each string into a list of integers. So, for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each column j, compute the maximum value.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, iterate through each student. For each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column. If yes, increment the count.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. For each line, convert to a list of integers. So, for example, the first line is '223', which becomes [2,2,3]. So the gradebook is a list of lists.\n\nThen, for each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n\nmax_col[j] = max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\nOnce we have max_col, then for each student in gradebook:\n\nfor each student in gradebook:\n\n   for j in 0 to m-1:\n\n      if student[j] == max_col[j]:\n\n          mark as successful, break\n\nSo, count how many students have at least one such occurrence.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, the user provided an example where the input is given as a list of strings. But in actual code, the input comes from stdin. So, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given via standard input. So, for example, the first input line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read the first line as input().split(), then read the next n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, the first input is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo, the code would read n=3, m=3. Then read three lines, each as a string. Then process them.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngradebook = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nThen, compute max_col for each column.\n\nmax_col = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n\n    max_col[j] = max_val\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_col = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each column j, compute the max.\n\nOnce we have max_col, then for each student in gradebook, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max_col[j].\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in gradebook:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_col[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo, that's the idea.\n\nWait, but for each student, we check all m subjects. Once any of them is found to be the max, we increment the count and break out of the loop for that student.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code would look like that.\n\nNow, test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngradebook is:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nmax_col for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: max(2,2,1) = 2\n\ncolumn 1: max(2,3,1) =3\n\ncolumn 2: max(3,2,2) =3\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0:\n\ncheck column 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1:\n\ncolumn 0: 2 == 2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2:\n\ncheck column 0: 1 < 2. column 1: 1 <3. column 2: 2 <3. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input is 3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo, gradebook:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_col for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: max(9,1,1) =9\n\ncolumn 1: max(1,1,1)=1\n\ncolumn 2: max(7,8,1) =8\n\ncolumn 3: max(2,2,1) =2\n\ncolumn 4: max(8,8,1) =8\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nstudent 0:\n\nhas 9 in column 0 (max), so yes.\n\nstudent 1:\n\nin column 2, 8 is max. So yes.\n\nstudent 2:\n\ncheck each column. column 1 has 1 which is max. So yes.\n\nThus total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if all students have same marks in all subjects? Like n=2, m=1, and both have 5. Then max_col is 5. Both students have 5 in the only subject. So both are successful. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. The student has 5. So he is successful. Output 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [3,4], student 2 has [4,3]. Then max_col for column 0 is 4, column 1 is 4. Student 1 has 3 in column 0 (not max), 4 in column 1 (max). So he is successful. Student 2 has 4 in column 0 (max), so he is successful. So total 2.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Then convert each character to int.\n\nThen compute max_col for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks is equal to the max_col for that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngradebook = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_col:\n\nmax_col = [0]*m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n\n    max_col[j] = max_val\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_col = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps the first way is better, but for m up to 100, it's negligible.\n\nOnce that's done, count the successful students.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in gradebook:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_col[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nProcessing:\n\ngradebook is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_col is [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2 (col 0) equals max_col[0] → count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: 2 (col 0) equals max_col[0] → count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none. So total 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_col is [9, 1, 8, 2, 8]\n\nstudent 0: 9 in col 0 → yes.\n\nstudent 1: 8 in col 2 → yes.\n\nstudent 2: 1 in col 1 → yes. So count is 3.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? Well, according to constraints, m is at least 1. Because 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 5 and 5. Then max_col is 5. Both students have 5. So count is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines each containing m digits representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), compute the maximum mark obtained by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in at least one subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nmax_col = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_col[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_col[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the integers n and m. The subsequent n lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing the marks of each student in different subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This helps in determining the best performance for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject and checking each student against these values. The complexity is O(n*m) for both finding the maximum marks and checking each student, which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 100).",
