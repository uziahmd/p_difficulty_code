Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Crazy Town, which is a plane divided by n infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The regions formed by these roads are called blocks. The task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block. A step is moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks through a line segment (not just a point) are considered connected.\n\nThe input gives the coordinates of home and university, and the list of roads. The output is the minimum steps required.\n\nHmm. How do I model this problem?\n\nFirst, I think of each block as a node in a graph. Then, edges exist between nodes if their blocks share a common border. The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks and determine adjacency between them? Since there are potentially infinite blocks, but the number of roads is up to 300, it's impossible to generate all blocks directly. So, we need another approach.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model the problem using the concept of regions divided by lines. But how to represent each region uniquely?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of BFS. Each state is determined by the position relative to each road. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For each road, the home is on one side, and the university is on some other side. The key insight here is that each block can be represented by the sign of the equations for each road. Because for each road, the block lies on one side of the line. So, for each road, we can compute whether the home is on the positive or negative side of that road. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut how does moving between blocks work? When you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly one equation. However, moving from one block to another adjacent block requires crossing exactly one road. So, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. Wait, no. Because two blocks can be separated by multiple roads. Wait, but adjacent blocks share a common border, which is a segment of a road. So, moving between them requires crossing exactly one road. Therefore, their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. Because crossing a road changes the sign of that road's equation. So, the adjacency is determined by differing in exactly one road's sign.\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Suppose two blocks are separated by two roads. But that's not possible. Because if two blocks are adjacent, their boundary is a segment of a single road. Because each road is a line, and two regions adjacent along a road must be separated by that road. So, the difference in their sign vectors would be exactly one road's sign.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a binary vector (for each road, whether it's positive or negative). But since there are n roads, there are 2^n possible states. However, with n up to 300, that's impossible. 2^300 is way too big.\n\nBut that's not feasible. So, how can we handle this?\n\nWait, but the home and university are fixed points. The problem is to find the minimal steps between their respective regions. So, perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is the set of signs of the roads relative to the current position. But again, with 300 roads, that's impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal steps between two regions is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. But that's not exactly right. Because each step can cross one road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the home is in region A and the university is in region B. The regions are separated by some roads. Each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from A to B. But how is that determined?\n\nEach road can be thought of as a hyperplane. The regions are connected components of the arrangement of hyperplanes. The problem is similar to finding the minimal number of hyperplanes (roads) that need to be crossed to go from the home region to the university region.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the parity of the signs. For each road, the home is on one side (say, positive or negative), and the university is on the other side. So, for each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, then that road must be crossed once. If they are on the same side, then that road is not crossed.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct.",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of steps to move from one block (region) to another in Crazy Town, we need to consider the arrangement of roads as dividing the plane into regions. Each region can be uniquely identified by the signs of the expressions $a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for each road $i$. The key idea is that moving between adjacent blocks involves crossing a single road, changing the sign of exactly one expression.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Regions Defined by Signs**:\n   - Each block corresponds to a unique combination of signs of the expressions $a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for all roads.\n   - Since there are up to 300 roads, the number of possible combinations is $2^{300}$, which is infeasible to explore directly.\n\n2. **Home and University Regions**:\n   - Given the coordinates of the home $(x_1, y_1)$ and university $(x_2, y_2)$, we can compute the sign of each road for both points.\n   - This gives us two binary vectors (signs) representing the regions of the home and university.\n\n3. **Crossing Roads**:\n   - To move from one block to an adjacent one, you must cross exactly one road.\n   - Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads where the signs of the expressions differ between the home and university.\n\n4. **Shortest Path**:\n   - Since each step corresponds to crossing a road and changing the sign of its expression, the shortest path is simply the number of differing signs between the home and university.\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1. For each road, compute the sign of $a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for both the home and university.\n2. Count how many of these signs differ.\n3. That count is the minimum number of steps required.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    # Parse home and university coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, data[0].split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, data[1].split())\n    \n    n = int(data[2])\n    \n    roads = []\n    for i in range(3, 3 + n):\n        if not data[i]:\n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data[i].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    # Compute sign for home and university\n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return signs\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n    \n    # Count differences\n    diff = sum(1 for s1, s2 in zip(home_signs, univ_signs) if s1 != s2)\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `get_signs(x, y)` computes the sign of the expression $a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for each road.\n- It then compares the signs of the home and university with respect to all roads.\n- The number of differing signs gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles the constraints well, with a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of roads (up to 300).",
