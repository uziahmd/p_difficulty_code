Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads (lines) in a plane. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to university. Each step allows moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks through a line segment (not just a point) are considered connected.\n\nThe key here is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between blocks that are adjacent via a shared border. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n lines, the number of regions can be up to something like O(n²), but with n up to 300, that's way too big to handle directly. So enumerating all possible regions isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. Because each move is across a line, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the regions based on their position relative to each line.\n\nAnother idea: For any given point (like home or university), each line divides the plane into two halves. The position of the point relative to each line (which side it's on) determines which region it's in. However, since the regions are determined by all the lines, the region can be uniquely identified by the sign of each line's equation evaluated at the point.\n\nWait, right! For each line ai x + bi y + ci = 0, the point (x,y) lies on one side or the other. So, for the home point, for each line, we can compute the value of ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci. Since the home is not on any line, this value is non-zero. Similarly for the university. So, the region of the home is determined by the signs of all these values. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut how can we model the regions? Well, two regions are adjacent if they differ by exactly one line's sign. Because if two regions differ by exactly one line, then they share a common border (the line itself). Because changing the sign of one line's evaluation would mean crossing that line, hence adjacent regions.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Suppose two regions differ in more than one line's sign. But if they differ in exactly one line, then they are adjacent. Because that line is their common border. So, the adjacency between regions is determined by whether their sign vectors differ in exactly one line.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step can flip exactly one sign (i.e., cross a single line).\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because when you cross a line, you flip the sign for that line. So, the regions are represented by their sign vectors. The minimal steps between two regions is the minimal number of sign flips required to transform one sign vector into another, where each flip corresponds to crossing a line. But how does this relate to the actual adjacency?\n\nBecause each step in the problem corresponds to moving across a line, which flips exactly one sign in the sign vector. So, two regions are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. Therefore, the problem becomes equivalent to finding the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But wait, no. Because the Hamming distance is the number of positions where they differ. However, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance, because each step can flip one bit (sign). So, the minimal steps required is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the home's sign vector is S, and the university's is T. Each step allows flipping one sign. So, the minimal number of steps is the number of differing signs between S and T. Because each differing sign requires crossing that line once. But is that correct?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose there are two lines. The home is in a region where both lines have positive values. The university is in a region where both lines have negative values. The Hamming distance is 2. So according to this idea, the minimal steps would be 2. But in reality, can you cross each line once, which would take two steps. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if the Hamming distance is 1, then you can cross that line once, so one step. That's correct.\n\nSo the answer is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university.\n\nWait, but how does that account for the actual arrangement of the lines? For example, suppose there are three",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the Crazy Town problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves crossing a line (road) that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regions and Lines**: Each line divides the plane into two regions. The position of a point relative to a line can be determined by evaluating the line equation at that point. The sign of the result indicates which side of the line the point lies on.\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For both the home and university points, compute a sign vector relative to each line. This vector captures the side of each line on which the point lies.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. This is because each differing sign in the vectors indicates a line that must be crossed to move from one region to another.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read the roads\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for home\n    home_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for university\n    uni_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        uni_signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    distance = sum(h != u for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs))\n    print(distance)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the lines defining the roads.\n- **Sign Vector Calculation**: For each line, we determine the sign of the result when evaluating the line equation at the home and university coordinates. This gives us two sign vectors.\n- **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between these two sign vectors gives the minimum number of steps required, as each differing sign indicates a line that needs to be crossed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal and straightforward solution.",
