    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nFirst, let's think about the problem. Let me denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since k is non-negative, x and y are at least a and b respectively. But since k is the same for both, the difference between x and y is (b - a). Wait, because x - y = (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So, x and y differ by a fixed value. Let me think: suppose a < b. Then, x = a +k, y = b +k. So y = x + (b - a). Let me call d = |a - b|. So, without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Then, the difference between the two numbers is (b - a) = d. So, the problem reduces to finding x such that x and x + d have the smallest possible LCM. And then find the minimal k which gives this x.\n\nWait, but how does x relate to k? Well, x = a + k. Since a and b are given, and we can assume a ≤ b, then d = b - a. So, the two numbers are x and x + d. So, the LCM of x and x + d.\n\nNow, the LCM of two numbers can be written as (x * (x + d)) / gcd(x, x + d). But the GCD of x and x +d is the same as GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So, the LCM becomes (x*(x+d))/gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize this value. Let's think about how to find x such that this is minimized.\n\nBut since x is a +k, and k ≥0, x must be ≥ a. Also, since d is fixed (as b -a), perhaps we can find the optimal x in terms of d.\n\nLet me think about the case where d is zero. That would be when a = b. Then, x and x + 0 are the same, so LCM is x. So the minimal x is a, which gives k=0. So that's straightforward.\n\nBut when d is not zero, let's proceed. Let me take the example from the first input: a=6, b=10. So d =4. The optimal k was 2, leading to x=8, y=12. Their LCM is 24. Let's see what's happening here. For x=8, the GCD(8,4) is 4. So LCM is (8*12)/4= 24. What if x is 6? Then y is 10. GCD(6,4)=2. LCM is (6*10)/2=30. Which is larger than 24. So, the example shows that choosing x such that x is a multiple of d may help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is such that x is as small as possible, but also that x and d share a large GCD. Because the LCM is (x*(x+d))/gcd(x,d). So, for fixed d, how can we minimize this expression?\n\nLet me think about x and d. Let's denote g = gcd(x, d). Let me write x as g * m, and d as g * n, where m and n are coprime. Then, since x = g*m, d = g*n. Then, x +d = g*(m +n). The LCM of x and x+d is (g*m * g*(m+n)) / gcd(g*m, g*(m+n))). The GCD here is g * gcd(m, m +n). But since m and n are coprime, m and m +n are coprime? Let's see. Suppose that m and n are coprime. Then, any common divisor of m and m +n must divide n. But since m and n are coprime, the GCD is 1. So, the GCD of x and x +d is g * 1 = g. Therefore, the LCM is (g^2 * m (m +n )) / g = g * m (m +n ). But since d = g*n, then n = d/g. Also, since x = g*m, and x must be ≥ a. So, the LCM is g * m * (m + n) = g*m*(m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The key insight is to recognize that the LCM of two numbers can be minimized by leveraging their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Given two integers $ a $ and $ b $, we need to find the smallest $ k $ such that the LCM of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. \n2. **Key Insight**: The difference between $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is constant and equal to $ |a - b| $. Let's denote this difference as $ d $.\n3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal value of $ k $ can be derived by considering the GCD of the numbers involved. For any $ x = a + k $, the LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $ can be minimized by ensuring $ x $ is a multiple of the GCD of $ d $ and $ x $.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating through possible values of $ k $ based on the divisors of $ d $, we can efficiently determine the minimum LCM and the corresponding $ k $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef minimal_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    # We need to find x such that x = a + k, and x + d = b + k\n    # So x and x + d have LCM minimized\n    # Let's consider possible candidates for x\n    # The optimal x is such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d\n    # Let's iterate over all possible divisors of d\n    # But since d can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way\n    # Let's try all possible divisors of d\n    # However, given the time constraints, we can consider that the optimal k is (g - (a % g)) % g where g is a divisor of d\n    # So let's generate all divisors of d and check for each possible candidate\n    # First, find all divisors of d\n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n        return divisors\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    # Also consider the case where k=0\n    candidates = []\n    for g in divisors:\n        # We want x = a + k to be a multiple of g\n        # So x = m * g\n        # Since x >= a, m >= ceil(a / g)\n        # Also, since x + d = m * g + d = m * g + g * (d/g) = g*(m + d/g)\n        # So the LCM is (x * (x + d)) / gcd(x, x + d) = (g*m * g*(m + d/g)) / g = g*m*(m + d/g)\n        # Which is g*m*(m + n), where n = d/g\n        # To minimize this, we can take m as small as possible\n        # So m is the smallest integer such that m*g >= a\n        m_min = (a + g - 1) // g\n        x = m_min * g\n        k_candidate = x - a\n        candidates.append(k_candidate)\n    # Also check the case where k is such that x = (a + k) is the same as the minimal possible\n    # Check k=0\n    candidates.append(0)\n    # Now, for each candidate k, compute the LCM of a +k and b +k\n    for k in candidates:\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // math.gcd(x, y)\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    return best_k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 2):\n        a = int(input[i])\n        b = int(input[i+1])\n        print(minimal_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into pairs of integers.\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If $ a $ and $ b $ are equal, the optimal $ k $ is 0 immediately.\n3. **Finding Divisors**: For the difference $ d $, we generate all divisors to consider potential values of $ k $.\n4. **Evaluating Candidates**: For each divisor, we compute potential values of $ k $ that could minimize the LCM and evaluate these candidates to find the smallest valid $ k $.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore potential values of $ k $ using properties of divisors and GCD, leading to an optimal solution.",
