Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in that concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from collections. For example, we can create a Counter for the combined guest and host names, and another Counter for the pile. Then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, Counter compares the counts of each character. So that's the right approach.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input. Let's say guest, host, pile.\n\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string.\n\n3. Create a Counter for the combined string and a Counter for the pile.\n\n4. Compare the two Counters. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? Like, if the guest + host has length 5, but the pile has length 6. Then obviously, it's impossible. So checking the lengths first might be a quick way to return NO.\n\nBut the Counter approach would automatically take care of that. Because if the lengths are different, the Counters can't be equal. So maybe checking the length first could be an optimization. However, for the problem constraints, since the maximum length is 100 per line, even for 200 characters, it's negligible. So perhaps not necessary, but maybe adding that check can save some time.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to just proceed with the Counter approach.\n\nLet me think about the sample input.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nguest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's see, the combined length is len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\") = 10 + 8 = 18? Let me count:\n\nWait \"SANTACLAUS\" is S A N T A C L A U S → 10 letters. \"DEDMOROZ\" is D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. Total 18 letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters. Well, the sample says it's correct. So the Counter approach would work here.\n\nAnother sample input is 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'. Let's check the lengths. Guest is PAPAINOEL (9 letters?), host is JOULUPUKKI (10 letters?), total 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let's see, maybe there's an extra L. So the Counter would catch that.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, how to read the input? The input is three lines. But in the example given, the input is given as a list of three elements. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three elements, but in reality, the actual input is three lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So for example, in the first example, the input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...], but that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows that the first input is three lines, but in the example, the input is given as a list of three elements. Wait, perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the input is three lines. The sample input shows three different test cases. For example, the first test case's input is the first line, then the second line, then third line. Then the output is the corresponding three answers.\n\nBut in the sample input",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the front door could have been formed by combining the letters from the guest's name and the host's name. This means we must verify that the pile contains exactly the same letters (with the same frequencies) as the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined names and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts of the combined names and the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    # Create counters for both combined and pile\n    combined_counter = Counter(combined)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counters\n    if combined_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()`, which ensures we handle each line correctly.\n- **Combining Names**: By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we create a single string representing all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Character Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module allows us to efficiently count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: The comparison of the two counters ensures that each character appears the same number of times in both the combined names and the pile, confirming whether the pile can be rearranged to form the names exactly. If they match, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters, leveraging Python's built-in data structures for clarity and performance.",
