    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem. Let me first understand what's going on here. The LCM of two numbers is minimized when the numbers are as small as possible and have a high common factor. Because LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So if the two numbers are close and have a large GCD, their LCM will be smaller.\n\nBut how do I find the optimal k?\n\nLet me think: Let's denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is the same for both, x - a = y - b → x - y = a - b. So the difference between x and y is fixed. Let me call this difference d. Let's say d = a - b. Wait, but if a and b are given, then d is fixed. So for example, if a is 6 and b is 10, then d is -4. So x - y = -4 → y = x +4. So the two numbers differ by a fixed value.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x and y such that y = x + (b - a) [Wait, original difference: x = a +k, y = b +k. So y -x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b -a. So the difference between y and x is (b -a). Let me denote that as d = b -a. So y = x +d. Or if d is negative, then x = y + |d|.\n\nSo the LCM of x and y, where y = x +d. And d is fixed based on a and b. So the problem becomes: find x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, and then find the smallest k such that x = a +k, which implies k = x -a. But since x has to be at least a (since k is non-negative?), no, wait. If a is larger than b, then d = b -a is negative. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the example given: a=6, b=10. Then d = b -a = 4. So y = x +4. So x is a +k, which is 6 +k. So y = 6 +k +4 = 10 +k, which matches. So in this case, the problem is to find x such that LCM(x, x+4) is minimized, and then find the minimal k (which is x -a, but since x must be >= a? No, because k can be zero. For example, if x is 6, then k is zero. But if x is 5, then k would be -1, which is invalid. So x must be at least a, because k can't be negative. Wait, no. Because k is non-negative. So x = a +k ≥ a. Similarly, y = b +k ≥ b. So x must be ≥ a, and y must be ≥ b. So given that, since d = b -a, then y = x +d. So for example, if d is positive, then x can be as small as a, and y would be a +d. Which is equal to b, since d = b -a. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find x ≥ a, and y = x +d (where d = b -a), such that LCM(x, y) is minimized. Then find the minimal k = x -a.\n\nBut how do I find x?\n\nLet me think. The LCM of x and x +d is minimized when x and x +d have the largest possible GCD. Because LCM(x, x+d) = x*(x +d)/GCD(x, x +d). Since x and x +d have a GCD equal to GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So the LCM is x*(x +d)/g, where g is GCD(x, d).\n\nSo to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize GCD(x, d). Because x*(x +d) is fixed once d is fixed? No, wait, x varies. So the problem is to find x such that x and x +d have as large a GCD as possible, while also keeping x as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d, and x +d is also a multiple of that divisor. Wait, but since x and x +d have GCD equal to GCD(x, d), maybe we can think of it as follows: Let's compute all possible divisors of d. Then, for each divisor g of d, find the minimal x such that x is congruent to 0 mod g, and x ≥ a, and x +d is also congruent to 0 mod g. Wait, but since x +d = x +d, and d is fixed. If x is congruent to 0 mod g, then x +d is congruent to d mod g. But since g divides d (because we are considering divisors of d), then d mod g is 0. So x +d is congruent to 0 mod g. Therefore, if x is a multiple of g, then x and x +d are both multiples of g. Thus, their GCD is at least g. But the actual GCD could be higher. However, for the purpose of finding the maximum possible GCD, perhaps considering the divisors of d is the way to go.\n\nSo, the idea is that the maximum possible GCD(x, x +d) is equal to the maximum possible GCD(x, d). Therefore, the optimal approach is to find the maximum possible GCD(x, d), which would be a divisor of d. So for each divisor g of d, we can try to find the minimal x ≥ a such that x is a multiple of g, and then compute the LCM for that x. Then, among all these possibilities, select the one with the minimal LCM. Then, the minimal k would be x -a.\n\nBut wait, what if d is zero? Oh, right! If a and b are equal, then d = b -a = 0. In that case, y = x +0 = x. So LCM(x, x) is x. So the minimal x is a (since x must be ≥ a, and k is zero). So the answer is k=0. That's an edge case.\n\nSo first, check if a == b. If so, return 0. Because adding k=0 gives LCM(a, a) = a, which is the minimal possible.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo for the general case where d is not zero. Let me proceed.\n\nLet me take d = b -a. But wait, if a is larger than b, then d is negative. But since d is fixed, perhaps I should take absolute value? Or maybe I can adjust variables. Let me think. Let me assume that d is non-zero. Let me compute d = b -a. But if d is negative, then perhaps I can swap a and b? Because the problem is symmetric in a and b. Because if I swap a and b, then the same logic applies. So for example, if a=10, b=6, then d = -4. Then, the problem is to find x such that y = x + (-4) = x-4. But since y = b +k = 6 +k. Also, x = a +k = 10 +k. So y = x -4 → 6 +k = 10 +k -4 → 6 +k = 6 +k. So yes. So regardless of whether d is positive or negative, the approach is similar.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to take the absolute value. Let me think. Let me define d = |a - b|. Then, the difference between the two numbers is d. Because if a and b are different, then the difference between x and y is fixed. So perhaps I should take d as the absolute value of (a -b). But maybe not. Let me think again. Let me suppose that a < b. So d = b -a. Then, the two numbers are x and x +d. If a > b, then d = b -a is negative, and the two numbers are x and x +d, which would be x and something smaller. But perhaps it's easier to take the absolute value. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute d as the absolute difference between a and b. Let me take d = abs(a - b). Then, the problem becomes to find x and y such that |x - y| = d, and x and y are as small as possible, etc. But perhaps I need to adjust the approach accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the earlier analysis, the key was that GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So if d is negative, then GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d) = GCD(x, |d|). So perhaps taking d as the absolute difference is better. Let me set d = |a -b|. Then, the problem is to find x and y such that |x - y| = d, and x and y are as small as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|. Then, find the minimal k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. Let me think of the two cases where a < b or a > b. Let's assume that a < b. Then, d = b -a. So the numbers are x and x +d, where x = a +k. So the LCM is LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/gcd(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/g, where g = gcd(x, d). So the problem becomes to find x ≥ a such that this value is minimized.\n\nNow, to find the optimal x, we can consider that the optimal x is such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d. Because the maximum possible g is the maximum divisor of d. For example, if d is 4, then the maximum possible g is 4. So if x is a multiple of 4, then the GCD(x, d) is 4. Which would give the LCM as x*(x +4)/4. So for example, if x is 4, then LCM(4, 8) is 8. Which is better than other possibilities.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = abs(a - b). If d is zero, return 0.\n\n- Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d, find the minimal x ≥ a such that x is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM for this x and x +d. Then compare all these possibilities to find the one with the minimal LCM, and the minimal k.\n\nWait, but why do we need to consider all divisors of d? Because the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is the maximum divisor of d. So by considering all divisors, we can find the maximum possible g, which would lead to the minimal LCM.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think. For example, suppose d is 4. Then the divisors are 1, 2, 4. For each of these, find the minimal x ≥ a that is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM for that x. Then choose the best among them.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input where a=6, b=10, d=4. So the divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\ng=1: minimal x ≥6 is 6. Then x=6, y=10. LCM(6,10)=30.\n\ng=2: minimal x ≥6 is 6 (since 6 is divisible by 2). x=6, y=10. LCM(6,10)=30. Same as before.\n\ng=4: minimal x ≥6 is 8 (since 6 is not divisible by 4, next is 8). Then x=8, y=12. LCM(8, 12) is 24. Which is better.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved with x=8, which gives k=8-6=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to generate all divisors of d, for each find the minimal x ≥a that is a multiple of g, then compute the LCM for that x and x +d. Then select the x with the minimal LCM, and the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What if there's a value of x that is not a multiple of any divisor of d, but gives a higher GCD? No, because the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is the maximum divisor of d. So by checking all the divisors of d, we can find the maximum possible GCD(x, d), which would lead to the minimal LCM.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. If a == b, return 0.\n\n2. Else, compute d = abs(a - b).\n\n3. Find all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x ≥a such that x is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d (which is x*(x +d)/g).\n\n5. Among all these possibilities, select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple x's give the same LCM, pick the one with the smallest x (since k = x -a, which would be minimal if x is minimal).\n\nBut wait, what about the case where x is not a multiple of any divisor of d? Well, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d, so there must be some divisor of d that is the GCD(x, d). So considering all divisors of d would cover all possibilities.\n\nBut why do we need to check all divisors? Because the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is the maximum divisor of d. So by checking all divisors, we can find the best possible scenario.\n\nSo the plan is to generate all the divisors of d, then for each, compute the minimal x ≥a that is a multiple of that divisor. Then calculate the LCM for that x, and choose the best among them.\n\nBut how do I generate all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, to generate all the divisors of a number, we can factorize it and generate all possible products of the prime factors. But for d up to 1e9, this is feasible. However, for numbers up to 1e9, the number of divisors is manageable. For example, even for numbers with many factors like 1e6, the number of divisors is manageable.\n\nSo, the first thing is to generate all the divisors of d. Let's think about that.\n\nOnce we have the list of divisors, we can loop through each of them. For each divisor g, compute the minimal x >=a that is a multiple of g. How?\n\nThe minimal x is the smallest multiple of g that is >=a. So:\n\nIf a % g == 0, then x = a.\n\nElse, x = ((a // g) + 1) * g.\n\nOnce we have x, then compute the LCM of x and x +d. But since x +d is x + (b -a) if a < b. Wait, no, since d is |a -b|. Let me think again. Suppose a < b, so d = b -a. Then x is a +k, and y is x +d = a +k +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. Which is correct.\n\nBut for the general case, when d is |a -b|, then x +d is either (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k, if a < b, or (a +k) + (a -b) = a +k + (a -b) = 2a -b +k. But in any case, the difference between x and y is d. So the LCM calculation is as before.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, compute x as above, then compute the LCM of x and x +d (or y = x +d, which is (a +k) + (b -a) if a < b, which is b +k, but in any case, the LCM is computed between x and y, which is x +d.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM? Well, LCM(x, y) = x * y // GCD(x, y). But since y = x +d, and d is known. But since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g (since g is a divisor of d), then GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d) = g. Because x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g. So the GCD of x and d is g. Therefore, the LCM(x, x +d) is (x * (x +d)) / g. So for each x generated from a divisor g, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) // g.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can compute this value.\n\nOnce we have all those possibilities, we can find the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple with the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (which gives the smallest k).\n\nBut wait, what if there are other x's not generated by divisors of d that could result in a smaller LCM? For example, suppose there is an x that is not a multiple of any divisor of d. But since d is fixed, and GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d, then that x would be considered under the divisor g = GCD(x, d). So that case is already covered.\n\nTherefore, considering all divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b). If d is 0, return 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n   compute x = minimal multiple of g >= a.\n\n   compute the LCM value (x * (x +d)) // g.\n\n   keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding x.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, find the x that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple x's have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x (so that k is minimal).\n\nThen, the answer is x - a.\n\nBut wait, there's another case. What if the minimal LCM occurs when x is not a multiple of any of the divisors of d? But according to previous reasoning, that's not possible. Because for any x, GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d, so x is a multiple of that divisor. Therefore, the x that gives the maximum GCD(x, d) is considered in our approach.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where two different divisors of d can generate x's with the same LCM. For example, maybe two different divisors generate x's that lead to the same LCM. So we need to compare all possibilities.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate all the divisors of d, process each as above, and then select the best option.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut first, how to generate the divisors of d.\n\nTo generate all divisors of a number, we can first find its prime factors, then generate all combinations. However, for numbers up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps the easiest way is to generate all divisors via trial division.\n\nLet me think of a function to generate all divisors of a number n.\n\nFunction get_divisors(n):\n\n   if n == 0: return [] (but in our case, d is non-zero)\n\n   divisors = set()\n\n   for i in 1 to sqrt(n):\n\n      if n % i == 0:\n\n         divisors.add(i)\n\n         divisors.add(n//i)\n\n   return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but for example, for n=4, this would generate 1, 2, 4.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nBut note that for the case where d is zero, which we already handled earlier.\n\nSo, once we have the list of divisors, we can proceed.\n\nBut in the code, we need to generate all divisors of d, then for each of them, compute x as the minimal multiple of g that is >=a.\n\nBut wait, what if a is larger than the value of x computed for a divisor g? For example, suppose a is 10, and g is 4. Then the minimal x is 12. But if a is 10, then x is 12, which is okay.\n\nSo for each divisor g, compute x as:\n\nif a % g == 0:\n\n   x = a\n\nelse:\n\n   x = ((a // g) + 1) * g\n\nOnce x is found, compute the LCM value.\n\nBut then, after considering all the divisors, we have to find the x that gives the minimal LCM. Then, the corresponding k is x -a.\n\nBut what about the case where the optimal x is not generated by any of the divisors? Well, according to previous reasoning, that's not possible.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: a=6, b=10. d=4. Divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=1:\n\nx is 6 (since 6%1 ==0). LCM is (6 * (6+4))/1 = 6*10/1=60.\n\ng=2:\n\nx is 6 (since 6%2 ==0). LCM is (6*10)/2= 30.\n\ng=4:\n\na is 6. 6%4 is 2, so x = ((6//4)+1)*4 = (1 +1)*4 = 8. LCM is (8 * 12)/4 = 96/4=24.\n\nSo the minimal is 24. So k is 8 -6 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: input '5 10' → output is 0. Let's see.\n\na=5, b=10. d=5.\n\ndivisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nfor each:\n\ng=1: x is 5. LCM(5, 5+5=10) → LCM(5,10)=10.\n\ng=5: x is 5 (since 5%5==0). LCM(5, 10) is 10. So same as before. So the minimal LCM is 10. Which occurs for x=5 (k=0) and x=5 (k=0). So the answer is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is '21 31'. Output is 9.\n\nLet's compute:\n\na=21, b=31 → d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=1: x=21. LCM(21, 21+10=31) → LCM(21,31) = 651.\n\ng=2: x is 22 (since 21%2=1 → (21//2=10 → 10+1=11 → 11*2=22). Then x=22, y=32. LCM(22,32) = (22*32)/2 = 352.\n\ng=5: x is 25 (since 21%5=1 → (21//5=4) +1 =5 → 5*5=25). Then x=25, y=35. LCM(25,35) is (25*35)/5 = 175.\n\ng=10: x is 30 (since 21%10=1 → 21//10=2 → 2+1=3 → 3*10=30). x=30, y=40. LCM(30,40) is (30*40)/10 = 120.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 120, which occurs for x=30. So k=30-21=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM?\n\nFor example, suppose two different divisors generate x's with the same LCM. Then, we need to choose the one with the smallest x (so that k is minimal).\n\nAnother example: suppose a=4, b=6. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\nFor g=1: x=4. LCM(4,6) is 12.\n\nFor g=2: x=4. LCM(4,6) is 12. So same LCM. But x is same. So k is 0. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=5. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\ng=1: x=3. LCM(3,5)=15.\n\ng=2: x=4. LCM(4,6) is 12. So better. So answer is 4-3=1.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   d = abs(a - b)\n\n   generate all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n      compute x as minimal multiple of g >= a.\n\n      compute current_lcm = (x * (x +d)) // g.\n\n      keep track of the minimal lcm, and the corresponding x.\n\n   among all x's, select the one with minimal lcm. if tie, select the smallest x.\n\n   then, the answer is x -a.\n\nBut how to generate the divisors of d?\n\nImplementing that.\n\nBut for d=0, which is handled earlier.\n\nBut code-wise, the code for generating divisors needs to handle d=0? No, because in the case a == b, we return 0 immediately.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, for generating divisors of d.\n\nBut for d=0, but that's handled before.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return list(divisors)\n\nBut note that for n=0, this would be a problem, but in our code, n is d which is non-zero.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, process each.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead a and b from input. For example, the input is given as a list of test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e9).\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input, the first input is ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'] but that's probably for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided examples with multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, the problem's input is:\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers. So the sample input given in the problem is probably for multiple test cases, but perhaps the user made a mistake. However, looking back, the problem's sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem requires to process one test case per input.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e9).\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines, which might be part of a programming competition's multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one line. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line. But the user's note says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases.\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line with a and b, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user shows multiple lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is only one line. So perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code should process one line.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, the code should read a and b from the input.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n\n    return divisors\n\ndef main():\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        return\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute x as the minimal multiple of g >= a\n\n        if a % g == 0:\n\n            x = a\n\n        else:\n\n            x = ((a // g) + 1) * g\n\n        # compute current lcm\n\n        y = x + d\n\n        current_gcd = g\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        # compare with min_lcm\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and x < best_x):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_x = x\n\n            best_k = x - a\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm and x < best_x:\n\n            best_x = x\n\n            best_k = x -a\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but in the code above, how to track best_x and best_k?\n\nWait, the code needs to track the x that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple x's have the same LCM, the smallest x is chosen (so that k is minimal).\n\nSo in the code, during the iteration over the divisors, for each candidate x, compute current_lcm. Compare with the current min_lcm. If it's smaller, update. If it's equal, check if the x is smaller than the previous best x. If so, update.\n\nBut in the code above, the variables min_lcm, best_x, best_k are being tracked.\n\nBut initial code may have errors. Let's think again.\n\nInitialize min_lcm as infinity. best_x as None. Then, for each candidate x:\n\ncurrent_lcm = ... \n\nif current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n   min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n   best_x = x\n\nelif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n   if x < best_x:\n\n       best_x = x\n\nSo in code:\n\nInitially, min_lcm is infinity. best_x is None.\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n    compute x...\n\n    current_lcm = ...\n\n    if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n        min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n        best_x = x\n\n    elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n        if x < best_x:\n\n            best_x = x\n\nSo after processing all divisors, the best_x is the x that gives the minimal LCM, and the smallest x in case of ties.\n\nOnce best_x is found, the answer is best_x -a.\n\nBut in the code above, there's a variable best_k, but perhaps that's redundant. Once best_x is found, k is best_x -a.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize best_x as None.\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n    compute x...\n\n    compute current_lcm...\n\n    if best_x is None or current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and x < best_x):\n\n        update min_lcm and best_x.\n\nOnce done, the answer is best_x -a.\n\nBut in code:\n\nIn the code, the initial code may have a mistake. Let me rework the code:\n\ndef main():\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        return\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_x = None\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute x as the minimal multiple of g >= a\n\n        if a % g == 0:\n\n            x = a\n\n        else:\n\n            x = ((a // g) + 1) * g\n\n        # compute current lcm\n\n        y = x + d\n\n        current_gcd = g\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        # compare with min_lcm\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_x = x\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if x < best_x:\n\n                best_x = x\n\n    print(best_x - a)\n\nBut wait, what if the divisors list is empty? No, because d is non-zero, and for any d >=1, the divisors will include 1 and d. So the divisors list is not empty.\n\nBut what if d is 0? That's handled earlier.\n\nBut what if the code for get_divisors returns empty? For example, if d is 0. But in that case, the code returns 0, so the code for get_divisors is not called.\n\nSo this should be okay.\n\nBut let's test the code with sample input 1: a=6, b=10. d=4. divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: x=6, current_lcm is (6*10)/1 = 60. min_lcm is 60, best_x is 6.\n\ng=2: x=6. current_lcm is (6*10)/2=30. less than 60. min_lcm is 30, best_x is 6.\n\ng=4: x=8. current_lcm is (8 * 12)/4 = 24. less than 30. min_lcm is 24, best_x is 8. So answer is 8-6=2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: a=5, b=10. d=5. divisors are 1,5.\n\ng=1: x=5. y=5+5=10. LCM(5*10)/1 = 50. min_lcm is 50.\n\ng=5: x=5. y=10. LCM is (5*10)/5=10. So min_lcm becomes 10. best_x is 5. So answer is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: a=21, b=31. d=10. divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\ng=1: x=21. y=31. LCM(21*31)/1 = 651.\n\ng=2: x=22. y=32. LCM is 22*32 / 2 = 352.\n\ng=5: x=25. y=35. LCM 25*35 /5 = 175.\n\ng=10: x=30. y=40. LCM 30*40 /10 = 120. So best_x is 30. k=30-21=9. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM?\n\nFor example, suppose a=4, b=6. d=2. divisors are 1,2.\n\ng=1: x=4. LCM is (4*6)/1 =24.\n\ng=2: x=4. LCM is (4*6)/2=12. So best",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized.
