    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D values. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the conditions properly. Since the triangle has sides x, y, z, and they have to satisfy x ≤ y ≤ z (because x is up to B, y starts from B and up to C, and z starts from C up to D). Wait, no. Wait the problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be between A and B, y between B and C, z between C and D. But also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, then x ≤ y. Similarly, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then y ≤ z. So overall, x ≤ y ≤ z. That's important because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because if x ≤ y ≤ z, then the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold as long as x + y > z. So the main condition we need to check is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already enforced by the ranges), and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute this? Because the ranges can be up to 5e5, so brute force checking all possible triplets would be O(B * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)), which is way too slow for large values. For example, if all ranges are 5e5, then B could be 5e5, and so on. That would be O((5e5)^3) operations, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we need an efficient approach. Let's think about how to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the variables:\n\nWe can iterate over possible y and z, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, for each possible y and z, find the number of x's that satisfy x ≥ (some value) such that x + y > z. But since x is in [A, B], and x ≤ y (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, but x can be up to B and y can be as low as B. So for x, the maximum possible value is B, and the minimum is A. Also, since x ≤ y, and y is fixed for a particular iteration, maybe we can find for each y and z, the valid x's.\n\nWait, but the problem is that y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. And for each such y and z, the x must satisfy x ≥ (z - y + 1) (since x + y > z → x > z - y → x ≥ z - y + 1). Also, x must be in [A, B], and x ≤ y (since x ≤ B ≤ y). Wait, but since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, then x ≤ y is automatically true. So x can be between max(A, z - y + 1) and B. But wait, z can be larger than y. For example, if z is larger than y, then z - y + 1 could be positive. However, if z is smaller than y, then z - y + 1 is negative. But since x is at least A (which is ≥1), then x ≥ 1, so in that case, all x's would satisfy x + y > z. But since y ≤ z (because y is up to C and z starts from C), so z ≥ y. Therefore, z is always ≥ y. Therefore, z - y is ≥ 0, so z - y + 1 is ≥ 1. Therefore, for each pair (y, z), the lower bound for x is max(A, z - y + 1). But since x can't be larger than B, the number of valid x's is max(0, B - max(A, z - y + 1) + 1).\n\nWait, but since x must be ≥ A and ≤ B, and also ≥ (z - y + 1). So the lower bound for x is lower = max(A, z - y + 1). The upper bound is upper = B. If lower > upper, then there are no valid x's. Otherwise, the count is upper - lower + 1.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all possible y in [B, C], z in [C, D], of (number of x's for that y and z).\n\nBut how do we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nBecause for each y and z, we can compute the count of x's. However, if we iterate over all possible y and z, that would be O((C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)) operations. Let's see the worst case: suppose B = C = D = 5e5, then the number of pairs (y, z) is (5e5 - B + 1) * (D - C + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1. But if B is small, like B=1, and C=5e5, D=5e5, then it's (5e5 - 1 + 1) * 1 = 5e5 operations. Which is manageable. But if B is 5e5, C is 5e5, D is 5e5, then it's 1 * 1 = 1. So overall, the number of pairs (y, z) is (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1). Let's call the number of y's as m = C - B + 1, and the number of z's as n = D - C + 1. Then m * n can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. So iterating through all possible pairs of y and z is not feasible for large cases. For example, if B is 1, C is 5e5, D is 5e5, then m is 5e5, n is 1, so 5e5 iterations. That's acceptable. But if B is 1, C is 5e5, D is 5e5, then m is 5e5, n is 1. But if D is 5e5 + 5e5, then n is 5e5, and m is 5e5, then m * n is 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible for the worst case. Therefore, we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's fix y and z, but find a way to compute the sum over all possible z for a given y. Let's think about for each y, how to compute the sum over z in [C, D] of the count of x's for that y and z.\n\nLet me think for a fixed y. For each z in [C, D], the required x must be ≥ max(A, z - y + 1) and ≤ B. Let's denote the lower bound as L_z = max(A, z - y + 1). The number of x's is max(0, B - L_z + 1). But since z varies from C to D, perhaps we can find for each y, the range of z where z - y + 1 is less than or equal to B, and greater than B, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed y, let's find the minimal z where z - y + 1 > B. Because for such z, L_z = z - y + 1 > B. Then the number of x's is 0. For z where z - y + 1 ≤ B, then L_z is max(A, z - y + 1). So for those z, the count is B - max(A, z - y + 1) + 1.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently for all z in [C, D]?\n\nLet me think about for fixed y. Let's consider the value of z. Let me define for each z, the term is:\n\ncount_x = max(0, B - max(A, z - y + 1) + 1)\n\nBut since z >= C, and y is in [B, C], then z >= C >= y. So z - y + 1 can be written as (z - y + 1) = (z + 1) - y.\n\nLet me think of z varying from C to D, and for each z, compute the value of (z - y + 1). Let me denote t = z - y + 1. Then, for each z, t ranges from C - y + 1 to D - y + 1.\n\nBut since z >= C, and y is fixed, t starts at C - y + 1.\n\nNow, for each t, the lower bound for x is max(A, t). So the count_x is:\n\nif max(A, t) > B → 0\n\nelse B - max(A, t) + 1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nif t > B → then max(A, t) is t, which is > B → count_x is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nmax(A, t) is either A (if t < A) or t (if t >= A). So:\n\nif t < A → count_x = B - A + 1\n\nif A <= t <= B → count_x = B - t + 1.\n\nSo for a fixed y, the sum over z is the sum over all z in [C, D] of:\n\nif (z - y + 1) > B → 0\n\nelse:\n\nif (z - y + 1) < A → (B - A + 1)\n\nelse → (B - (z - y + 1) + 1) = B - z + y - 1 + 1 = B - z + y.\n\nSo the problem now becomes, for each y, compute the sum over z in [C, D] of the above terms.\n\nLet me rephrase this. For a fixed y, let me find the range of z where z - y + 1 <= B. That is, z <= B + y -1. But since z >= C, the valid z's are in the interval [C, min(D, B + y - 1)].\n\nIf this interval is empty, then the sum is 0.\n\nOtherwise, within this interval, we need to split into two parts: where z - y + 1 < A, and where z - y + 1 >= A.\n\nLet me find for a given y, the lower and upper bounds of z.\n\nFirst, the z must be between C and D. Also, z must be <= (B + y - 1). Let me define z_max = min(D, B + y - 1). If z_max < C, then there are no such z, so contribution is 0.\n\nElse, the z ranges from C to z_max.\n\nWithin this range, z - y + 1 ranges from (C - y + 1) to (z_max - y + 1). Let me denote this as t_low = C - y + 1 and t_high = z_max - y + 1.\n\nNow, for t_low to t_high, which is the same as z varying from C to z_max.\n\nWe need to find for each z in this range, whether t = z - y + 1 is less than A or not.\n\nSo, solving for z:\n\nt < A → z - y + 1 < A → z < A + y - 1 → z <= A + y - 2.\n\nSo the z's that contribute the first case (count_x = B - A + 1) are those z in [C, min(z_max, A + y - 2)].\n\nThe remaining z's in [max(C, A + y - 1), z_max] contribute (B - z + y) per z.\n\nSo for each y, the contribution is:\n\ncontribution = (number of z in first part) * (B - A + 1) + sum_{z in second part} (B - z + y).\n\nSo the problem is now, for each y, compute these two parts.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFor a given y:\n\nCompute z_min = C\n\nz_max = min(D, B + y - 1)\n\nif z_max < z_min → contribution is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the threshold_z = A + y - 2.\n\nThe first part's upper limit is min(z_max, threshold_z). Let's call this z1_upper = min(z_max, threshold_z).\n\nThe first part's lower limit is z_min. So the number of z in first part is max(0, z1_upper - z_min + 1). Let's call this count1.\n\nThen, the second part is from z2_lower = max(z_min, threshold_z + 1) to z_max. Let's call this z2_lower and z2_upper = z_max. The number of elements here is count2 = max(0, z2_upper - z2_lower + 1).\n\nFor the first part, the contribution is count1 * (B - A + 1), provided that B >= A. Which it is, since A ≤ B.\n\nFor the second part, the sum is sum_{z = z2_lower}^{z2_upper} (B - z + y) = sum_{z} ( (B + y) - z )\n\nWhich is equal to (B + y) * count2 - sum_{z=z2_lower}^{z2_upper} z.\n\nThe sum of z from a to b is (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2.\n\nSo putting this all together, for each y, we can compute the contribution in O(1) time.\n\nThus, the overall algorithm is:\n\nLoop over each possible y in [B, C].\n\nFor each y:\n\nCalculate z_max = min(D, B + y - 1)\n\nif z_max < C → continue (no contribution)\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate threshold_z = A + y - 2\n\nz1_upper = min(z_max, threshold_z)\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1) if z1_upper >= C else 0\n\ncontribution1 = count1 * (B - A + 1) if B >= A else 0 (but since A ≤ B, this is always okay)\n\nThen, z2_lower = max(C, threshold_z + 1)\n\nif z2_lower > z_max → contribution2 = 0\n\nelse:\n\ncount2 = z_max - z2_lower + 1\n\nsum_z = (z2_lower + z_max) * count2 // 2\n\ncontribution2 = (B + y) * count2 - sum_z\n\ntotal_contribution = contribution1 + contribution2\n\nAdd this to the total.\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(C - B + 1) = O(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this correctly, handling all edge cases.\n\nLet me test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet me see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo y ranges from B=2 to C=3. So y can be 2 or 3.\n\nLet's process each y:\n\nCase y=2:\n\nz_max = min(4, B + y -1) = min(4, 2 + 2 -1) = min(4, 3) = 3.\n\nz_min is C=3. So z ranges from 3 to 3 (only z=3).\n\nthreshold_z = A + y -2 = 1 + 2 -2 = 1. So z1_upper is min(3, 1) → 1. But z_min is 3. So z1_upper < z_min → count1 is 0.\n\nThen z2_lower = max(3, 1+1)= max(3,2) → 3. z2_upper is 3.\n\ncount2 = 1.\n\nsum_z = 3.\n\ncontribution2 = (2 + 2)*1 - 3 = 4 -3 = 1.\n\nSo for this y=2, contribution is 0 +1 = 1.\n\nBut wait, what's the actual count for y=2 and z=3?\n\nFor each z=3, the required x is ≥ max(1, 3 - 2 + 1) = max(1, 2) = 2. So x can be 2 (since B=2). So count_x is 2 - 2 +1 = 1. Which matches the contribution of 1. So correct.\n\nNow for y=3:\n\nz_max = min(4, 2 + 3 -1) = min(4, 4) =4.\n\nz_min is 3. So z ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nthreshold_z = 1 +3 -2 = 2. So z1_upper is min(4, 2) = 2. But z_min is 3. So z1_upper < z_min → count1 is 0.\n\nz2_lower is max(3, 2+1)=3. So z ranges from 3 to 4.\n\ncount2 = 4-3 +1 =2.\n\nsum_z = (3 +4) *2 /2 = 7*2/2 =7.\n\ncontribution2 = (2 +3)*2 -7 = 5*2 -7 = 10-7=3.\n\nSo for y=3, contribution is 3.\n\nSo total contribution is 1+3=4, which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. So y ranges from B=2 to C=2. Only y=2.\n\nz_max = min(5, 2+2-1) = min(5,3) =3. So z ranges from C=2 to 3.\n\nWait, C is 2, so z ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nWait, for y=2:\n\nz_max = min(5, 2 + 2 -1) = 3. So z ranges from C=2 to 3.\n\nthreshold_z = A + y -2 = 1 +2 -2 =1.\n\nSo z1_upper is min(3, 1) =1. But z_min is 2. So count1 is 0.\n\nz2_lower is max(2, 1+1)=2. So z ranges from 2 to 3.\n\ncount2 = 3-2 +1 =2.\n\nsum_z = (2+3)*2/2 =5.\n\ncontribution2 = (2+2)*2 -5 = 8 -5 =3.\n\nWhich is the total contribution. Which matches the sample output of 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000. So y ranges from B=500000 to C=500000. Only y=500000.\n\nz_max is min(500000, B + y -1) → B is 500000, y is 500000. So 500000 + 500000 -1 = 999999, but D is 500000. So z_max = 500000. z ranges from C=500000 to 500000 (only z=500000).\n\nthreshold_z = A + y -2 = 500000 +500000 -2 = 999998. So z1_upper is min(500000, 999998) →500000. So z1_upper is 500000. z_min is 500000. So count1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 =1.\n\ncontribution1 is 1 * (B -A +1) → since B=A, this is 1*(1) =1. Then, z2_lower is max(500000, threshold_z +1) = max(500000, 999998 +1) = 999999. Which is larger than z_max (500000). So contribution2 is 0. Total contribution is 1. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to work for the samples.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop y from B to C inclusive:\n\nfor y in range(B, C+1):\n\nThen for each y:\n\nCompute z_max = min(D, B + y -1)\n\nif z_max < C → continue.\n\nElse:\n\nthreshold_z = A + y - 2\n\nz1_upper = min(z_max, threshold_z)\n\nz_min = C\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - z_min + 1) if z1_upper >= z_min else 0.\n\nWait, z1_upper can be less than z_min. So count1 is 0 in that case.\n\nBut how to compute it?\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - z_min + 1) if z1_upper >= z_min else 0 → but z1_upper can be >= z_min?\n\nWait, z1_upper is min(z_max, threshold_z). And z_max >= C (since earlier check: z_max >= C).\n\nBut threshold_z can be anything.\n\nSo for example, if threshold_z is 5, and z_min is 3, then z1_upper is min(z_max, 5). So if z_max is 6, then z1_upper is 5. So z1_upper >= z_min (3) → count is 5-3+1=3.\n\nBut if threshold_z is 2, and z_min is 3, then z1_upper is 2, which is less than z_min → count1 is 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncount1 = 0\n\nif z1_upper >= z_min:\n\n    count1 = z1_upper - z_min + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    count1 = 0\n\nBut in code, we can write:\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - z_min + 1) if z1_upper >= z_min else 0 → but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since z_min is C, and z1_upper can be computed as:\n\nz1_upper = min(z_max, threshold_z)\n\nthen:\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1) if z1_upper >= C else 0 → but z1_upper >= C is equivalent to z1_upper >= z_min (since z_min is C). So in code:\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1) if z1_upper >= C else 0 → but how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, compute:\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1) if (z1_upper >= C) else 0 → but in code, since z1_upper can be less than C, then the value would be negative. So:\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1)\n\nWait, no. Because if z1_upper is less than C, then z1_upper - C + 1 is (something less than C) - C +1 → which is negative. So taking max(0, ...) would give zero. So yes, count1 can be written as max(0, z1_upper - C + 1).\n\nYes. Because:\n\nif z1_upper >= C → then z1_upper - C +1 is positive.\n\nif not, then it's negative, and max(0, ...) is zero.\n\nSo that's a simpler way.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncount1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1)\n\ncontribution1 = count1 * (B - A + 1)\n\nThen, for the second part:\n\nz2_lower = max(C, threshold_z + 1)\n\nif z2_lower > z_max → contribution2 = 0\n\nelse:\n\ncount2 = z_max - z2_lower + 1\n\nsum_z = (z2_lower + z_max) * count2 // 2\n\ncontribution2 = (B + y) * count2 - sum_z\n\nAdd contribution1 + contribution2 to total.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for very large numbers, we need to make sure that integer operations are handled properly, but in Python that's not a problem.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge case when A = B = C = D. Like the third sample. It works.\n\nAnother edge case: when B = C, and D is large. For example, A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. Which is the second sample. Which worked.\n\nAnother edge case: when y is such that B + y -1 is less than C. For example, A=1, B=1, C=3, D=5. For y=1, B + y -1 = 1 + 1 -1 =1. Which is less than C=3. So z_max is 1, which is less than C=3. So no contribution.\n\nAnother case: when z_max is larger than D. For example, if B + y -1 is larger than D, then z_max is D.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input. But the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. Wait, the sample input shows three lines, but that's probably because the user provided multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines, each being a separate test case. So the code must read multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nWhich is three test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the code needs to read multiple lines, each line being a separate test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is multiple lines, each line is a test case. For example, the sample input shows three lines. So the code must read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's input description, it says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the original problem is for a single test case. But the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the sample input, but the actual code should read one line of input. Or perhaps the problem is that the code should read multiple lines, each being a separate test case.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. But in the sample input, there are three lines. So perhaps the problem expects multiple test cases. For example, the sample input shows three test cases, and the output is three lines. So the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nTherefore, the code must read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo the code should read all input lines, split them into individual test cases, and process them.\n\nBut how to read input in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, and process.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '1 2 3 4', and the output is '4', etc.\n\nSo the code must process each line as a separate test case.\n\nNow, implement the algorithm for each test case.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor y in range(B, C+1):\n\n    z_max = min(D, B + y - 1)\n\n    if z_max < C:\n\n        continue\n\n    threshold_z = A + y - 2\n\n    z1_upper = min(z_max, threshold_z)\n\n    count1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1)\n\n    contribution1 = count1 * (B - A + 1)\n\n    z2_lower = max(C, threshold_z + 1)\n\n    if z2_lower > z_max:\n\n        contribution2 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count2 = z_max - z2_lower + 1\n\n        sum_z = (z2_lower + z_max) * count2 // 2\n\n        contribution2 = (B + y) * count2 - sum_z\n\n    total += contribution1 + contribution2\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if B + y -1 is very large, but D is smaller?\n\nYes, handled by z_max = min(...).\n\nNow, testing this code for the first sample:\n\nSample 1: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ny ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nz_max = min(4, 2 + 2 -1) = min(4, 3) → 3. Which is >= C=3. So proceed.\n\nthreshold_z = 1 + 2 -2 = 1.\n\nz1_upper = min(3, 1) → 1. count1 = max(0, 1 -3 +1) → 1-3+1= -1 → 0.\n\ncontribution1 = 0.\n\nz2_lower = max(3, 1+1) = max(3, 2) →3. which is <= z_max (3). count2 = 3-3 +1 =1. sum_z = (3+3)*1//2 = 3. contribution2 = (2 + 2)*1 -3 = 4-3=1. So total += 1.\n\nFor y=3:\n\nz_max = min(4, 2 +3 -1) = min(4,4) →4. >= C=3.\n\nthreshold_z = 1 +3 -2 = 2.\n\nz1_upper = min(4, 2) →2. count1 = max(0, 2 -3 +1) → 0. contribution1 = 0.\n\nz2_lower = max(3, 2+1) = max(3,3) →3. <=4.\n\ncount2 = 4-3 +1 =2.\n\nsum_z = (3+4)*2//2 = 7*2//2 =7.\n\ncontribution2 = (2+3)*2 -7 →5*2=10-7=3. total += 3 → total is 4. Correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother sample: the second sample input is 1 2 2 5.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. So y ranges from 2 to 2.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nz_max = min(5, 2 + 2 -1) = min(5, 3) =3. >= C=2.\n\nthreshold_z = 1 +2 -2 =1.\n\nz1_upper = min(3, 1) →1. count1 = max(0, 1 -2 +1) = 0. contribution1 = 0.\n\nz2_lower = max(2, 1+1) = max(2, 2) =2. <=3.\n\ncount2 = 3 -2 +1 = 2. sum_z = (2+3)*2//2 = 5*2//2 =5.\n\ncontribution2 = (2+2)*2 -5 = 8-5=3 → total is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample: A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\ny ranges from 500000 to 500000.\n\nFor y=500000:\n\nz_max = min(500000, 500000 + 500000 -1) → min(500000, 999999) →500000. >= C=500000.\n\nthreshold_z = 500000 + 500000 -2 = 999998.\n\nz1_upper = min(500000, 999998) →500000.\n\ncount1 = max(0, 500000 - 500000 +1) = 1. contribution1 = 1 * (500000 - 500000 +1) →1*1=1.\n\nz2_lower = max(500000, 999998 +1) →max(500000, 999999) →999999. which is > z_max (500000). contribution2=0. total is 1. Correct.\n\nSo code works for these cases.\n\nNow, think about other edge cases.\n\nCase where A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then y is 1. z_max is min(1, 1 +1 -1) = min(1,1) =1. threshold_z =1 +1-2=0. z1_upper = min(1, 0) →0. count1 = max(0, 0 -1 +1) →0. contribution1=0. z2_lower = max(1, 0+1)=1. count2 =1-1+1=1. sum_z =1. contribution2 = (1+1)*1 -1 = 2-1=1. total is 1. Which is correct: (1,1,1) is valid.\n\nAnother case: A=2, B=3, C=3, D=3. So y ranges from 3 to 3. For y=3:\n\nz_max = min(3, 3 +3 -1) = min(3,5) →3. threshold_z = 2 +3 -2 =3. z1_upper = min(3,3) →3. count1 = 3 -3 +1 =1. contribution1 is 1 * (3-2 +1) = 1*2=2. Then z2_lower = max(3, 3+1)=4. which is >3. contribution2=0. total is 2. What are the valid triangles?\n\nx can be between 2 and 3. For z=3 and y=3. The condition x + y > z →x +3>3 →x>0. Since x ≥2, all x in [2,3] are valid. So for x=2,3. So 2 possibilities. Which matches the code's result of 2.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=5. Let's compute for y=3.\n\nz_max = min(5, 3+3-1) = min(5,5) =5. threshold_z = 1 +3-2=2. z1_upper = min(5, 2) →2. count1 = max(0, 2 -3 +1) = 0. contribution1=0. z2_lower = max(3, 2+1)=3. count2 =5-3+1=3. sum_z = (3+5)*3//2 = 8*3//2 =12. contribution2 = (3+3)*3 -12 = 18-12=6. So for this y=3, contribution is 6. Let's see:\n\nFor z in 3,4,5:\n\nFor each z, the required x is ≥ max(1, z -3 +1) = max(1, z-2). So:\n\nz",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints based on given integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The constraints are $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. For sides in non-decreasing order $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the key condition is $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate over possible values of $y$**: Since $y$ ranges from $B$ to $C$, we iterate through each value in this range.\n2. **Determine valid $z$ values for each $y$**: For each $y$, compute the maximum possible value of $z$ such that $z \\leq B + y - 1$ and $z \\leq D$.\n3. **Calculate valid $x$ values for each pair $(y, z)$**: For each valid $z$, determine the range of $x$ values that satisfy $x + y > z$ and lie within $[A, B]$.\n4. **Efficiently compute contributions**: Use mathematical range calculations to efficiently compute the number of valid $x$ values without iterating through all possible combinations, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n    total = 0\n    for y in range(B, C + 1):\n        z_max = min(D, B + y - 1)\n        if z_max < C:\n            continue\n        threshold_z = A + y - 2\n        z1_upper = min(z_max, threshold_z)\n        count1 = max(0, z1_upper - C + 1)\n        contribution1 = count1 * (B - A + 1)\n        \n        z2_lower = max(C, threshold_z + 1)\n        if z2_lower > z_max:\n            contribution2 = 0\n        else:\n            count2 = z_max - z2_lower + 1\n            sum_z = (z2_lower + z_max) * count2 // 2\n            contribution2 = (B + y) * count2 - sum_z\n        \n        total += contribution1 + contribution2\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.split())\n        print(count_triangles(A, B, C, D))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Iterating Over $y$ Values**: For each $y$ in the range $[B, C]$, we determine the valid range of $z$ values.\n3. **Range Calculations**: For each $y$, we calculate the threshold $z$ values to split the valid $z$ range into two parts: those where $x$ can be bounded by $A$ and those where $x$ is bounded by $z$.\n4. **Mathematical Contributions**: Using arithmetic series and range calculations, we efficiently compute the contributions of valid $x$ values for each $y$ and $z$ pair, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large input sizes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles without explicitly iterating through all possible combinations, making the solution feasible even for large input constraints.",
