He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, for a given m, I need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how?\n\nThe problem is that for some m, there might be no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, if m is 5, then let's see. Let me think: For n=24, the trailing zeros are 24/5=4 + 24/25=0 → 4. For n=25, it's 25/5=5 + 25/25=1 → total 6. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the trailing zeros is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero. Wait, but the sample input shows for m=1, the output is 5 numbers. Let me check that.\n\nIn the first sample input, m=1. The output is 5, 6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero. 6! is 720 → 1. Similarly up to 9! which is 362880 → 1 zero. Then 10! is 3628800 → 2 zeros. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. So how do we find these numbers?\n\nThe approach here is to find for each m, the possible n's that would produce exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\n1. For a given m, find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find those n's?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible range of n's that could result in m zeros. For example, for m=1, the possible n's are 5-9. But how to find that?\n\nThe key idea is that the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when n crosses multiples of 5, the count increases by more than one. For example, when n crosses 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). Therefore, for some m, there might be no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, m=5, as discussed earlier.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find that range?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or other numbers?) that satisfy the condition. Wait, in the sample, there are 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think. For example, when m is 1, the count of trailing zeros for n=5 is 1, and for n=6, 7, 8, 9, it's still 1. But when n=10, it's 2. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) give exactly 1 zero. So that's 5 numbers. So why is that? Because the next number after 5 (which is 10) increases the count by 2 (from 1 to 2). So between the numbers that generate m, there's a range of numbers where the count is m.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nLet me think of the function f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe can find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and the largest n where f(n) = m. Then all numbers between them will also have f(n) = m. But how to find those?\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n with f(n) = m. Because for some m, there may be no n. For example, m=5.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n where f(n) = m. If there's no such n, output 0. Otherwise, output the numbers between lower and upper.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and the maximal n where f(n) = m. The numbers between them are the answer.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Because the function f(n) is non-decreasing. So once we find the first occurrence of m, then the next numbers until the next increase in f(n) will also be m.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1, the first occurrence is at n=5. The next occurrence is until n=9, because at n=10, the count jumps to 2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers from min_n to max_n inclusive are the answers. The count is max_n - min_n + 1.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Then the max_n is that n-1. Because between min_n and (n-1), the count is m.\n\nSo for example, if for m=1, the first occurrence is at 5, and the next occurrence is when m becomes 2. The first occurrence of m=2 is at n=10. So the max_n is 9.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the first n where f(n) = m, and the first n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between first_n and (second_n -1) are the answers.\n\nBut how to find the first n where f(n) = m? Well, perhaps using binary search.\n\nBut first, how to find if there exists any n where f(n) = m. Because for some m, there is no such n. For example, m=5.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\n2. Check if f(low_n) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high_n.\n\n4. The numbers from low_n to high_n -1 are the valid numbers. So the count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut wait, let's take the sample case m=1. Let's compute low_n for m=1. The minimal n where f(n) >=1 is 5. f(5)=1. Then for m+1=2, find the minimal n where f(n)>=2. That is 10. So high_n is 10. So the valid numbers are from 5 to 9. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's find the low_n for m=5. Let's compute f(24) = 4 + 0 =4. f(25) = 5+1=6. So the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So there's no solution. Hence output is 0.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven m, find the possible numbers n such that f(n) = m. The steps are:\n\n- Check if there exists any n with f(n) = m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the range of n's where f(n) = m. The count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut how to compute f(n)? Well, the function f(n) is the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the term is zero.\n\nNow, how to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. This can be done via binary search. Similarly for m+1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, perform the following steps:\n\n- Find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= m. This can be done with binary search.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n- The answer is all numbers from n_low to n_high -1. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThe binary search needs to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. The possible range for n can be from 1 to some upper limit. What's the upper limit? Well, since for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because for example, 5*m /5 = m. So the upper limit can be 5*m. But perhaps even higher, but for binary search, we can use 5*m as the upper bound.\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct n_low. For m=5, the upper limit would be 25. But for m=5, the count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than m=5. So the binary search would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m=5. Which would be 25, but since count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m, then there's no solution.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m can be done between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut what if m is very large, like 1e5? Then 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search steps for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have this, we can check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, then no solution.\n\nElse, proceed to find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1. Then the answer is [low, ..., n_high -1].\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nn_low is 5. count_zeros(5) = 1.\n\nThen for m+1=2, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >=2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the answers. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, implement the helper function count_zeros(n).\n\nThen, find n_low for m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) is m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find n_high for m+1.\n\nThen the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are the answers.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m+1 is 0? Well, since m is at least 1, m+1 is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n   print 0\n\nelse:\n\n   compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\n   the count is (n_high -1) - n_low +1 = n_high - n_low.\n\n   So output that count and the numbers.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample m=1, n_high is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9. Which is 5 numbers. n_high - n_low = 10 -5 =5. Correct.\n\nSo the code would generate the list of numbers from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive.\n\nNow, the problem is that for some m, the n_high could be 0? No, because m is at least 1. So for m+1, the find_min_n would be for m+1.\n\nNow, the code for find_min_n:\n\nImplement a binary search function that takes target (m) and returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for binary search?\n\nWell, for the target m, the minimal n that can have count_zeros(n) >= m is 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because 5*m divided by 5 is m, and higher terms (like 25, etc.) add more.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, the actual n is smaller than 5*m. But for binary search, using 5*m as upper bound is safe.\n\nBut for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct value.\n\nBut for m=5, 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is >=5. So the binary search would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Which is 25? Or maybe lower?\n\nWait, for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4 <5. So the minimal n is 25. So yes, 5*m is 25.\n\nBut for m=6, the minimal n is 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. So 5*m is 30. So the upper bound is 30, which is larger than 25. So binary search would work.\n\nSo the upper bound for binary search is 5*m.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code for the binary search function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for target=0, but that's not part of the problem.\n\nNow, the count_zeros function:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut let's test the code for the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) returns 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nThen find_min_n(2) returns 10.\n\nso the answer is numbers from 5 to 9. So 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So since 6 !=5, output is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. find_min_n(6) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? Or higher?\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. For target=7, find_min_n(7) would be 25? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 <7. So the binary search for target=7 would go higher. Let's compute for n=25, 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6. So for target=7, the minimal n is 25+1=26? Let's check count_zeros(26) is same as 25. So no. Wait, 26//5 is 5, 26//25 is 1. So 5+1=6. Still 6. So for 25, 26, 27, 28, 29: count_zeros is 6. At 30, 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So for m=6, the numbers are from 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead m from input. Then process.\n\nBut the input is a single line containing m. However, in the example, the input is ['1', '5'], which seems like multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. But the example shows two inputs. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example input is:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the original problem has multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as two cases. Maybe the user provided a sample where the input is two different m's. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the example is showing two different test cases. For example, the first input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the code must read a single m from input. So the code should read m from stdin, process, and output the required answer.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of two elements. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. The example shows two input cases, but perhaps the first input is m=1, and the second is m=5. So the code must process a single m.\n\nSo the code should read m as input, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code is written for a single m.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead m from input. Then:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = 5*target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = n_high - n_low\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but in Python, range(n_low, n_high) gives numbers from n_low to n_high-1. So that's correct.\n\nBut for the sample input m=1, n_high is 10. So range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would output k = 10-5=5, and the numbers.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? The code would not process that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, testing for m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, what about m=6?\n\nn_low is find_min_n(6) → returns 25. count_zeros(25)=6 → yes. Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers are 25-29. Which is 5 numbers. So output 5 followed by them.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code uses binary search, which is O(log(5*m)) steps. Each step is O(log n) for the count_zeros function. So for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would take around 20 steps. Each count_zeros is O(log n) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: m=0. But according to the problem, m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nCase 2: m=1. As discussed.\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nFor m=2, find_min_n(2) is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\n10! → 2 zeros.\n\n11! → same as 10! *11 → 2 zeros.\n\nSame for 12, 13, 14. 15! has 3 zeros. So yes.\n\nSo code would output 5 numbers: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.\n\nAnother case: m=3. The numbers would be from 15 to 19. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut for m=4, the numbers would be 20-24. Because 20! has 4+0=4 zeros. 25! has 6. So for m=4, the numbers are 20-24. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m=6? As discussed earlier, 25-29. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo why does this happen? Because each time, when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. Except when it's a multiple of 25, which increases by 2. So when m is such that it's not a jump point, there are 5 numbers. But when m is a jump point, like m=5, then there's no solution.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut the code must read m from stdin, and output the required answer.\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nBut for the case where m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. But in the sample input, it's given as a list, but perhaps the actual code reads from stdin. So in the code, the input is read as a single integer.\n\nBut in the example, the first input is '1' and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nSo the code should read m as input.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        k = n_high - n_low\n\n        print(k)\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nBut wait, when k is zero? No, because if count_zeros(n_low) == m, then n_high is the first n where count_zeros >= m+1. So n_high must be larger than n_low. Because for example, for m=1, n_low=5, n_high=10. So k=5.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's a single n? For example, if m is 6, but for some reason, the next number is m+1. But according to our previous example, for m=6, there are 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but in the case where the count increases by more than 1. For example, m=5. Suppose there is no n with count_zeros(n) =5. But for m=6, the code would find n_low=25. Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (5 numbers). So the code works.\n\nBut what about when the count_zeros increases by more than 1. For example, m=6. Let's say there's a number where the count increases by 2. Like for m=6, if there is a n where count_zeros(n) is 6, and then the next count is 8. Then the code would generate numbers from n_low to n_high-1. Which would be 5 numbers. But if the count increases by 2, then for m=6, there's a range of numbers where the count is 6, but how long is that range?\n\nLet me think. Let's take m=6. The count_zeros(25) is 6. Then for n=25, 26, 27, 28, 29, the count is 6. For n=30, count_zeros is 7 (30//5=6, 30//25=1, 6+1=7). So the range is 25-29. 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nAnother example: m=24. Let's see. Let's find n_low for m=24.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. But the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when m is 100000? Well, the code will run with the binary search steps. For 5*1e5=5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the code for m=5. The code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about m=6? The code returns 5 numbers.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=1 would output 5 followed by the numbers 5 6 7 8 9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when printing the numbers, the code uses range(n_low, n_high). Which in Python is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, if n_high is 10, range(5, 10) gives 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what if the code returns k=0? For example, when m=5. Then the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the code returns k=1? For example, when there is only one n that satisfies the condition. How?\n\nLet me think. For example, when m=24. Let's suppose that the count_zeros increases by 1. But for that, let's imagine that the count_zeros(n) jumps from 24 to 25. So for some n, the count_zeros(n) is 24, and the next number is 25. So the range is [n_low, n_high-1] which is one number.\n\nBut how can that happen?\n\nFor example, suppose that m=24. Let's find the n_low and n_high.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the count_zeros(n) increases by 1. For example, when n is 100. Let's compute count_zeros(100) = 100//5 + 100//25 + 100//125 = 20 +4 +0 =24. Then for n=101, same count. Up to n=104. For n=105, count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So for m=24, the n_low is 100. n_high is 105. So the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo again, 5 numbers. So why would there be a case where there is only one number?\n\nAh, perhaps when the count_zeros increases by more than 1. For example, m=24, but there's a number where the count jumps from 24 to 26. Then, the code would find that for m=24, the n_low is the first number with count >=24, which is 100 (count 24). Then for m+1=25, find the first n_high where count >=25. Which would be 105 (count 25). So the range is 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So even if there's a jump of 1, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo perhaps there is no case where the answer is 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 numbers. Only 0 or 5?\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by 1 for each multiple of 5, but when there are multiple factors of 5 (like 25, 125, etc.), the count increases by more than 1.\n\nBut in the case where the count increases by more than 1, then the numbers between the previous and current would have a gap.\n\nBut for example, let's take m=5. There is no solution. But for m=6, the code returns 5 numbers. So how?\n\nBecause for m=6, the count_zeros increases from 6 to 7 when n increases from 25 to 30. So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the count increases by 2? For example, m=5. Let's say that the count for n=24 is 4, n=25 is 6. So for m=5, there is no solution. So the code returns 0.\n\nBut for m=6, the count is 6 for n=25, and then increases to 7 for n=30. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases, and the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but what if there's a case where the count increases by 3?\n\nFor example, let's say n=125. count_zeros(125) is 125//5=25, 125//25=5, 125//125=1, total 31. So for n=124, count_zeros(124) is 124//5=24, 124//25=4, 124//125=0. Total 28. So for m=28, the n_low is 124. Then for m=28, the code would find n_high for m+1=29. Let's see: find_min_n(29). Let's see what's the first n where count_zeros(n) >=29. Let's think:\n\nn=125: count is 31. So maybe the first n is 124? No, count_zeros(124) is 24+4=28. So for target=29, the binary search would look for the first n where count_zeros >=29. Let's compute for n=125, it's 31. So the minimal n would be 125. So for m=28, the code would have n_low=124 (count_zeros(124) is 28). Then n_high is 125. So the numbers from 124 to 124 (since n_high is 125, range is 124 to 125-1=124). So the count is 1. So the code would output 1 and the number 124. But according to our previous logic, that would be a case where the answer is 1 number. But according to our previous reasoning, that's not possible. So why?\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier assumption that the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers. So this suggests that the code may have a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nFor m=28, the code would find n_low = find_min_n(28). Let's compute what that is.\n\nThe count_zeros(124) is 24 + 4 + 0 = 28. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=28 is 124. So n_low is 124. Then, check count_zeros(124) ==28 → yes.\n\nThen, find n_high = find_min_n(29). Let's compute for that.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=29?\n\ncount_zeros(124) is 28. count_zeros(125) is 25 +5 +1 =31. So for target=29, the minimal n is 125? Because there's no n between 124 and 125 where count_zeros is 29. So the minimal n is 125. Thus, the range is from 124 to 125-1=124. So the answer is 1 number: 124. Which would be printed as 1 followed by 124.\n\nBut according to the code, this is possible. So this is a case where the answer is 1 number. But according to the previous examples, it was always 5 numbers. So why is this happening?\n\nAh, because the code is correct, and the previous assumption that the answer is always 5 numbers is wrong. So this is a problem.\n\nSo this suggests that the code may have a bug here. So what's the correct answer for m=28?\n\nLet me compute the count_zeros(124) = 28. What about 125? 31. So between 124 and 125, the count jumps from 28 to 31. So there are no numbers between 124 and 125 that have 29, 30, or 31 zeros. So for m=28, the answer is 1 number (124). For m=29, there is no solution. For m=30, there is no solution. For m=31, the answer is numbers from 125 to ... ?\n\nSo the code would return 1 number for m=28. Which is correct. So why does this happen?\n\nBecause when the count increases by more than 1, there are some m's that have only one n. So the code is correct, but the initial assumption that the answer is always 0 or 5 is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code as written is correct. It handles all cases, whether there is 0, 1, 2, etc. numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. The code for m=28 would output 1 and",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the range of `n` values that meet the requirement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials. The formula to count trailing zeros in `n!` is given by:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the smallest `n` such that the number of trailing zeros is at least `m`, we use binary search. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values for `n`.\n\n3. **Range Determination**: Once we find the smallest `n` for `m` trailing zeros, we then determine the smallest `n` for `m+1` trailing zeros. The valid range of `n` values that produce exactly `m` trailing zeros lies between these two values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = n_high - n_low\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 until the quotient is zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target value. The upper bound for binary search is set to `5 * target` which is a safe upper limit based on the properties of trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Function**: Reads the input value `m`, determines the smallest `n` (n_low) that gives at least `m` trailing zeros. If `n_low` does not give exactly `m` trailing zeros, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it finds the smallest `n` (n_high) for `m+1` trailing zeros and prints the range of `n` values from `n_low` to `n_high - 1`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values using binary search, ensuring that the solution handles large values of `m` up to 100,000 efficiently.",
