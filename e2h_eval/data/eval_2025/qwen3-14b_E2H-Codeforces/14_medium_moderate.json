    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me consider the example given. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. The count for 5! is 1 (since 5/5=1). For 6!, same as 5! multiplied by 6, which doesn't add another 5. So the count remains 1. Similarly up to 9. Then 10! would add another 5 (from 10/5=2, and 10/25=0. So total 2). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key idea is that for a certain m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, but how?\n\nWait, how does the count of trailing zeros change as n increases? For each n, the count can either stay the same or increase by 1 or more. For example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases. But when it crosses a multiple of 25, it increases by two (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for example, when n is 24, the count is 4 (24/5=4.8 → 4, 24/25=0). At 25, it's 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25,26,27,28,29). But wait, what about numbers before 25? For example, let's say m=5. Let's see:\n\nFor n=24, count is 4+0 = 4? Wait, no. Wait, the count is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 =4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 =6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. So for m=5, the answer is zero. So that's why in the sample input when m=5, the output is zero.\n\nSo the problem is that for some m, there's no n that gives exactly m zeros. For others, there may be one or five numbers. Wait, but how?\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For a given m, find all possible n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how do I find these n's?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible range of n's that could have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nLet me think. The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's where the count is exactly m. However, sometimes there's no such n. For example, if m is 5, as in the example above.\n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal n where the count is m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that minimal n?\n\nThis seems like a problem where binary search can be used. Because for a given m, we can find the smallest n such that the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. But how to find the possible n's.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's must lie in a certain range. Let's think about how the count function works. For example, if we have a count of m, then the next number that increases the count is when n is a multiple of 5. So the possible n's that give exactly m trailing zeros would be a consecutive sequence of numbers. But how long is that sequence?\n\nIn the example of m=1, the numbers are 5-9. Which is 5 numbers. So that's 5 numbers. But for other cases, maybe the length is 5, or 1, or 0?\n\nWait, for example, let's take m=2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: count is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0. So 2).\n\nn=11: same count. Up to 14. Then 15: 15/5=3, 15/25=0. Total 3. So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14. Again 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m=6? For example, n=25: count is 6 (as before). Then 25,26,27,28,29. So again 5 numbers. But when m is 3?\n\nn=15: count is 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0). Then 16,17,18,19: same count. Then 20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → count is 4. So for m=3, the numbers are 15-19. Again 5 numbers.\n\nSo in these examples, when there exists at least one n with exactly m trailing zeros, there are exactly 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when you cross a multiple of 5, the count increases. So for example, if the count for n is m, then the next number (n+1) will have same count unless n+1 is a multiple of 5. So the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros would be from some x to x+4, but only if x is a multiple of 5. Or perhaps not?\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose that the count for n is m. Then for n+1, the count is same as n unless n+1 is divisible by 5. So, for example, if n is not divisible by 5, then the count for n+1 is same as n. But if n is divisible by 5, then the count increases by 1 (or more if it's a multiple of higher powers of 5).\n\nSo the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros would be consecutive numbers until the next multiple of 5. So the maximum possible numbers is 5, but maybe less if the next multiple of 5 adds more than one to the count.\n\nWait, let's take an example where n is 24. Count is 4 (as before). Then n=25, count increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). So for m=5, there are no numbers. So in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the key is to find for a given m, whether there exists any n such that count(n) = m. If yes, then the numbers are 5 consecutive numbers, but only if the next multiple of 5 doesn't cause a jump of more than 1. Otherwise, maybe there are less than 5 numbers.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, the number of possible n's for a given m is either 0, 1, 5, or something else?\n\nWait, let's think about when the count increases by more than 1. For example, when n is 25. The count increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no n. But for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25-29). So for m=6, the count is 6 for n=25, and increases to 7 when n reaches 30.\n\nSo in that case, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So five numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=24. Let's compute count(99) and count(100).\n\ncount(99) is floor(99/5) + floor(99/25) + floor(99/125) = 19 + 3 + 0 = 22.\n\ncount(100) is 20 + 4 + 0 = 24. So for m=24, the count is achieved at n=100, but then for n=101, 102, 103, 104, the count is 24. Then n=105: count increases by 1 (since 105/5=21, 105/25=4, 105/125=0. So total 21+4=25. So for m=24, the numbers are 100,101,102,103,104. Five numbers.\n\nSo again five numbers.\n\nBut what about when the count jumps by more than 1? Let's take m=5. Let's say that the count for n=24 is 4, for n=25 it's 6. So there's no n where count is 5. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nAnother example: m=4. Let's see. For n=20, count is 4 + 0 = 4 (since 20/5=4, 20/25=0). Then for n=21,22,23,24, the count is 4. Then n=25: count is 6. So for m=4, the numbers are 20,21,22,23,24. Five numbers.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that if there exists an n such that count(n) = m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. Except when the count jumps by more than 1, which would create a gap. So how can I find whether m is present?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where count(n) = m. Then check if there's such n. If not, output zero. Else, output the 5 numbers starting from that n.\n\nWait, but how do I find that minimal n?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. The count function is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there may be a range of n's where count(n) = m. But how to find that range.\n\nFirst, find the smallest n such that count(n) >= m. Let's call this low. Then check if count(low) == m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where count(n) == m, and then check how many numbers are in the sequence.\n\nBut how to find the smallest n where count(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, the count(n) can be calculated for a given n. So perhaps using binary search to find the possible n's.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's for a given m.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count(n) >= m. Let's call this lower.\n\n2. Check if count(lower) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\n3. If yes, then find the minimal n where count(n) = m. Then find the next n where count(n) increases beyond m. The numbers between these two points (exclusive of the upper) would be the valid n's.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound?\n\nAlternatively, the upper bound is the first n where count(n) > m. Then the numbers from lower to upper-1 would be the ones with count(n) = m.\n\nSo for example, if lower is the first n where count(n) = m, and upper is the first n where count(n) > m, then the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo the count of numbers is upper - lower.\n\nBut how to find upper?\n\nWell, upper can be found by finding the first n where count(n) > m.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n where count(n) >= m. Let's call it low.\n\n- If count(low) != m, then return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n where count(n) > m. Let's call it high.\n\n- The numbers from low to high-1 are the valid ones. The count is high - low.\n\nBut then, how to find low and high?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with binary search.\n\nSo first, the function to calculate the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nLet me code that function first. Let's call it count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to compute the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nNow, for binary search.\n\nFor example, to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe minimal possible n is 0 (but since n is positive integer, perhaps 1?), but the maximum n could be 5*m. Because for each 5 numbers, you get at least one zero. So for m, the maximum possible n is 5*m.\n\nWait, but for example, m=1, 5*1=5. Which is correct. For m=2, 5*2=10. Which is correct. For m=6, 5*6=30. But count_zeros(25) is 6. So 25 is less than 30. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nSo for binary search, the low can be 0, high can be 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even higher? Well, for m=1, 5*m is 5. But for m=1, the minimal n is 5. So perhaps 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\nThen check if count_zeros(low_n) == m. If not, then no solution.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m. Let's call this high_n.\n\nThe numbers between low_n and high_n -1 are the valid ones. So the count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut how to find high_n?\n\nWell, the same approach as for low_n. For example, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nBut perhaps, once we have low_n, we can find high_n by finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m. Which can be done via binary search again.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, once we have low_n, the high_n is the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) > m. Which can be found by binary search again.\n\nOnce we have low_n and high_n, the answer is the numbers from low_n to high_n -1, inclusive. The count is high_n - low_n.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, m=1:\n\nlow_n is 5 (count_zeros(5)=1). high_n is 10 (count_zeros(10)=2). So high_n - low_n = 5. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example, m=5:\n\nFind low_n such that count_zeros(low_n) >=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. Hence, no solution. So output is zero.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\nGiven m:\n\n- Find low_n = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(low_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find high_n = minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\n- The answer is the list of numbers from low_n to high_n -1. The count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, implement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, implement a binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nWait, but for the first part, how to find low_n?\n\nThe binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe possible range for n can be from 0 to 5*m. Because for example, for m=1, 5*1=5. For m=2, 10, etc. But for larger m, perhaps 5*m is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, for m=100000, 5*m is 500000. But the actual n could be higher? Let me think. For example, for m=100000, the required n is such that count_zeros(n) = m. How big is that n?\n\nThe count_zeros(n) is roughly n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... which is approximately n/4. So for m=1e5, n is roughly 4*1e5 = 400,000. But perhaps 5*m is a safe upper bound for binary search. So for binary search, we can set the upper limit as 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even higher. For example, for m=1, 5*1=5 is correct. For m=6, 5*6=30, but the correct n is 25. So the upper bound is okay.\n\nSo, for binary search, the upper limit can be set as 5*m.\n\nSo, code for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m:\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly, for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m, we can do the same, but with the condition checking for > m.\n\nOnce we have low_n and high_n, then the numbers are from low_n to high_n -1.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, but according to the input constraints, m starts from 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nCompute low_n = find_min_n(m).\n\nCheck if count_zeros(low_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute high_n = find_min_n(m+1). Because the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m is the same as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1, find_min_n(2) would be 10. Which is correct.\n\nOnce we have low_n and high_n, the answer is the numbers from low_n to high_n -1. The count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut then, for example, when m=1, high_n is 10. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. So high_n - low_n is 10-5=5.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low_n = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   high_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   the answer is [low_n, low_n+1, ..., high_n -1]\n\n   the count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut then, how to handle when m is such that there is no n with count_zeros(n) = m. For example, m=5.\n\nIn that case, low_n is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So output 0.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about the edge cases?\n\nFor example, m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1.\n\nAnother case: m=6. Let's see.\n\nlow_n is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So low_n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which equals m. So proceed. high_n is find_min_n(7). What is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So high_n is 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: m=24. Let's see:\n\nlow_n is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=24. Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. So low_n is 100. high_n is find_min_n(25). Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is 24. ... count_zeros(104) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 25. So high_n is 105. So the answer is 100-104, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother example: m=5. low_n is find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\nfind_min_n(5) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0. 4+0=4). count_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search, the minimal n is 25. Then check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No. So output 0.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low_n = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute high_n = find_min_n(m+1).\n\n   numbers = list(range(low_n, high_n)).\n\n   print len(numbers), followed by the numbers.\n\nWait, because range(low_n, high_n) is from low_n to high_n-1. So the length is high_n - low_n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nBut how to implement the find_min_n function.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement a helper function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be written.\n\nBut for large m (like 1e5), 5*m could be 5e5. Binary search over that is acceptable.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, for the main code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is given as a list, but according to the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which probably corresponds to two test cases. Wait, the example shows:\n\nSample input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is a list of test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is read as a single integer. But the sample input shows that perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). \n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, when input is 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers, and when input is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings. But perhaps that's part of the test case setup. For example, the user is supposed to read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which may be a way to represent multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo perhaps the original problem is that the input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and for m=5, output is '0'.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single integer m from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows that perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one m per test case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from stdin.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, and the sample input is for multiple test cases. However, according to the problem statement, the input is only one integer m.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read one integer m from input.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute the answer as per the steps.\n\nBut then, the sample input shows that for m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers, and for m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low_n = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    high_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = high_n - low_n\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n\nBut wait, the output requires that first print k, then print the numbers in increasing order.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code for that case would generate range(5, 10) → [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(low_n, high_n) is from low_n to high_n -1, inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the high_n is 5*m, but for some cases, the high_n is larger than 5*m?\n\nBut the find_min_n function uses 5 * target as the upper bound. So for target = m+1, the upper bound is 5*(m+1). Which for m up to 1e5, is manageable.\n\nNow, testing for m=5.\n\nlow_n is find_min_n(5). Let's compute what that returns.\n\nThe binary search for target=5.\n\nInitially low=0, high=5*5=25.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search steps.\n\nBut perhaps better to think that for target=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25?\n\nNo. Let's compute count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) = 6. So during the binary search, the code would find that the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. Then check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. low_n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. high_n is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(7) will search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7 (30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7). So the minimal n is 30. So high_n is 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut for m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. But in Python, input().strip().\n\nBut the input is given as a single integer. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n    low_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = high_n - low_n\n        print(k)\n        if k >0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nBut wait, in the case where k is zero? But that's impossible, because if count_zeros(low_n) == m, then high_n is the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. So high_n must be >= low_n +1. So k is high_n - low_n >=1.\n\nBut for example, if m=6, and high_n is 30, low_n is 25. 30-25=5. So the code would print 5, then the numbers.\n\nBut for the case where k is 5, the code prints the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, the 'range(low_n, high_n)' is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut when high_n is 10, the code generates range(5,10), which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5? Let's see.\n\nBut the code uses binary search with O(log(5m)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing for m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=24, the code returns 5 numbers: 100-104.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. low_n is 10. high_n is 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3. So the numbers are 10-14. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's only one n? For example, is there any m where the high_n - low_n is 1?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that m is such that the count_zeros(n) jumps by 2. For example, m=5. But no n has count_zeros(n) =5. So no. What about m=24? No, the code gives 5 numbers.\n\nIs there any case where the count is 1?\n\nNo, because the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 or more. So when the count increases by 1, the numbers between the previous and current would be 5 numbers. But if the count increases by more than 1, then there's a gap.\n\nBut in that case, the code returns zero for the m in between.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code for the problem.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=5 is 0. Which the code returns.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=1:\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(1) → 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) = 1. So proceed.\n\nhigh_n = find_min_n(2) → 10.\n\nso output is 5 numbers: 5-9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in the code, when printing the numbers, for example, when k=5, the code prints the list. However, for cases where k is zero, but that's already handled by the first check.\n\nBut in the code, after checking that count_zeros(low_n) == m, the code proceeds to compute high_n. Since count_zeros(low_n) is m, and high_n is the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. So high_n must be >= low_n +1. Thus, k is high_n - low_n >=1.\n\nThus, the code can safely print the list.\n\nBut in the code, the 'print(' '.join(...))' may have a problem when k is zero. But that's not possible here.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut when the code is run for m=5, the code outputs 0.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But the problem says m is >=1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother case: m=6.\n\nBut the code works.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, considering that for large m, say m=1e5, the code may take some time, but binary search is efficient.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut the code for the main function needs to read from stdin. Also, in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. So using sys.stdin.read().strip() is safe.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The code would print 5 followed by the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n    low_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = high_n - low_n\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output for m=1 is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". The code would print 5 followed by the numbers. However, the code's print statements are:\n\nprint(k) → which is 5.\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) → which is \"5 6 7 8 9\".\n\nBut the sample output shows that the first line is '5\\n' and the second line is the numbers. Which is exactly what the code does. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5, which outputs 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are more than one line? Well, the code prints them all in one line, which is correct",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the valid values of $ n $ using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $, we use binary search. Similarly, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros exceeds $ m $.\n3. **Range Validation**: Once we have the range of values where the number of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $, we validate if such values exist and compute the count of these values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n    low_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = high_n - low_n\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value.\n3. **main()**: This function reads the input value $ m $, determines the range of $ n $ values that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, and prints the count and the values in increasing order.
