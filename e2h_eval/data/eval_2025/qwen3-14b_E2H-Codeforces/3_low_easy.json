Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we have to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be checked properly. For example, if lanterns are at positions 5, 3, then after sorting they are 3,5. The gap between them is 2, so the maximum required d for that gap would be 1 (since each lantern covers up to d distance. So between 3 and 5, the middle point is 4, which is 1 unit away from both. So the maximum required d for that gap is (5-3)/2 = 1.)\n\n2. After sorting, check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position. The required d for that is (a[0] - 0) because the lantern's light has to reach the start of the street. Wait, no. If the first lantern is at a[0], then the leftmost point it can cover is a[0] - d. To cover 0, we need a[0] - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. But wait, if the lantern is at a[0], then the left end of the street is 0. So the distance from the lantern to 0 is a[0] - 0. So the required d must be at least that. But if there's another lantern to the left of a[0], but since we sorted the array, the first element is the leftmost. So the first check is the distance between 0 and the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern's position and the end of the street (l). \n\nSo for the first part, the initial d candidate is a[0], and for the last part, it's l - a[-1]. Then, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). For each such gap, the required d is (gap)/2. Because the optimal coverage is to cover the middle of the gap. For example, if two lanterns are 5 units apart, then the middle is 2.5 units from each. So d must be at least 2.5 to cover the entire gap.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum between the initial and final distances, and the maximum of the (gap/2) values between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is already at 0? Then the initial distance is zero, so no problem. Similarly for the last lantern being at l. \n\nSo steps:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial distance: first lantern's position minus 0. So initial_d = a[0] - 0. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then this is zero. So the required d is zero for that part. But if the first lantern is at position 3, then the initial_d is 3. So the d must be at least 3 to cover the 0 point.\n\nSimilarly, the end part is l - a[-1]. So the end_d is l - a[-1]. \n\nThen for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Take the maximum of all these values.\n\nThe answer is the maximum between initial_d, end_d, and the maximum gap/2.\n\nYes. That makes sense.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nLanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15. \n\nSo initial_d is 0 (since first lantern is at 0). end_d is 15 -15 = 0. \n\nNow the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length $ l $. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a segment of the street within a distance $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Initial and Final Segments**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, compute the maximum distance that needs to be covered. This is done by considering the midpoint of each gap, which requires half the gap's width as the radius $ d $.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the initial segment, the final segment, and the midpoints of the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first part\n    first_part = a[0] - 0\n    max_d = max(max_d, first_part)\n    \n    # Check the last part\n    last_part = l - a[-1]\n    max_d = max(max_d, last_part)\n    \n    # Check the gaps between lanterns\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        max_d = max(max_d, current)\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns efficiently.\n- **Initial and Final Segments**: The initial segment checks the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern, while the final segment checks the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n- **Gaps Between Lanterns**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we calculate the midpoint of each gap between consecutive lanterns. The maximum of these midpoints ensures that the entire street is illuminated with the minimum radius $ d $.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required by considering all critical points on the street, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of $ O(n \\log n) $ due to sorting.",
