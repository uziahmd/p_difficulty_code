Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position divided by two would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive differences won't make sense. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 3, 5, 0, then sorting them would be 0, 3, 5. Then the gaps between them are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, etc.\n\n2. After sorting, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each gap, the maximum distance needed would be half of that gap. Because the worst case is that the two lanterns are covering towards each other. So the middle of the gap would be the farthest point from both, so the required d would be (gap)/2. \n\n3. Also, check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position. The required d here would be (a[0] - 0) / 2. Wait, no. Wait, the first lantern's coverage starts at a[0] - d. If the first lantern is at position a[0], then the leftmost point it can cover is a[0] - d. But the street starts at 0. So to cover 0, we need that a[0] - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is all points within distance d. So for the left end of the street (position 0), the distance to the nearest lantern (say, the first one at a[0]) is a[0] - 0. So the required d must be at least that distance. Wait, no. Because if the lantern is at a[0], then the coverage extends from a[0] -d to a[0] +d. So to cover 0, 0 must be within [a[0]-d, a[0]+d]. So 0 >= a[0] -d → d >= a[0] - 0. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the first lantern is at position x. The left end of the street is 0. The distance between 0 and x is x. For 0 to be covered by this lantern, the distance between 0 and x must be <=d. So d must be at least x. But wait, the lantern's coverage is a radius d around it. So if the lantern is at x, then the leftmost point covered is x -d. So to cover 0, we need x -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ x -0 → d ≥x. Wait, no. Wait, x -d ≤ 0 → d ≥x. So yes. So the required d for the left end is x. But what if there's another lantern closer to the left end? Well, if the lanterns are sorted, then the first lantern is the leftmost. So for example, if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], so d must be at least a[0] to cover 0. Similarly, the last lantern's position is a[-1], and the right end of the street is l. The distance between a[-1] and l is l - a[-1], so d must be at least that value. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the lantern is at a[0], then the coverage extends from a[0]-d to a[0]+d. So for the street's start (0) to be covered, 0 must be in that interval. So 0 >= a[0] -d → d >= a[0] - 0. But also, the lantern's coverage can't extend beyond the street. Wait, no. The problem says that the lanterns light all points of the street that are within distance d. So even if the lantern's coverage extends beyond the street, the part that's within the street is considered. So for example",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ such that all points on a street of length $ l $ are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a distance $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This allows us to efficiently check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position $ l $). These distances are critical because they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance required to cover the gap is half the size of the gap. This is because the worst-case point in the gap is the midpoint, which is equidistant from both lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first segment from 0 to a[0]\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0.0)\n    \n    # Check segments between lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current_d = gap / 2.0\n        if current_d > max_d:\n            max_d = current_d\n    \n    # Check the last segment from a[-1] to l\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns $ n $, the length of the street $ l $, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Check for Street Ends**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street is checked to determine the initial minimum radius.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the required radius is calculated as half the gap size, ensuring that the midpoint of the gap is covered.\n5. **Output**: The maximum of all calculated distances is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places, ensuring the result meets the required accuracy constraints.",
