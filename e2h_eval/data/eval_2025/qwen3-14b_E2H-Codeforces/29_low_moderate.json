Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step by step would be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If we naively replace each occurrence every time, that would be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might not be feasible for large inputs.\n\nHmm, so we need an efficient way to handle these substitutions. Let me think. Since each substitution replaces a digit with another string, maybe we can model this with some kind of transformation that tracks how each original digit is transformed through the queries. But the problem is that substitutions can be applied in sequence, and later substitutions might override previous ones. For example, if we first replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then all the original '2's would become '11'.\n\nWait, but the substitutions are applied in order. So, when processing a query, we have to replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. However, if we process each query by replacing all occurrences of di in the current string, then for each query, the string could become very long. For example, if we have a query that replaces a digit with a long string, and then another query that replaces another digit with a longer string, the string could grow exponentially. That's not feasible for n=1e5 queries.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the substitutions as a mapping from each digit to a string. However, since substitutions can be done in any order, and later substitutions can affect the previous mappings. For instance, if we first replace '2' with 'a', then later replace 'a' with 'b', but since the substitutions are done on the current string, which may have already replaced '2's with 'a's. But wait, the substitution queries are always replacing a single digit (di) with ti. So, the ti can contain digits, but when you perform a substitution, you replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. So, the substitutions are only for individual digits, not for sequences. Therefore, the replacement is done in a way that each query affects the current state of the string, but each replacement is based on the current digits in the string.\n\nBut if we process each query naively, replacing all occurrences of di in the current string with ti, then for large strings and many queries, this would be too slow. For example, if the initial string is 1e5 characters, and each query replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, then after n queries, the string could be O( (1e5)^n ), which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to model the transformations without actually building the entire string. Let's think in terms of dynamic programming or memoization. For each digit, we can track what it would expand to after all substitutions. However, since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution can overwrite previous mappings, we need to process the queries in order and track for each digit, what it's currently expanded to.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's maintain for each digit (from 0-9) a value that represents the expansion of that digit. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d. But since the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string with t, which may contain other digits. However, when we process this query, the expansion of d is now t. However, when t contains digits, those digits would have their own expansions. But how do we represent this?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a mapping where '2' expands to '00', and '0' expands to '1'. Then, if we have a query that replaces '2' with '00', then when we process the original string, each '2' would be replaced by '00', which in turn would be replaced by '11' when the '0's are replaced. But if we process the queries in order, the first substitution is '2->00', and then '0->1', then the expansion of '2' would be '00' which is replaced by '11' when we process the second query. However, if we want to track the expansion of each digit after all substitutions, perhaps we need to track for each digit, the expansion as a string, but with the understanding that when we replace a digit, we need to replace it with the current expansion of the target string.\n\nWait, but this seems like a problem that can be modeled using memoization with some kind of replacement rules. Let me think again. Suppose we have a",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution step-by-step is computationally infeasible due to potential exponential growth of the string. Instead, we can use a dynamic programming approach to track how each digit expands through the queries.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Digit Expansion Mapping**: Maintain a mapping for each digit (0-9) that represents what it will expand to after all substitutions. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Query Processing**: For each query, update the expansion mapping for the specified digit. This involves replacing the current expansion of the digit with the new string, which may contain other digits that have their own expansions.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since we are interested in the result modulo $10^9 + 7$, we can compute the result incrementally using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    # Read all input lines\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        # Read the first line as s\n        s = line\n        idx += 1\n        n = int(input[idx].strip())\n        idx += 1\n        queries = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            if idx >= len(input):\n                break\n            q = input[idx].strip()\n            if q:\n                queries.append(q)\n            idx += 1\n        cases.append((s, n, queries))\n    \n    for case in cases:\n        s, n, queries = case\n        # Initialize the expansion map: each digit maps to itself\n        expansion = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Parse the query: \"di->ti\"\n            parts = query.split('->')\n            di = parts[0]\n            ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n            # Update the expansion for di\n            expansion[di] = ti\n        \n        # Now compute the value of the original string s after expansion\n        # We need to process each character in s, expanding it according to the expansion map\n        # But since expansion can be recursive, we need to compute the expanded string's value mod MOD\n        # However, directly expanding could be too slow, so we need to compute the value incrementally\n        # Using a stack-based approach to compute the value efficiently\n        \n        # To compute the value, we can use a stack where each element is a tuple (current_value, power_of_10)\n        # When we process a digit, we replace it with its expansion and compute the value accordingly\n        # But since the expansion can be complex, we need to precompute the value of each expansion\n        \n        # Precompute the value of each expansion string\n        # For each digit d, compute its value mod MOD and the length (number of digits)\n        # So we can use memoization to store for each expansion string, its value and length\n        # However, since the expansion can change during queries, we need to recompute as needed\n        \n        # Let's build a memoization table for the expansion strings\n        memo_val = {}\n        memo_len = {}\n        \n        def get_val(s):\n            if s in memo_val:\n                return memo_val[s], memo_len[s]\n            val = 0\n            length = 0\n            for ch in s:\n                val = (val * 10 + int(ch)) % MOD\n                length += 1\n            memo_val[s] = val\n            memo_len[s] = length\n            return val, length\n        \n        # Now, process the original string s\n        # We'll use a stack where each element is a tuple (current_value, current_length)\n        # Initially, the stack is empty\n        stack = []\n        for ch in s:\n            # Get the expansion of the current character\n            exp_str = expansion[ch]\n            # Compute the value and length of exp_str\n            val, length = get_val(exp_str)\n            # Now, we need to combine this with the previous value on the stack\n            # The new value is previous_value * 10^length + val\n            # We also need to track the total length for computing 10^length\n            if stack:\n                prev_val, prev_len = stack.pop()\n                # Compute 10^length mod MOD\n                power = pow(10, length, MOD)\n                new_val = (prev_val * power + val) % MOD\n                new_len = prev_len + length\n                stack.append((new_val, new_len))\n            else:\n                stack.append((val, length))\n        \n        # After processing all characters, the result is the first element of the stack\n        if stack:\n            res = stack[0][0]\n        else:\n            res = 0\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual test cases.\n2. **Expansion Mapping**: Each digit is initially mapped to itself.
