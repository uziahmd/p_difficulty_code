He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be a normal base or Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and we have to convert it to base b, handling Roman numerals if needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the conversion from base a to decimal. The input c can have digits up to a-1. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase? Well, the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used, like A for 10, etc. But the input for c may have letters? Wait, the input says that c is given in base a. So the input c is a string that represents the number in base a, which may include letters for digits >=10. But the problem says that the input for c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, note that when converting to Roman numerals, the number is guaranteed to be non-zero and <= 3000 in decimal.\n\nSo first step: parse the input c into a decimal value.\n\nFor example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, how to convert the string c from base a to decimal?\n\nI can process each character of the string, converting it to its numerical value, then multiply by the base's power accordingly.\n\nBut for that, I need to handle digits as characters. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So, for each character in the string, I can check if it's a digit or a letter, and convert accordingly.\n\nWait, the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. So for example, in base 12, digits go up to 11, which would be represented as B. So the input c's digits are in the range 0 to a-1, represented as numbers or letters.\n\nSo, the function to convert the string c to decimal would be:\n\nInitialize value = 0\n\nFor each char in the string:\n\n   digit = value of the char (e.g., 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc.)\n\n   value = value * a + digit\n\nBut how to handle the characters? For example, the input could have letters in uppercase or lowercase? The problem's examples have 'A' in the input. The problem says that in the input, the c may have letters? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string which is in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, then the input could have digits like A-F, but the problem says that the input is given as a string which may have leading zeros. So, the code must handle letters as digits for bases higher than 10.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each character of c, converting it to its corresponding value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc. So, for a given character, we can check if it's a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z or a-z?), and then convert accordingly.\n\nBut the problem says that in the input, the c is given as a string. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters? The sample input includes 'A' in one case. For example, the sample input has '12 13\\nA' which outputs 'A'. Because converting from base 12, 'A' is 10 in decimal, then converting to base 13, which is 'A' again.\n\nSo, the code should process the input c's characters as follows: each character is a digit in base a. For example, if the character is 'A', then it represents 10. So, for the code, I need to write a helper function that converts a character to its value.\n\nLet me think about that. For a character ch:\n\nif it's a digit (0-9), then its value is int(ch).\n\nelse, it's a letter, and its value is 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A')) or something similar. But need to handle uppercase or lowercase? The problem's examples use uppercase letters, but the input may have lowercase? The problem says that the input is given as a string. However, the problem statement says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. But the problem says nothing about case. However, in the sample input, the third example is '5 R\\n4', which outputs 'IV', which is correct. The input c is '4' in base 5, which is 4 in decimal, converted to Roman numerals as IV.\n\nAnother sample input is '16 R\\n5' which outputs 'V'. So 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal, which is V in Roman numerals.\n\nSo, for the input c, the digits are in uppercase letters? Or maybe the problem expects that the input c is in uppercase letters. But the problem says that the input is given as a string. So perhaps the code should process letters regardless of case. However, the problem's note says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. So, the input c's letters are uppercase, perhaps? Well, the problem says that the input may have leading zeros but the length is up to 10^3. But for the code, perhaps the input is in uppercase letters. However, the code should process any case, but the problem says that the input is given correctly. So, perhaps the code can assume that letters are uppercase. But maybe not. For example, if the input is 'a' in base 12, which would be 10. But the problem says that the input is correct. So, perhaps the code can process both upper and lower case letters. However, the problem's examples use uppercase letters, so maybe the code can process the input as uppercase.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps the code should convert the input to uppercase, and then process. For example, if the input has 'a', then it's treated as 10.\n\nSo, for the code, the helper function to convert a character to its value is:\n\ndef char_to_value(ch):\n\n    if ch.isdigit():\n\n        return int(ch)\n\n    else:\n\n        return 10 + ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A')\n\nBut need to make sure that the character is valid for the base a. However, the problem says that the input is correct. So, we don't need to handle invalid inputs.\n\nOnce the input c is converted to a decimal integer, then we need to convert that integer to base b, which can be a normal base (integer between 2 and 25) or Roman numerals (R).\n\nSo, the next step is to handle the conversion from decimal to base b, which is either a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nLet me split this into two cases:\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-O (since base can be up to 25). For example, base 16 uses digits 0-9 and A-F. Base 25 would have digits up to 24, which is O (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 is O).\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, let's handle the case where b is not R.\n\nFor converting a decimal number to another base:\n\nWe can do this by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting the remainders. However, we need to handle zero. But according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. For other cases, the input c may be zero? Wait, the problem says that in the input, if Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input may be zero. For example, if the input is a=2, b=2, c=0, then output is 0.\n\nBut the input says that c is a non-negative integer. So, the code must handle zero.\n\nBut the problem says that in the input, the c may have leading zeros, but the actual value can be zero. So, during conversion to decimal, if the input is zero, then the code must handle that.\n\nSo, for converting decimal to base b (non-R), the steps are:\n\nIf the number is zero, output '0'.\n\nElse:\n\nCollect the digits in reverse order (since we get the least significant digit first), then reverse them.\n\nEach digit is converted to its corresponding character. For example, 10 becomes 'A', etc.\n\nNow, the code for this part.\n\nFor example, for the decimal number 10, converting to base 16 would be 'A'.\n\nSo, the helper function to convert a decimal number to base b (as a string) is:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters.\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    result = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            result += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            result += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return result\n\nWait, but for example, if the base is 16, and the remainder is 10, then it's 'A'. So yes.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? The problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. However, when converting from decimal to base b, the code will not generate leading zeros except when the number is zero. For example, if the number is zero, return '0'. Otherwise, the digits list is generated correctly.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, when n is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, the code processes the digits. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is 'R', which requires converting the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals?\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of tuples that map values to their Roman numeral equivalents, ordered from highest to lowest. For example:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in the list, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, for 4, it would be 'IV'.\n\nSo, the code for this is:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n        while n >= value:\n\n            res += symbol\n\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So the code can safely process numbers in that range.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe overall steps for each test case:\n\nRead a and b (where b can be R or an integer between 2-25).\n\nRead the string c (which is in base a).\n\nConvert c to decimal.\n\nThen, convert that decimal to base b (either as a string in base b or as Roman numerals).\n\nNow, the first step is converting c from base a to decimal.\n\nBut how to handle the case where c is zero? For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then the output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input can be zero.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    # s is the string in base a.\n\n    # convert to decimal.\n\n    decimal = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        # get the value of the digit\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = 10 + ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A')\n\n        decimal = decimal * a + digit\n\n    return decimal\n\nBut wait, what if the input is '0'? For example, the string is '0', then the decimal is zero. That's handled correctly.\n\nNow, the code for the entire problem.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows that the first line is a list of inputs, but perhaps the actual input is per test case. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (with b possibly being R).\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a.\n\nSo, the code should read two lines per test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nAh, but the sample input seems to be multiple test cases, each with two lines. But the actual input is not given as a list. Wait, perhaps the user provided the sample input as a list of test cases, but in reality, the program must process a single test case per run. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the program must read two lines of input. However, in the sample input, there are multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case at a time. Or perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking at the problem statement's sample input and output, the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual input for the program is one test case. Wait, no, the problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the program should read two lines of input, and output the answer. However, in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. But perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, in the sample input, the user shows that for each of the test cases, the input is given as two lines. So, the code should read two lines of input, process them, and output the answer. So, the code is supposed to handle one test case per run.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample shows that the input is given as a list of test cases. However, in practice, the code should read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is usually one test case per run. But perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but the actual code must process one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, which for each run, has two lines: first line a and b, second line c.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. How is that possible? Maybe the sample input is written as a list of test cases for illustration, but the actual code must read one test case per run. So, the code should read two lines of input.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the first test case is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. So, the code should read two lines. So, the code will read two lines from stdin.\n\nSo, in code, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Read first line\n\n    line1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Read second line\n\n    line2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # process line1 and line2.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading/trailing spaces. So, perhaps split line1 into a and b.\n\nSo, for line1, split into parts. For example, line1 is '10 2' which splits into a='10', b='2'.\n\nBut in the case where b is R, line1 would be something like '16 R'.\n\nSo, code:\n\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\n\nThen, a is integer a_str, and b is either integer or 'R'.\n\nBut the problem says that the first line contains two integers a and b, except that b may be replaced by R. So, for example, the first line can be '16 R' which means a=16, b=R.\n\nSo, code:\n\na = int(a_str)\n\nb = b_str\n\nThen, the second line is the string c.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c, we proceed to convert c to decimal, then to base b.\n\nSo, now, the code steps.\n\nBut first, converting c to decimal. For example, if c is '1111001' in base 2, which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Which is the fourth sample input, and the output is '1111001' (since converting to base 2 again). So the code must handle that.\n\nOnce the decimal is computed, then:\n\nif b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert to base b as a string.\n\nNow, the code for the conversion.\n\nBut what about the case where the decimal is zero? For example, if the input is '2 2\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. So, in that case, when converting to Roman, the code can assume that the number is non-zero.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (n).\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\n   convert n to Roman numerals.\n\nElse:\n\n   convert n to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nBut how to handle the case when n is zero? For example, if n is zero, then when converting to base b (non-R), the code returns '0'.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal.\n\nBut what if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer, may have leading zeros, but the length is up to 10^3. So, the input c is non-empty.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code for base_a_to_decimal.\n\nBut what about when a is 1? Wait, the problem says that a is between 2 and 25. So, the code can assume that a is >=2.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    decimal = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\n        decimal = decimal * a + digit\n\n    return decimal\n\nBut need to make sure that the digits are valid for base a. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't need to check.\n\nNow, for the case where the decimal is zero, the code returns zero.\n\nOnce that is done, then:\n\nif b is 'R':\n\n   roman = decimal_to_roman(n)\n\n   print(roman)\n\nelse:\n\n   base = int(b)\n\n   converted = decimal_to_base(n, base)\n\n   print(converted)\n\nBut the decimal_to_base function needs to handle zero. For example, if n is zero, returns '0'.\n\nNow, the code for decimal_to_base.\n\nBut what if the number is zero? The code returns '0'.\n\nElse, process as before.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nConvert c '1' in base 10 to decimal: 1.\n\nConvert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample Output: '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nc is '5' in base 16: decimal is 5. Convert to Roman: 'V'.\n\nSample Output: 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nc is '4' in base 5: decimal is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Output: 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nConvert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64+32+16+8+1= 121. Then converting to base 2: 121 in binary is 1111001. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nc is 'A' in base 12: decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so the representation is 'A'.\n\nSample Output: 'A'.\n\nAll samples are handled.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where c is zero. For example, a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 1? Wait, no, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that the base is at least 2.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 25. For example, decimal number 25. Then 25 in base 25 is 10 (since 1*25 + 0). So the code would generate '10'.\n\nBut for decimal_to_base, when the number is 25 and base is 25:\n\ndigits = [25 % 25 = 0, then 25//25 = 1. Then 1%25=1, 1//25=0. So digits list is [0, 1], reversed to [1,0]. So the string is '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: decimal 30, base 25. 30 divided by 25 is 1, remainder 5. So digits are [5, 1], reversed to [1,5], which is '15'.\n\nWhich is 1*25 +5=30.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_base.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_roman.\n\nTesting decimal 4: returns 'IV'.\n\nTesting decimal 3000: 'MMM'.\n\nTesting decimal 3001: but the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <=3000. So code can assume that.\n\nNow, code for the entire problem.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut first, code for the functions.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(ch):\n    if ch.isdigit():\n        return int(ch)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    decimal = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        decimal = decimal * a + char_to_value(ch)\n    return decimal\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    line1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    line2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n    a = int(a_str)\n    b = b_str\n    c = line2\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    n = base_a_to_decimal(c, a)\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(n, base)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero and the output is base b? For example, if n is zero, the code returns '0'.\n\nBut in the case where the input is zero and the output is Roman, the problem says that Roman case won't have zero. So the code can safely assume that when b is R, n is not zero.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nline1: '10 2'\n\nline2: '1'\n\nn is 1, converted to base 2: '1'.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nline1: '16 R'\n\nline2: '5'\n\nn=5, converted to Roman: 'V'.\n\nSample input 3:\n\nline1: '5 R'\n\nline2: '4' → n=4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample input 4:\n\nline1: '2 2'\n\nline2: '1111001' → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample input 5:\n\nline1: '12 13'\n\nline2: 'A' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input a=10, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal is 255 → hex is 'FF'.\n\nBut the code for decimal_to_base would generate that.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=101 → decimal is 5 → output '5'.\n\nBut what about leading zeros?\n\nFor example, if the input is a=10, b=10, c=000 → the code converts to decimal 0, and outputs '0'.\n\nSo the code handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input is a non-negative integer, so the code can assume that c is non-empty.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting to base b, the code returns '0' for zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting to base b which is 2-25, but the code returns leading zeros. But the code for decimal_to_base returns the correct digits without leading zeros except for zero. For example, if the number is 5 in base 10, the code returns '5'.\n\nNow, the code for decimal_to_base returns the correct string.\n\nBut what about when the number is zero and the base is R? Well, the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code does not have to handle that case.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nBut wait, in the function decimal_to_base, when the input is zero, returns '0'. But in the problem statement, the output must omit leading zeros. However, for zero, the output is exactly '0', which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting a number to base 1? But the problem says that the base is between 2 and 25, so that's not possible.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 25, and the number is 25 → 10 (base 25).\n\nSo, the code returns '10'.\n\nAnother case: number is 30, base 25 → 1*25 +5 → '15'.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input where c is 'A' in base 12. The code converts it to decimal 10. Then, converting to base 13, which is 10, which is 'A' in base 13. So the code returns 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input a=5, b=10, c=10 → which is 5 in decimal. So output is '5'.\n\nNow, code should be correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base, which could be either a standard base (2-25) or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting that decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We convert this number to a decimal integer by processing each digit of the input string.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a standard base or Roman numerals, we use different conversion methods:\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: Convert the decimal integer to the target base using division and modulus operations, handling digits greater than 9 with letters (A-Z).\n   - **Roman Numerals Conversion**: Use a predefined list of Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding values to construct the Roman numeral representation of the decimal integer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(ch):\n    if ch.isdigit():\n        return int(ch)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    decimal = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        decimal = decimal * a + char_to_value(ch)\n    return decimal\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    line1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    line2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n    a = int(a_str)\n    b = b_str\n    c = line2\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    n = base_a_to_decimal(c, a)\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(n, base)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the original base `a` and the target base `b` (which could be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `base_a_to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its decimal equivalent by iterating through each digit and adjusting the value based on the original base.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - If the target base is a standard base, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the target base using repeated division and modulus operations, handling digits greater than 9 with appropriate letters.\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals, the function `decimal_to_roman` constructs the Roman numeral representation using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring the correct format by subtracting values iteratively.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including leading zeros and zero values, ensuring correct conversion to the required base or Roman numeral representation.",
