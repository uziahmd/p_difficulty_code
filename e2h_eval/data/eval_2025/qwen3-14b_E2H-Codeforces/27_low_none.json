On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The idea is that by reversing any subarray [l, r], I can get a new sequence. My task is to choose the best such reversal so that the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nThe original LNDS might already be good, but maybe reversing a certain part can make it even longer. For example, in the first sample input, reversing [2,3] turns [1,2,1,2] into [1,1,2,2], which is perfectly non-decreasing, hence the LNDS is 4.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Let's think about the possible ways to maximize the LNDS after reversal.\n\nSince the array elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be calculated based on the counts of 1s and 2s. However, the arrangement matters. For example, if there are x 1s and y 2s, the maximum possible LNDS is x + y if all 1s come before 2s. But if the original array isn't like that, reversing some parts could help arrange them better.\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect the overall structure?\n\nLet me think: the optimal scenario would be to have all 1s followed by all 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, which is n. But that's only possible if the original array can be arranged that way through a reversal. However, maybe not all cases can achieve that. For example, if the original array has some 2s followed by 1s, then reversing the entire array would fix that.\n\nWait, but the original array may already have a lot of 1s and 2s in order. So the problem is to find the best reversal that can improve the arrangement.\n\nBut considering that the array is made up of only 1s and 2s, perhaps the optimal way is to find the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, possibly with some parts reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal can be found by considering the original LNDS and the possibilities of merging some parts.\n\nBut how do I model the effect of reversing a subarray?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each possible subarray [l, r], reverse it and compute the LNDS of the new array. Then take the maximum over all these possibilities. However, for n up to 2000, there are O(n^2) possible subarrays. For each of those, computing the LNDS would take O(n) time. That would be O(n^3), which for n=2000 would be 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible. Need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the array is only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be determined by the number of 1s and 2s and how they are arranged. For example, the LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, no. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1 (but that's not necessarily the case). Alternatively, the LNDS can be calculated by counting the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the first occurrence of a 2 in the original array. Wait, no. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc.), but after reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS 4.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. The maximum possible LNDS would be the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that can be placed after the 1s.\n\nBut how can reversing a subarray help achieve that?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Suppose there are some 1s and 2s. Let's say that the original array has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing that part would turn them into 1s followed by ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The optimal approach involves efficiently analyzing the impact of potential reversals on the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The sequence consists of only 1s and 2s. The LNDS can be maximized by ensuring as many 1s as possible are followed by as many 2s as possible.\n2. **Key Insight**: The LNDS length is determined by the number of 1s and the number of 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Reversing a subarray can help align more 1s before 2s.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the number of 1s up to each position and the number of 2s from each position onwards. This helps in quickly evaluating the impact of reversing any subarray [l, r].\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating over all possible subarrays and using precomputed values, we can determine the maximum LNDS achievable by reversing any subarray.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s and suffix counts of 2s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i + 1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i + 1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    \n    # Original LNDS\n    ones_total = prefix_ones[n]\n    twos_total = suffix_twos[0]\n    max_len = ones_total + twos_total\n    \n    # Try all possible intervals [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Reverse the subarray [l, r]\n            # Calculate how many 1s are before l, 2s after r, and in between\n            # Also consider the 1s and 2s inside the reversed segment\n            # The reversed segment will have the same number of 1s and 2s, but their arrangement changes\n            # The optimal scenario is that the reversed part contributes as many 1s followed by 2s as possible\n            \n            # The total LNDS would be:\n            # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 2s in reversed part) + (number of 2s after r)\n            # plus the number of 1s in the reversed part that can be placed before the 2s in the reversed part\n            # But since the reversed part is flipped, we need to count the number of 1s and 2s in it\n            \n            # Count the number of 1s and 2s in the subarray [l, r]\n            ones_in_sub = prefix_ones[r + 1] - prefix_ones[l]\n            twos_in_sub = (r + 1 - l) - ones_in_sub\n            \n            # The reversed subarray will have the same number of 1s and 2s, but their positions are swapped\n            # So the contribution of the reversed subarray to the LNDS is min(ones_in_sub, twos_in_sub) + max(ones_in_sub, twos_in_sub)\n            # Wait no, that's not correct.
