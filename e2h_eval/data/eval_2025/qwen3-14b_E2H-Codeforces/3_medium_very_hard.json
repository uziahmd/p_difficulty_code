Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up points within distance d. We need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, but also considering the ends of the street. Because the lanterns might not cover the very start or end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is something that needs to be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's an idea: sort the lantern positions. Then, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. The maximum gap divided by two would be the required d for that gap. But also, we need to check the first segment from 0 to the first lantern, and the last segment from the last lantern to l. Because those edges could be the maximum.\n\nWait, right. Because for the first lantern, the leftmost part (from 0 to a1) needs to be covered. So the distance from 0 to a1 is a1 - 0. The lantern at a1 can cover up to d distance. So for that segment, the maximum distance from the lantern would be a1 - 0. So the required d for that part is a1 - 0. But wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is a radius d. So the left end of the street (0) must be within d of some lantern. Similarly for the right end (l).\n\nSo for example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the radius d must be at least a1. Because the lantern at a1 can cover from a1 -d to a1 +d. To cover 0, we need a1 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But if the lantern is at a1, then the left end is covered if d is at least a1. Similarly for the right end.\n\nBut then, for the gaps between two consecutive lanterns. Suppose there are two lanterns at positions x and y, sorted. The distance between them is y -x. The maximum distance between them is (y -x). The middle point between them is at (x + y)/2. The distance from each lantern to that point is (y -x)/2. So for that gap, the required d must be at least (y -x)/2. Because that's the maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint.\n\nSo the overall approach would be:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n- Check the first gap between 0 and the first lantern. The required d for this is the first lantern's position (since the lantern has to cover 0).\n- Check the last gap between the last lantern and l. The required d for this is l - last lantern's position.\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them, divide by two, and take the maximum of all these values.\n- The answer is the maximum of all these three values (first gap, last gap, and max of consecutive gaps divided by two).\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the first and last gaps are the same. For example, if the lantern is at position a, then the first gap is a, the last gap is l -a. And since there are no consecutive lanterns, the maximum between those two would be the answer.\n\nYes. So that seems to handle all cases.\n\nLet me test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input: 7 15, and the lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. So the first lantern is at 0. The first gap is 0, so that's 0. The last lantern is at 15, so the last gap is 0. Then the consecutive gaps are:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nThe maximum among these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example: input is 2 5, positions 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. First gap is 2 - 0 = 2. Last gap is 5 -5 =0. The consecutive gap is 5-2=3 → 1.5. So maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the first gap is 5, the last gap is 5. The max of these is 5. So the answer is 5. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, positions [0, 10]. Then the first gap is 0, last gap is 0. The consecutive gap is 10-0=10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, positions [1, 9]. The consecutive gap is 8, divided by 2 is 4. The first gap is 1, last gap is 1. So maximum is 4. Which is correct. The radius needs to be 4 to cover from 1 to 9. The middle is 5, which is 4 away from both.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The first gap is a[0] - 0. So current_max = a[0].\n\nThen check the last gap: l - a[-1]. current_max is max(current_max, l -a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through consecutive pairs. For i from 0 to n-2:\n\ngap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_gap_half = gap / 2.0\n\ncurrent_max = max(current_max, current_gap_half)\n\nAt the end, the current_max is the answer.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if there are zero lanterns? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCompute first part: a[0] - 0.0. Because the first lantern's position is a[0], and the distance from 0 to that lantern is a[0], so the radius must be at least that. So max_d = a[0].\n\nThen compute the last part: l - a[-1]. Compare to max_d.\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.0 and compare to max_d.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first check\nif a[0] > 0:\n    max_d = a[0]\n\n# last check\nif l > a[-1]:\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\n# check consecutive pairs\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the first part is 0, so the max_d starts as 0. Then the last part may be l - a[-1], which could be larger. For example, if the last lantern is at 0, and l is 5, then the last part is 5, which would be the max.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in code, the initial max_d is 0.0. Then, for the first check, the code compares a[0] to 0.0. For example, if a[0] is 0, then the first part is 0.0, which is same as initial max_d. So no problem.\n\nBut wait, the first check is a[0] - 0.0. So if a[0] is 0, then that's 0. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, the code above for the first check is:\n\nmax_d = a[0]. But a[0] is an integer, but max_d is a float. But in Python, that's okay. But perhaps better to cast it as a float.\n\nBut in code, the initial max_d is 0.0. Then, the first check is a[0], which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So the code for the first check is:\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nSimilarly for the last check.\n\nWait, in the code above, the code does:\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nBut that's not correct. Because if a[0] is 0, then the first part is 0. So the code is initializing max_d as 0.0, then checking if a[0] is greater than 0. But that's not correct. Because the first part is a[0] (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). So the code should set max_d to the maximum between the current max_d (which is 0.0) and a[0]. Similarly for the last part.\n\nWait, the code I wrote earlier was wrong. Because the code says:\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nBut that's not correct. Because even if a[0] is zero, the first part is zero. So the code should compare the first part (a[0] - 0) which is a[0] to the current max_d. So the code should be:\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nBut initially, max_d is 0.0. So for example, if a[0] is 0, then the max_d remains 0.0. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the code was written as:\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nWhich would miss the case where a[0] is 0. So that's a mistake.\n\nAh, right! So the code should be:\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nBut in code, how to do that?\n\nInitially, max_d is 0.0.\n\nThen, the first part is a[0], which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So:\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nSimilarly, for the last part:\n\nlast_part = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, last_part )\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\nThen, for the consecutive pairs.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first part\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\n# last part\nmax_d = max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\n# consecutive parts\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but a[0] is an integer. So when you do max_d = max( ... ), which is a float. So that's okay.\n\nBut for example, if a[0] is 0, then the first part is 0.0, which is correct.\n\nLet me test the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2: 2 5, positions 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nmax_d is initialized to 0.0.\n\nFirst part is a[0] = 2.0. So max_d is 2.0.\n\nLast part is 5 -5 = 0. So max_d remains 2.0.\n\nThen, the consecutive gap is 5-2=3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. Which is less than 2.0. So the max_d remains 2.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input. After sorting, the a is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nFirst part is a[0] = 0. So max_d is 0.0. Then last part is 15 -15 =0. So max_d is 0.0. Then, the consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5, which is bigger than 0.0. So max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0, no change. Then 7-5=2 → 1.0. Then 9-7=2 → 1.0. Then 14-9=5 → 2.5. Which is bigger than 1.5. So max_d is 2.5. Then 15-14=1 → 0.5. So the final max_d is 2.5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then:\n\nmax_d is initialized to 0.0.\n\nFirst part is a[0] =5. So max_d is 5.0.\n\nLast part is 10 -5 =5. So max_d is 5.0.\n\nNo consecutive pairs. So answer is 5.0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=10, positions [0,10]. Then:\n\nmax_d is 0.0 (from a[0] =0), then last part is 10-10=0. So max_d is 0.0. Then consecutive gap is 10-0=10 → 5.0. So the answer is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, the first input sample had the lanterns in the order 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. So after sorting, it becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Which is handled correctly.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. For example, the first input line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', and the second input line is '2 5\\n2 5'. Wait, but the input is read as two lines. Wait, the first input is given as two lines. Wait, the first line is the first line of input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the code reads n and l from the first line. Then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of two elements, like ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']? Or perhaps that's how the test cases are structured. But in the actual code, the input comes from stdin. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code is correct in reading the first line as n and l, then the second line as the list of a_i.\n\nNow, in Python, when reading input, sometimes there can be leading or trailing spaces. But using split() is okay.\n\nNow, for the output, the code needs to print the answer with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, 2.5 is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nIn Python, formatting with .10f will do that.\n\nBut what about when the answer is an integer? Like 2.0. The code will print 2.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to input constraints, l is at least 1. Oh, no. Wait, the input says l can be 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively.\n\nSo l is at least 1. So the case where l=0 is not possible.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then the first part is 0, the last part is 1-0=1. So max_d is 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then first part is 1, last part is 0. So max_d is 1.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the consecutive gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. The first part is 0, last part is 0. So answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The consecutive gaps are 5 and 5. Divided by 2 gives 2.5. First and last parts are 0. So answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 2, 10]. Then the consecutive gaps are 2 (0-2) and 8 (2-10). The first gap is 0, last is 0. The consecutive gaps divided by 2: 1 and 4. So answer is 4.0. Which is correct. Because the gap between 2 and 10 is 8, so the midpoint is 6, which is 4 away from 2 and 6 away from 10. So the radius needs to be 4 to cover that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when we read the list of a_i, we have to make sure that they are integers. Then, after sorting, proceed as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute max_d as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first part\nmax_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n# last part\nmax_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\n# consecutive parts\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in Python, when you do max_d = max(max_d, a[0]), since a[0] is an integer, but max_d is a float. But in Python, comparing int and float is allowed, and the result is correct.\n\nBut for example, if a[0] is 0, then max_d is 0.0, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as 0.0. Then first part is a[0] =0 → max_d is 0.0. Last part is 15-15=0 → max_d remains 0.0. Then for consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change. Then 7-5=2 → 1.0. Then 9-7=2 → 1.0. Then 14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d becomes 2.5. Then 15-14=1 → 0.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted as [2,5]\n\nmax_d is initially 0.0. first part is 2 → max_d is 2.0. last part is 5-5=0 → remains 2.0. consecutive gap is 3 → 1.5. So answer is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case where the first part is the maximum.\n\nn=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then first part is 3.0. last part is 5-3=2.0. So max_d is 3.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the last part is maximum. n=1, l=5, a=[2]. Then first part is 2.0, last part is 3.0. So answer is 3.0.\n\nAnother test case where the consecutive gap is the maximum. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then consecutive gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5.0. Which is the answer.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are all at the same position?\n\nLike n=3, l=10, a = [5,5,5]. Then sorted a is [5,5,5]. First part is 5.0. last part is 5.0. consecutive gaps are 0 and 0. So max_d is 5.0. Which is correct. Because the first part is 5.0, which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. The last part is 5.0, distance from last lantern to l. So the required d is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 0]. Then first part is 0. last part is 10 -0 =10. So answer is 10.0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The key insight is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: This helps in systematically checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Evaluate Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the maximum gap between them. The radius needed to cover this gap is half the size of the gap since the light can extend equally in both directions from each lantern.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the edges and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first part (from 0 to the first lantern)\n    max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))\n    \n    # Check the last part (from the last lantern to l)\n    max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[-1]))\n    \n    # Check consecutive lanterns gaps\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of lanterns) and `l` (length of the street), followed by a list of positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Edge Distance Calculation**: The initial and final distances from the edges of the street to the nearest lanterns are considered.\n4. **Consecutive Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap is divided by two to determine the radius needed to cover that segment.\n5. **Result Formatting**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure the required accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required by leveraging sorting and linear traversal, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is suitable given the constraints.",
