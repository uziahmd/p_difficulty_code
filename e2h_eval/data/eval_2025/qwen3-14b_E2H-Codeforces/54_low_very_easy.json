Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall some geometry here. In a regular polygon with n sides, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides at a vertex. However, the problem here is about choosing three vertices such that the angle at v2 is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v3. So maybe I need to find the possible angles that can be formed this way.\n\nLet me think: For a regular polygon, the central angles (angles from the center to two adjacent vertices) are 360/n degrees. But when considering angles formed by three vertices, perhaps the angle depends on how many steps apart the vertices are.\n\nFor example, in a regular polygon, if I pick three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v2 and v3 (but maybe in a different direction?), but since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would depend on the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3.\n\nWait, but the problem states that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides. So the angle is formed by connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So the angle between these two lines.\n\nNow, for a regular polygon, the measure of such an angle can be determined based on how many edges are between the points. Let me think about this. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's fix v2 as a vertex. Then, suppose there are k vertices between v1 and v2 when moving clockwise, and m vertices between v3 and v2 when moving clockwise. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the number of steps between v1 and v2 along the perimeter determines the angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any three vertices, the angle at v2 can be determined by the number of sides between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the positions are symmetric. So maybe for any triangle formed by three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon.\n\nAlternatively, here's a formula I remember: in a regular polygon, the angle formed at a vertex v2 by two other vertices v1 and v3 depends on the number of sides between them. Let me think. Suppose that between v1 and v2, there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are m steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle is determined by the total number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, but perhaps the angle depends on the arc that is subtended by the points.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Let's imagine that the polygon is inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle formed by three points on a circle. For example, if you have three points A, B, C on a circle, then the angle ABC depends on the arc AC. The measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. So if points A and C are on the circle, and B is another point on the circumference, then angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nBut in our case, the polygon is regular, so all vertices lie on a circle. So the angle at v2 (vertex B) between v1 and v3 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Let me think. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps (edges) along the perimeter. Then, the arc length (in degrees) would be k * (360/n). But since the polygon is convex, the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be the smaller arc between v1 and v3. Wait, but how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 between v1 and v3 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Let me take an example. For example, in a square (n=4), if v2 is one vertex, and v1 and v3 are",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding three vertices in a regular convex n-gon that form an angle closest to a given angle `a`, we need to understand how angles are formed within such a polygon.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Regular Polygon Geometry**:\n   - A regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle.\n   - Each central angle (angle at the center between two adjacent vertices) is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $.\n   - The angle formed at a vertex (say, `v2`) by two other vertices (`v1` and `v3`) is determined by the arc subtended by those two vertices on the circle, excluding the arc that contains `v2`.\n\n2. **Angle Formula**:\n   - If there are `k` steps (edges) between `v1` and `v3` along the perimeter (excluding `v2`), the arc length is $ k \\times \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $.\n   - The angle at `v2` is half of that arc:  \n     $$\n     \\text{angle} = \\frac{k \\times 360^\\circ}{2n} = \\frac{k \\times 180^\\circ}{n}\n     $$\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - We want to find the value of `k` such that the resulting angle is as close as possible to the given angle `a`.\n   - The valid range for `k` is from `2` to `n-2`. Why? Because if `k = 1`, then `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2`, forming a triangle with one edge, which is not valid for the angle formation.\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm Strategy\n\n1. **Iterate over all possible values of `k`** from `2` to `n-2`.\n2. For each `k`, compute the corresponding angle using the formula:  \n   $$\n   \\text{angle} = \\frac{k \\times 180^\\circ}{n}\n   $$\n3. Compute the absolute difference between this angle and the target angle `a`.\n4. Keep track of the `k` that gives the minimum difference.\n5. Once the best `k` is found, construct a valid triplet of vertices.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing the Triplet\n\nOnce the optimal `k` is found, we can construct the triplet as follows:\n\n- Fix `v2` as vertex `1`.\n- Let `v1` be vertex `1 + k` (mod `n`).\n- Let `v3` be vertex `1 + k + 1` (mod `n`).\n\nThis ensures that the angle is formed with the correct number of steps between the vertices.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 2\n    \n    for k in range(2, n - 1):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Now construct the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = (v2 + best_k) % n\n    if v1 == 0:\n        v1 = n\n    v3 = (v2 + best_k + 1) % n\n    if v3 == 0:\n        v3 = n\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n- This solution efficiently computes the best possible angle using a linear scan through possible values of `k`.\n- It constructs a valid triplet based on the best `k`, ensuring that the angle is as close as possible to the target angle `a`.\n- The modulo operation ensures that the vertex numbers wrap around correctly for large `n`.",
