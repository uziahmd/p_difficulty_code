He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about splitting n problems into exactly k days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous block of problems starting from the beginning. So like, the first day he does some number of problems, then the next day starts where the previous left off, and so on until all are done. The total profit is the sum of the maximum difficulty of each day's problems. And I need to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm. The example given: for n=8, k=3, and the array [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], the optimal split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2], with maxes 5,6,9 summing to 20.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum possible sum and output the split.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this problem. Since it's a dynamic programming problem, maybe?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming approaches. Let's consider dp[i][j] as the maximum profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nThen, the transition would be: for dp[i][j], we can look at all possible m < i, where the j-th day is from m+1 to i. Then dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m from j-1 to i-1 (since each day must have at least one problem).\n\nBut for n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this approach would be O(n^2 * k) time. Let's see: n is 2000, k is 2000. Then n^2 *k is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. Not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to optimize this. Let's think about the constraints. For example, when k is up to n, but perhaps in practice, for some cases, the DP can be optimized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a greedy approach? But how? Because the maximums are dependent on the grouping. For example, if you have a very high value in the array, it's better to have it as a single day's max. But since the splits are contiguous, perhaps the optimal way is to split such that each day's max is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem requires exactly k days. So if k is 1, then the answer is the max of the entire array. If k equals n, then each day has one problem, and the sum is the sum of all elements.\n\nBut for general cases, how to approach?\n\nAnother thought: for each possible split into k days, the sum is the sum of the max of each segment. To maximize this sum, we need to have as many high values as possible as maxes of their segments.\n\nBut how to split?\n\nLet me think about the DP approach again. Let's think about the DP[i][j] as the maximum profit for the first i problems divided into j days. Then, for the base case, DP[0][0] = 0. For DP[i][1], it's the max of the first i elements. For DP[i][j], we can consider for each m from j-1 to i-1, and take DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut the problem is that calculating the max for each m and i would take O(n) per transition. So for each DP[i][j], it's O(n) time, leading to O(n^2 *k) total time. For n=2000 and k=2000, this is impossible.\n\nBut wait, n is up to 2000, and k is up to 2000. However, if k is larger than n, but according to the input constraints, k is between 1 and n. So for k up to n, but for n=2000, O(n^3) is 8e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nSo we need to find a way to optimize this.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute the maximums for all possible intervals. For example, create a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum value in a[i..j]. Then, when we compute DP[i][j], we can quickly get the max for any interval.\n\nBut even with that, the DP transition is O(n^2 *k) time.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a way to compute the transitions more efficiently. Let's think about the DP recurrence:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute a list of problems into exactly `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulties of each day's problems, is maximized. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) with precomputed maximum values for intervals to optimize the transitions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximum Values**: Create a 2D array `max_range` where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum value in the subarray from index `i` to `j`.\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each possible number of problems `i` and days `j`, compute the maximum profit by considering all possible splits of the first `i` problems into `j` days. This involves checking all possible previous splits and using the precomputed maximum values to efficiently calculate the profit for each segment.\n4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: After computing the DP table, backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across the `k` days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    # Also track the path\n    prev = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][1] = max_range[0][i-1]\n    \n    for j in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            # Find the best m where the j-th day starts at m\n            max_val = 0\n            for m in range(j-1, i):\n                current = dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1]\n                if current > max_val:\n                    max_val = current\n                    prev[i][j] = [m, i-1]\n            dp[i][j] = max_val\n    \n    # Reconstruct the solution\n    res = []\n    current_i = n\n    current_j = k\n    while current_j > 1:\n        m, end = prev[current_i][current_j]\n        res.append(end - m + 1)\n        current_i = m\n        current_j -= 1\n    res.append(current_i)  # the first day's length\n    res.reverse()\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_range` array is precomputed to quickly access the maximum difficulty of any subarray, which helps in efficiently calculating the profit for each possible segment during the DP transitions.\n2. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp[i][j]` is initialized where `dp[i][1]` is set to the maximum value of the first `i` problems since they must be solved in one day.\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each possible number of days `j` and problems `i`, the solution considers all possible previous splits and computes the maximum profit by adding the maximum value of the current segment.\n4. **Reconstructing the Path**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across the `k` days, ensuring the maximum profit is achieved.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal distribution using dynamic programming with precomputed values, leading to an optimal solution within feasible time complexity.",
