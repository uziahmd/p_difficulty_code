There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all restrictions.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Well, since n and h and m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even then, for each of the n houses, there are h+1 possibilities. For n=50, that's 51^50 possibilities, which is way too big. So brute force isn't feasible here.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's think about constraints. The restrictions are about the maximum in certain intervals. So for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval must be <= x_i. How can I model this?\n\nAnother thought: since each restriction applies to a range, perhaps the maximum height for each position is constrained by some of the restrictions. For example, if there's a restriction that says that in [1,3], the max is 2, then each of the houses 1, 2, 3 can't be higher than 2. But maybe there are other restrictions that apply to subsets of those ranges, which could be more restrictive.\n\nWait, but the restrictions are that for each interval, the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. So, for each interval, the maximum of all the houses in that interval must be <= x_i. So, for example, if there's a restriction on [l_i, r_i] with x_i, then each individual house in that interval can't be higher than x_i. Because if any of them was higher, then the max would exceed x_i. Wait, no. Because if one of them is higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i. So, that would violate the restriction. Therefore, for each restriction, all houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Wait, no! Because the restriction says that the maximum in that interval must be <= x_i. So that implies that every house in that interval must be <= x_i. Because if any house in the interval was higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i. Therefore, the restriction is equivalent to saying that for each house in [l_i, r_i], its height must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose there's a restriction that the max in [1,3] is 2. Then, each house in that interval must be <= 2. Because if any of them is higher, say house 2 is 3, then the max is 3 which violates the restriction. Therefore, the restriction can be transformed into per-house constraints. So for each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), each house in positions l_i to r_i must have a height <= x_i. But wait, maybe that's not the case. Because maybe there's a restriction that says that the maximum in [1,3] is 2. However, if all the houses are <= 2, then the maximum is also <= 2. So the restriction is equivalent to saying that each house in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Therefore, the problem can be transformed into a set of per-house constraints. For each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval. Plus, the original h constraint (each house can't be higher than h).\n\nWait, but that's only if the restrictions are such that for each house, all the restrictions that cover it. For example, suppose a house is in multiple restrictions. For example, if a house is in two restrictions: one that says [1,2] must be <= 3, and another that says [2,3] must be <= 2. Then, for house 2, the maximum allowed is min(3, 2) = 2. So yes, for each house, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's from the restrictions that include that house in their interval. Also, we have to consider the original h as an upper bound. Because even if there are no restrictions, the house can't be higher than h.\n\nWait, but what if a restriction has a higher x_i than h? Like, suppose h is 3, and there's a restriction that says [1,1] must be <= 4. But since the maximum allowed is h=3, that restriction is automatically satisfied. So for each house, the effective maximum is min(h, the minimum of x_i's of all restrictions that cover that house).\n\nBut is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose there are multiple restrictions. For example, suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x_i=2, and another restriction on [2,2] with x_i=3. Then, for house 2, the first restriction says that it must be <= 2, and the second allows up to 3. So the effective maximum is 2. So the min of all x_i's that apply to that house. So yes, for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem becomes straightforward. For each house, compute the maximum allowed height, which is the minimum between h and all the x_i's of restrictions that include that house in their interval. Then, the optimal choice is to set each house to that maximum allowed height, because the profit is a^2, which is maximized when a is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each restriction is converted into per-house constraints. So once we have per-house constraints, then each house can be set to the maximum allowed, and that would satisfy all the restrictions. Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], all the houses in that interval are constrained to be <= x_i. So the maximum in that interval would be <= x_i. Therefore, the problem reduces to, for each house, find the maximum allowed height (the minimum of h and all x_i's of restrictions that cover that house). Then sum the squares of these values.\n\nBut wait, that seems too easy. Let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is 3 3 3, with restrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → house 1 must be ≤1.\n\n2 2 3 → house 2 must be ≤3.\n\n3 3 2 → house 3 must be ≤2.\n\nSo for each house, the maximum allowed is 1, 3, 2. So the sum is 1² + 3² + 2² = 1+9+4=14, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → houses 2 and 3 must be ≤8.\n\n3 4 7 → houses 3 and 4 must be ≤7.\n\nSo for each house:\n\nHouse 1: no restrictions, so max is h=10.\n\nHouse 2: only the first restriction applies, so 8.\n\nHouse 3: both restrictions apply. So min(8,7) =7.\n\nHouse4: second restriction, 7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each house, find the minimum between h and all x_i's of restrictions that include that house in their interval. Then, sum the squares of those values.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo for each house i (from 1 to n), collect all the restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Then take the minimum of their x_i's. Then compare that with h, take the minimum between them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize for each house, the maximum allowed is h.\n\n- For each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   - For each house i in l to r:\n\n      - if x is less than the current maximum allowed for i, update it to x.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, each house's maximum allowed is the minimum between h and all x_i's that apply to it. Then sum the squares.\n\nYes. That seems to be the approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize an array max_heights of size n, initialized to h.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = input values.\n\n   for i in range l to r (inclusive):\n\n       if x < max_heights[i-1]:\n\n           max_heights[i-1] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute sum of (h^2 for h in max_heights).\n\nWait, but in Python, indexes start from 0. So for the houses 1..n, the array is 0-based.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nmax_heights starts as [3,3,3].\n\nProcess the first restriction (1,1,1). So for i=1 (house 1), set max_heights[0] to 1.\n\nThen second restriction (2,2,3): for i=2, set max_heights[1] to 3 (no change).\n\nThird restriction (3,3,2): for i=3, set max_heights[2] to 2.\n\nSo the array is [1,3,2], sum of squares is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second sample. The restrictions are (2,3,8) and (3,4,7). For each house:\n\nInitially, max_heights is [10,10,10,10].\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3. So for i=2 and 3. For i=2 (index 1), set to 8. For i=3 (index 2), set to 8. Now array is [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4. So for i=3 (index 2) and 4 (index 3). For i=3, current value is 8, new x is 7. So set to 7. For i=4, set to 7. Now array is [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 10² + 8² +7² +7² = 262.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach works. So the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, what about overlapping restrictions? For example, if a house is covered by multiple restrictions, the code will take the minimum of all x_i's. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about when a restriction's x_i is larger than h? For example, h is 3, and a restriction says [1,1] must be <= 4. Then, the code would set the max_heights for house 1 to 4, but since the initial value is h=3, which is lower than 4, the code would leave it as 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly takes the minimum between the x_i and h.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize each house's maximum height to h.\n\nFor each restriction, iterate over all positions in l_i to r_i, and set the maximum height of that position to the minimum between its current value and x_i.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of inputs, like ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'].\n\nBut the problem says that the input is read from standard input. Wait, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in reality, the actual input is given as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as two separate cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases? But looking at the problem statement's sample input and output, the first example is one case, and the second is another. But the problem says that the code should process a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is showing two different test cases, but in practice, the code should process one test case. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's for the purpose of the example. So the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that the first input is a string like '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2' which is the first test case, and then another string for the second test case. But in reality, the code should process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code should read one.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as two separate cases, but the output is given as two separate outputs. However, in the problem's actual input, the code is supposed to read a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows two test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. Therefore, the sample input given in the problem is perhaps two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one. So the code should read from stdin as per the input format.\n\nTherefore, the code should read n, h, m from the first line, then read m lines of restrictions.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nInitialize max_heights as [h] * n.\n\nThen for each restriction, loop through l_i to r_i (inclusive), and for each position in that range, set max_heights[i-1] to min(current value, x_i).\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares.\n\nThen print the sum.\n\nBut wait, the code must read from stdin. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nSo the code reads that and outputs 14.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, h=0, m=0. Then the maximum is 0, sum is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: multiple restrictions on the same interval. For example, two restrictions on [1,1], x=2 and x=3. The code will take the minimum, which is 2.\n\nAnother case: a restriction that covers the entire range. For example, n=3, h=5, m=1, restriction [1,3, 2]. All houses are capped at 2. Sum is 2² *3 = 12.\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions. For example, n=3, m=2: restriction [1,2, 3], and [2,3, 2]. Then house 1 is allowed up to 3, house 2 is allowed up to min(3,2)=2, house 3 is allowed up to 2.\n\nSo the code would process this correctly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nThen read m lines.\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as input().split().\n\nBut for the code to handle multiple lines, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        idx = i - 1\n\n        if max_heights[idx] > x:\n\n            max_heights[idx] = x\n\nsum_profit = sum( [a*a for a in max_heights] )\n\nprint(sum_profit)\n\nWait, but in the code, for each restriction, the code loops from l to r (inclusive), and for each i in that range, set the max_heights[i-1] to min(current value, x). So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nAfter processing:\n\nmax_heights is [1, 3, 2], sum is 14.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial max_heights is [10, 10, 10, 10]\n\nFirst restriction l=2, r=3, x=8. So for i=2 and 3:\n\npositions 2 (index 1) and 3 (index 2). So set to 8. Now max_heights is [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction l=3, r=4, x=7. So i=3 and 4. For i=3 (index 2), current value 8 is larger than 7 → set to 7. For i=4 (index 3) → 10 → set to 7. So max_heights is [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 10² + 8² +7² +7² = 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. Then sum is 5² = 25.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=5, m=1, restriction [1,2, 3]. So max_heights is [3,3]. Sum 18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m. Then m lines.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple test cases? Well, according to the problem statement, the code should process one test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. However, looking back, the sample input is given as a list of two inputs. But in reality, the code should read one test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. So the code is written for a single test case.\n\nThus, the code should be as follows.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then m lines. So the code is as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nThen process as before.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        idx = i - 1\n\n        if max_heights[idx] > x:\n\n            max_heights[idx] = x\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor height in max_heights:\n\n    total += height * height\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code may have to read from stdin, but sometimes when there are multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should process one test case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should process one test case. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThe code processes that, and returns 14.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich returns 262.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWhat about when a restriction has x_i larger than h?\n\nLike n=1, h=3, m=1, restriction [1,1, 5]. Then the max_heights is [3], since the initial value is h=3, and x_i=5 is larger. So the code leaves it as 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case where a restriction is redundant. Like, if there's a restriction [1,1, 5], but h is 3. So the code sets the max_heights to 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions.
