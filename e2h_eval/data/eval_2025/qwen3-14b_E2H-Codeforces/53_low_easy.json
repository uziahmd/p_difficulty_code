Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. Let's take the examples given. For example, 'ababa' gives 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So overlapping is allowed here.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once?\n\nThe brute force way would be to check all possible substrings for each possible length, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, and see if any of them appear at least twice. Once I find the maximum length where this is true, I can return it.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible length? Well, for a string of length n, the maximum possible substring length that can appear twice is floor(n/2). For example, if the string is length 5, the maximum possible is 2 (since two substrings of length 2 can fit, but not 3). Wait, no. For example, in 'aaaaa', the substring of length 3 'aaa' appears multiple times. Wait, the maximum possible length would be n-1. Because if the string is 'aa', then the maximum is 1. But for a string of length 5, the maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is 4? Like if the string is 'aaaaa', then the substring of length 4 'aaaa' appears twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So yes, for a string of length n, the maximum possible is n-1. But for the problem, we need to check all possible lengths from the maximum possible down to 1, and for each length, check if there's a substring of that length that occurs at least twice.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the given string, iterate possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1.\n- For each length L, generate all possible substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n- The first L for which this is true is the answer. If none found, return 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently check for duplicates?\n\nFor each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once. For example, using a set to track the substrings we've seen so far. If during iteration, we find a substring that's already in the set, then we can return that L as the answer.\n\nWait, but for each L, we need to check if there exists at least two occurrences. So for each L, we can generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears more than once. So for each L, we can loop through all possible starting indices, collect the substrings, and check for duplicates.\n\nBut for the problem, since the maximum length of the string is 100, the maximum number of possible substrings for each L is O(n), and for each L, checking for duplicates can be done with a set. So for each L, we can do this:\n\nInitialize a set. Then, for each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n   substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n   if substring is in the set, then return True for this L.\n\n   else add it to the set.\n\nIf after checking all substrings for this L, we found at least one duplicate, then return L as the maximum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   check if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\n   if yes, return L.\n\nIf none found after checking all L down to 1, return 0.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output is 0. Because all substrings of length 3 (max possible is 3) are 'abc', 'bcd' — each appears once. For length 2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. So output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → len is 5. Let's check L=4 first. Substrings are 'abab' (positions 0-3), 'baba' (1-4). Both unique. Then L=3. Substrings are 'aba' (0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So 'aba' appears twice. So return 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → len is 3. Check L=2 first. Substrings are 'zz' (positions",
