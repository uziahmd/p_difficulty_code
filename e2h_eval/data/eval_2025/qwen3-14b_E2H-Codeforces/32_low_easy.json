    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when we remove one element, we want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, consider removing it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and find the minimum instability. However, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. For n=1e5, that would be 1e10 operations, which won't work.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's think about the properties of the array.\n\nThe instability after removing one element depends on which element we remove. The key observation here is that the original array's max and min are important. But when we remove an element, it can affect the max or min of the array.\n\nFor example, if the array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them might not change the overall max or min. But if there's only one occurrence, then removing that element would change the max or min.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider the cases where removing the max or min would lead to a better instability. However, there might be other cases where removing some other element (not the max or min) would be better.\n\nBut how do I find that efficiently?\n\nLet me think: the original array's max and min are known. Suppose I sort the array. Then, the instability is max - min. If I remove the first element (the smallest), then the new instability is (max of the rest) - (second smallest). Similarly, if I remove the last element (the largest), the new instability is (second largest) - (min of the rest).\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, then the min is the first element and the max is the last. So, if I remove the first element, the new min is the second element. The new max is the last element. Similarly, if I remove the last element, the new max is the second last element, and the min is the first element.\n\nBut what if there are duplicates? Like, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. If I remove the 7, the new max is 3, and the min is 1. So instability is 2. If I remove the first element (1), the new min is 3, and the max is 7. Instability is 4. So in this case, the best is to remove the max.\n\nBut how do I find the best element to remove?\n\nSo, if the array is sorted, then the possible candidates for removal are:\n\n- The first element (min) or the last element (max). Because removing them could reduce the instability.\n\nBut maybe also other elements? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 1, it's 4-2=2. But if we remove 2, the instability is 4-1=3. So the best is to remove either the first or last element.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 5, the array becomes [1,2,6,7], instability is 5. If we remove 6, the array becomes [1,2,5,7], instability is 6. So in this case, removing 5 gives a better result. Wait, but how does that fit into the sorted array approach?\n\nIn this case, the sorted array is [1,2,5,6,7]. The possible options are:\n\nIf we remove 5 (the third element), then the new array is [1,2,6,7]. The instability is 7-1 = 6. Wait, no. Wait, the max is 7, min is 1. So instability is 6. Which is same as original. So why did I think earlier that removing 5 gives 5? Oh, I must have made a mistake in that example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, original array is [1,2,5,6,7]. Instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 5, the array is [1,2,6,7], so instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 6, array is",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us efficiently determine the potential candidates for removal that could minimize instability.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in zero instability.\n3. **Evaluate Candidates**: After sorting, consider removing the first element (minimum) or the last element (maximum). This is because removing these elements can potentially reduce the instability.\n4. **Compute Minimum Instability**: By checking the instability when removing the first element and the last element, we can determine the minimum possible instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check removing the first element\n    instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # Check removing the last element\n    instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are critical for determining instability.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: When the array has only two elements, removing either results in a single-element array with zero instability.\n3. **Instability Calculation**: By considering the removal of the first and last elements in the sorted array, we efficiently compute the potential minimum instability. Removing the first element reduces the minimum value, while removing the last element reduces the maximum value. The minimum of these two scenarios gives the optimal result.\n\nThis approach ensures we handle large input sizes efficiently with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it suitable for the given constraints.",
