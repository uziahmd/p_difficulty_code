Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm, how do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once?\n\nThe brute force way would be to generate all possible substrings for all possible lengths, then check if they appear at least twice. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, this might be feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings for all possible lengths, starting from the maximum possible length down to 1. For each length, check if there's a substring of that length that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that length as the maximum.\n\nSo for example, for a string of length N, the maximum possible substring length is N-1 (since a substring of length N would be the entire string, but it can't occur twice). Wait, but if the string is like \"aaaaa\", then the substring of length 4 occurs twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So for each possible length L, we can check all substrings of length L and see if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate L from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1.\n- For each L, generate all substrings of length L, track their occurrences using a dictionary or a set.\n- If any substring occurs more than once, return L as the answer.\n- If no such substring is found for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently check for duplicates?\n\nFor each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears more than once. For example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' appears twice.\n\nSo for each L, we can loop through the string, take each substring of length L, and store them in a set. If during this process, a substring is already in the set, then we return L as the answer.\n\nWait, but how do we check if a substring occurs at least twice? Because if we have a set, we can check if the same substring is added again. But for that, maybe we can use a dictionary to count occurrences. Or perhaps, for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, we can iterate through all possible starting indices, collect the substrings, and check if any substring occurs more than once.\n\nBut for each L, the maximum number of substrings is O(N) (for example, for L=1, there are N substrings). So for each L, the process is O(N) time. Since the maximum L is up to 100, and the string is up to 100 characters, the total time complexity is O(N^3) in the worst case. Because for each L (up to N), for each starting index (up to N-L+1), we generate the substring (O(L) time) and check for duplicates.\n\nBut for N=100, that's 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000 operations. Which should be manageable.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- For the given string s:\n\n- For L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   - Create a set to store substrings of length L.\n\n   - Iterate i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n      - substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n      - if substr is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n      - else add it to the set.\n\n   - After checking all substrings of length L, if none found, proceed to L-1.\n\n- If no such L found, return 0.\n\nWait, but this approach would miss cases where a substring occurs more than once but not overlapping. For example, in 'abcdabc', the substring 'abc' occurs twice. But in this case, the code would find it when L=3.\n\nYes, because for L=3, the substrings are 'abc', 'bcd', 'cda', 'dab', 'abc'. The first 'abc' is added to the set. Then when the next 'abc' is found",
