For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset must satisfy that for every binary string s (of length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset depends on how the c_s values are chosen. Our goal is to find all possible assignments of c_s values where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints on the c_s values. The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by all prefixes. So perhaps we can model this as some kind of tree structure, where each node represents a binary string, and the constraints propagate upwards.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For any binary string s of length l, the number of times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset is limited by c_s. However, each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, a string of length n contributes to all its prefixes of lengths 1 to n.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum constraints along the paths from the root (empty string?) to the leaves (strings of length n). Wait, but the problem says that the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So each such string has all its prefixes (from length 1 up to n) contributing to their respective counts.\n\nBut how to model the maximum possible size of the multiset given the c_s values?\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where you have to assign capacities to nodes in a trie, and the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) you can have without exceeding any of the capacities along their paths. Then, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset would be the maximum number of such leaves possible given the capacities.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of capacity assignments (c_s for all s) such that the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be placed without violating any c_s is exactly f.\n\nSo the key is to find, for each possible assignment of c_s, what is the maximum number of strings of length n that can be placed in the multiset under those constraints. Then, count the number of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum for a given set of c_s?\n\nLet me think of the trie structure. Each node in the trie represents a binary string. For example, the root is the empty string, then each level corresponds to the length of the string. For each node, the capacity c_s is the maximum number of times that node's string can be a prefix of any string in the multiset.\n\nNow, the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be placed under these constraints is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves such that for every node on the path from the root to any leaf, the number of leaves passing through that node does not exceed c_s.\n\nThis is similar to a flow problem where each node has a capacity, and the leaves are the destinations. However, since each leaf contributes to all its ancestors, the capacity constraints must be respected for all nodes along the path.\n\nIn this scenario, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (the sum of capacities of the node's children, considering the constraints from their parents). Wait, no. Maybe this is more like a problem where the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal \"bottleneck\" along the paths.\n\nAlternatively, this is similar to the problem of scheduling with constraints. For example, each node can have a certain capacity, and when you add a leaf, you use up one unit from each of the nodes along its path. The maximum number of leaves is the largest number such that for all nodes, the number of leaves passing through them is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum? Let's think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, each of its children can contribute to that.\n\nWait, here's a standard approach: For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be generated under its subtree is min(c_s, sum of the max leaves from each child). But since each leaf passes through exactly one path from the root to a leaf, and for each node on that path, the count increases by 1. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves that can be placed under the entire trie is determined by the capacities of the nodes in a way that for each node, the number of leaves passing through it cannot exceed c_s. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves given that each node has a capacity constraint. The maximum number of leaves would be the minimum over all nodes of the sum of the capacities of their children, but that might not capture the hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a hierarchical constraint. For the root node (empty string), the maximum number of leaves is limited by c_root. But each of those leaves must also pass through their first-level children. So for each child of the root, the number of leaves that pass through it can't exceed c_child, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be generated under that subtree is constrained by the node's capacity and the capacities of its children.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}, but that's probably not correct. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For a given assignment of c_s, the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) is the minimum, over all nodes s, of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, think of the constraints as follows: For any node s of length l, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s. Since each such leaf is a string of length n, the number of leaves that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s. Let's denote this as m_s. Then, for each node s, m_s ≤ c_s.\n\nMoreover, for the root node (empty string), m_root is the total number of leaves in the multiset, which is the value we want to maximize. But for each node s, m_s is the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}, where s0 and s1 are the children of s (appending 0 or 1). However, this is only if the node s is not a leaf (i.e., its length is less than n). For nodes of length n, m_s can be at most 1 (since they are leaves themselves), but perhaps in this problem, the nodes of length n are leaves in the trie.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for the multiset to contain any number of strings of length n. However, each such string contributes to the count of all its prefixes. So for a node s of length l < n, m_s is the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For example, if s is a string of length l, then m_s is the number of leaves in the multiset that start with s. Therefore, m_s can be any number, but for each node s, m_s ≤ c_s. Also, for a node s of length l, m_s = m_{s0} + m_{s1}, where s0 and s1 are the children of s (if l < n). But for nodes of length n, m_s can be 0 or 1, depending on whether the string is present in the multiset. However, the multiset is allowed to have multiple copies of the same string. Wait, no! Wait, the problem says it's a multiset, so duplicates are allowed. So for example, the same string can appear multiple times in the multiset. So for a node s of length n, m_s is the number of times s appears in the multiset. However, for a node s of length l < n, m_s is the total number of leaves (strings of length n) in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Which is the sum of the counts of all leaves in the subtree rooted at s.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nFor every node s, m_s ≤ c_s.\n\nAnd for every node s of length l < n, m_s = m_{s0} + m_{s1}.\n\nBut since the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string, the m_s for the leaves (nodes of length n) can be any non-negative integer, as long as the sum of their counts doesn't exceed the constraints of their ancestors.\n\nBut the maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum possible sum of all m_s for leaves (i.e., the total number of elements in the multiset), which is the same as the sum of all m_s for leaves. Wait, no. Because each element in the multiset is a string of length n. So the total number of elements in the multiset is the sum of m_s for all leaves s (each m_s is the count of s in the multiset). But for the constraints, the m_s for each node s is the sum of counts of all leaves in its subtree.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: given the capacities c_s for all nodes, what is the maximum possible value of the sum of m_leaf (for all leaves) such that for all nodes s, m_s ≤ c_s, and for all non-leaf nodes s, m_s = m_{s0} + m_{s1}.\n\nSo, the maximum total is the maximum possible sum of m_leaf (over all leaves) under these constraints. And we need to find the number of c_s assignments such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Now, the question is: How can we compute this maximum value given the c_s values?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node s, the maximum possible m_s is min(c_s, sum of the maximum possible m of its children). But since for non-leaf nodes, m_s is fixed as the sum of its children's m's. Wait, but the children's m's are constrained by their own capacities. So, perhaps the maximum possible m_root (which is the total number of elements in the multiset) is determined by the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, here's an example. Suppose n=1. Then, there are two nodes: '0' and '1'. The capacities c_0 and c_1. The maximum possible multiset size is min(c_0, c_1). Because each element in the multiset is either '0' or '1', and each contributes to their respective c_s. So the maximum is min(c_0, c_1). For example, if c_0=2 and c_1=3, then the maximum is 2.\n\nIn the first example input, n=1, k=42, f=2. The output is 3. The three ways are choosing c_0=0, c_1=2 (max is 0, but wait that's not matching. Wait, no. Wait the example says that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So in that example, for the first case, when c_0=0 and c_1=2, the maximum size is 0? No, that can't be. Wait the note says that in the first example, the three ways are:\n\nFor example, when c_0=0, c_1=2: the maximum beautiful multiset is {1,1}, which has size 2. But why is that allowed? Because the root node (empty string) is not considered here. Wait, no. Wait the root is not part of the problem. The problem says that for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n, the count of prefixes is considered. So for the root, perhaps there is no such thing. Wait the root is not considered here. The problem says that for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n. So for n=1, the nodes are '0' and '1'.\n\nSo for the multiset {1,1}, the count for '1' is 2 (which is allowed if c_1 is ≥2). The count for '0' is zero, which is allowed if c_0 ≥0. So the maximum possible size is 2, which is the minimum between c_0 and c_1? No. Because the maximum size is the sum of the counts of the leaves (each leaf is a string of length 1). But since each string in the multiset is a leaf, and for each such string, the count is added to their respective c_s. But the constraints are that for each s (like '0' and '1'), the count of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤c_s. For the root, there's no such node. Wait, no, the root isn't considered here. The problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So in the case of n=1, the s's are the single-character strings.\n\nSo in the example where c_0=0 and c_1=2, the maximum size is 2. Because you can have two copies of '1', which contributes 2 to the count for '1' (which is allowed as c_1 is 2) and 0 to the count for '0' (allowed as c_0 is 0). So the maximum is 2.\n\nAh, so the maximum possible size is the minimum of the capacities of the root's children? No, because the root is not part of the problem. Wait, the root isn't considered. So how is the maximum determined?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints of the nodes. For example, in the case of n=1, the maximum size is the minimum between c_0 and c_1? No, because if c_0 is 0 and c_1 is 2, the maximum size is 2. Which is the minimum of c_0 (0) and c_1 (2)? No, that's not. So that approach is wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct way to model this? For each node, the count of leaves in its subtree is m_s. For the root node (which is not considered in the problem?), no. Wait, the root is not part of the problem. The problem considers all strings s of length 1 to n. So for example, for n=1, the root is not part of the problem. So in that case, for the root's children (the nodes of length 1), their m_s is the count of leaves (since they are leaves themselves). So for the root's children (nodes of length 1), m_s is the number of times s appears in the multiset. And since the root is not considered, the constraints are only on the nodes of length 1. Thus, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the sum of m_0 + m_1, where m_0 ≤ c_0 and m_1 ≤ c_1. But since the sum is m_0 + m_1, the maximum is c_0 + c_1. But that contradicts the earlier example where the maximum was 2 when c_0=0 and c_1=2. Because 0+2=2, which matches. Oh right! So in this case, the maximum is the sum of the capacities of the leaves (nodes of length n). But wait, that can't be right because in other cases, there may be constraints from higher nodes. For example, consider n=2. Suppose for the root's children (nodes of length 1), say '0' and '1', their capacities are 3 and 3. Then, for their children (nodes of length 2), say '00', '01', '10', '11' have capacities 1, 1, 1, 1. What is the maximum possible size of the multiset?\n\nEach string in the multiset is of length 2. For example, the multiset can contain '00', '01', '10', '11' once each. That's 4 elements. But the sum of the capacities for the leaves is 1+1+1+1=4. However, for the node '0' (length 1), the m_s is the number of leaves in its subtree, which is 2 (the two children). So m_0 is 2 ≤ c_0 (which is 3). Similarly for m_1. So the maximum is indeed 4. But what if the capacity for '0' is 1? Then, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of '0' is 1. So for the leaves under '0', their sum can be at most 1. Thus, the maximum total is 1 (from '0's children) plus 1 (from '1's children) = 2. Which is the sum of the capacities of the root's children (1 + 1 = 2). Wait, but the capacities of the leaves are 1 each. So the sum of the capacities of the leaves is 4, but the maximum possible is 2. So clearly, the maximum is not simply the sum of the capacities of the leaves. It depends on the constraints of the parent nodes.\n\nSo the maximum is determined by the constraints of the nodes along the paths. This seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming, where for each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in its subtree is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. For a node s of length l < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children. Because each child can contribute up to their own maximum, but the sum of those must not exceed c_s. For example, if a node has two children, each can contribute up to x and y, but the sum x + y can't exceed c_s. So the maximum for this node is min(c_s, x + y).\n\nBut for the leaves (nodes of length n), their maximum is simply c_s, since there are no children. Because for a leaf node, the number of leaves in its subtree is the count of that node itself. Which is bounded by c_s. So for a leaf node, the maximum is c_s.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n- For each node in the trie (starting from the leaves and moving up to the root), compute the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in its subtree, which is min(c_s, sum of the maximum of its children).\n\nThen, the maximum size of the multiset is the maximum for the root's children (but the root is not part of the problem?), or perhaps the root is considered as a node of length 0. Wait, the root would be the empty string. But according to the problem statement, all s considered are of length 1 to n. So the root isn't part of the constraints. However, the root's children are the nodes of length 1. So the maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the maximum leaves for each of the root's children? No, because each of the root's children's maximum is the number of leaves in their subtree, which is the sum of their children's maximum, etc. But the root's maximum would be the sum of its children's maximum. However, since the root isn't part of the constraints (as per the problem statement), there's no upper limit on the root's maximum. So the maximum size of the multiset is the maximum possible sum of the leaves, which is the sum of the maximum for each of the root's children's maximum. Wait, no. Because the root's maximum would be the sum of its children's maximum. But since there's no constraint on the root, that sum is allowed. So the maximum possible size of the multiset is the sum of the maximum of each of the root's children. However, since the root's children are the nodes of length 1, each of which contributes their own maximum, which is min(c_s, ...).\n\nWait, but this seems to suggest that the maximum possible size of the multiset is determined by the root's children's maximum. But for example, in the case of n=2, the root has two children (0 and 1). For each of them, their maximum is min(c_s, sum of their children's maximum). The sum of these two maxima is the total number of leaves in the multiset.\n\nYes. So the overall maximum is the sum of the maximum of the root's children. But the root's children are the nodes of length 1. For each of them, their maximum is min(c_s, sum of their children's maximum). And their children are the nodes of length 2.\n\nSo for the entire trie, we can compute for each node s (of length l) the maximum number of leaves in its subtree, which is:\n\nif l == n:\n    max_leaves[s] = c_s\nelse:\n    max_leaves[s] = min(c_s, sum(max_leaves[child] for child in children of s))\n\nThen, the total maximum size of the multiset is the sum of max_leaves for the root's children (the nodes of length 1).\n\nBut since the root is not part of the constraints, there's no upper bound on the sum of its children's max_leaves. However, the max_leaves for each child is already constrained by their own c_s and their children's max_leaves.\n\nSo, given this model, the problem reduces to: find the number of assignments of c_s (for all s of length 1 to n) such that the computed total (sum of max_leaves for root's children) is exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be up to 15, which means there are 2^1 - 1 + 2^2 - 1 + ... + 2^n - 1 = 2^{n+1} - 2 - n? Wait, no. The total number of binary strings of lengths 1 to n is sum_{l=1}^n 2^l} = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable for some DP approaches, but not sure yet.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, and for each node, we need to compute something based on its children, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, considering the trie structure.\n\nBut how to model the possible choices of c_s and their impact on the maximum?\n\nAlternatively, since each node's max_leaves depends on the c_s and the children's max_leaves, perhaps we can find for each node s, the possible values of max_leaves[s], and then combine them in a way that ensures the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut since the c_s can be up to k (which can be 2e5), and n is small (up to 15), perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of max_leaves[s], and the number of ways to choose c_s such that this value is achieved, considering the constraints from the children.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think recursively. For each node s, the max_leaves[s] is determined by c_s and the max_leaves of its children. Let's denote that for a node s of length l, if l < n, then it has two children (s0 and s1). For the node s, the max_leaves[s] is min(c_s, max_leaves[s0] + max_leaves[s1]).\n\nBut the choice of c_s can be any value between 0 and k. However, for the max_leaves[s] to be determined, we need to choose c_s such that:\n\nmax_leaves[s] = min(c_s, sum_children).\n\nBut the sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of the children. So for a node s, once we know the sum_children, the choice of c_s can be any value >= max_leaves[s], but since max_leaves[s] is min(c_s, sum_children), then:\n\nif c_s >= sum_children, then max_leaves[s] = sum_children.\n\nOtherwise, max_leaves[s] = c_s.\n\nTherefore, for a given sum_children, the possible values of max_leaves[s] are between 0 and sum_children, and for each possible value m (<= sum_children), the number of ways to choose c_s is:\n\nif m == sum_children: then c_s can be any value >= sum_children (but <=k). So the number of choices is (k - sum_children + 1) if sum_children <=k. Otherwise zero.\n\nif m < sum_children: then c_s must be exactly m, and m must be <=k. So the number of choices is 1 if m <=k, else zero.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given sum_children, the max_leaves[s] is min(c_s, sum_children). So, if I want max_leaves[s] to be m, then:\n\nif m <= sum_children, then c_s must be >= m (so that min(c_s, sum_children) = m if and only if c_s >=m and sum_children >=m. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose sum_children is S. Then, for the max_leaves[s] to be m:\n\nCase 1: m = S. Then, we need that c_s >= S. Because min(c_s, S) = S iff c_s >= S.\n\nCase 2: m < S. Then, we need that c_s = m. Because min(c_s, S) = m only if c_s = m and m <= S. Because if c_s > m, then min(c_s, S) would be min(c_s, S), which could be larger than m. For example, if c_s is m+1 and S is larger than m, then min(m+1, S) = m+1, which is larger than m.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because if we want the max_leaves[s] to be m, then for the min(c_s, S) to equal m, it must be that m is the minimum of c_s and S. So:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s = m and S >= m (so min(m, S) = m)\n\nOR\n\n- S = m and c_s >= m (so min(c_s, m) = m)\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose S is 5. If I want the max_leaves[s] to be 3, then:\n\nmin(c_s, 5) = 3 → which implies that c_s must be exactly 3, because if c_s is larger than 3, then min(c_s, 5) would be 5 (if c_s is 5 or more) or c_s (if between 3 and 5). So the only way to get min(c_s, S) = m is:\n\nIf m < S: then c_s must be exactly m.\n\nIf m = S: then c_s must be >= m.\n\nSo for a given sum_children S, the number of ways to choose c_s such that max_leaves[s] is m is:\n\nif m < S: then 1 way (c_s = m), provided that m <=k.\n\nif m = S: then (k - S + 1) ways (c_s ranges from S to k), provided that S <=k.\n\nOtherwise, zero.\n\nBut for the node s, the sum_children S is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. So, for each node, once we know the possible values of max_leaves for its children, we can compute the possible values of max_leaves for this node, and multiply the possibilities accordingly.\n\nThis suggests that we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of max_leaves for that node, and the number of ways to achieve that value given the choices of c_s and the children's possibilities.\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of nodes is sum_{l=1}^n 2^l} = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534 nodes. But even with that, if we can process each node in a bottom-up manner, it might be feasible.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Build the trie structure for all binary strings of lengths 1 to n. For each node, we can represent it as a string, but since n is small, perhaps we can generate all nodes in a hierarchical way.\n\nBut generating all nodes explicitly may be memory intensive. Alternatively, since each node is uniquely determined by its length and its binary representation, perhaps we can process nodes in order of increasing length.\n\nFor example, for length 1, there are 2 nodes (0 and 1). For length 2, each of those nodes has two children (00, 01, 10, 11), etc.\n\nSo processing nodes in order of increasing length (from n down to 1?), or from 1 to n? Well, since the max_leaves for a node depends on its children, we need to process the nodes in order from leaves (length n) up to the root (length 1). Wait, no. For a node of length l, its children are of length l+1. So to compute the max_leaves for a node of length l, we need to have already computed the max_leaves for its children (of length l+1). Therefore, we should process the nodes in reverse order of their lengths, starting from the leaves (length n) and moving up to length 1.\n\nSo for each node of length l (starting from n down to 1), we compute the possible values of max_leaves for that node, based on the possible values of its children (which are of length l+1, except for the leaves, which have no children).\n\nFor the leaves (length n), the max_leaves is determined by c_s, which can be any value between 0 and k. However, for the leaves, since they have no children, the sum_children is zero. Wait, no. For a leaf node (length n), it has no children. So the sum_children is zero. But according to the previous logic, for a node of length l < n, the max_leaves is min(c_s, sum_children). But for a leaf node (l = n), the max_leaves is c_s, since there are no children. So for leaves, the max_leaves is simply c_s. However, since there are no children, the sum_children is zero, but the formula for l < n is not applicable.\n\nSo, for each node, if it's a leaf (l = n), then the max_leaves is c_s. For non-leaf nodes (l < n), the max_leaves is min(c_s, sum_children), where sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of its two children.\n\nBut how do we model this for dynamic programming?\n\nFor each node, we need to track the possible values of max_leaves for that node, and for each possible value, the number of ways to choose the c_s and the children's configurations that lead to that value.\n\nLet me think for each node. Let's define dp[node][m] as the number of ways to choose the c_s for this node and its descendants such that the max_leaves for this node is m. But since the choices for the children affect this, we need to combine the possibilities for the children.\n\nFor a leaf node (l = n), the max_leaves is c_s. So for this node, the possible m is any value between 0 and k. However, since the node is a leaf, the c_s can be chosen freely between 0 and k. So for each possible m (from 0 to k), the number of ways is 1 (since c_s must be exactly m). However, this is only for the leaf node. Wait, but for the leaf node, the max_leaves is exactly c_s, so for each possible value of m (which is the same as c_s), there's exactly one way to choose c_s (set it to m). So for a leaf node, the dp is:\n\ndp_leaf[m] = 1 for all m in [0, k].\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that for all nodes, the c_s is chosen between 0 and k. So for a leaf node, the possible m is between 0 and k, and for each m, there's exactly one way (choose c_s = m).\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, the dp depends on the children. Let's take a node s of length l < n. Its children are s0 and s1. Let's denote the possible values of max_leaves for s0 as m0 and for s1 as m1. Then, the sum_children is m0 + m1. Then, the max_leaves for s is min(c_s, sum_children). As discussed earlier, the number of ways to choose c_s for this node depends on the desired value of max_leaves for this node.\n\nSo for each possible pair of (m0, m1) from the children, we can compute sum_children = m0 + m1. Then, for this node, the possible max_leaves values are:\n\nEither:\n\n- m = sum_children, which requires c_s >= sum_children. The number of ways is (k - sum_children + 1) if sum_children <=k, else 0.\n\nOR\n\n- m < sum_children, which requires c_s = m. The number of ways is 1 if m <=k, else 0.\n\nBut how do we combine this across all possible pairs of (m0, m1) for the children?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\nFor each non-leaf node, we calculate the possible combinations of the children's max_leaves values, compute the sum_children, and then for each possible m (the max_leaves for this node), accumulate the number of ways based on the children's possibilities and the choices of c_s.\n\nThis seems computationally expensive, but with n up to 15, and for each node, the possible m values up to some maximum (which depends on the children's max values), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible m for a node? For the root's children (length 1), the maximum m can be up to k * 2^{n-1} }, since each level adds a factor of 2. For example, for n=15, the maximum m could be up to k * 2^14. But with k up to 2e5, this would be 2e5 * 2^14 ≈ 2e5 * 16384 = 3.2768e9, which is way too large to handle directly.\n\nThis suggests that the straightforward approach of tracking all possible m values for each node is not feasible due to memory and time constraints.\n\nWe need to find a smarter way to model this. Let's think about the problem again.\n\nThe final goal is to compute the number of ways to assign the c_s values such that the total maximum size of the multiset is exactly f. The total maximum size is the sum of the max_leaves for the root's children (the nodes of length 1). Let's denote this as T.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to computing the number of assignments of c_s values such that T equals exactly f.\n\nLet me think recursively again. For each node, we can model the possible values of max_leaves for that node, and the number of ways to achieve that value. However, for the root's children, we need the sum of their max_leaves to be exactly f.\n\nBut even with this, the problem remains of handling the large possible values of max_leaves for the nodes.\n\nAlternative idea: For each node, the max_leaves is determined by the constraints of the node and its children. However, for the purpose of calculating the total T, which is the sum of the max_leaves for the root's children, perhaps we can model the DP for each node in terms of the possible contribution to T.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the root's children. For each of them, their max_leaves is a value that depends on their own c_s and their children's max_leaves. The sum of these two values is T.\n\nBut how to compute the number of ways that the sum of these two values equals f?\n\nPerhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of max_leaves for that node, and combine them appropriately.\n\nBut again, the problem is the large possible range of max_leaves.\n\nWait, but for the problem's constraints, the final answer is the number of ways to get T = f. So, perhaps we can model the DP for each node as the number of ways to achieve a certain value of max_leaves for that node, and then combine these in a way that allows us to compute the total sum.\n\nBut with n up to 15 and f up to 2e5, maybe there's a way to manage this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each node, we will compute a generating function, which represents the number of ways to assign c_s values for that node and its descendants, leading to a certain value of max_leaves for this node. Then, combining the generating functions of the children to compute the generating function for the parent.\n\nFor example,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to binary strings such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. This involves understanding constraints on prefixes and efficiently computing valid configurations using dynamic programming.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Trie Structure**: Consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` as nodes in a trie. Each node's value (prefix) influences the constraints on the multiset.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a bottom-up DP approach starting from the leaves (strings of length `n`) up to the root (strings of length 1). For each node, compute the number of ways to assign values such that the maximum number of leaves (strings of length `n`) under its subtree is constrained.\n3. **Generating Functions**: Use generating functions to track the number of valid configurations for each node, considering both its children and the constraints on their values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    k = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    f = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    # Precompute all nodes in order of increasing length\n    # We can represent each node by its length and its binary value (as an integer)\n    # But since n is small (<=15), we can process nodes level by level from n down to 1\n    \n    # For each node, we'll store its children (for non-leaf nodes)\n    # But since we process from leaves up, we can generate children on the fly\n    \n    # The DP will be a dictionary for each node, mapping possible max_leaves value to count of ways\n    # However, for efficiency, we can use arrays for each level\n    \n    # Let's think of nodes as being represented by their depth (length) and their binary value\n    # For each depth l, there are 2^l nodes, each with a unique binary string of length l\n    \n    # We'll process nodes in order from depth n down to 1\n    # For each node at depth l, we need to know the possible max_leaves values and their counts\n    \n    # We can represent the DP for each node as a dictionary or array\n    \n    # Since n is up to 15, and for each node, the max_leaves can be up to k * 2^{n - l}, but we need to track only up to f\n    # However, given that f can be up to 2e5, we need to manage the DP states carefully\n    \n    # To optimize, for each node, we'll track a dictionary of possible max_leaves values and their counts\n    # But for large values, we might need to cap it at f\n    \n    # However, for the final answer, we need the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children (depth 1) to be exactly f\n    \n    # Let's precompute for each node the possible max_leaves and their counts\n    \n    # First, for leaves (depth n), the max_leaves is c_s which can be any value between 0 and k\n    # So for each leaf node, the number of ways for a particular m is 1 if 0 <= m <=k, else 0\n    \n    # For non-leaf nodes, we combine the possibilities from their children\n    \n    # We can represent the DP for each node as a dictionary of {m: count}\n    \n    # Let's build the DP for each node level by level, from depth n down to 1\n    \n    # We'll use memoization for each depth level\n    \n    # Precompute for each depth l, the list of nodes (represented as integers from 0 to 2^l - 1)\n    \n    # But since we don't need to store the actual binary strings, just process them as integers\n    \n    # For each depth l, process all nodes of that depth\n    \n    # Initialize dp as a list of dictionaries, where dp[l][node] is a dictionary of {max_val: count}\n    \n    # However, for space efficiency, we can process each depth level sequentially, and for each node, compute its dp based on its children\n    \n    # Start from depth n (leaves)\n    \n    # For each depth from n downto 1:\n    #   for each node in depth l:\n    #       if l == n:\n    #           dp for this node is {m: 1 for m in 0..k}\n    #       else:\n    #           get the two children (node*2 and node*2 +1) in depth l+1\n    #           combine their dp dictionaries to compute the current node's dp\n    \n    # However, the problem is that for each node, combining the children's dp can lead to very large numbers of possible max_vals\n    \n    # To handle this, we can use convolution-like operations, but since the values can be up to k * 2^{n-l}, which for n=15 and k=2e5 can be huge, we need to find a way to limit our tracking to values relevant to f\n    \n    # But since the final answer requires the sum of the two root children's max_vals to be exactly f, perhaps we can track up to f for each node's max_vals\n    \n    # So, during the DP computation, we'll cap the max_vals at f, because higher values would not contribute to the final sum being f\n    \n    # This is a crucial optimization\n    \n    # Now, let's implement this\n    \n    # We'll use a list of dictionaries for each depth level\n    \n    # For each depth l, we have 2^l nodes.
