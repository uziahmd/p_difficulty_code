For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose the c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement again. The beautiful multiset is a collection of binary strings of length exactly n. For each binary string s of length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. Our goal is to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to model the constraints on the c_s's that would allow the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f. But how?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. For a given set of c_s's, what is the maximum size of such a multiset? Well, this sounds like a problem where we need to find the maximum number of strings we can include in the multiset without violating any of the constraints. This seems similar to a problem where each string contributes to multiple constraints (all its prefixes). So perhaps this is a problem that can be modeled with some kind of tree structure or hierarchy, since each string of length n has prefixes of lengths 1 to n.\n\nWait, the constraints are hierarchical. For example, if a string s is a prefix of another string t, then the count for s's constraints affects the count for t's constraints. Because if you include a string t in the multiset, it contributes to all its prefixes. So, for instance, the count for a longer prefix can't exceed the count for its shorter prefixes.\n\nThis feels similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a trie with certain capacity constraints on each node. Each node represents a prefix, and the capacity is c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be placed such that for every node (prefix), the number of leaves in its subtree does not exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but in this case, the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string. Wait no, the problem says it's a multiset, so duplicates are allowed. But the constraints are that for each prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. So, for example, if I have two copies of the string \"01\", then the count for \"0\" would increase by 2 (since both copies have \"0\" as a prefix), the count for \"01\" would increase by 2, etc.\n\nBut when trying to maximize the size of the multiset, the optimal way is to assign as many as possible, considering the constraints. However, since the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string, but each copy contributes to the counts of all its prefixes.\n\nSo, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on the prefixes. How do we compute this maximum size given the c_s's?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a trie where each node has a capacity. Each element in the multiset is a path from the root to a leaf (the full string of length n), and for each node (prefix), the number of paths that pass through it is at most c_s. The maximum number of such paths is the sum over all leaves of their multiplicities, but constrained by the capacities along their paths.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum? It's similar to a flow problem. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with some constraints. For example, for each node (prefix), the number of times it is used as a prefix (i.e., the number of strings in the multiset that have this prefix) is limited by c_s. However, the constraints are hierarchical. For example, the number of strings that have prefix \"0\" is the sum of the counts of all strings that start with \"0\". Similarly, the count for \"0\" must be ≥ the count for \"00\" plus the count for \"01\", etc.\n\nWait, but for the maximum possible size, we want to maximize the total number of strings in the multiset. Let's think recursively. For each node (prefix), the maximum number of strings that can be added under this node is limited by the minimum of c_s and the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, no. Because each string in the multiset that passes through this node contributes to its count. For example, if a node has two children (say, \"0\" and \"1\"), then the maximum number of strings that can be under \"0\" is limited by c_0, and similarly for \"1\". But the total number of strings under \"0\" plus those under \"1\" cannot exceed c_0 (if the parent is \"0\")? No, that's not right. Wait, the parent node's count is the number of strings that have it as a prefix. So, for the root node (empty string?), but in our case, the root isn't considered. Wait, the prefixes are all strings of length 1 to n. So for each node (prefix s), the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of all strings in the multiset that start with s. Therefore, for a node s, which is a prefix of length l, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum over all extensions of s (i.e., adding a bit) of the number of times those strings are in the multiset. However, for the maximum case, we want to maximize the total number of strings in the multiset, given that for each node s, the sum of the counts of the strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s.\n\nBut this seems like a problem where for each node, the maximum number of strings that can be under it is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the maximum numbers of its children. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the nodes as forming a tree. Each node is a binary string. The root is the empty string (but perhaps we don't consider it here). Then, each node has two children: appending a 0 or 1. The leaves are the strings of length n. The constraints are that for each node, the number of strings in the multiset that have it as a prefix is at most c_s. Let's denote that for node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is m_s. Then, for each node, m_s is the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}, where s0 is s followed by 0, and s1 is s followed by 1. Also, m_s <= c_s. The leaves (strings of length n) have m_s being the number of times they appear in the multiset. Since the multiset is of strings of length exactly n, each leaf's m_s is the count of that string in the multiset. But for the root (the empty string?), m_root is the total number of strings in the multiset. However, since the problem allows the multiset to be of any size, but with constraints on the prefixes.\n\nBut in this scenario, the maximum total number of strings in the multiset is the value of m_root, which is the sum of m_0 and m_1, where 0 and 1 are the first-level prefixes. However, m_0 must be <= c_0, and m_1 <= c_1. But also, for each of their children, m_0 is the sum of m_00 and m_01, which must be <= c_0. Similarly for other nodes.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum value of m_root, given that for each node s, m_s is the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}, and m_s <= c_s. So for the maximum possible m_root, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem. For each node, the maximum possible m_s is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the maximum possible m for its children. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node s of length l, if l = n, then it's a leaf. Its m_s can be any value up to c_s. However, since the total m_root is the sum of the m of all leaves, but for the maximum, we want to take the maximum possible for each node. Wait, but the way to maximize the total is to take for each node s, the maximum possible m_s, which is min(c_s, sum of children's m). However, since the children's m are determined by their own constraints.\n\nWait, this seems like a standard problem where the maximum possible m_root is the minimum of c_root and the sum of the maxima of the children. But since the children's maxima depend on their own children, and so on down to the leaves. For the leaves (length n), their maximum m_s is c_s. Because they can contribute as much as possible (since their children are nonexistent, so their m_s is just the count of the string itself, which can be up to c_s).\n\nSo the maximum possible total is computed by a bottom-up approach. Starting from the leaves (depth n), each node's maximum possible m is min(c_s, sum of children's m). For the leaves, their maximum m is c_s. Then, for their parents, it's min(c_parent, sum of children's m). And so on up to the root. The root's m is the maximum possible total number of strings in the multiset.\n\nTherefore, given the c_s values, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly this value computed via this bottom-up approach.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that:\n\n- The maximum size computed as above is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nThe key observation is that the maximum size is determined by the constraints of the c_s's. To have the maximum size exactly f, we need that:\n\n- The maximum size computed as above is at least f, but also that there's no way to have a larger maximum size. Wait, no. The problem says that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So the assignment must be such that the maximum possible size is f, not more, not less.\n\nWait, the problem says that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So for the given c_s's, when you compute the maximum possible size (as per the bottom-up method), it's exactly f.\n\nBut how can we count the number of such c_s assignments?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nWe need to count all possible c_s assignments (each c_s between 0 and k inclusive) such that when you compute the maximum size via the bottom-up method, you get exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as follows: For each node s (binary string of length from 1 to n), the value of c_s must be >= the number of times it is used in the optimal selection. But perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the concept of constraints on the c_s's. For the maximum size to be exactly f, the following must hold:\n\nThe maximum size computed via the bottom-up method is f. Which implies that during the bottom-up computation, for some node, the value is constrained by its c_s, and the sum of children's values is larger than c_s, leading to the min(c_s, ...) being c_s. But this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as follows. The maximum size is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths. For example, for a particular path from the root to a leaf, the maximum number of strings that can be added along that path is limited by the minimal c_s along the path. However, this is only true if the constraints are tight. But the actual maximum is the sum of all contributions, which depends on the entire tree's structure.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this using dynamic programming. Let's think of the nodes in order of increasing length. For each node, the maximum possible contribution is min(c_s, sum of children's max). Let's denote this value as m(s). Then the total maximum is m(empty string), but since the empty string is not considered here (since the problem starts with strings of length 1 to n), perhaps the root here is the empty string, but since the problem requires the multiset to consist of strings of length exactly n, perhaps the root is considered as the empty string, and the maximum size is m(empty string). However, the problem doesn't mention the empty string. Wait, the problem says that for all binary strings s with length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix must be <= c_s. So the empty string is not part of the constraints. Therefore, the root node (empty string) is not considered here. So the maximum size is determined by the bottom-up approach starting from the leaves (strings of length n) and moving up.\n\nBut for the root node (the empty string), which is not part of the constraints, but the maximum size is the sum of the counts of the first-level prefixes (strings of length 1). However, the constraints for the first-level prefixes (like '0' and '1') are given by their respective c_s values. So the maximum size is determined by the bottom-up process, which for the first-level nodes (length 1) is min(c_0, m_00 + m_01) and similarly for c_1. Then, for the root (empty string), the maximum size is min( ... but wait, the empty string is not part of the constraints. So the maximum size is the sum of m_0 and m_1, where m_0 is the maximum possible for the '0' node, and m_1 for the '1' node. However, since the empty string is not constrained, the maximum is simply the sum of m_0 and m_1. But m_0 is computed as min(c_0, m_00 + m_01), and m_00 is min(c_00, m_000 + m_001) (if n is larger than 2), etc. So the maximum size is the sum of the m_0 and m_1, where each m is computed as the min of their c_s and the sum of their children's m.\n\nTherefore, the problem becomes to count the number of assignments of c_s (for each s of length 1..n) such that the computed maximum size is exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this and find the count.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, the total number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1) - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16-2=65534 nodes. That's manageable for some dynamic programming approaches, but perhaps we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. For each node, the value m(s) is min(c_s, sum of children's m). The sum of children's m is the sum of m(s0) and m(s1). But for leaves (length n), the children don't exist. So for leaves, m(s) = c_s.\n\nSo the maximum size is the sum of m(0) and m(1), where m(0) is min(c_0, m(00) + m(01)), and similarly for m(1).\n\nNow, to compute the number of assignments where the maximum size is exactly f, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of m(s) given the constraints on the c_s's.\n\nBut how to combine these possibilities across the tree.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For a node s of length l, the possible value of m(s) can be determined based on the values of its children. However, for each node, the value of m(s) is min(c_s, sum_children_m). So, given that the children's m values are known, the m(s) is determined.\n\nBut since c_s can vary between 0 and k, and for each node, the choice of c_s affects the m(s) value.\n\nBut the problem requires that the final maximum size (sum of m(0) and m(1)) is exactly f. So, we need to find all possible combinations of c_s's (each 0<=c_s<=k) such that when you compute the m(s) values bottom-up, the sum of m(0) and m(1) equals f.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible m values that can be achieved, and the number of ways to assign c_s's to achieve that.\n\nBut with n up to 15, and each node possibly having m values up to f (which can be up to 2e5), this might be feasible with memoization.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For a node s of length l, the m(s) can be determined based on the choices of c_s and the m values of its children. Let's denote that for a node s, the m(s) is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the m values of its children. However, the children's m values are determined by their own c values.\n\nBut since the children are of length l+1, and the node s is of length l, we can process the nodes in order of decreasing length. Starting from the leaves (length n), then processing nodes of length n-1, and so on until length 1.\n\nFor each node of length l, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's c values such that the m(s) is a certain value. However, this seems complex.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define for a node s of length l, the function dp[s][x] as the number of ways to assign c_s and the c values of the descendants of s such that the m(s) value is x. Then, for the leaves (l = n), the m(s) is exactly c_s. So for a leaf node, dp[s][x] is 1 if x is between 0 and k, else 0. However, since for leaves, the m(s) is c_s, which can be chosen freely from 0 to k. So the number of ways for a leaf node to have m(s) = x is 1 if x is between 0 and k, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThen, for a non-leaf node s of length l < n, we have two children: left (s0) and right (s1). The m(s) is min(c_s, m_left + m_right). Let's denote the possible m_left and m_right values. For each possible pair (a, b) of m_left and m_right, the sum a + b can be anything. Then, the m(s) is min(c_s, a + b). However, the choice of c_s can be anything between 0 and k, but we need to count the number of ways that for the current node, the m(s) is x.\n\nBut how to compute this? For a node s, given that the left and right children have their own dp tables, we need to compute for all possible x, the number of ways to choose c_s and the ways for the children's m_left and m_right such that min(c_s, a + b) = x.\n\nBut since the children's m values are determined by their own dp tables, perhaps for each node s, we can compute the number of ways to have m(s) = x by combining the possibilities of the children.\n\nLet me formalize this. For a non-leaf node s, the m(s) is determined by c_s and the sum of the m values of its children. Let’s denote the left child as L and right as R. Let’s say that for L, the number of ways to get a certain m_L value is stored in dp_L, and similarly for R in dp_R.\n\nFor each possible value of a (m_L) and b (m_R), the sum a + b can be anything. Then, for each possible choice of c_s, the m(s) is min(c_s, a + b). However, we need to count the number of ways that for the current node, the m(s) is x, considering all possible a, b, and c_s choices.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: For each possible x, the number of ways for the current node s to have m(s) = x is equal to the sum over all possible a and b (from the children's dp tables) of the number of ways that:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: c_s >= a + b. In this case, m(s) = a + b. So for this to be x, we must have a + b = x. And the number of ways for c_s is (k - (a + b - 1)) if a + b <= k, else zero. Wait, no. Because c_s can be any value between 0 and k. But in this case, the choice of c_s must be >= a + b. However, since m(s) is min(c_s, a + b) = a + b. So for this to happen, c_s must be >= a + b. The number of possible c_s values is (k - (a + b) + 1) if a + b <=k, else 0. But since a + b can be up to something (depending on the children's m values). However, for the current node, the choice of c_s can be anything >= a + b, but the value of x is a + b.\n\nCase 2: c_s < a + b. In this case, m(s) = c_s. So for this to be x, we need c_s = x, and x < a + b. The number of ways here is 1 (since c_s is fixed to x) multiplied by the number of a and b pairs where a + b > x.\n\nSo for each x, the total number of ways for the current node s is:\n\nsum_{a, b} [ (number of ways for L to have a) * (number of ways for R to have b) * [ (if a + b = x) * (number of c_s >= x) ) + (if x < a + b) * (number of c_s = x) ) ] ]\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. However, given that n is small (up to 15), and for each node, the possible x values can be up to f (which can be up to 2e5), but perhaps we can find a way to precompute these sums.\n\nBut even then, for each node, combining the possibilities of the children's m values could be expensive. However, for each node, the children are processed first, and their dp tables are already computed.\n\nSo the idea is to build a DP table for each node, where for each possible x (up to f), we store the number of ways to assign c_s's for the subtree rooted at this node such that m(s) = x.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For all nodes in the tree, process them in order of decreasing length (starting from leaves, then moving up to length 1).\n\n2. For each node, compute its DP table based on the DP tables of its children.\n\nFor the leaves (length n):\n\ndp_leaf[x] = 1 if 0 <= x <=k, else 0. But since for a leaf node, m(s) = c_s, which can be chosen between 0 and k, and for each x, there's exactly one way (choosing c_s = x).\n\nFor non-leaf nodes:\n\nFor each possible x, compute the number of ways as follows:\n\nsum over all a and b (possible m values of left and right children) of (ways_L[a] * ways_R[b]) * (ways_c_s that make min(c_s, a + b) = x).\n\nAs discussed earlier, this can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x = a + b. Then, c_s must be >= a + b. The number of such c_s is max(0, k - (a + b) + 1) if a + b <=k. Otherwise, zero.\n\nCase 2: x < a + b. Then, c_s must be exactly x. So for each a and b where a + b > x, we add ways_L[a] * ways_R[b] * 1 (since c_s must be x).\n\nSo for a given x, the total ways is:\n\nsum_{a, b} ways_L[a] * ways_R[b] * [ (if a + b == x) * (number of c_s >= x) + (if a + b > x) * (indicator(x == c_s)) ) ]\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nLet’s precompute for the children's DP tables the convolution of their ways. For example, for the left and right children, we can compute for all possible a and b, the product ways_L[a] * ways_R[b], and then group them by a + b. But for the purposes of computing the sum for case 1 and case 2, perhaps we can precompute the sum over a and b of ways_L[a] * ways_R[b] for various conditions.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible sum s = a + b, we can compute the total number of (a, b) pairs that sum to s, multiplied by the number of ways for that s. Let's call this S[s] = sum_{a + b = s} ways_L[a] * ways_R[b].\n\nSimilarly, T[s] = sum_{a + b > s} ways_L[a] * ways_R[b}.\n\nThen, for case 1, when x = s, the contribution is S[s] * (max(0, k - s + 1)) if s <=k.\n\nFor case 2, when x is fixed, the contribution is T[x] * 1 (since for each (a,b) where a + b >x, we can choose c_s =x, which contributes 1 way).\n\nSo for each x, the total ways for the current node is:\n\ncontribution_case1 + contribution_case2.\n\nWhere contribution_case1 is S[x] * (max(0, k - x + 1)) if x <=k, else 0.\n\nContribution_case2 is T[x] * 1, but only if x is between 0 and k (since c_s must be between 0 and k).\n\nWait, but x is the value of m(s) which is min(c_s, a + b). For case 2, x = c_s, which must be between 0 and k. So yes, x must be in 0..k.\n\nTherefore, for each x in 0..k:\n\nways_current[x] = (S[x] * (max(0, k - x + 1))) + (T[x] * 1) if x <=k.\n\nBut how to compute S and T?\n\nWell, S[s] is the sum of ways_L[a] * ways_R[b] for all a and b where a + b = s.\n\nT[s] is the sum of ways_L[a] * ways_R[b] for all a and b where a + b > s.\n\nSo for each node, once we have the left and right children's DP tables, we can compute these S and T arrays.\n\nBut how?\n\nTo compute S[s], we can perform a convolution of the left and right DP arrays. However, since the maximum possible sum s is up to (max possible m for left) + (max possible m for right). But given that f can be up to 2e5, and n is up to 15, the maximum possible sum for a node at level l is up to f (since the maximum size is f). However, since the problem requires that the final maximum size is exactly f, perhaps during the DP steps, we can cap the possible values of m(s) to up to f. Because if during the DP steps, a node's m(s) exceeds f, then it's impossible for the final maximum to be exactly f. Therefore, we can limit our DP tables to values up to f.\n\nThis is a crucial optimization. Because if during the DP processing, the m(s) exceeds f, then it's not useful for our problem, since we need the final maximum to be exactly f. Therefore, for each node, we can cap the m(s) values up to f. This reduces the computational complexity.\n\nSo for each node, when computing its DP table, we only need to consider m values up to f. Thus, for the convolution steps, we can limit the sum s to up to 2f.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think. For each node, the DP table will have entries for x from 0 to f. For any x beyond that, we can ignore them. Because if during the processing of the tree, a node's m(s) exceeds f, then it's impossible for the final maximum to be exactly f. However, since the final maximum is the sum of m(0) and m(1), which must be exactly f, any intermediate m(s) can be up to f. Wait, no. For example, if the sum of m(0) and m(1) is exactly f, but some intermediate node's m(s) is higher than f. Is that possible?\n\nNo. Because m(s) is the minimum between c_s and the sum of children's m. Suppose the sum of children's m is s. Then m(s) is min(c_s, s). Since c_s can be up to k, but if s is larger than k, then m(s) is k. If s is smaller than k, then m(s) is s. So for any node, m(s) can be up to min(k, sum_children_m). Therefore, during the DP steps, the m(s) can be up to k. However, since the final maximum is f, which is up to 2e5, and k can be up to 2e5 as well, we need to consider up to min(k, ...) but since k can be larger than f, but in the problem statement, the final maximum is exactly f. So during the DP steps, the m(s) can be up to f. Wait, not necessarily. For example, if a node's m(s) is min(c_s, sum_children_m), and sum_children_m is larger than f, but c_s is set to something larger than f. However, in that case, the sum_children_m could be larger than f, but the m(s) would be c_s, which could be larger than f. However, the final maximum is the sum of m(0) and m(1), which must be exactly f. So if during the processing of the tree, some node's m(s) is larger than f, but the final sum is exactly f, that's possible. For example, suppose that for a node, m(s) is 5 (f is 3), but the sum of its children's m is 5, and c_s is 5. But then, the parent of this node may have a constraint that limits it to 3, leading to the final sum being 3.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate m(s) can be larger than f, but the final sum must be exactly f. Therefore, we cannot cap the m(s) during the DP steps. However, this complicates the problem, as the possible values of m(s) can be up to k, which can be as high as 2e5. For n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the DP table would need to store up to k values. For k=2e5, this would be O(65534 * 2e5) = around 1.3e10 operations, which is way too big.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is not feasible due to time constraints. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: since the final maximum is exactly f, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of constraints that ensure that the maximum is exactly f. Let's think about the maximum being f. For this to happen, the bottom-up computation must result in the sum of m(0) and m(1) being exactly f. Also, there must be no way to increase this sum further by changing the c_s's. However, since the c_s's are chosen such that the maximum is exactly f, this implies that the computed m(s) values are such that the sum is f, and that there is no way to increase it by increasing any c_s.\n\nWait, but the maximum is determined by the constraints. For the maximum to be exactly f, there must be at least one node in the tree where the m(s) is constrained by c_s (i.e., m(s) = c_s < sum_children_m). Otherwise, if all nodes have m(s) = sum_children_m, then increasing any c_s would allow the maximum to increase. However, since we are choosing the c_s's, the maximum is exactly f, which implies that the bottom-up computation gives f, and that for all nodes, the m(s) is as large as possible given their constraints.\n\nBut this line of thinking might not help directly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the problem in terms of the constraints that must be satisfied for the maximum to be exactly f. The maximum is determined by the bottom-up process. For the maximum to be exactly f, the following must hold:\n\n- The computed maximum is f.\n\n- There exists at least one node where the m(s) is constrained by c_s (i.e., m(s) = c_s < sum_children_m). Otherwise, if all nodes are not constrained, then you could increase some c_s to get a larger maximum.\n\nWait, but this is not necessarily true. For example, if all nodes are not constrained, then the maximum is the sum of the leaves' c_s's. But if you increase any c_s, you might not be able to increase the maximum. Hmm, perhaps this is not the right direction.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the maximum size being f. This means that during the bottom-up computation, the sum of m(0) and m(1) is f. But how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can think of the entire tree as a DAG and model the constraints for the m(s) values. However, this seems abstract.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Maybe we can find a way to represent the DP states more efficiently.\n\nLet me note that for a node s of length l, the m(s) is min(c_s, m_left + m_right). Now, since the final maximum is f, which is the sum of m(0) and m(1), which is f. Let's denote that the root of the entire tree (the empty string) is not part of the constraints, but the sum of m(0) and m(1) is f. So the DP for the root is the sum of m(0) and m(1) being exactly f.\n\nBut how to model this? For each node, during the DP process, we need to track the possible values of m(s), and then for the root, we need the sum of m(0) and m(1) to be exactly f.\n\nSo, for the entire problem, the answer is the number of ways to assign c_s's for all nodes such that the sum of m(0) and m(1) is exactly f.\n\nNow, the DP approach for each node is to compute the number of ways for that node to have m(s) = x, given the choices of c_s and the children's m values.\n\nBut with n=15 and k up to 2e5, it's still challenging. However, perhaps we can find that for each node, the maximum possible m(s) is f. Because the sum of m(0) and m(1) is f, and each m(s) is part of the tree. For example, for a node s of length l, the m(s) can be at most the sum of the m values of its children. But since the sum of m(0) and m(1) is f, and each node's m(s) is part of this sum, perhaps the m(s) values for all nodes are bounded by f. Let's think:\n\nConsider the root of the entire tree (the empty string), but it's not part of the constraints. Its m value is m(0) + m(1) = f. For its children (nodes of length 1), their m values are min(c_s, sum of their children's m values). The sum of their children's m values is part of the tree below. For example, for node '0', its m value is min(c_0, m_00 + m_01). The m_00 and m_01 are part of the subtree rooted at '0'. Since the sum of m(0) and m(1) is f, and m(0) is part of that sum, it's possible that m(0) could be as large as f (if m(1) is 0). So, the m values for nodes can be up to f. Hence, for the DP tables, it's sufficient to consider m values up to f.\n\nThis is a critical insight! Because if the final sum is f, then all m(s) values for nodes must be <= f. This is because:\n\nFor any node s, m(s) is the minimum between c_s and the sum of its children's m values. Since the sum of children's m values can't exceed the sum of all m values in the subtree rooted at s. And since the overall sum is f",

So for a node at level l, the left and right children are of the same structure. Hence, their dp tables are the same. Therefore, for all nodes at level l, the dp tables are identical. Thus, we can compute the dp for one node and multiply by the number of nodes at that level.\n\n        # This is a crucial optimization.
