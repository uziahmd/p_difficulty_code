He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to split n problems into exactly k days, each day solving consecutive problems starting from the beginning. Each day's profit is the max of the problems solved that day. We need to maximize the total profit. And then output the maximum profit and the distribution of the number of problems per day.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Since the problem requires splitting into k days, and each day's segment is a consecutive block starting from the previous day's end, it's similar to partitioning the array into k contiguous parts. The challenge is to choose the splits such that the sum of the maxima of each part is maximized.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming here. Because for each position and number of days, we can track the maximum profit.\n\nLet's consider dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems divided into j days. Then, the recurrence would be something like:\n\nFor dp[i][j], we can look back to some m < i, where the j-1th day ends at m, and the jth day is from m+1 to i. So, dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2000, and k up to 2000, the DP table would be O(n^2 *k) in time. Wait, for each dp[i][j], we have to check all possible m's, and for each m, compute the max from m+1 to i. If we compute that naively, it's O(n^3 *k) which is way too slow for n=2000. That's 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nSo we need a way to compute the max efficiently. Let's think about precomputing max ranges. For example, precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum value in a[i...j]. But even that would take O(n^2) space, which for n=2000 is 4 million entries. Which is manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP can proceed with O(n^2 *k) time. However, for n=2000 and k=2000, this would be O(2000^3) again, which is 8e10. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, but k can't be larger than n. For example, when k equals n, each day has exactly one problem. Then the total profit is the sum of all elements. But for general cases, perhaps there's a way to optimize.\n\nWait, what is the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So the DP approach with O(n^2 *k) is O(n^3), which is not feasible for n=2000. So this approach is not going to work. Need to think of another way.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the splits are contiguous and must cover the entire array, maybe we can find that for each day, the maximum in the current segment is the maximum of the entire segment. So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the array in such a way that each day's segment has as high a maximum as possible. However, how to balance between taking a higher maximum now versus allowing more higher maxima in the future?\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe the DP is still necessary, but we need to find a way to optimize the transitions.\n\nAnother thought: For the DP transition, when considering dp[i][j], we can think that the last day's segment is from m+1 to i. The max for that segment is max(a[m+1..i]). To compute this quickly, perhaps for each i and j, we can find the best m.\n\nBut even with precomputed max_range, the DP is O(n^2 *k). Let's calculate the numbers. For n=2000, k=2000, that would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10 operations. Which is way beyond the acceptable time limit (assuming 1e8 operations per second, this would take 800 seconds). So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, but perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. Let's think about the constraints. For example, for the DP[i][j], the j-th day must be at least one problem. So for each j, the i must be >=j.\n\nBut how else can we optimize?\n\nWait, what if we note that when splitting into j days, the j-th day must consist of some number of problems. Let's think about the case where j=1. Then the answer is the max of the entire array. For j=2, we need to split the array into two parts. The first part is from 1 to m, and the second from m+1 to n. The total profit is max(a[1..m]) + max(a[m+1..n]). We need to find m such that this sum is maximum. How to find that m?\n\nBut for general j, the problem is similar. So maybe the DP is the way to go, but we need to find a way to compute the transitions efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For each i and j, when we compute dp[i][j], we can look for m in [j-1, i-1], and for each m, compute the max from m+1 to i. However, for each i and j, the max from m+1 to i can be computed incrementally. For example, when m increases by 1, the range becomes smaller. But I'm not sure how to use that.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, and for each j, when considering the last segment (from m+1 to i), the max can be tracked as we move m from i-1 down to j-1. Let me think. For example, for a fixed i and j, when we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, the segment [m+1, i] starts at m+1. As m decreases, the start of the segment moves left. So for each m, the max of [m+1, i] can be computed by keeping track of the maximum so far. For example, starting from m = i-1 (the segment is [i], max is a[i]), then m = i-2 (segment is [i-1, i], max is max(a[i-1], a[i]), etc. So for each i and j, we can compute the max for each possible m in O(i) time. But then for each dp[i][j], this would take O(n) time. So overall, the DP would be O(n^2 *k) time. Which is again O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nBut wait, n is 2000 and k is 2000. However, in practice, for j up to k, but when j is large, say j = k, then i must be at least j. So for example, when j is 2000, then i must be 2000, and the only possible split is each day has one problem. So maybe the actual time can be optimized by considering that for each j, the i ranges from j to n.\n\nBut even then, for n=2000 and k=2000, the total number of dp states is O(nk) = 2000*2000 = 4e6. For each of these states, the O(n) processing would be 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9 operations. Which is still way too slow.\n\nSo, this suggests that the DP approach may not be feasible for n=2000. Therefore, perhaps there's another way to think about the problem.\n\nAlternative approach: Since each day's segment is a consecutive block starting from the beginning, the splits are determined by positions where we split the array into k parts. For example, for k days, we need to choose k-1 split points. The first split after some index, then the next split after some index, etc.\n\nBut how to maximize the sum of maxima for each segment.\n\nLet me think about the problem greedily. For example, perhaps the optimal way is to split whenever a new maximum is found. But that might not work. For example, in the sample input, the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The maximum is 9. So if we split so that the last day includes 9, but also, the earlier days can include their own maxima. But how to decide where to split.\n\nBut greedy approaches can fail. For example, suppose you have an array [3, 1, 2, 4], and k=2. The optimal split is [3,1,2], [4], sum is 3+4=7. Alternatively, [3,1], [2,4] gives 3+4=7. Or [3], [1,2,4] gives 3+4=7. So same sum. But if the array was [3, 1, 4, 2], and k=2. Then splitting into [3,1,4] and [2] gives sum 4 + 2 = 6. But splitting into [3,1] and [4,2] gives 3 +4 =7. So here, the greedy approach of taking the maximum as early as possible may not be correct.\n\nThus, a greedy approach may not work.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the problem is similar to the problem of partitioning the array into k segments to maximize the sum of the maximums of each segment, perhaps there's a way to find that for each segment, the maximum is as large as possible. However, the problem is how to balance between taking a larger maximum now and allowing for more maxima in the future.\n\nBut again, this seems vague. Let's return to the DP approach and see if we can find optimizations.\n\nLet me think again about the DP transitions. For each dp[i][j], the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max{ dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) }, for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, for each j, we can compute dp[i][j] based on previous values. The key is to compute the max(a[m+1..i]) efficiently.\n\nLet me think about precomputing for all possible ranges. Let's create a 2D array max_range where max_range[l][r] is the maximum value in a[l..r]. This can be precomputed with O(n^2) time and space.\n\nYes. For example, for each l from 0 to n-1, and for r from l to n-1, compute the max. This can be done with dynamic programming as well. For each l, we can compute the max for r = l to n-1 by keeping track of the current maximum as we expand r.\n\nOnce we have that, then for any m and i, the max from m+1 to i is max_range[m+1][i].\n\nSo with that precomputed, the DP transitions can be calculated.\n\nBut even with that, the time complexity is O(n^2 *k), which is too slow for n=2000 and k=2000. However, perhaps in practice, the constraints are not that tight. Let's check the numbers again.\n\nn is up to 2000, and k up to 2000. So for each j from 1 to k, and for each i from j to n, we have to process O(i) steps. Let's compute the total number of operations.\n\nFor j from 1 to k:\n\nfor each j, for i from j to n:\n\n   for m from j-1 to i-1:\n\n       compute dp[i][j] as max over m.\n\nBut for each i and j, the inner loop is O(i) steps. So the total number of operations is O(k * n^2). For n=2000 and k=2000, this is 2000 * 2000^2 = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize this. Let's think about the constraints. For example, when k is small, say k=1, then the answer is simply the maximum of the entire array. Similarly, when k=n, each day has one problem, and the answer is the sum of the array.\n\nBut for general cases, perhaps we can find that for each j, the transitions can be optimized. Let's think about the case where j is fixed. For example, for j=2, the DP[i][2] is the maximum of dp[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i]) for m from 1 to i-1. Since dp[m][1] is the max of a[1..m], which is the same as the max_range[1][m]. So for j=2, the problem reduces to finding for each i, the best m where the sum of the max up to m and the max from m+1 to i is maximum.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nAnother observation: For a fixed i and j, when considering m from j-1 to i-1, the max_range[m+1][i] can be computed as follows. For example, for each i, as m decreases from i-1 to j-1, the range [m+1, i] increases in length. The maximum of this range can be maintained by tracking the current maximum as we move m from right to left.\n\nSo for each i and j, we can compute for m from i-1 downto j-1, and keep track of the current maximum. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for j=2 and i=5, m can be from 1 to 4. For each m, the segment is from m+1 to 5. So when m=4, it's [5], max is a[5]. When m=3, the segment is [4,5], max is max(a[4], a[5]). When m=2, the segment is [3,4,5], etc. So as m decreases, the start of the segment moves left. So for each i, we can compute the max_range[m+1][i] as we move m from i-1 down to j-1, keeping track of the current maximum. This way, for each i and j, the inner loop can be done in O(i) time, but with a constant time per step.\n\nThis approach would reduce the computation of the max_range[m+1][i] for varying m. However, even with this, the total time complexity remains O(n^2 *k), which is still too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find that for certain j, the transitions can be optimized. For example, when j is larger than some value, the number of splits required is such that the maximum can be determined in a different way. However, I can't think of any such optimization.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed using the previous j-1 layer. For example, for j=1, it's straightforward. For j=2, we can compute for each i, the best m. But maybe for j=2, the best m is the one that splits the array into two parts where the sum of the maxima is maximum. However, even for j=2, this requires O(n^2) time.\n\nBut given that n is 2000, and k is up to 2000, this approach may not be feasible. However, perhaps in practice, the code can be optimized enough with Python's speed, but I doubt it. For example, 2000^3 is 8e10 operations, which is way beyond Python's capabilities. Even if each operation is a simple addition, Python can handle roughly 1e6 operations per second. So 8e10 would take 8e4 seconds, which is way too long.\n\nSo this suggests that we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the fact that each day's segment must be a prefix of the array. Wait no, because the segments are consecutive. For example, the first day's segment is from 1 to m1, the second from m1+1 to m2, etc. But the problem is that the splits are sequential. However, the maximum for each segment is the maximum of that segment.\n\nNow, considering that the maximum of a segment is determined by the maximum element in that segment. So, if we can find a way to split the array such that each split captures a new maximum, perhaps that's optimal.\n\nFor example, the first day's segment should include the first maximum, the next day's segment includes the next maximum, etc. But how to formalize this.\n\nLet me think about the case where k is small. For example, k=2. The optimal split would be to split the array into two parts such that the sum of their maxima is as large as possible. Suppose the array is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]. The maximum of the entire array is M. If we split the array so that M is in one of the segments, then the other segment's maximum will be less than or equal to M. So the optimal is to have one of the segments contain M. But which split gives the best sum?\n\nFor example, if we split the array into [M] and the rest, then the sum is M + max(rest). Alternatively, if the split is such that M is in the first segment, then the first segment's max is M, and the second segment's max is the max of the remaining elements.\n\nBut in this case, the optimal split would be to have the first segment as the earliest occurrence of the maximum, or the latest occurrence, depending on the rest of the array.\n\nBut this line of thinking doesn't directly help with the general case.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the maximum elements. Since each day's profit is the maximum of its segment, the total profit will be the sum of the maximums of each segment. Now, the maximum of the entire array must be included in one of the segments. Let's say it's in the first segment. Then, the maximum of that segment is the global maximum. But if it's in the second segment, then the first segment's maximum is less than the global maximum, and the second's is the global maximum. However, since the sum is additive, it's better to have the global maximum in as many segments as possible. But since each segment can have only one maximum, perhaps the optimal is to have the global maximum in one segment, and then split the rest into k-1 segments optimally.\n\nBut how to apply this recursively. For example, for the array, the maximum is at position p. We can split the array into two parts: the first part up to p, and the second part from p onwards. Then, the first part can be split into (k-1) days, but wait, no. Because the entire array must be split into k days. So if we take the global maximum as the last day's segment, then the first part is split into k-1 days, and the last day is just the maximum. But this is not necessarily optimal.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum can be in any of the k segments. So the idea is to find where to split the array so that the maximum is in one of the segments and the rest are handled optimally.\n\nThis sounds like a recursive approach, but again, for large n and k, this might not be efficient.\n\nBut perhaps we can combine this with dynamic programming. For example, for the DP[i][j], when considering splitting the array into j segments, the maximum of the last segment could be the maximum in the range from m+1 to i. So, for each i and j, we can find the best m where the last segment starts at m+1 and ends at i. But how to find this efficiently.\n\nAnother observation: For the DP[i][j], the optimal split for the last segment is to take the maximum of the last segment as large as possible. However, since the previous segments are also contributing to the total sum, it's a trade-off.\n\nBut again, this doesn't directly lead to an algorithm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem differently. Since each day's segment is a prefix of the array. No, that's not true. The first day's segment is a prefix, the second day's is a prefix of the remaining array, etc. So the entire array is divided into k prefixes. For example, if the splits are after m1, m2, ..., mk-1, then the segments are [1..m1], [m1+1..m2], ..., [mk-1+1..n].\n\nBut for the DP approach, this is the same as before.\n\nWait, but for the DP[i][j], the first j-1 segments are covering the first m elements, and the j-th segment covers m+1 to i. So for each i and j, the choice of m is between j-1 and i-1.\n\nBut with the DP approach, even with O(n^2 *k) time, perhaps we can find a way to implement it in Python with optimizations.\n\nLet's try to think about the actual code. For example, for n=2000, k=2000, the worst case would be when j=2000, and i=2000. Then, the DP[i][j] is the sum of all elements. But for j=2000, i must be >=j, which means i=2000, and m must be j-1=1999, and the segment is from m+1=2000 to i=2000. So for this case, the code would run quickly.\n\nBut for j=2 and i=2000, the code would have to loop through m from 1 to 1999. Which is O(n) steps. For each step, it would need to compute the max from m+1 to i. With precomputed max_range, this is O(1) per step. So for this case, it's O(n) steps.\n\nBut for all j and i, the total number of steps would be O(n^2 *k). Which is still too slow for n=2000 and k=2000.\n\nBut wait, what is the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So for k= n, the number of operations would be O(n^2 *n) = O(n^3), which is 8e9 for n=2000. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps the actual constraints are not that tight. For example, the problem says that n and k are up to 2000, but in practice, for many test cases, k is small. But in the worst case, the code would not pass.\n\nSo what can we do? Perhaps we can find that for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed in O(n) time, not O(n^2).\n\nWait, let me think again. For the DP[i][j], the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max_{m} (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]))\n\nNow, for j=1, dp[i][1] = max(a[1..i]).\n\nFor j=2, dp[i][2] = max_{m=1 to i-1} (dp[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nBut for each i, and j=2, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me consider that for j=2, and for each i, we want to find the best m. For each m, we have dp[m][1] = max of the first m elements. And the max of the next part is the max of a[m+1..i].\n\nBut for each i, if we can find for each m the value of max(a[m+1..i]), and add to dp[m][1], then take the maximum over m.\n\nBut how to find this maximum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about for each i, and for all m from 1 to i-1, the max(a[m+1..i]). This is equivalent to the suffix maximums for each i.\n\nFor example, for each i, we can precompute the suffix maxima. For example, for each position l, we can have the maximum from l to i. But this is similar to the precomputed max_range.\n\nBut with that, for j=2, we can compute for each i:\n\ndp[i][2] = max over m from 1 to i-1 of (max_a_1_to_m + max_a_m+1_to_i)\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think: for each i, and for each m from 1 to i-1, the term is max_a_1_to_m + max_a_m+1_to_i.\n\nBut for each i, the max_a_m+1_to_i can be computed as the suffix maximum for m+1. So for example, if I precompute for each position l, the maximum from l to i, for all i >= l.\n\nBut again, this seems to require O(n^2) precomputation.\n\nBut perhaps for each i, we can compute the suffix maxima as we go. For example, for each i, we can iterate m from i-1 downto 1, and keep track of the current maximum.\n\nFor example, for i fixed:\n\ncurrent_max = a[i]\n\nfor m from i-1 downto 1:\n\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[m+1])\n\n    term = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], term)\n\nThis way, for j=2, and for each i, we can compute the max in O(n) time.\n\nSo for each j and i, we can compute the max_range[m+1][i] by iterating m from i-1 downto j-1 and keeping track of the current maximum. This would allow us to compute the transitions in O(n) per i and j.\n\nThis way, the total time complexity is O(n^2 *k), but with a lower constant factor. However, for n=2000 and k=2000, it's still O(8e10) operations, which is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, what if k is small? For example, if k is up to 10, then it's manageable. But for large k, it's not. However, the problem requires handling up to k=2000.\n\nSo this suggests that the DP approach is not feasible for the given constraints.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the fact that the maximum of a segment can be considered as a contribution to the total sum. Since each segment contributes its maximum, perhaps we can find that the optimal way to split the array into k segments is to select k-1 positions where the maximum of the segments are as large as possible.\n\nBut how to select those positions.\n\nFor example, if we have to split into k segments, then the optimal way is to select k-1 positions such that the sum of the maxima is maximized. But how to find those positions.\n\nAnother observation: The maximum of the entire array must be in one of the segments. Let's say it's in the j-th segment. Then, the contribution of this segment is the maximum. The other segments can be split optimally. However, this is a recursive approach.\n\nBut how to find which segment contains the global maximum. For example, the global maximum could be in the first segment, the second, etc. For each possibility, we can split the array into three parts: the part before the global maximum, the global maximum itself, and the part after. Then, the problem becomes splitting the first part into (j-1) segments, and the part after into (k-j) segments. But this is getting complicated.\n\nBut perhaps this leads to a recursive solution with memoization. However, for large n and k, this might not be efficient.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's denote that the global maximum is at position p. We can choose to have the segment containing p be the first segment, the second, ..., up to the k-th segment. For each choice, we split the array into parts before and after the segment containing p, and recursively solve for those parts.\n\nBut even this seems complex. For example, if we decide that the segment containing the global maximum is the i-th segment, then the first i-1 segments must be chosen from the prefix up to some position before p, and the remaining k-i segments from the suffix after p. But this seems difficult to model.\n\nBut perhaps this can be used in combination with dynamic programming. For example, define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i elements split into j segments. Then, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max_{m} ( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So this brings us back to the original DP approach.\n\nAt this point, I think that despite the O(n^2 *k) time complexity, the problem may require this approach, and perhaps with some optimizations, it can be made to work within the time limits for n=2000.\n\nLet me think about the actual numbers. For n=2000 and k=2000, the total number of states is nk = 4e6. For each state, the inner loop is O(n) steps. So 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9 operations. This is way too much for Python, which can handle about 1e6 operations per second.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize further. For example, for each j, we can compute the dp[i][j] based on the previous j-1 layer. And for each i and j, the inner loop can be optimized by precomputing the suffix maxima.\n\nLet's think about implementing the DP with this optimization.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Precompute the max_range array. For all l and r, max_range[l][r] is the maximum value between a[l] and a[r]. This can be done with O(n^2) time.\n\nBut for n=2000, this is 4 million entries. Which is manageable.\n\n2. Initialize the dp table. dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\n3. Base case: dp[i][1] = max_range[0][i-1] (assuming 0-based indices for the array).\n\n4. For j from 2 to k:\n\n   For i from j to n:\n\n      dp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1] ) for m in [j-1 ... i-1]\n\nWait, wait, the indices are tricky. Let's clarify:\n\nAssuming the array is 0-based, and the first i elements are a[0..i-1]. For splitting into j days, the last day's segment is from m to i-1, where m ranges from (j-1-1) ? No.\n\nWait, for the first i elements (indices 0 to i-1), split into j days. The last day must have at least 1 element. So the previous j-1 days must cover m elements, where m ranges from j-1-1 ? No, for j-1 days, m must be at least j-1 elements. So for the first i elements, m can range from j-1 to i-1. The previous j-1 days cover m elements (indices 0 to m-1), and the last day covers m to i-1 (which is i - m elements). So for each m in [j-1, i-1], the last day's segment is from m to i-1. The max of this segment is max_range[m][i-1].\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1] ) for m in [j-1, i-1]\n\nSo for the precomputed max_range, we need to have max_range[l][r] for l <= r.\n\nOnce this is set up, the DP can be computed.\n\nBut for each i and j, we can compute this max by iterating m from j-1 to i-1, and for each m, adding dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1]. However, this would take O(n^2 *k) time.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, it's impossible. So, what's the alternative?\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For example, in the sample input, the answer is 20. The third example has n=4, k=2. The best way is to split into [1,2000] and [2000, 2], giving sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000.\n\nBut what if we notice that for each j, the number of days, the optimal way to split is to have the last segment as large as possible. Or perhaps the optimal way is to have the last segment include the maximum of the remaining elements.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For each j and i, the optimal m for the last segment is the one that maximizes dp[m][j-1] + max of [m+1..i]. But perhaps the max of [m+1..i] is non-decreasing as m decreases. Or some other property that allows for binary search or other optimizations.\n\nBut I don't see any obvious monotonicity.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the max_range[m][i-1] is the maximum in the range from m to i-1, and m decreases, the max_range[m][i-1] is non-decreasing as m decreases. Because when m decreases, the range becomes larger, so the maximum can only stay the same or increase.\n\nYes! For example, if we have m1 < m2, then the range for m1 includes the range for m2, so the max_range[m1][i-1] >= max_range[m2][i-1]. So as m decreases (from i-1 downto j-1), the max_range[m][i-1] is non-decreasing.\n\nThis is a crucial observation. Because for a fixed i and j, as we decrease m from i-1 downto j-1, the max_range[m][i-1] is non-decreasing.\n\nNow, what about dp[m][j-1]? How does this behave as m decreases?\n\nWell, dp[m][j-1] is the maximum profit for the first m elements split into j-1 days. As m increases, dp[m][j-1] can increase or decrease? It depends on the data, but generally, it's non-decreasing. Because adding more elements allows for more flexibility in splitting, but since the profit is the sum of maxima, it's possible that adding more elements could increase or decrease the profit.\n\nBut this is not necessarily monotonic. For example, if the new elements have lower maxima, but the way of splitting could change.\n\nHowever, combining the two terms: dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1], where the first term could be anything and the second term is non-decreasing as m decreases.\n\nBut how can we use this?\n\nLet me think about the function f(m) = dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1]. As m decreases, max_range increases, but dp[m][j-1] could vary.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find the maximum of f(m) efficiently. For example, since max_range is non-decreasing, and dp[m][j-1] is some function, maybe the maximum occurs at a certain point.\n\nBut without knowing more about dp[m][j-1], it's hard to say.\n\nBut here's an idea: since max_range is non-decreasing, and we're looking for the maximum of f(m) = A(m) + B(m), where B(m) is non-decreasing, and A(m) is some function. If A(m) is non-increasing, then the maximum of f(m) would be at the point where the two functions cross. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since B(m) is non-decreasing, and we're trying to find the maximum of A(m) + B(m), it's possible that the maximum occurs at a certain m where A(m) is relatively large and B(m) is also relatively large.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to exploit this.\n\nHowever, this observation allows us to optimize the computation of the max for each i and j.\n\nLet's think about for a fixed i and j. We can iterate m from i-1 downto j-1, and keep track of the current max_range[m][i-1]. Since this is non-decreasing, and for each m, we have to compute dp[m][j-1] + current_max.\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this sum.\n\nLet me think about the following: as we iterate m from i-1 downto j-1, current_max is non-decreasing. At each step, the value of dp[m][j-1] + current_max is being added to the possibilities for dp[i][j]. Since current_max increases as m decreases, and dp[m][j-1] may vary, it's possible that the maximum occurs at some m where dp[m][j-1] is large enough to compensate for the increase in current_max.\n\nBut without knowing more about dp[m][j-1], it's hard to find",
