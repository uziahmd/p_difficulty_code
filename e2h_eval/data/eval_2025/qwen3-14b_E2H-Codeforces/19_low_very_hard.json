The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nSo, the nation has n districts connected in a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between any two districts). Each district i has a contestant with 2^i fans. The president wants to remove k contestants such that the remaining districts form a connected component (so they can all reach each other), and the total fans are maximized. And we have to output the k districts to remove, sorted in increasing order.\n\nThe key here is to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i grows exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more than lower ones. So, ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how do we do that? Let's think about the approach.\n\nThe problem resembles selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes, which is connected, and maximizes the sum of 2^i for those nodes. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers, we need to select the highest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n\nBut how to choose which nodes to remove?\n\nAn idea: Since higher-numbered districts have higher values, we should prioritize keeping them. However, the tree structure may require that certain nodes are kept to maintain connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps we need to find a subtree of size (n - k) that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we need to select a subset of nodes of size (n -k) that form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^i is maximum. Since the sum depends on the nodes, and higher nodes contribute more, we need to select the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how to ensure that they are connected? Well, perhaps we can start by considering that the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest number (n), then the next highest possible nodes that can be connected to it, etc. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we want to remove k nodes, but in such a way that the remaining nodes are connected. To maximize the sum, we want to remove the nodes with the smallest possible values, but we have to make sure that after removal, the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because removing a small node might not affect the connectivity, but removing a larger node could split the tree into parts. So maybe the correct approach is to keep the largest possible nodes, and remove the smallest ones, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother thought: Since the tree is connected, if we want to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but they might not be connected. So we need to find a way to select a connected subtree that contains as many of the largest nodes as possible.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be approached using a priority-based selection, but with constraints on connectivity.\n\nLet me think of the following strategy:\n\nWe can think of the problem as choosing which nodes to keep. The optimal set will consist of the largest (n -k) nodes, but connected. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to remove some smaller nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nAlternatively, since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, and then ensure that they form a connected subtree. If they do not, then we need to add some smaller nodes to connect them, but that would require removing more nodes than allowed. Wait, no. Because we can't add nodes; we can only remove. So perhaps the optimal solution is to find the minimal number of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree, and among those options, the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the problem as selecting a subtree of size (n -k) that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is determined by the nodes, the maximum sum is achieved when the subtree includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a subtree of size m = n -k, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nHow to find such a subtree?\n\nAn idea is to perform a greedy approach, starting from the highest-numbered node, and then adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of building a tree where we want to keep the largest nodes, and remove the smallest ones. However, when you remove nodes, you have to ensure",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more. Thus, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and iteratively adding the next highest-numbered districts that maintain connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    if m == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # We need to select m nodes with the largest numbers possible, forming a connected subtree.\n    # The approach is to start from the largest node and perform a BFS or DFS to collect as many large nodes as possible.\n    # We will use a priority queue (max-heap) approach to prioritize larger nodes.\n    \n    # First, create a list of nodes sorted in descending order\n    nodes = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n    \n    # We need to select m nodes.
