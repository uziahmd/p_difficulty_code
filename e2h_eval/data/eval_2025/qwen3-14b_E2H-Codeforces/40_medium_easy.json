    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's break it down.\n\nSo, permutations p and q are both of size n. We need to count all pairs where p < q lexicographically, and inv(p) > inv(q). The answer is the total number of such pairs modulo mod.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 500, which is quite big. So any O(n^4) approach is probably out of the question. Need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that the total number of permutation pairs where p is lex smaller than q is equal to (total number of permutation pairs) divided by 2, minus the cases where p = q. But since p and q are distinct permutations, the total number of pairs where p < q is (total_permutations * (total_permutations -1 )) / 2. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly half are p < q. But since the problem counts ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q, the total number is (total_permutations choose 2) = (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. However, our problem is not counting all those pairs, but only those where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute the number of such pairs?\n\nAn important observation here is that for each pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). So the total number of pairs where p < q is equal to the sum of these three possibilities.\n\nBut we need to find the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q.\n\nLet me think about the relation between inv(p) and inv(q) when p < q. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider all pairs (p, q) where p and q are permutations, p < q, and inv(p) > inv(q). Then, the answer is the count of these pairs.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q. Let's denote this as T. Then, if we can find the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q, and the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) and p < q, then we can compute the desired value.\n\nBut since for each pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or equal. So the total T equals A + B + C, where A is the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q), B the ones with inv(p) < inv(q), and C the ones with equal. So A is the desired answer.\n\nBut how can we relate A and B? For any pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in T. Now, if inv(p) < inv(q), then (p, q) contributes to B if p < q, and (q, p) would contribute to A if q < p. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf inv(p) < inv(q), then for the pair (p, q), if p < q, then this contributes to B. For the pair (q, p), since q > p lex order, then (q, p) is not counted in T. So for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. And for each such pair, if inv(p) < inv(q), then (p, q) contributes to B, and (q, p) is not considered. Similarly, if inv(p) > inv(q), then (q, p) would contribute to A if q < p. So the total A is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Similarly, B is the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). But since for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. And for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) (since if inv(p) = inv(q), then neither contributes to A nor B). So the sum A + B equals T - C, where C is the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nNow, considering that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. For each such pair, if inv(p) != inv(q), then exactly one of A or B is incremented. If inv(p) < inv(q), then (p, q) is in T and contributes to B if p < q. Otherwise, if inv(p) > inv(q), then (q, p) is in T and contributes to A if q < p. So, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. Therefore, the total A + B equals the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) != inv(q). But since T is the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q, which is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2, and C is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), then A + B = T - C.\n\nMoreover, for all unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of A or B is increased by 1. Therefore, A = (number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q)) - (number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q))? No, wait. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), if p < q, then it contributes to A. Otherwise, if q < p, then (q, p) is in T, and since inv(q) < inv(p), this contributes to B. So the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + B', where B' is the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) but q < p. But since for each such pair, exactly one of A or B is incremented. So the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + (number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p). Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + (the number of such pairs where q < p). But since for each such pair, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T, and in that case, if inv(p) > inv(q), then if p < q, it's in A, else if q < p, then (q, p) is in T, and since inv(q) < inv(p), this would be part of B. Wait, no. Let me rephrase.\n\nSuppose we have an unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Then, if p < q, then this contributes to A. If q < p, then (q, p) is in T, and since inv(q) < inv(p), then (q, p) would contribute to B. So for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. Similarly for inv(p) < inv(q). Therefore, the total number of unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q) is A + B. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of A or B is incremented. Also, the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q), because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair {q, p} with inv(q) < inv(p). Wait, no. The total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is the same as those with inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each unordered pair, exactly one of the two is true. So the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q). Therefore, the total A + B is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), which is equal to (total_unordered_pairs) - C_unordered, where C_unordered is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q). And since A and B are equal? No, that's not correct. Because A counts the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and B counts those with inv(p) < inv(q). But the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q). But how does that relate to A and B?\n\nWait, for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. If p < q, then (p, q) is in T and contributes to A. If q < p, then (q, p) is in T and contributes to B. So for each such unordered pair, exactly one of A or B is incremented. Similarly, for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. But since the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q), then A + B = (number of unordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q)) = (total_unordered_pairs - C_unordered). But since A and B are the counts of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) and inv(p) < inv(q), respectively, then A and B must be equal? No, because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), whether it contributes to A or B depends on the lex order. So unless the lex order is symmetric, which it isn't. For example, if p < q, then it contributes to A, otherwise to B. But how can we know the total?\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Let's consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. Now, suppose that inv(p) and inv(q) are different. Then, exactly one of A or B is incremented. But for each such pair, the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the probability that inv(p) < inv(q) if the inversions are symmetric. Wait, but inversion counts are not symmetric. For example, the number of permutations with k inversions is not necessarily the same as those with (max_inversions -k) inversions. However, for each permutation p, there's a unique permutation q which is the reverse of p, and the number of inversions in q is max_inversions - inv(p). So perhaps there's some kind of symmetry here. However, I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), plus some correction based on the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let's think about the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. Let's denote this as S = n! * (n! - 1). For each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or equal. Now, considering all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs with inv(p) < inv(q), since for each pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). Therefore, the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let's denote this as X. Then, S = 2X + Y, where Y is the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). Therefore, X = (S - Y)/2.\n\nNow, the problem requires us to find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this as A. Similarly, the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is B. As before, T = A + B + C, where C is the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). But from the previous reasoning, X = (S - Y)/2. Also, X is the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). But this includes all ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) (which is A), and all ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q) (which is the same as the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is B). Because if p > q, then (p, q) is not in T. So the total X is equal to A + B', where B' is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But since (p, q) where p > q is not in T, but (q, p) is in T. So for each pair (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q), the corresponding (q, p) is in T and has inv(q) < inv(p). Therefore, B' is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p > q and inv(p) > inv(q), which is the same as the number of ordered pairs (q, p) with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is B. Therefore, X = A + B. But earlier, X is (S - Y)/2. Also, S = 2X + Y. So, X = (S - Y)/2.\n\nBut T is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q. So T = (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. Also, T = A + B + C. But X = A + B. Therefore, X = A + B = (S - Y)/2. But S is 2T + (number of pairs where p = q). Since p and q are permutations, p = q is allowed, but in our case, we are considering p != q. So S = 2T. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q, there are two ordered pairs (p, q) and (q, p). Therefore, S = 2T. Hence, substituting into X = (S - Y)/2 gives X = (2T - Y)/2 = T - Y/2. But X is also A + B. Therefore, A + B = T - Y/2. But Y is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). So Y = 2C' where C' is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q). Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), there are two ordered pairs (p, q) and (q, p). So Y = 2C'.\n\nBut then, T = A + B + C, where C is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). So substituting back, we get:\n\nA + B = T - (Y/2) = T - ( (2C') / 2 ) = T - C'. But since C' is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), and C is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), then C' = C * 2? No. Wait, for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. So the total C is the number of such unordered pairs. Because for each unordered pair, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. Therefore, C' = C. Because C' is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), and C is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). So C' = C. Therefore, A + B = T - C. Which matches what we had earlier.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, if we can compute X = A + B = T - C, and also X = (S - Y)/2 = T - C. So nothing new here.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that the desired answer A is equal to (X - D), where D is something. Wait, but earlier we said that X = A + B. And since X is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q), and since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. However, the number of such unordered pairs is equal to X' = X / 1? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, considering that X is the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), and for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in X or not. So for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in X. Therefore, the number of such unordered pairs is equal to X. But this seems incorrect. For example, if p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), then (p, q) is in X. If q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), then (q, p) is not in X. Wait, no. Because X is the count of all ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), regardless of their lex order. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in X. So the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X. But since X = (S - Y)/2, and S = 2T, then X = (2T - Y)/2 = T - Y/2. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nBut going back to the problem. We need to find A, which is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me think of another approach. Suppose we can precompute for all permutations p, the number of inversions they have. Let’s denote inv(p) as the number of inversions in p. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, we need to count the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nSo the problem reduces to, given a list of numbers (the inversion counts of all permutations), count the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j (in lex order?), but wait, no. Wait, the permutations p and q are ordered by lex order. So for all permutations p and q, if p is lex smaller than q, then we check if inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThe problem is that the permutations are ordered lex, and for each pair (p, q) with p < q, we need to compare their inversion counts.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute for all permutations of size n, their inversion count. But for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too large. So this is impossible. So we need another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the inversion counts of all permutations. For each possible inversion count k, let's compute the number of permutations with that count. Let's call this cnt[k]. Then, for each pair of inversion counts (k1, k2), the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = k1, inv(q) = k2, and p < q is equal to (cnt[k1] * cnt[k2]) / 2 if k1 != k2, but only if we can determine how many pairs (p, q) with inv(p) =k1 and inv(q)=k2 have p < q. However, this seems tricky because the lex order of permutations depends on their actual values, not just their inversion counts. So even if we know the number of permutations with inversion counts k1 and k2, we can't directly compute how many of the pairs (p, q) with inv(p)=k1 and inv(q)=k2 satisfy p < q.\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry here. For example, for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for all pairs (p, q) with inv(p) =k1 and inv(q) =k2, and k1 !=k2, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p)=k1, inv(q)=k2 is equal to (number of such unordered pairs) * 1 if k1 and k2 are such that ... no, that's not helpful. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p)=k1 and inv(q)=k2, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p)=k1 and inv(q)=k2 is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p)=k1 and inv(q)=k2 multiplied by 1 (if k1 !=k2). But how do we compute this?\n\nBut if we assume that for any two permutations p and q with inv(p) =k1 and inv(q)=k2 (k1 !=k2), the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is equal to (cnt[k1] * cnt[k2]) / 2, then this would be true if for every pair of permutations p and q with inv(p) =k1 and inv(q)=k2, exactly half of the ordered pairs (p, q) and (q, p) are in the p < q category. However, this is not necessarily the case. For example, suppose k1 = 0 (the identity permutation) and k2 = max_inversion (the reversed permutation). Then, the identity permutation is lex smaller than the reversed permutation, so for this pair, (p, q) is counted once. But there are other pairs where p may be lex smaller or larger than q, depending on their structure. So this assumption is not valid. Therefore, this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So this seems like a dead end. What else can we do?\n\nAnother observation: The lex order of permutations is not directly related to their inversion counts. However, the problem requires us to count pairs where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's think about generating all pairs (p, q) with p < q, and for each such pair, check if inv(p) > inv(q). But again, for n=500, this is impossible due to the sheer number of permutations.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the answer is (total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q) - (number of pairs with inv(p) <= inv(q)) ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, earlier we thought that the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (X - Y') / something. Not sure.\n\nBut earlier, we found that X = A + B = (S - Y)/2. And X is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). Also, for all such pairs, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. So, for each pair (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), if p < q, it contributes to A; else, it contributes to B. So the total X = A + B. But we also have that for all pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), the number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) < inv(q). So X = B_total, where B_total is the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). But how to find A?\n\nAlternatively, since for all pairs (p, q) with p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or equal. And for the entire set of permutations, the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) if there's some symmetry. But I don't see why that would be the case.\n\nBut let's think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is equal to T - C. And since the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is A, and the others are B. Now, if we could find that A = B, then we could say that A = (T - C) / 2. But is this true?\n\nNo. Because for example, consider n=2. The permutations are [1,2] (inv=0) and [2,1] (inv=1). The total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is 1 (only ([1,2], [2,1])). For this pair, inv(p)=0 < inv(q)=1. So A is zero, B is 1, and C is zero. So A is not equal to B. Thus, this approach is invalid.\n\nSo the earlier assumption that A and B are equal is wrong. So how else can we proceed?\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps for each permutation p, we can find the number of permutations q that are lex larger than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). Then, summing this over all p would give us the answer A. Because for each such pair (p, q), p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut again, with n=500, this is not feasible unless we can find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe need to find for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex larger than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). Summing this over all p would give us the answer.\n\nBut again, with n=500, enumerating all permutations is impossible. So we need another approach.\n\nLet me think about generating functions or dynamic programming for inversion counts.\n\nFirst, for a given n, the inversion count of a permutation can range from 0 (sorted) to max_inv = n*(n-1)/2 (reversed).\n\nLet’s denote for each possible inversion count k, the number of permutations with that count as cnt[k].\n\nWe can precompute cnt[k] for all k using dynamic programming. This is a known problem. The standard approach is to use DP where dp[n][k] represents the number of permutations of size n with k inversions. The recurrence is dp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k-i]. This is because inserting the nth element into position i (0-based) adds i inversions. However, for n=500, the maximum k is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the DP table would be of size 500 x 124750. For n=500, this is manageable with O(n^3) time? Wait, for each n from 1 to 500, and for each k up to max_inv, we have to sum over i from 0 to min(n-1, k). So the total time complexity would be O(n^2 * max_inv). For n=500, max_inv is around 125,000. So 500^2 * 125,000 = 3.125e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more optimized way to compute the cnt[k], using generating functions or convolution. For example, the generating function for the number of permutations of size n with k inversions is the product of the generating functions for each step. For example, the generating function for n=1 is 1. For n=2, it's x^0 + x^1. For n=3, it's the convolution of the previous generating function with (1 + x + x^2). This is because adding a new element to a permutation of size n-1 can add 0, 1, ..., n-1 inversions. So the generating function for n is the convolution of the generating function for n-1 with (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{n-1}).\n\nThis approach would allow us to compute the cnt[k] using dynamic programming with convolution. For n=500, the maximum inversion count is 124750. Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) might help, but since we need exact integer results, FFT is not suitable. However, we can perform the convolution using dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach again. Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of permutations of length i with j inversions. The base case is dp[1][0] = 1. For i >= 2, dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j -k}. This is because inserting the new element into the i-th position (which can be placed in any of the i positions, adding k inversions, where k ranges from 0 to i-1).\n\nBut for each i, the sum can be optimized using prefix sums. For example, for each i, we can compute dp[i][j] as dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] + ... + dp[i-1][j - (i-1)] }, but only for j >= (i-1). This can be computed with prefix sums. Let me see:\n\nFor each i, we can compute the dp[i] array based on dp[i-1]. For each j, dp[i][j] = sum_{x= max(0, j - (i-1))}^{j} dp[i-1][x} }, but wait, no. Wait, inserting the new element into position k (0-based) adds k inversions. So for the new element being inserted at position k (which can be from 0 to i-1), the number of new inversions added is k. So for the previous permutation of size i-1 with m inversions, inserting the new element at position k will give a permutation of size i with m + k inversions. So dp[i][m + k] += dp[i-1][m]. Therefore, for each j, dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j -k} }.\n\nBut this is equivalent to for each j, dp[i][j] = sum_{m= max(0, j - (i-1))}^j dp[i-1][m} }, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each j, the sum is over all possible k (number of inversions added) such that k is between 0 and i-1, and j -k is >=0. So for each j, the sum is over m = j -k, where k ranges from 0 to i-1 and m >=0. So m ranges from j - (i-1) to j, but m cannot be negative. So the sum is sum_{m = max(0, j - (i-1))}^j dp[i-1][m} }, provided that j - (i-1) >=0. Otherwise, it's sum from 0 to j.\n\nBut this can be computed efficiently with prefix sums. For each i, we can precompute the prefix sums of dp[i-1][...], then for each j, compute the sum for dp[i][j] as prefix[j] - prefix[max(0, j - i)].\n\nYes! This would reduce the time complexity. Let's see: For each i from 2 to n, and for each j from 0 to max_inv_i (which is i*(i-1)/2), we can compute dp[i][j] using prefix sums. The time complexity becomes O(n^2 * max_inv), but with the prefix sums, each dp[i][j] is computed in O(1) time. For n=500, max_inv is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the total number of operations would be O(n * max_inv) = 500 * 124750 ≈ 62 million operations. That's manageable in Python with optimizations.\n\nOnce we have the cnt array (dp[n][k] for all k), we can proceed.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this as A.\n\nAs earlier, we can think of A as the sum over all pairs (k1, k2) where k1 > k2, multiplied by the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) =k1, inv(q)=k2, and p < q.\n\nBut how to compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) =k1, inv(q)=k2?\n\nLet’s denote this as f(k1, k2). Then, A = sum_{k1 > k2} f(k1, k2).\n\nThe challenge is to compute f(k1, k2).\n\nBut how?\n\nAssuming that for all pairs of permutations p and q with inv(p) =k1 and inv(q)=k2, the number of pairs where p < q is equal to (cnt[k1] * cnt[k2]) / 2 if k1 !=k2. But this is only true if for every pair (p, q) with inv(p)=k1 and inv(q)=k2, exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have q < p. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if k1 is 0 and k2 is 1, then there is only one permutation with inv=0 (the sorted one), and one permutation with inv=1 (the swapped pair). The sorted one is lex smaller than the other, so f(0, 1) = 1. But according to the formula (cnt[k1]*cnt[k2])/2, it would be (1 * 1)/2 = 0.5, which is not possible. So this approach is invalid.\n\nThus, we need another way to compute f(k1, k2).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative Idea: For each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p) is the same as the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). But again, without knowing the relationship between lex order and inversion counts, this seems difficult.\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry here. For example, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X = (S - Y)/2. And for all such pairs, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the number of pairs",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q.
