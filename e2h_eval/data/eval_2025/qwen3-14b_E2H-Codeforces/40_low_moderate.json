The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to do this modulo a given mod value.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand what exactly is required here. Let's think about the constraints:\n\nFor each pair of permutations (p, q), we need two conditions:\n1. p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n2. inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut since permutations can be numerous, especially for n up to 500, brute-forcing all possible pairs is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the total number of permutation pairs where p < q. Since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. The total number of unordered pairs is (total_permutations * (total_permutations -1 )) / 2. But since we're considering ordered pairs where p < q, the count would be (total_permutations choose 2) = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. However, this is only if all pairs are considered. But our problem requires considering only those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nWait, but how can we relate the inversion counts between p and q?\n\nAnother thought: For all pairs (p, q) where p < q, how many of them have inv(p) > inv(q)? Let me think about symmetry. Suppose we consider all pairs (p, q) where p != q. Then, for each such pair, either p < q or q < p. Now, suppose we consider the inversion counts of p and q. If inv(p) > inv(q), then in the pair (p, q), it's counted once. In the pair (q, p), if inv(q) < inv(p), then that's a different scenario. But since p and q are different, for each pair (p, q) where p < q, there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where q < p. However, the inversion counts may not be symmetric here.\n\nBut perhaps, if we can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), then maybe we can find some relation between the total number of such pairs and the total number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs_with_p_less_than_q - same_inv_count_pairs)/2. Because for each pair where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q), unless inv(p) = inv(q). Wait, but that depends on whether there's a symmetry here.\n\nLet me think. For all pairs (p, q) where p != q, either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) or inv(p) = inv(q). Let me denote the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q as T. Then, the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) would be equal to (T - S)/2, where S is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Because for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. And since for each such pair, the reverse (q, p) would be in the other case. So the total number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which would be same as the number of pairs with inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. So the total of these two would be T - S. Therefore, each of them would be (T - S)/2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you consider all pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and the pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), they are two different sets. However, the sum of the counts of these two sets would be equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) != inv(q). But since for each such pair, exactly one of the two possibilities holds. But how does this relate to T?\n\nLet me clarify. Let me define:\n\nLet A be the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet B be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. This requires an efficient approach due to the constraints on n (up to 500).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Inversion Count Calculation**: For each permutation of length n, compute the number of inversions. This can be done efficiently using dynamic programming.\n2. **Lexicographical Order Consideration**: Since we need to consider pairs (p, q) where p is lexicographically smaller than q, we can leverage the symmetry of permutations and inversion counts.\n3. **Symmetry and Pair Counting**: Use the symmetry of permutation pairs to reduce the problem size. The total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is calculated, and then we adjust for pairs with equal inversion counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7  # Placeholder, actual mod is read from input\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials mod mod\n    max_n = n\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n\n    # Precompute inversion counts for all permutations of size up to n\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    # Initialize dp[1][0] = 1\n    dp = [ [0]*( (i*(i-1))//2 + 1 ) for i in range(n+1) ]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for len_p in range(2, n+1):\n        max_inv = (len_p * (len_p -1 )) // 2\n        for prev_inv in range( ( (len_p -1)*(len_p -2) ) // 2 + 1 ):\n            if dp[len_p -1][prev_inv] == 0:\n                continue\n            for pos in range(len_p):\n                new_inv = prev_inv + pos\n                if new_inv <= max_inv:\n                    dp[len_p][new_inv] = (dp[len_p][new_inv] + dp[len_p -1][prev_inv]) % mod\n\n    # Now, for each possible inversion count, count the number of permutations with that count\n    inv_count = [0] * ( (n*(n-1))//2 + 1 )\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        for j in range(len(dp[i])):\n            inv_count[j] = (inv_count[j] + dp[i][j]) % mod\n\n    # Compute total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q\n    total_pairs = (fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1) // 2) % mod\n\n    # Compute S: number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) == inv(q)\n    S = 0\n    for inv in range( (n*(n-1))//2 + 1 ):\n        cnt = inv_count[inv]\n        if cnt < 2:\n            continue\n        # number of pairs is C(cnt, 2)\n        S = (S + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2) % mod\n\n    # Answer is (total_pairs - S) // 2 mod mod\n    ans = (total_pairs - S) * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Factorial Precomputation**: We precompute factorials up to n modulo the given mod value to handle large numbers efficiently.\n2. **Dynamic Programming for Inversions**: Using dynamic programming, we compute the number of permutations of each length with a specific number of inversions.\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: By leveraging the symmetry of permutation pairs and their inversion counts, we compute the total number of valid pairs (p, q) where p is lexicographically smaller than q and has more inversions than q.
