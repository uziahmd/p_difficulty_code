For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset is one where for every possible prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. Also, the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. So each string in the multiset is of length n, and for each shorter string s, we count how many of these strings have s as a prefix.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the number of assignments of c_s values (each between 0 and k) such that when you choose those c_s's, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, the maximum possible size of such a multiset is f, and not more than that.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints on the c_s's that would allow the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f.\n\nFirst, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s's. To find the maximum possible size, we need to find the largest possible number of strings (each of length n) such that for every prefix s, the count of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis feels similar to some kind of flow problem or constraint satisfaction. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the concept of a trie, where each node represents a prefix, and the number of strings passing through that node can't exceed the c_s for that prefix.\n\nWait, but for a multiset of strings of length n, each string contributes to all its prefixes. For example, a string \"01\" contributes to prefixes \"0\", \"01\", and the empty string (but perhaps the problem only considers prefixes of length 1 to n). Wait, the problem says for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So, for a string of length n, all its prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n are considered.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each s (binary string of length 1..n) such that the maximum number of strings (of length n) that can be placed in the multiset without violating any c_s constraints is exactly f.\n\nOur goal is to count the number of such c_s assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to model the maximum size of the beautiful multiset given the c_s's. Let's call this maximum value M. We need to find the number of c_s assignments where M = f.\n\nSo first, we need to find for a given set of c_s's, what is M. Then, count all c_s assignments where M equals exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute M?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of strings (of length n) that can be placed such that for every prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where each string contributes +1 to all its prefixes. So, the constraints are that for every prefix s, the sum over all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of such strings?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure, where each node represents a prefix. The constraints are that the number of strings passing through a node (i.e., having that prefix) is at most c_s for that node. The maximum number of strings is then determined by the minimum constraints along the paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed such that for each node (prefix), the number of strings passing through it is ≤ c_s. This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum flow, but perhaps there's a way to compute it greedily.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the maximum number of strings M is determined by the minimum of the c_s values along the paths from the root to the leaves. Because each string is a path from the root (empty string?) to a leaf (the full string of length n). However, the problem here is that the constraints are on all prefixes of each string.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a string of length n. It contributes to all its prefixes. So, for each node (prefix) along its path, the count increases by 1. Therefore, the total number of strings that can be placed",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to each binary string prefix such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. The constraints and conditions are complex, so we break the solution into manageable parts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string of length from 1 to `n` has a constraint value `c_s` which limits how many times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset.\n2. **Trie Structure Insight**: The problem can be modeled using a trie where each node represents a binary string prefix. The constraints on each node (prefix) determine how many strings can pass through it.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations for each possible maximum size of the beautiful multiset. This involves:\n   - Precomputing the number of ways to assign values to prefixes such that the maximum size is at most `f`.\n   - Subtracting the number of configurations where the maximum size is less than `f` to get the exact count for `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        # Precompute the number of nodes at each level\n        # For level l (1-based), there are 2^{l-1} nodes\n        # Total levels from 1 to n\n        max_level = n\n        total_nodes = 0\n        for l in range(1, n+1):\n            total_nodes += 2 ** (l-1)\n        \n        # For each node, we need to compute the number of ways to choose c_s\n        # such that the maximum possible beautiful multiset size is exactly f\n        \n        # Let's think of the problem as follows:\n        # The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths.\n        # For any configuration of c_s, the maximum M is the minimal value of (sum_{s} c_s) over all paths, but this is not straightforward.\n        # Another approach is to realize that the maximum M is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of leaves under s).\n        # Wait, no. Actually, for each node s, the number of strings passing through it is limited by c_s. However, since each string is of length n, the number of strings passing through a node s of length l is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. But the maximum number of such strings is limited by c_s.\n        # However, for the entire tree, the maximum number of strings is the minimal c_s along the path from root to leaf multiplied by the number of leaves under that node?\n        # Not sure. Another way: the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for a node s of length l, each string that passes through s can branch out into 2^{n-l} possible strings. Therefore, the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # So, for a given set of c_s, the maximum M is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Therefore, to have M = f, we need that for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (for each binary string s of length 1..n) such that:\n        # 1. For all s, c_s <= k\n        # 2. For all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f\n        # 3. There exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f\n        \n        # First, compute for each node s (of length l), the minimal required c_s_min = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But since c_s must be integer, if f is not divisible by 2^{n - l}, then c_s must be at least ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). Otherwise, it can be exactly f / (2^{n - l}).\n        \n        # However, since the minimal value across all nodes is f, we need for all nodes s: c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - l_s})), where l_s is the length of s.\n        # Also, for at least one node s, c_s * 2^{n - l_s} == f. Which implies that f must be divisible by 2^{n - l_s}, and c_s = f / (2^{n - l_s}).\n        \n        # So the steps are:\n        # 1. Check if f is achievable. For example, if for some node s, the minimal required c_s is larger than k, then there are 0 ways.\n        # 2. Compute the number of valid configurations where all c_s >= required_min (so that M >= f), and subtract those where all c_s >= required_min + 1 (so that M > f). The difference will be the number of configurations where M is exactly f.\n        \n        # But how to compute required_min for each node?\n        \n        # Let's precompute for each node length l (from 1 to n), what is the minimal c_s required for that node to contribute to M being at least f.\n        # For a node of length l, the contribution is c_s * 2^{n - l} >= f. So c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - l})).\n        # However, since 2^{n - l} can be very large, for l = n, 2^{n - l} is 1, so c_s >= f. But since c_s <=k, if f >k, then no solution.\n        \n        # So first, for each l in 1..n, compute the minimal required c_s for that level: m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But note that for l < n, 2^{n - l} can be big. For example, if l=1 and n=15, 2^{14} is 16384. If f is 1, then m_l is 1/16384, which is 0.000... but since c_s must be integer >=0, then m_l is 0? No, wait, because c_s * 2^{n - l} >= f. So if f is 1, and 2^{n - l} is 16384, then c_s * 16384 >=1 => c_s >= 1/16384. Since c_s is an integer >=0, the minimal c_s is 1 (since 0*...=0 <1). Wait, but if c_s is 0, then 0*...=0 <1. So the minimal required is ceil(f / (2^{n - l})) if that is positive. But if f is zero, but the problem says f >=1, according to the input constraints (since input has 1<=f<=2e5). So for each l, compute m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But since c_s can be up to k, if m_l >k, then no way. So first check for all l whether m_l <=k. If any l has m_l >k, then answer is 0.\n        \n        # So first, for each l from 1 to n, compute m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). Then check if m_l <=k for all l. If not, answer is 0.\n        \n        # Then, the number of valid configurations is (product over all nodes s of (k - m_l +1)) minus the product where for all nodes s, c_s >= m_l +1 (but only if m_l +1 <=k). Wait, no. Because we want to count all configurations where for every node s, c_s >= m_l, and at least one node s has c_s = m_l (so that the minimal is exactly f). So the total number is (number of configurations with all c_s >= m_l) - (number of configurations with all c_s >= m_l +1).\n        \n        # However, the problem is that m_l depends on the length of the node. For each node of length l, the required minimal is m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But for different nodes of same length l, they all have the same m_l. So for each length l, there are 2^{l-1} nodes. For each such node, the allowed c_s must be >= m_l, and <=k.\n        \n        # So for each l, compute the number of choices per node of that length: (k - m_l +1) if m_l <=k else 0. Then the total for all nodes is the product of these terms across all l. But then, we need to subtract the case where all nodes have c_s >= m_l +1 (if that is possible).\n        \n        # However, this approach is only correct if m_l is the minimal required for each node. But for the minimal M to be exactly f, we need that the minimal of (c_s * 2^{n - l}) across all nodes is exactly f. Which requires that for at least one node, c_s * 2^{n - l} = f. Which implies that for that node, c_s = f / (2^{n - l}), which must be integer. So for that node, f must be divisible by 2^{n - l}.\n        \n        # Therefore, the initial approach may not be correct. Because even if all nodes have c_s >= m_l, it's possible that the minimal (c_s * ...) is higher than f. Hence, the previous idea of using the product of (k - m_l +1) is not sufficient. That approach would give the number of configurations where M >= f, but we need to ensure that M is exactly f.\n        \n        # Therefore, we need to find the number of configurations where for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of valid configurations is equal to:\n        # total = (number of configurations where all c_s >= required) - (number of configurations where all c_s >= required and for all nodes, c_s * ... > f)\n        \n        # But how to compute required? For each node s, required is ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})). But the problem is that for some nodes, even if c_s is exactly required, their contribution might be more than f. Wait, no. For example, suppose for a node of length l, 2^{n - l} is d. Then required is m_l = ceil(f/d). So c_s *d >= f. But if c_s = m_l, then c_s*d is >=f. However, if d divides f, then m_l = f/d. So in that case, c_s*d = f. Otherwise, m_l = floor(f/d)+1, and c_s*d >=f. So for the minimal case, the minimal value of c_s * ... across all nodes is f if and only if there is at least one node where c_s * ... = f. Therefore, the configurations where all nodes have c_s >= m_l and at least one node has c_s * ... = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n        # Compute the number of configurations where for all nodes s, c_s >= m_l (where m_l is ceil(f / (2^{n - l}))) and at least one node s has c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f.\n        \n        # How to compute this? It's equal to the total number of configurations where all c_s >= m_l, minus the number of configurations where all c_s >= m_l and for all nodes, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} > f.\n        \n        # Now, the second term (all nodes have c_s * ... > f) is equivalent to for all nodes s, c_s >= ceil( (f + 1) / (2^{n - len(s)}) ). Let's call this value m'_l for each length l. If for some l, m'_l >k, then the term is zero.\n        \n        # Therefore, the steps are:\n        # 1. For each l from 1 to n, compute m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). If any m_l >k, then answer is 0.\n        # 2. Compute the number of configurations where all c_s >= m_l for each node. This is the product for each l of (k - m_l +1)^{number_of_nodes_at_level_l}.\n        # 3. Compute m'_l = ceil( (f +1) / (2^{n - l}) ). If for any l, m'_l >k, then the second term is 0. Otherwise, compute the product for each l of (k - m'_l +1)^{number_of_nodes_at_level_l}.\n        # 4. The answer is (total1 - total2) mod MOD.\n        \n        # Now, let's implement this logic.\n        \n        # First, check if for any l, m_l >k.

Actually, for each node s, the number of strings passing through it is limited by c_s. However, since each string is of length n, the number of strings passing through a node s of length l is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. But the maximum number of such strings is limited by c_s.\n        # However, for the entire tree, the maximum number of strings is the minimal c_s along the path from root to leaf multiplied by the number of leaves under that node?\n        # Not sure. Another way: the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for a node s of length l, each string that passes through s can branch out into 2^{n-l} possible strings. Therefore, the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # So, for a given set of c_s, the maximum M is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Therefore, to have M = f, we need that for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (for each binary string s of length 1..n) such that:\n        # 1.

But since c_s must be integer, if f is not divisible by 2^{n - l}, then c_s must be at least ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). Otherwise, it can be exactly f / (2^{n - l}).\n        \n        # However, since the minimal value across all nodes is f, we need for all nodes s: c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - l_s})), where l_s is the length of s.\n        # Also, for at least one node s, c_s * 2^{n - l_s} == f. Which implies that f must be divisible by 2^{n - l_s}, and c_s = f / (2^{n - l_s}).\n        \n        # So the steps are:\n        # 1. Check if f is achievable. For example, if for some node s, the minimal required c_s is larger than k, then there are 0 ways.\n        # 2. Compute the number of valid configurations where all c_s >= required_min (so that M >= f), and subtract those where all c_s >= required_min + 1 (so that M > f). The difference will be the number of configurations where M is exactly f.\n        \n        # But how to compute required_min for each node?\n        \n        # Let's precompute for each node length l (from 1 to n), what is the minimal c_s required for that node to contribute to M being at least f.\n        # For a node of length l, the contribution is c_s * 2^{n - l} >= f. So c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - l})).\n        # However, since 2^{n - l} can be very large, for l = n, 2^{n - l} is 1, so c_s >= f. But since c_s <=k, if f >k, then no solution.\n        \n        # So first, for each l in 1..n, compute the minimal required c_s for that level: m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But note that for l < n, 2^{n - l} can be big. For example, if l=1 and n=15, 2^{14} is 16384. If f is 1, then m_l is 1/16384, which is 0.000... but since c_s must be integer >=0, then m_l is 0? No, wait, because c_s * 2^{n - l} >= f. So if f is 1, and 2^{n - l} is 16384, then c_s * 16384 >=1 => c_s >= 1/16384. Since c_s is an integer >=0, the minimal c_s is 1 (since 0*...=0 <1). Wait, but if c_s is 0, then 0*...=0 <1. So the minimal required is ceil(f / (2^{n - l})) if that is positive. But if f is zero, but the problem says f >=1, according to the input constraints (since input has 1<=f<=2e5). So for each l, compute m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But since c_s can be up to k, if m_l >k, then no way. So first check for all l whether m_l <=k. If any l has m_l >k, then answer is 0.\n        \n        # So first, for each l from 1 to n, compute m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). Then check if m_l <=k for all l. If not, answer is 0.\n        \n        # Then, the number of valid configurations is (product over all nodes s of (k - m_l +1)) minus the product where for all nodes s, c_s >= m_l +1 (but only if m_l +1 <=k). Wait, no. Because we want to count all configurations where for every node s, c_s >= m_l, and at least one node s has c_s = m_l (so that the minimal is exactly f). So the total number is (number of configurations with all c_s >= m_l) - (number of configurations with all c_s >= m_l +1).\n        \n        # However, the problem is that m_l depends on the length of the node. For each node of length l, the required minimal is m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). But for different nodes of same length l, they all have the same m_l. So for each length l, there are 2^{l-1} nodes. For each such node, the allowed c_s must be >= m_l, and <=k.\n        \n        # So for each l, compute the number of choices per node of that length: (k - m_l +1) if m_l <=k else 0. Then the total for all nodes is the product of these terms across all l. But then, we need to subtract the case where all nodes have c_s >= m_l +1 (if that is possible).\n        \n        # However, this approach is only correct if m_l is the minimal required for each node. But for the minimal M to be exactly f, we need that the minimal of (c_s * 2^{n - l}) across all nodes is exactly f. Which requires that for at least one node, c_s * 2^{n - l} = f. Which implies that for that node, c_s = f / (2^{n - l}), which must be integer. So for that node, f must be divisible by 2^{n - l}.\n        \n        # Therefore, the initial approach may not be correct. Because even if all nodes have c_s >= m_l, it's possible that the minimal (c_s * ...) is higher than f. Hence, the previous idea of using the product of (k - m_l +1) is not sufficient. That approach would give the number of configurations where M >= f, but we need to ensure that M is exactly f.\n        \n        # Therefore, we need to find the number of configurations where for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of valid configurations is equal to:\n        # total = (number of configurations where all c_s >= required) - (number of configurations where all c_s >= required and for all nodes, c_s * ... > f)\n        \n        # But how to compute required? For each node s, required is ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})). But the problem is that for some nodes, even if c_s is exactly required, their contribution might be more than f. Wait, no. For example, suppose for a node of length l, 2^{n - l} is d. Then required is m_l = ceil(f/d). So c_s *d >= f. But if c_s = m_l, then c_s*d is >=f. However, if d divides f, then m_l = f/d. So in that case, c_s*d = f. Otherwise, m_l = floor(f/d)+1, and c_s*d >=f. So for the minimal case, the minimal value of c_s * ... across all nodes is f if and only if there is at least one node where c_s * ... = f. Therefore, the configurations where all nodes have c_s >= m_l and at least one node has c_s * ... = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n        # Compute the number of configurations where for all nodes s, c_s >= m_l (where m_l is ceil(f / (2^{n - l}))) and at least one node s has c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f.\n        \n        # How to compute this? It's equal to the total number of configurations where all c_s >= m_l, minus the number of configurations where all c_s >= m_l and for all nodes, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} > f.\n        \n        # Now, the second term (all nodes have c_s * ... > f) is equivalent to for all nodes s, c_s >= ceil( (f + 1) / (2^{n - len(s)}) ). Let's call this value m'_l for each length l. If for some l, m'_l >k, then the term is zero.\n        \n        # Therefore, the steps are:\n        # 1. For each l from 1 to n, compute m_l = ceil(f / (2^{n - l})). If any m_l >k, then answer is 0.\n        # 2. Compute the number of configurations where all c_s >= m_l for each node. This is the product for each l of (k - m_l +1)^{number_of_nodes_at_level_l}.\n        # 3. Compute m'_l = ceil( (f +1) / (2^{n - l}) ). If for any l, m'_l >k, then the second term is 0. Otherwise, compute the product for each l of (k - m'_l +1)^{number_of_nodes_at_level_l}.\n        # 4.
