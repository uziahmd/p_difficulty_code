Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we have to consider the ends of the street. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine part of the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones won't be adjacent. So sorting them first makes sense.\n\n2. After sorting, check the distance between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, the maximum gap between them divided by 2 would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are s units apart, then the middle point between them is s/2 away from each. So the minimal d needed to cover that gap is s/2. But wait, maybe the lanterns are placed such that their coverage areas overlap. But the problem is to cover the entire street. So for any gap between two adjacent lanterns, the maximum distance between them determines the required d. Because if the gap is s, then the middle of that gap is s/2 away from each lantern, so the d must be at least s/2 to cover that point.\n\nBut also, the first lantern might not be at 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly, the distance from the last lantern's position to l. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1 - 0. The required d must be at least that distance, because otherwise the area from 0 to a1 -d would not be covered. Wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is up to d distance. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the leftmost point it covers is a1 -d. To cover 0, we need a1 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. Similarly, for the end of the street, the last lantern is at an. Then the rightmost point it covers is an +d. To cover l, we need an +d ≥ l → d ≥ l - an.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nThe minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all consecutive pairs in the sorted array.\n- The first lantern's position (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nWait, no. Because for the first lantern, the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the required d must be at least a[0], since the lantern's coverage starts at a[0] -d. To cover 0, that a[0] -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. Similarly for the end, l - a[-1] must be ≤ d → d ≥ l -a[-1].\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between (the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2), and the first and last distances.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial max_gap as the maximum between a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n- Then iterate through consecutive pairs, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare with the current max_gap. Update max_gap accordingly.\n- The final answer is max_gap.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then the max_gap is max(a[0], l -a[0]). Because the lantern's coverage has to reach both ends.\n\nYes. So that case is covered.\n\nLet me test the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting: 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nThen the first distance is 0 (since first lantern is at 0). The last distance is 15 -15 =0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are:\n\n3-0 =3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5. Then compare with the first and last distances (0 and 0). So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 5\n\npositions 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. \n\nFirst distance is 2-0=2. Last distance is 5-5=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nYes. So that logic works.\n\nSo now, the steps for code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nAt the end, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? No, according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen loop through consecutive elements, compute the differences, divide by 2, compare to max_d.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the list is [0, 15], l=15. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 0) =0. Then the gap between 0 and 15 is 15, divided by 2 is 7.5. So the max_d is 7.5, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the max_d is max(0, 0) and the gap between them is l, divided by 2. So the answer is l/2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead n and l. Then the list of a_i.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, the first case is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — so the first line is n and l, the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo in Python, the code can read the first line as input().split(), then the second line as input().split().\n\nBut when reading from stdin, perhaps using input().split() for each line.\n\nBut in some cases, perhaps the input is given with multiple lines. So for example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n and l, then the next line being the a_i. So for each test case, perhaps the code is supposed to process one case. Wait, but looking at the sample input, the first input line is for the first test case, then the second line is the a_i. Then the third line is for the second test case, then the fourth line is the a_i. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line containing n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So the code is to read one test case. But looking at the sample input, the first input line is for the first test case, then the second line is the a_i, then the third line is for the second test case, then the fourth line is the a_i. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So perhaps the code is to process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, no, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains two integers n and l. The next line contains n integers ai. So the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich seems to be two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the code is supposed to read one test case. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. But the user's code is supposed to read from standard input. So perhaps the code is written for a single test case. Therefore, in the code, we need to read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is two lines, then another two lines. But perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code would read the first line, then the second line, process, and output the answer. So for the sample input, perhaps the code is run once for each test case. But in programming competition problems, the code is supposed to process exactly one test case. Therefore, the sample input given is perhaps showing two test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. So the code is written for a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code will read n and l, then the list of a_i.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n, l. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen proceed as per the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if n is 1?\n\nFor example, n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then the initial max_d is max(3, 5-3) = max(3, 2) =3. Then there are no consecutive pairs, so the loop doesn't run. So the answer is 3, which is correct. Because the lantern is at 3, so the radius needs to be 3 to cover 0, and 2 to cover 5. So the maximum is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 0) =0. The gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0, 3]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 5-3=2). Then the gap between 0 and 3 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d is 2. So the answer is 2.0. Which is correct. Because the first lantern covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. So for d=2, the first lantern covers from -2 (but the street starts at 0) to 2. The second lantern is at 3, covers from 1 to 5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nFirst case:\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max_d.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the answer is 2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, for the output formatting, the problem says that the answer must be printed with enough decimal digits. The sample outputs show 10 decimal digits. So in Python, using the format string with .10f.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds the number. But the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-9. So using 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut for example, if the correct answer is 2.5, then printing 2.5000000000 is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut need to make sure that the code reads the input correctly. For example, in the case where the input is given with multiple lines. For example, the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut what if the input has leading or trailing spaces? Well, the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have more than one space between numbers, but split() handles that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and l, then read a list, sort it, compute the max_d as described, then print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, n is at least 1, so a has at least one element.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the case where n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. So the answer is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[0]. Then max_d is max(0, 5-0=5) → 5. So answer is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. The gaps between 0-5 is 5 → 2.5, between 5-10 is 5 → 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of given length. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial Maximum Distance**: Determine the maximum distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n3. **Evaluate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the radius required to cover the midpoint of this gap. This is done by dividing the gap by 2.\n4. **Determine the Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value obtained from the initial distances and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Distances**: The initial maximum distance is determined by checking the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we calculate the gap between each pair of consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover the midpoint of each gap is half the gap's width.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value between the initial distances and the calculated midpoints of the gaps, ensuring that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimum radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required radius with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it suitable for the given constraints.",
