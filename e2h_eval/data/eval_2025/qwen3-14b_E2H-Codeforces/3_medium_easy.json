Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about the approach. The key idea is probably to sort the lantern positions and then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Because the maximum gap between two adjacent lanterns will determine the required d. But wait, there's also the beginning and the end of the street to consider. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate for d. Similarly, if the last lantern isn't at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is another candidate. \n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. That's one candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and the end of the street (l). That's another candidate.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these divided by 2 (since the coverage area of each lantern would cover half the gap between them) would be another candidate. Because if two lanterns are spaced by s, then the minimal d needed to cover the gap is s/2. Because each lantern can cover up to d, so the middle point between them would require d = s/2. \n5. The overall answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say two lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The distance between them is b - a. The maximum distance between any two points in this interval that are not covered by either lantern would be the midpoint between a and b. Because the lanterns can cover up to d from their positions. So if d is (b - a)/2, then the entire interval between a and b is covered. Because the first lantern covers up to a + d, and the second covers from b - d. If d is (b -a)/2, then a + d = a + (b-a)/2 = (a + b)/2. Similarly, b - d is (a + b)/2. So the entire gap between a and b is covered. \n\nBut if the gap between two consecutive lanterns is larger than twice the current d, then there's a part not covered. So the minimal d needed for that gap is (gap)/2. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nSort the lantern positions. Then:\n\n- Compute initial max_d as the maximum between (first lantern's position - 0) and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them, divide by 2, and compare with current max_d. Take the maximum.\n\nSo the answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then the lantern is at some position a. Then the distance from 0 to a is a, and from a to l is l -a. The maximum of those two is the required d. Because the lantern's coverage must reach both ends.\n\nYes. So that case is covered by the initial step.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck the first lantern is at 0, so the distance from 0 is 0. The last lantern is at 15, which is the end. So the distance from the last lantern to l (15) is 0. \n\nThen check consecutive gaps:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: 3-0=3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. Current max is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: 2. /2 = 1.0. Max remains 1.5.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: 2/2=1.0. Same.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: 2/2=1.0.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: 5.0. Divided by 2 is 2.5. Now max is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: 1/2=0.5. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5 with lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted: [2,5]. \n\nFirst, check the initial distances. First lantern is at 2, so distance from 0 is 2. Last lantern is at 5, distance from l (5) is 0. Then check the gap between 2 and 5: 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nIn Python, read n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through consecutive pairs in the sorted list, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare with max_d.\n\nBut wait, the initial max_d could be the maximum between the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern) and the last part (distance from last lantern to l). Then, for the gaps between lanterns, we compute (current gap)/2 and compare with the current max_d.\n\nSo the code would look something like:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif sorted_a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = sorted_a[0]\n\nelse:\n\n    max_d = 0.0 ?\n\nWait no. The initial max_d is the maximum between (sorted_a[0] - 0) and (l - sorted_a[-1]). So:\n\nmax_d = max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nWait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 0. But if the first lantern is at 3, then the distance is 3. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo, initial max_d is the maximum between the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0 = a[0]) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d:\n\n    max_d = current\n\nSo after checking all gaps, the max_d is the answer.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if there are zero lanterns? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the gap, divide by 2, compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street? For example, if there's a gap between two lanterns that is larger than 2*d. But the code is considering the maximum of all the gaps divided by 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nNow, handling the input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — so the first line is n and l, then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nIn Python, the code would read from stdin. So:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines. For example, in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, but that's perhaps the way the user presented the input. But in reality, the input is given as two lines. For example, for the first test case, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut then, sometimes, when there are multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and l. The second line has the n integers ai.\n\nSo for each test case, the code reads two lines. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. Wait, the sample input shows two examples. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first example. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the input is for a single test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's part of the example. But the actual code needs to process a single test case. Because the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc.\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. So in the code, read the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nNow, code:\n\nOnce the list is sorted, compute the initial max_d.\n\nBut for the case when n is 1, then the code would compute max between a[0] and l - a[0], which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nfor i in range(1, len(sorted_a)):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but for example, in the second sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. sorted_a is [2,5]. initial max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then check the gap between 5-2=3 → 3/2=1.5. So max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and 5, l=5. Then initial max_d is max(0, 5-5=0) → 0. Then the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max_d is 2.5. Which is correct because the middle of the street is at 2.5, which is 2.5 away from both ends.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Which is correct because the lantern is at 5, so the radius needs to be 5 to reach both ends.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then check gaps between 0 and 5 (gap 5 → 2.5), between 5 and 10 (gap 5 → 2.5). So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the lanterns are at 0, 3, 10. l=10. Then initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then between 0 and 3: 3/2=1.5. Between 3 and 10: 7/2=3.5. So the max_d is 3.5. Which would be the correct answer. Because the area between 3 and 10 is covered with d=3.5. The lantern at 3 covers up to 3+3.5=6.5, and the lantern at 10 covers down to 10-3.5=6.5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output formatting. The problem says that the answer must be printed with enough decimal digits, such that the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9. So using 10 decimal digits is sufficient. So in Python, format it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, for example, 2.5, it would show as 2.5000000000. So the code uses the format string with 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d.\n\nLoop through consecutive elements and check gaps.\n\nFinally, print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if n is zero? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 7 15, and the list [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The initial max_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then check the gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5. max_d becomes 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d becomes 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5. No change.\n\nSo output is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nSample input 2: 2 5, [2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. initial max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap between 5-2=3 → 1.5. So max_d remains 2. Output is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. So output 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. max_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then gaps are 5 and 5. Each divided by 2 is 2.5. So output 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. The gap between 0 and 10 is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. The initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then the gaps are 3-0=3 (1.5) and 10-3=7 (3.5). So max_d is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where the lanterns are all at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,0]. Then the initial max is max(0, 5-0=5) → 5. Then the gaps between the lanterns are zero, so no change. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at the ends. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the max_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then the gap is 10, divided by 2 → 5. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case where the maximum gap is between the first lantern and the start. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[3, 5]. Then initial max is max(3, 10-5=5). So 5. Then the gap between 3 and 5 is 2 → 1. So the max is 5. So output is 5.0. Which is correct, because the lanterns cover from 3-d to 3+d and 5-d to 5+d. The first lantern's coverage starts at 3-d. To cover the start of the street (0), 3-d <= 0 → d >=3. But the initial max is 5 (from the end). So the required d is 5. Which would cover from 3-5=-2 (so 0 is covered) and 5+5=10. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can illuminate a distance `d` from its position. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Distance Check**: Calculate the initial maximum radius required to cover the start and end of the street from the nearest lanterns.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the radius needed to cover this gap. The radius required for each gap is half the gap size since each lantern can cover up to `d` distance from its position.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The final answer is the maximum value obtained from the initial distance check and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Distance Calculation**: The initial maximum radius is determined by considering the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted positions of the lanterns, we compute the gap between each consecutive pair of lanterns. The radius required to cover each gap is half the size of the gap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value from the initial distance check and the gap analysis is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure the required accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimum possible radius, considering both the gaps between lanterns and their distances from the ends of the street.",
