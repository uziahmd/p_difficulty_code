Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings (guest and host), concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in this concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string (the pile).\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from the collections module. Because Counter can count the frequency of each character in a string.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Combine the first two into one string.\n3. Create a Counter for the combined string and a Counter for the third string.\n4. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but how about the order? Because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same counts for all characters, then it's a match.\n\nYes, that's right. So for example, if the combined guest and host has SANTA... etc., and the pile has exactly those letters, then it's a yes.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length. Then the Counters can't be equal, but checking the Counter equality would automatically take care of that. Because if the total number of characters is different, the Counters can't be the same. So that's handled.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, host: DEDMOROZ. Combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's check the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code would handle that.\n\nAnother sample: second input is guest PAPAINOEL, host JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see: the combined has letters, but the pile has an extra L? Let me count.\n\nOriginal guest and host: Let's count letters.\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts: adding all together.\n\nThen the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's count letters here. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare the counts.\n\nIn the sample, the output is NO because there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would catch that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read three lines from input. But how are the inputs given? The problem says that the input is three lines. So in Python, we can read them via input() function three times. However, sometimes when there are multiple test cases, but according to the example, the input is three lines for each test case. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three elements, but the actual input is three lines. Wait, the example shows that the input is three lines. For example, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent the three lines. So in reality, the input is three lines. So for each test case, the code reads three lines.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code needs to read three lines. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate test cases. Like, the first input line is the first test case's three lines, then the second test case's three lines, etc. Wait, no. Wait the sample input is written as a list of three elements, but perhaps that's a formatting mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that the input file consists of three lines. So each test case is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. For example, the sample input shows three different test cases, each with three lines. So the actual input is three lines per test case. But how does that work? For example, the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. But the user is supposed to process each test case, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample output is ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].\n\nSo each of these three entries is a separate test case, each consisting of three lines. So the actual input is three lines per test case. But how many test cases are there? The problem says that the input is three lines. But perhaps the sample shows multiple test cases, but the actual program must process a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So the program is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample shows three test cases. So maybe the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. But how does that work?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input file consists of three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the actual code should read three lines, process them, and output the answer. But the sample input shows that there are three test cases, which would imply that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines once, and process them once.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So for example, in the first sample input, the three lines are:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is one test case, and the output is YES.\n\nBut the sample shows that there are three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each with three lines. But how does that fit with the problem's input description?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's input is three lines, but the sample shows multiple test cases. So the problem may have multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process each test case. However, the problem's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample shows three test cases. That's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. So the code must read three lines from the input. For example, the first line is guest's name, second host's name, third the pile. Then output YES or NO.\n\nBut the sample shows three test cases, which implies that the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements in the list is a separate test case. So for example, the first test case is the first three lines, the second test case is the next three lines, etc. But how does that work in practice?\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of three elements. But in reality, the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. But how can that be? For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen the second test case's input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nAnd third test case's input is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. But how does that fit with the problem's input description? The problem says that the input file consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is given in a way that each test case is three lines, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three answers. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which suggests that the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nThis is a contradiction. But perhaps the problem's sample input is presented in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but the actual input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But then why does the sample input have three test cases?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is three lines, but the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's note:\n\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left. In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\". In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nSo the sample input has three test cases, each with three lines. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. Which would imply that the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample shows three test cases. How to resolve this?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's input description is incorrect. Or perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. So for example, the actual input is three lines, but the sample shows three test cases. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where each test case is processed in a loop. But the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines, which would be one test case. However, the sample shows that there are three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is three lines for each test case, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement isn't clear on that. But looking at the sample input and output, the sample input has three test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can that be? For example, how many test cases are there? How does the code know when to stop reading?\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first element is the first test case's three lines, the second element is the second test case's three lines, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines per test case, and process each test case. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is three lines. For example, the first test case's input is three lines, and the code is supposed to process one test case. Then the sample input is presented as three lines, but in the sample input, the three test cases are presented as three separate entries.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, the output is a list of three answers. So the code must process three test cases. Therefore, the code must read three test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, how to read multiple test cases. Well, perhaps the code is supposed to read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but each test case is three lines. So the actual code should process each test case by reading three lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, if the code is supposed to read from standard input, then for each test case, read three lines. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines once, and process one test case. But the sample shows three test cases.\n\nThis is a problem. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as three test cases, and the output is three answers. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it says that the input file consists of three lines. Which would mean that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem's input description is incorrect, and the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that the three elements are three test cases, but each test case is three lines. So for example, the first test case is the first line of the input, which is the guest's name, the second line is the host's name, and the third line is the pile. Then the next test case is the fourth line, fifth line, sixth line, etc. But in the sample input, the first element is three lines, then the second element is three lines, etc. So the code would read all lines, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nWell, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines, and process one test case. However, the sample shows three test cases. But in that case, the sample input would have nine lines. So perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each of the three test cases is represented as a single line in the input, but that's not possible since each test case has three lines.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking at the problem's example:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWhich is three elements. Each element represents three lines. So for example, the first element is three lines (split by \\n). So the actual input is three lines for each test case. So the code must process three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut how to read them in Python. Well, perhaps the code is supposed to read all the input lines, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut then, for each group of three lines, process them as a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. So this suggests that there is only one test case. But the sample shows three test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but each test case is three lines. So the actual input for the code is three lines, but the sample shows three test cases. However, this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but each test case is three lines. So the code should read three lines per test case, and process them. But how many test cases are there?\n\nWell, the problem says that the input is three lines.

So the sample input is three lines, but the sample shows three test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample output, the output is three answers. So the code must process three test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nPerhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where each test case is given as three lines, and the code must read all test cases until the end of input. So, for example, the code reads all lines, and processes them in groups of three.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines, then for each group of three lines, process them as a test case.\n\nSo for example, if there are three test cases, then there are nine lines in total.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nSo, the code would read all lines from stdin, then iterate over them in chunks of three.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n    guest = lines[i]\n    host = lines[i+1]\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n    # process and print\n\nBut this assumes that the number of lines is a multiple of three. However, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case, but the sample shows three test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the problem expects that the code processes multiple test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, the code can read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as three test cases, but the actual input is one test case. However, the sample shows that the code must output three answers. Therefore, the code must process three test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines, it's possible that the sample input is presented in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but in reality, the input is three lines for each test case. So the code must read three lines for each test case.\n\nBut how to read that in practice? For example, in the programming competition, the code would read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines, process them, and output the answer. However, the sample shows three test cases, which would require that the code reads three lines three times. But that's not possible unless the input has nine lines.\n\nThis is very confusing, but perhaps the problem's sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual input is three lines for each test case, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but each test case is three lines. But the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. But that would not explain the sample output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is three lines, and the sample input shows three test cases, but each test case is three lines. But the code is supposed to process one test case. But then the sample output would have one answer, not three.\n\nI think that perhaps the problem's sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that doesn't make sense with the sample output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is wrong. For example, in programming competitions, it's common to have multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nAssuming that, then the code would read all lines, group them into three-line chunks, and process each chunk.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, there are three test cases, each with three lines. So the code would read all lines, and for each group of three lines, process them.\n\nBut how to read them in Python. Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nNow, considering that, the code will be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each group of three lines:\n\nguest = line 0 of group\n\nhost = line 1 of group\n\npile = line 2 of group\n\nCheck if the combined guest and host letters match the pile.\n\nPrint YES or NO accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the input. For example, if the input is given as three lines, then the code would process one test case. If the input is nine lines, then three test cases.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. Which would imply that there is only one test case. However, the sample shows three test cases, which suggests that there are three test cases. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. So the code will read all lines, split into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nLet me proceed with that.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImport necessary modules: sys and collections.Counter.\n\nRead all lines from stdin, stripping any trailing newlines.\n\nThen, for each group of three lines:\n\nguest = lines[i]\n\nhost = lines[i+1]\n\npile = lines[i+2]\n\nThen, check if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile).\n\nIf yes, print YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the Counter is case-sensitive. But the problem says that all lines contain uppercase Latin letters, so no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? For example, if there are 4 lines, then the code would crash on i+2. But according to the problem statement, the input consists of three lines. So for a single test case, the code works. But for multiple test cases, it depends on the input.\n\nBut given the sample input, the code would process three test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the code reads three lines once. So for example, in the first sample input, the code reads three lines, and processes them once.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, which would require that the code reads nine lines. However, the sample output is three answers.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem's input is three lines, but the sample input is written as three test cases, each with three lines. Therefore, the code should process three test cases, but the actual input is three lines. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the three elements are three test cases, but each test case is three lines. But the actual input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual input is one test case. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but each test case is three lines. So the code should process three test cases, each with three lines. Therefore, the code should read three lines per test case.\n\nBut how to read that in practice. For example, if the code is run with three lines, it would process one test case. If run with nine lines, three test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input has three test cases, which would be nine lines.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But this is not making sense.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look back at the original problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo, the input is three lines. So the code must process one test case. So the sample input must be three lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But that's probably because the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. So for example, the first test case is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThe second test case is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nThe third test case is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the sample input is three test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So the code must read three lines for each test case. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle this in practice? For example, if the code is run with three lines, it processes one test case. If run with six lines, two test cases, etc.\n\nTherefore, the code should be written to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that each of the three elements is a test case, but the actual input is three lines. But this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is three lines, and the sample input is three test cases, but that's a mistake in the problem statement. However, the sample output shows three answers, so the code must process three test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nSo I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code reads all lines from stdin, and processes them in groups of three.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ'\n\npile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined guest + host is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'.\n\nLet's count the letters.\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nS: 1 (from guest) + 0 (host) = 1?\n\nWait guest is SANTACLAUS:\n\nLetters are S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S → S appears twice, A appears three times, etc.\n\nHost is DEDMOROZ → D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z → D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined letters: guest + host.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's break it down:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nCounting:\n\nS: 2 (positions 0 and 17)\n\nA: 3 (positions 1, 4, 15)\n\nN: 1\n\nT: 1\n\nM: 1\n\nO: 2 (positions 6, 8)\n\nR: 1\n\nZ: 1\n\nD: 2 (positions 10, 11)\n\nE: 1\n\nC: 1\n\nL: 1\n\nU: 1\n\nSo the combined guest + host letters should be the same as the pile.\n\nIn the guest + host:\n\nguest is SANTACLAUS → letters:\n\nS: 2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nHost is DEDMOROZ → D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nS: 2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nThe pile has:\n\nS:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nYes, same counts. So the code would return YES.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL → letters P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nhost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP:2+1=3? Wait guest's P is 2, host's P is 1. So total P:3.\n\nA:2.\n\nI:1+1=2.\n\nN:1.\n\nO:1+1=2.\n\nE:1.\n\nL:1+1=2.\n\nJ:1.\n\nU:3.\n\nK:2.\n\nPlus others.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters.\n\nLet me count:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nLet me count:\n\nJ:1\n\nO: 2 (positions 1 and 8)\n\nU: 3 (positions 2, 13, 14?)\n\nWait, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo counts:\n\nJ:1\n\nO:2\n\nU:3\n\nL:3\n\nN:1\n\nA:2\n\nP:2\n\nI:2\n\nE:1\n\nK:2.\n\nSo comparing with combined guest and host:\n\nCombined guest and host:\n\nguest has P:2, host has P:1 → total 3.\n\nBut in the pile, P is 2. So this is a discrepancy. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code would return NO for the second test case.\n\nThird test case:\n\nguest: BABBONATALE → letters B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E → counts B:3, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1.\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S → counts F:1, A:2, T:2, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nB:3, A:3+2=5, O:1, N:1, T:2, L:1, E:1+1=2, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1.\n\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me count the letters.\n\nBut the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nB, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R.\n\nCounting:\n\nB:3 (positions 0, 2, 12)\n\nA: let's see: positions 1, 10, 15, 16, 23 → 5?\n\nWait:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\nB: 0, 2, 12 → 3\n\nA: 1, 10, 15, 16, 23 → 5?\n\nWait:\n\nLooking at the pile:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nSo A appears at positions 1, 10, 15, 16, 23 → 5 times?\n\nYes.\n\nOther counts:\n\nC:1.\n\nH: positions 4, 24 → 2?\n\nR: positions 5, 26 → 2?\n\nI: 1.\n\nS: positions 7, 11 → 2.\n\nT: positions 8, 17, 25 → 3?\n\nM: 9.\n\nO:1.\n\nN:1.\n\nL: positions 18, 19 → 2.\n\nE: positions 20, 25 → 2?\n\nWait, position 20 is E, position 25 is E?\n\nWait the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nLet me count each character:\n\nB: 3\n\nA: let's count:\n\nA appears in positions 1, 10, 15, 16, 23 → 5 times.\n\nC:1\n\nH: positions 4, 24 → 2 times.\n\nR: positions 5, 26 → 2 times.\n\nI: 1.\n\nS: positions 7, 11 → 2 times.\n\nT: positions 8, 17, 25 → 3 times.\n\nM: 9.\n\nO: position 13 → 1.\n\nN: position 14 → 1.\n\nL: positions 18, 19 → 2.\n\nE: positions 20, 26? Wait, the last part is FATHER → F A T H E R.\n\nSo after the E in position 20, the rest is F, A, T, H, E, R. So E is at position 20 and 26.\n\nSo E: 2 times.\n\nF: positions 21, 24? Wait:\n\nAfter the E at position 20, the next is F at position 21, then A at 22, T at 23, H at 24, E at 25, R at 26.\n\nSo F: 1, A: 22, T:23, H:24, E:25, R:26.\n\nSo E is at 20 and 25 → 2 times.\n\nSo the pile has:\n\nB:3\n\nA:5\n\nC:1\n\nH:2\n\nR:2\n\nI:1\n\nS:2\n\nT:3\n\nM:1\n\nO:1\n\nN:1\n\nL:2\n\nE:2\n\nF:1.\n\nNow, the combined guest and host counts:\n\nGuest: BABBONATALE → B:3, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1.\n\nHost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F:1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all lines from the input.\n2. **Grouping Input**: Process each group of three lines as a separate test case. Each test case consists of the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in the combined string of the guest and host names, and compare it with the frequency of characters in the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: If the character counts match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Processing Test Cases**: The input lines are processed in groups of three, where each group represents a single test case.\n- **Character Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names (guest + host) and the pile. If these counts match, the answer is \"YES\", indicating that the pile can be rearranged to form the names; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the presence of exactly the required characters in the pile, leveraging the properties of hash maps (Counters) for quick lookups and comparisons. The time complexity for each test case is O(n), where n is the total length of the guest and host names combined, making the solution efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
