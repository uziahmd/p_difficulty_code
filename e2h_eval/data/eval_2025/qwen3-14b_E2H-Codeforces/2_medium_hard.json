Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements in both diagonals must be the same. Also, the non-diagonal elements must all be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this character 'o'.\n3. Ensure that 'd' is not equal to 'o'.\n\nBut how do I check these?\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, determine if it's on either diagonal. If it is, check that it's equal to the diagonal character. If not, check that it's equal to the non-diagonal character.\n\nBut how do I find the diagonal characters?\n\nWait, the diagonals might have different characters? No, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all elements on both diagonals must be the same. So first, collect all elements from both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nBut for example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal has positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal has (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Wait, (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the elements of both diagonals, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking, all elements in both diagonals must be same. So for example, in the case of 3x3, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, the diagonals' elements are the union of the two diagonals. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, but overlapping cells are counted once.\n\nWait, but for the problem statement, the first condition is that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So that implies that all elements on the main diagonal are same, all elements on the anti-diagonal are same, and also that the elements on both diagonals are same. Because for example, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So if the main diagonal has all 'a's and the anti-diagonal has all 'a's, then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's, that's invalid. So the first step is to check that all elements on the main diagonal are same, all elements on the anti-diagonal are same, and that the two are same as each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that all elements on both diagonals are same. So the entire set of elements on either diagonal must be the same. So for example, if the main diagonal is all 'a's and the anti-diagonal is all 'a's, that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's, that's invalid.\n\nSo the first thing is to collect all elements that are on either of the two diagonals. Then check that they are all the same.\n\nBut how to collect them? For each cell (i,j), check if i == j (main diagonal) or i + j == n-1 (anti-diagonal). So for each cell in the grid, if it's on either diagonal, then it's part of the diagonals.\n\nOnce we collect all those cells, they must all have the same character. Let's call that 'd'.\n\nThen, all other cells (those not on either diagonal) must have the same character, say 'o', and 'o' != 'd'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through all cells in the grid.\n\n- For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, check that it's equal to 'd'. If not, check that it's equal to 'o'.\n\nBut how to get 'd' and 'o'?\n\nFirst, we can collect all the diagonal elements and check that they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal elements and check they are all same and different from 'd'.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of steps:\n\nStep 1: Check all diagonal elements are same.\n\nCollect all elements on diagonals. Let's take the first element of the main diagonal (i=0, j=0) as the reference. Then check that all elements on the diagonals are same as this.\n\nBut what if the first element is not part of the anti-diagonal? For example, in n=3, the first element (0,0) is on main diagonal. The anti-diagonal starts at (0,2). So for the first element, it's part of the main diagonal. So for the first element, maybe we can take the first element of the main diagonal and check that all elements on the diagonals are same as that.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to collect all the elements on the diagonals, and check that they are all the same. For example, collect all elements in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, but ensuring that each cell is considered once. For example, in the case of the center cell (for odd n), which is part of both diagonals, it's counted once.\n\nBut how to collect them? For each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. So for each cell in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nSo for the first part, collect all the elements that are on the diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same.\n\nOnce that is done, collect all elements not on the diagonals. Check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read n and the grid.\n\n2. For each cell (i,j):\n\n   a. Check if it's on a diagonal.\n\n   b. Collect all the diagonal elements into a set. If the size of the set is more than 1, then it's invalid.\n\n   c. Similarly for the non-diagonal elements.\n\nWait, but perhaps the diagonal elements can be checked by checking that all of them are equal to the first diagonal element.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, for the first diagonal element (0,0), let's say it's 'x'. Then all other diagonal elements must be 'x'.\n\nSo, for the first part, collect all the elements on the diagonals. Let's take the first element (0,0) as the target. Then check that all other elements on the diagonals are same as this.\n\nBut what if the first element is not part of the anti-diagonal? Like, for n=5, (0,0) is part of the main diagonal, but not the anti-diagonal. So, the first element is part of the main diagonal. So, the first element is in the diagonals. So, for the first element, we can take it as the reference.\n\nBut what if the first element is not part of the diagonals? No, for n >=3, (0,0) is part of the main diagonal. So for any n, the first element is part of the main diagonal.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck for the diagonals:\n\n- Get the first diagonal element (0,0). Let's call it d_char.\n\n- For every cell (i,j) that is on either diagonal, check that grid[i][j] == d_char.\n\nIf any of them is not, return NO.\n\nThen, check the non-diagonal elements:\n\n- Get the first non-diagonal element. For example, (0,1) in a 3x3 grid. Let's check if it's not on a diagonal. For (0,1), i=0, j=1. i != j, and i + j = 1, which for n=3, n-1 is 2. So 0+1=1 != 2. So it's not on a diagonal. So, take this as the reference o_char.\n\nThen, check that all non-diagonal elements are equal to o_char.\n\nAlso, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are 9 cells. The diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 elements (since the center is counted once). So non-diagonal elements are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck for all cells:\n\nIf it's on a diagonal, check equals d_char.\n\nElse, check equals o_char.\n\nBut how to get o_char? Well, we can take the first non-diagonal cell. However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is >=3. So no problem.\n\nBut for example, in a 3x3 grid, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1). Let's check that.\n\nBut what if that cell is not present? No, because for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut how do we find the first non-diagonal cell? Well, perhaps iterate through the grid in order, and find the first cell that is not on a diagonal. Then take that as o_char. Then check all other non-diagonal cells against that.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So that's not possible.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nCheck that all elements on the diagonals are same as d_char.\n\nCheck non-diagonals:\n\nCheck that all elements not on the diagonals are same as o_char, and o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen:\n\nCheck for diagonals.\n\nFirst, get d_char. Let's take grid[0][0].\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n      if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n          if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n              return NO\n\nThen, check the non-diagonal elements.\n\nBut how to get o_char? Let's find the first cell that is not on a diagonal, and take its value as o_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is >=3. So no.\n\nSo, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the first cell that is not on a diagonal is (0,1). Let's check that.\n\nOnce we have o_char, then check for all cells not on the diagonals whether their value is o_char.\n\nBut also, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nWe can loop through the grid in row-major order (row by row, left to right) and find the first cell that is not on a diagonal.\n\nOnce found, take that as o_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the first cell (0,0) is on diagonal. (0,1) is not. So that's the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nOnce o_char is determined, check for all non-diagonal cells that they are equal to o_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut what if the grid is such that all cells are on the diagonals? That's not possible for n >=3. For example, for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 3 + 3 -1 = 5. So 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, proceed to check non-diagonal.\n\nFind the first cell not on a diagonal. If there are none, then it's impossible (but n is >=3). So proceed.\n\nOnce o_char is found, check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to o_char. Also, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nLoop through each row, then each column. For each cell (i,j), check if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1). If not, then that's the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nOnce found, take o_char = grid[i][j].\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? For example, n=1. But since n is >=3, that's not possible.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nBut what if the first non-diagonal cell is not present? For example, for n=3, but all cells are on diagonals? Well, that's impossible. Because for n=3, there are 5 diagonal cells, and 4 non-diagonal.\n\nSo, code:\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, then:\n\nfound = False\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        break\n\nif not found:\n\n    # this is impossible, but for code's sake, perhaps return NO?\n\nBut for n >=3, this can't happen. So proceed.\n\nThen, check for all cells not on the diagonals that their value is o_char.\n\nBut also, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce o_char is found, then:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nAlso, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char? Then o_char would be same as d_char, which is invalid.\n\nSo, after checking all non-diagonal cells, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, suppose all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char. Then o_char is same as d_char, which is invalid.\n\nSo, after collecting o_char, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the code would have passed the check for non-diagonal cells (since they are same as o_char, which is same as d_char), but then the condition that the non-diagonal is different from the diagonal is violated.\n\nSo, the code must check that o_char != d_char.\n\nSo, after checking all non-diagonal cells are same as o_char, check that o_char is different from d_char.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck that all diagonal elements are same as grid[0][0].\n\nIf any fails, print NO.\n\nElse:\n\n   find the first non-diagonal cell, get o_char.\n\n   check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to o_char.\n\n   check that o_char != d_char.\n\nIf all pass, print YES. Else, NO.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think of code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check diagonals\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal elements\n\n# Find first non-diagonal cell\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\n# Now check all non-diagonal cells are o_char and o_char != d_char\n\nif o_char is None:\n\n    # impossible, but for code's sake, perhaps print NO?\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check all non-diagonal cells\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                continue\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\n    # check o_char != d_char\n\n    if o_char == d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in the case where all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char, then o_char is same as d_char. So the code would check that and print NO.\n\nBut what about the case where there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3, so that's not possible.\n\nBut what if n=3, and all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char? Then the code would check that o_char is same as d_char, and print NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the non-diagonal cells are all same, but same as d_char?\n\nLike, for example, the grid is all same letters. Then, the diagonals are same (all same), and non-diagonal are same (same as d_char). So the code would check o_char == d_char and print NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut what about the sample input?\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe first line is 'xooox'.\n\nSo grid[0][0] is 'x'.\n\nCheck the diagonals. For example, grid[0][0] is 'x', grid[0][4] is 'x' (since i + j = 0+4=4, n-1=4 for n=5. So yes, part of anti-diagonal. Then grid[1][1] is 'o'? Wait, the second line is 'oxoxo' — indexes 0-4. So for i=1, j=1, it's 'o'. But according to the first check, the diagonals must be all 'x's. So this would fail, hence output NO. Which matches the first sample's output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. Anti-diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So all diagonals are 'w'.\n\nThen, non-diagonal elements. Let's find first non-diagonal cell. For (0,0) is diagonal. (0,1) is not. So o_char is grid[0][1] = 's'.\n\nCheck all non-diagonal cells. The non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nCheck their values:\n\n(0,1) is 's'\n\n(1,0) is 's'\n\n(1,2) is 's'\n\n(2,1) is 's'.\n\nSo all are 's', which is different from 'w'. So output YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So here, the third element is e, which is different from x. So during the first check, when i=2, j=2, grid[i][j] is e != d_char (x). So code returns NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nBut what about cases where the non-diagonal elements are all same, but same as the diagonal?\n\nFor example, n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, the diagonals are all a. The non-diagonal elements are all a. So o_char is a. Then o_char == d_char, so code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\nxxx\n\nxax\n\nxxx\n\nHere, diagonals are x. The non-diagonal elements are a, and others. Let's see:\n\nThe non-diagonal elements are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Those are a, x, x, x? Wait:\n\nRow 0 is 'xxx' — so (0,1) is x. So the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is x. So o_char is x. Then check all non-diagonal cells. Are they all x? For the given example, yes. Then o_char is same as d_char (x), so code returns NO. Which is correct because the non-diagonal elements must be different from the diagonals.\n\nAnother test case where it's correct: n=3, grid:\n\nxxx\n\nxax\n\nxxx\n\nBut the non-diagonal elements are x. So code returns NO.\n\nBut if the non-diagonal elements are all 'y' and diagonals are x, then it's correct.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, think about code structure. In Python, the exit() function may not be the best way. But in code, perhaps using sys.exit() or returning early.\n\nBut in code, the code should read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use sys.exit(), but perhaps using flags.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps using a function.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck for diagonals.\n\nIf any of the diagonal elements are not equal to d_char, print NO and exit.\n\nElse, find the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nIf no non-diagonal cell (but n is >=3, so no), then print NO.\n\nElse, check all non-diagonal cells are equal to o_char, and o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut in code, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in the code, for the first check:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function is not in the standard namespace. So perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal elements\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nif o_char is None:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            continue\n\n        if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            sys.exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, for the code, in the first part, the code checks all cells on the diagonals. But for the grid, each row is a string. So grid[i][j] is correct.\n\nBut what about when the code reads the input? For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', but in the code, when reading the input, the first line is read as n, then the next n lines are read. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the input is read as per the standard input. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b'.\n\nSample input:\n\n3\n\naab\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nRow 0: a a b\n\nRow 1: a b a\n\nRow 2: b a a\n\nThe diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=a, (1,1)=b, (2,2)=a. So during the first check, (1,1) is b, which is not equal to d_char (a). So code returns NO.\n\nBut if the diagonals are all a.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are:\n\n(0,0)=a, (1,1)=b, (2,2)=a. So the first check would fail.\n\nAnother example where diagonals are all same. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, the code proceeds to check non-diagonal elements. The first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is a. Then check all non-diagonal cells (they are all a). Then check o_char (a) == d_char (a). So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b'.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 0: a b a\n\nRow 1: b a b\n\nRow 2: a b a\n\nThen, the diagonals are a, a, a (main) and a, a, a (anti). So code passes first check. Then non-diagonal cells are (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=b, (2,1)=b. o_char is b. Then check o_char != a. So code returns YES.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, all non-diagonal cells are same, but one of them is different.\n\nFor example, the first non-diagonal cell is 'b', but another is 'c'. Then code will detect during the check.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the first non-diagonal cell is not the same as others?\n\nLike, for example, in a 3x3 grid:\n\nDiagonals are 'a's. The first non-diagonal cell is 'b', but another is 'c'.\n\nThen, during the check, the code would find that and return NO.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the code's efficiency. Since n can be up to 299, which is manageable. The code loops through the grid multiple times, but for O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for n=300 (about 90,000 operations).\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all letters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all elements on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure that all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    grid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    d_char = grid[0][0]\n    \n    # Check all diagonal elements are the same as d_char\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n    \n    # Find the first non-diagonal character\n    o_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                o_char = grid[i][j]\n                break\n        if o_char is not None:\n            break\n    \n    if o_char is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    # Check all non-diagonal elements are the same as o_char\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n    \n    # Check o_char is different from d_char\n    if o_char == d_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, starting with the size of the grid `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The first character of the grid (top-left corner) is taken as the reference character for the diagonals. We iterate through all cells to ensure that every cell on either diagonal matches this reference character.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After confirming the diagonals, we find the first non-diagonal character to use as the reference for the non-diagonal elements. We then check all non-diagonal cells to ensure they match this reference character.\n4. **Final Check**: Ensure that the non-diagonal reference character is different from the diagonal reference character. If all checks pass, the grid forms the letter 'X', otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using straightforward iteration and comparison, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
