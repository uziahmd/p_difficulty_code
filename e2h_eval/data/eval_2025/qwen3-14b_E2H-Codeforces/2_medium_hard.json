Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is n lines, each with n characters. n is an odd number. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 5x5 grid.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nStep 1: Check all the cells on the two diagonals. All of them must be the same. Wait, but the two diagonals might have different letters? No, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. Wait, the first condition says that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if one diagonal is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first, collect all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Also, check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nFor a square grid of size n x n, the main diagonal is cells where row == column. The anti-diagonal is where row + column == n - 1. Because for 0-based indices, the sum would be n-1 for the anti-diagonal. For example, in a 3x3 grid, positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) sum to 2 (since n-1 is 2).\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n\n- Collect all the non-diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the non-diagonal cells are empty. Wait, no, the problem says that all squares have some letter. So the input is such that every cell has a letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck for all cells in the diagonals:\n\n- Are all of them the same? If not, return NO.\n\nThen check for all non-diagonal cells:\n\n- Are all of them the same? If not, return NO.\n\nAlso, check that the non-diagonal character is different from the diagonal character.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n    for j in 0..n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1: return NO\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1: return NO\n\nif diagonal_chars.pop() == non_diagonal_chars.pop(): return NO\n\nElse return YES.\n\nWait, but what if there are no non-diagonal cells? For example, when n=1? But the constraints say n is at least 3. So for n=3, the diagonals are 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So total of 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells. The non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4 cells. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4 cells. So in that case, the code would check that all those 4 are same.\n\nBut what about when n is 1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the non-diagonal cells are zero. Well, no, because for n >=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is n^2 - (2n -1). For example, n=3: 9-5=4. For n=5: 25 - 9=16. So yes, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input:\n\nFirst example input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe diagonals are the main diagonal (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)) and the anti-diagonal (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nLooking at the first line: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nSecond line: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nThird line: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. (2,2) is part of both diagonals.\n\nFourth line: o x o x o → (3,1) is x, (3,3) is x.\n\nFifth line: x o o o x → (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nSo all the diagonal cells are x, except for (2,2)? Wait no, third line is 'soxoo'. So (2,2) is x. So all diagonals are x. Then the non-diagonal cells. Let's check some of them.\n\nFor example, (0,1) is o. (0,2) is o. (0,3) is o. Then in row 1, (1,0) is o. (1,2) is o. (1,4) is o. Row 2: (2,0) is s. (2,1) is o. (2,3) is o. (2,4) is o. Row 3: (3,0) is o. (3,2) is o. (3,4) is o. Row 4: (4,1) is o. (4,2) is o. (4,3) is o.\n\nWait, but in row 2, (2,0) is s. Which is part of the non-diagonal cells. So the non-diagonal cells include s and o. So the non-diagonal set would have s and o, which makes len(non_diagonal_chars) = 2. Hence, the first sample input returns NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0) w, (1,1) w, (2,2) w. And anti-diagonal (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w. So all diagonals are w. The non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) s; (1,0) s; (1,2) s; (2,1) s. So all non-diagonal are s. So the check passes. So output is YES.\n\nThird sample input is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nThe diagonals: (0,0) x, (1,1) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonals have x and e. So the diagonal set has two elements. So the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as first line n, then n lines. But in the sample input given, the first input is a list of strings. Wait, the user provided sample input is in the form of a list, but in reality, the actual input is read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: first line is integer n. Then next n lines each contain n letters.\n\nSo in code, we can read n, then read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, but that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows. The first line contains integer n. Then next n lines are the grid. So for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is a list of three test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case per input. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three outputs. However, the actual problem says that the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list for the purpose of the example, but the actual input is one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's probably because the user is providing multiple examples. But the actual code should process one test case.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut this is probably a way to show that for these three test cases, the outputs are as given. However, the actual code must process a single test case. So the code should read n, then read n lines, then process and output YES or NO.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as the first line is n, then n lines. So the code should read that.\n\nSo the code will read from stdin, which for the sample input would be, for example, the first test case:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the code needs to read that, process, output NO.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of length n.\n\nThen process as per the logic.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n as int(input())\n\nThen grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen process the grid.\n\nBut need to check that each line is exactly n characters. However, the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n letters, so we can assume that.\n\nNow, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, collect all the diagonal characters and non-diagonal.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if diagonal_chars.pop() != non_diagonal_chars.pop():\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but for the case where there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, the non-diagonal is 4 cells. So the code is safe.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the code works.\n\nBut let's test for n=3, all cells are on diagonals. For example, if all cells are same. Then non_diagonal_chars is empty? No, because for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells. So 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells. So in that case, non_diagonal_chars would have 4 elements, but if they are all same, then len is 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, for the case where non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, that's impossible.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty. For example, n=1. But since n is at least 3, this can't happen.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, grid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonal characters are all x except for (2,2) which is x. Wait, the third row is 'soxoo' → (2,2) is x. So all diagonals are x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}, non_diagonal_chars includes 's' (from (2,0) ? Let me check.\n\nWait, (2,0) is row 2, column 0. For i=2, j=0. i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So 2+0=2 !=4. So it's not part of the diagonal. So (2,0) is part of non-diagonal. In row 2, the third line is 'soxoo' → (2,0) is 's', (2,1) is 'o', (2,2) is 'x', (2,3) is 'o', (2,4) is 'o'.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells include s, o, etc. So the non_diagonal_chars will have 's' and 'o' (and others?), which makes len(non_diagonal_chars) >= 2. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So all diagonals are w. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, which is different from diagonal's 'w'. So code returns YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when you read input, sometimes there may be leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line has exactly n letters. So input().strip() may be needed. But perhaps the input lines are read as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if a line is 'xooox', then input().strip() is same as the original. So perhaps the code can read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps the code can read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is exactly n characters. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the logic.\n\nBut in Python, for the code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1:\n\n    if diagonal_chars.pop() != non_diagonal_chars.pop():\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in the code, if the diagonal_chars has more than one element, then it's invalid. Same for non_diagonal_chars.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, sets are unordered. But when you pop, it's arbitrary. But since we just need to check whether the two are same or not, it's okay.\n\nBut what if the diagonal_chars has only one element, and non_diagonal_chars has only one element, but they are same? Then output is NO.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, testing for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b'. Output YES.\n\nEdge case 2: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'a' → output NO.\n\nEdge case 3: diagonals have two different letters. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is 'a', 'a', 'b' (but that's not possible, since the anti-diagonal would have some letters. Wait, for example, the grid:\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nThen the diagonals are (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So diagonal_chars is {a}. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=b, (2,1)=b. So non_diagonal is {b}. So output YES.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are all a. Non-diagonal cells are all a. So len(diagonal_chars) is 1, len(non_diagonal) is 1, but same. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So diagonal is a. Non-diagonal cells: (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=b. So non_diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nSo code handles all.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, read grid.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) != 1 or len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal.pop()\n    nd_char = non_diagonal.pop()\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal is empty? For example, n=1. But n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the non_diagonal is 4 cells. So code is okay.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid is:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw'\n\nrow 1: 'sws'\n\nrow 2: 'wsw'\n\nCheck for each cell:\n\ni=0, j=0 → i==j → add 'w' to diagonal.\n\ni=0, j=1: not diagonal. add 's' to non.\n\ni=0, j=2: i + j = 0+2=2, n-1=2 → yes. add 'w' to diagonal.\n\ni=1, j=0: i + j = 1 + 0 = 1 != 2. So non. add 's'.\n\ni=1, j=1: yes, add 'w'.\n\ni=1, j=2: i + j = 3 → 1+2=3, which is n-1=2? No. n is 3, n-1 is 2. So 1+2=3 != 2. So no. So for i=1, j=2: not diagonal. add 's'.\n\ni=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2 → yes. add 'w'.\n\ni=2, j=1: not diagonal. add 's'.\n\ni=2, j=2: yes. add 'w'.\n\nSo diagonal has {'w'}, non_diagonal has {'s'}, so output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the third case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 → x.\n\ni=0, j=2 → x.\n\ni=1, j=1 → x.\n\ni=2, j=0 → x.\n\ni=2, j=2 → e.\n\nSo diagonal is {x, e} → len is 2. So output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n",
