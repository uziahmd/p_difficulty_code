For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor triad definitions. The output depends on whether any of those conditions are met.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the notes into numerical values representing their positions in the 12-note scale. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but here it's H). Wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the list given in the problem is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, so H is the 12th note. Wait, but the list has 12 elements. Let me count:\n\nOriginal list:\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. That's 12 notes. So H is the last one, which would be index 11 if starting from 0. So for example, the distance between C (0) and E is 4 semitones. Let me check: C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. Yes, so that's correct.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let me create a dictionary for that. The order is important. Let me list them in order:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the list is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So for example, H is index 11. Then, the next note after H is C again.\n\nNow, the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper note. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. But between E and C is 8 semitones. Because when you go from E to C, you can go upwards: E to F (1), F to F# (2), ... up to C. Wait, but how is that calculated?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, for example, between E and C: if we consider the distance from E to C, but since E is higher than C, then the distance would be (C - E + 12) mod 12? Or maybe the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones when moving upwards. So for example, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the result is negative, then add 12. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is 1 semitone. So for example, C to C# is 1 semitone. The distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So the way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the result is negative, then adding 12. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, for example, the distance between E and C: E is higher than C. So the distance from E to C would be (C - E + 12) semitones? Let's compute: E is 4, C is 0. So (0 - 4) = -4. Adding 12 gives 8. Which matches the example given in the problem statement. So yes, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So the way to calculate the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is always positive. Wait, but mod 12 would give a value between 0 and 11. However, for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then (4-0) mod 12 is 4. Which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % 12. But wait, if we have X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper, perhaps the way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). But in any case, for our problem, when we have two notes, the distance between them is (Y - X) mod 12. However, in the problem's definition, the distance is taken from the lower to upper, so for example, when considering X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. Otherwise, it's (Y + 12 - X). So the distance is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y - X + 12). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12, but only if we take the positive value. So for example, (Y - X) mod 12 gives the number of semitones between X and Y when moving upwards.\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, when checking for major or minor triads, we need to find an ordering of the three notes X, Y, Z such that:\n\nFor a major triad: distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So the total between X and Z is 7 semitones.\n\nFor a minor triad: distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. Total between X and Z is 7 as well.\n\nBut how do we check all possible orderings of the three notes?\n\nSo given three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of them. For each permutation, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4 (for major) or 3 (for minor), and then the next two have the required distance.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. For example, for the three notes, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation, check if the first two steps meet the criteria for major or minor.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for the three notes, generate all possible permutations, then for each permutation, check the distances between the first and second note, and between the second and third.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input notes. For example, input is a list of three strings, like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\n2. Convert each note to its numerical index. For example, C is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of these three notes. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   a. Compute distance between x and y. Let's call this d1.\n\n   b. Compute distance between y and z. Call this d2.\n\n   c. If d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → it's a major triad.\n\n   d. If d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → it's a minor triad.\n\nSo, if any permutation satisfies either condition, then we can return the corresponding result.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets major or minor, we can return accordingly.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor the three notes, generate all permutations. For each permutation, check for major or minor conditions. If any permutation meets major, return 'major'. If any meets minor, return 'minor'. Else, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's make a list of the notes in order, then use a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but what about the note 'B'? In the problem statement, the list includes 'B' and 'H' as the 11th and 12th elements? Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe notes are listed as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the list has 12 elements. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So B is index 10, H is index 11.\n\nSo the list is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can have a list called note_order, and then a dictionary mapping each note to its index.\n\nOnce that's done, for each input note, convert to the index.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check the distances.\n\nBut wait, the permutations are of the three notes. For example, if the input is ['C', 'E', 'G'], then the permutations would include (C, E, G), (C, G, E), (E, C, G), etc. For each of these, check the distances between first and second, and between second and third.\n\nSo for the permutation (C, E, G):\n\ndistance between C and E is 4 → correct. Then between E and G: G is index 7, E is 4. 7-4=3. So that's 3. So this is a major triad.\n\nSo that's the example given.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as a list of three notes, but in the sample input, the input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but that's probably a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line contains 3 space-separated notes. So for example, the sample input shows three different test cases. But the actual input for the code is a single line with three notes. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Because in reality, the input is one line with three notes. For example, the first example input is \"C E G\" and the output is \"major\".\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line, like \"C E G\", and the code should process that line.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is written as a list of three examples. But that's probably an example of the input and output. So for example, the first input is 'C E G', output 'major'; the second input is 'C# B F', output 'minor'; third input is 'A B H', output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single line of input, split into three notes.\n\nSo in Python, the code will read input().split().\n\nOnce the three notes are read, then convert them to their indices.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCreate a note_to_index dictionary.\n\nThen, for the three notes, get their indices as a list, say [a, b, c].\n\nGenerate all permutations of this list. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCompute d1 = (y - x) % 12 → but wait, the distance between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + 12). But (y -x) mod 12 gives the same result. For example, if x is 4 (E) and y is 0 (C), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, using (y -x) % 12 gives the correct distance between x and y.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured as from X to Y along the scale. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is exactly (Y - X) mod 12. Because (Y - X) mod 12 is equivalent to (Y - X + 12) % 12. So yes.\n\nSo for each permutation, compute d1 between x and y, and d2 between y and z.\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can loop through all permutations and check for these conditions.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImport permutations from itertools.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nThen, for the three notes, get their indices as a list, say notes = [a, b, c]\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print 'strange'\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets major, we can return 'major' immediately, and similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can check all permutations, and if any of them meets major, then return major. If any meets minor, return minor. Else, strange.\n\nBut how to handle that in code. For example, for each permutation, check if it's major. If any permutation is major, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can:\n\nCheck all permutations. For each permutation, check if it meets major or minor. Once any of them is found, return the corresponding answer.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, this approach may not work. Because permutations can have multiple possibilities. For example, if one permutation meets major and another meets minor. But according to the problem statement, this is not possible. So the code can check all permutations, and if any permutation meets major, then return major. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut in code, if during the loop, once a major is found, we can immediately return 'major' and break. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nBut this would check permutations in order, and if any permutation meets the condition, return immediately. However, the problem says that the answer is unique. So even if there are multiple permutations that satisfy the same condition, it's okay to return once.\n\nBut for example, in the case of a major chord, there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the major condition. But the code will return as soon as the first one is found.\n\nBut this approach is correct because once a permutation is found that meets the condition, the answer is determined.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nLet me code that:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut need to make sure that the note_order is correctly ordered.\n\nWait, the order in the problem statement is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So note_order is as written.\n\nNow, for example, 'B' is index 10, 'H' is 11.\n\nNow, the code can read the three notes, convert them to their indices.\n\nBut what if the input has a note that's not in the list? Well, the problem says that the input is three valid notes, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but permutations returns tuples of the elements. So for the list indices, which is a list of three integers, permutations would generate all possible orderings.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'C E G'\n\nindices would be [0,4,7].\n\npermutations are all possible orderings. Let's see:\n\nOne of the permutations is (0,4,7). d1 is (4-0) mod 12 = 4. d2 is (7-4) mod 12 = 3. So condition for major is met. So code returns 'major'.\n\nSample input 2: 'C# B F'\n\nNotes are C#, B, F.\n\nLooking up their indices:\n\nC# is 1.\n\nB is 10.\n\nF is 5.\n\nSo indices are [1, 10, 5].\n\nNow, permutations. One of them is B, C#, F → which is (10, 1, 5).\n\nd1 is (1-10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 mod 12 is 3. So d1 is 3. Then d2 is (5-1) mod 12 → 4. So this is minor. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nAnother permutation could be (1, 10, 5). Let's see:\n\nd1 is 10-1 = 9 mod 12 is 9. Not 3 or 4. So no. But other permutations would be checked.\n\nSo the code would find the permutation (10,1,5) and return minor.\n\nThird sample input: 'A B H'\n\nNotes are A, B, H.\n\nIndices: A is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nLet's check all permutations:\n\nFor example, (A, B, H): d1 is 10-9 =1, d2 is 11-10=1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (A, H, B): d1 is H - A = 11 -9 = 2. d2 is B - H → 10 -11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (B, A, H): d1 is A - B → 9 -10 = -1 mod 12 is 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: (B, H, A): d1 is H - B = 11-10=1. d2 is A - H → 9 -11 = -2 mod 12 is 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (H, A, B): d1 is A - H → 9 - 11 = -2 mod 12 is 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (H, B, A): d1 is B - H → 10 - 11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nOther permutations would have similar results. So no major or minor found, so output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat about a case where the same note is repeated? But the problem says that the input is three notes, but it's possible that they are same? But according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. Wait, but the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But for example, if all three notes are same, then all distances are zero. So code would output 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: notes that wrap around.\n\nFor example, H, C, E. Let's see:\n\nH is 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nPermutation (H, C, E): d1 is (0 - 11) mod 12 → ( -11 ) mod 12 is 1. d2 is 4 - 0 =4. So d1 is 1, d2 is 4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (C, H, E). d1 is H - C = 11 - 0 = 11. d2 is E - H → 4 -11 = -7 mod 12 is 5. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, H. d1 is 4-0=4, d2 is 11-4=7 mod 12 is 7. So no.\n\nBut perhaps another permutation. Let's see if there's any that meets the criteria.\n\nNot sure. But the code would check all permutations.\n\nAnother example: a minor triad.\n\nSuppose the notes are B, C#, F. Which is the sample input. So the code would find the permutation (B, C#, F) → which is (10, 1, 5). d1 is (1-10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 mod 12 is 3. Then d2 is (5-1) mod 12 =4. So minor.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G → major. Correct.\n\nAnother case: C, E, G#. Let's see. What's the permutation (C, E, G#). d1 is 4, d2 is (G# is index 8. 8-4=4. So d2 is 4. So 4 and 4. Not matching. So no. So code would check all permutations and return strange.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations. How many permutations are there? For three elements, 6 permutations.\n\nSo the code checks all 6 possibilities for each input.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to import permutations. So the code must import from itertools.\n\nBut the code needs to be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, exit() may not be the best practice, but for code submission, it's acceptable. Alternatively, using sys.exit(). But in code submission, using return or break is not possible. So the code can use sys.exit().\n\nWait, but in the code, the code is written as a script. So when using exit(), it's possible that in some environments, it may not work. However, in Python, exit() is in the sys module. But in practice, using sys.exit() would be better.\n\nBut in the code, the code uses exit(), which is available in the standard Python environment. However, perhaps in some cases, it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nBut the code may have to import sys. Let me check.\n\nIn the code, the first line is import sys. But in the code above, the code uses exit(). But in Python, exit() is a function in sys. So perhaps the code should use sys.exit().\n\nBut in practice, in code submission, using exit() may work. However, to avoid any issues, perhaps replace exit() with sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G → Output is major.\n\nSample Input: C# B F → Output minor.\n\nSample Input: A B H → Output strange.\n\nSo the code should return those.\n\nAnother test case: let's take the example of the minor triad given in the problem: C# B F → which is the same as C# F B? Well, the code would check all permutations.\n\nAnother test case: what about the minor triad in the example. Let's see:\n\nThe notes are C#, B, F. Their indices are 1, 10, 5.\n\nPermutations: (10, 1, 5) → x=10, y=1, z=5.\n\nd1 is (1-10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 →4. So yes, minor.\n\nThus, the code would print minor.\n\nAnother test case: what if the three notes are C, E, G#?\n\nIndices are 0, 4, 8.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nFor example, (0,4,8): d1=4, d2=4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation (0,8,4): d1= (8-0)=8 mod 12=8. d2= (4-8) mod 12= ( -4 ) mod 12= 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation (4, 0, 8): d1= (0-4) mod 12 = 8. d2= (8-0) mod 12 = 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation (4, 8, 0): d1= 8-4=4. d2= (0-8) mod 12= 4. So d1=4, d2=4. No.\n\nAnother permutation (8, 0,4): d1=0-8 mod 12 = 4? Wait, (0-8) is -8 mod 12 is 4. So d1 is 4. Then d2 is 4-0=4. So again, 4 and 4. No.\n\nAnother permutation (8,4,0): d1=4-8= -4 mod 12 is 8. d2=0-4= -4 mod 12 is 8. No.\n\nThus, code returns 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about a minor triad where the order is not the first permutation. For example, the notes are B, C#, F. The code would find the permutation (B, C#, F) as discussed.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into numerical indices based on their position in the musical scale and checking all permutations of these indices to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Indices**: Map each note to its corresponding index in the 12-note musical scale.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Check all possible permutations of the three input notes to find if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Check Triad Conditions**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the required distances for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: The notes are mapped to indices based on their position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked. This is crucial because the triad can be ordered in different ways to meet the major or minor criteria.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Using modulo arithmetic, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated. If the distances match the criteria for a major triad (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor triad (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones), the appropriate result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes and ensures that the correct classification is determined based on the given musical theory.",
