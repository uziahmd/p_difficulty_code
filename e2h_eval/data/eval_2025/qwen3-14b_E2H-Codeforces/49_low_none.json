They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about reconstructing the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values for each road (edge) between two lawns (vertices). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Each edge has a GCD and LCM of the two connected nodes. Let's denote the two nodes as u and v. Let their mushroom counts be a and b. Then, we have:\n\ngcd(a, b) = g\nlcm(a, b) = l\n\nWe know that for any two numbers a and b, the product of their GCD and LCM is equal to the product of a and b. So, a * b = g * l. Also, since the GCD divides both a and b, we can say that a = g * x and b = g * y, where x and y are coprime (their GCD is 1). Then, the LCM of a and b is g * x * y. So, the LCM must be equal to g * x * y. Therefore, l must be equal to g * x * y. Which implies that x * y = l / g. But since x and y are coprime, this means that x and y must be factors of l/g that are coprime. \n\nSo, for each edge, given g and l, we must check if l is divisible by g. If not, then it's impossible because l must be a multiple of g. Because if a and b have GCD g, then their LCM is (a*b)/g, which would be (g^2 x y)/g = g x y. So l must be divisible by g. Therefore, if for any edge, l % g != 0, then the answer is immediately NO.\n\nSo first step: For all edges, check if LCM is divisible by GCD. If any isn't, output NO.\n\nOnce that is satisfied, for each edge, the possible pairs (a, b) are (g*x, g*y), where x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g. But since x and y are coprime, they must be divisors of (l/g) such that their product is exactly l/g and they are coprime. So for example, if l/g is 6, possible pairs (x,y) are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). However, since x and y are coprime, these are the only possibilities. \n\nBut in our problem, we need to assign values to each node such that for every edge, the GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied. How can we model this?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node has a value, and each edge imposes constraints on the values of its endpoints. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by some relationships with its neighbors. \n\nThe problem resembles building a graph where each edge defines a relationship between two nodes. However, since the relationships involve GCD and LCM, which are multiplicative, perhaps we can model this using a union-find data structure or some kind of constraints propagation. However, union-find might not directly work here because the relationships are not straightforward equivalence relations.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each edge between u and v gives us a relation between the values of u and v. Let's think of each node's value as being a multiple of the GCD of the edge. Let me think again: For an edge between u and v, the GCD of their values is g. So, both u's value and v's value must be multiples of g. Also, their LCM is l. So, the LCM of u's value and v's value is l. \n\nBut how do we assign these values? One approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we can assign variables such that for each edge, the pair (u, v) satisfies the required GCD and LCM conditions.\n\nLet me think about building a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base value. For example, if we consider the GCD of u and v as g, then u = g * x, v = g * y, where x and y are coprime. Also, x * y = l/g. So, for each edge, the product of x and y must be equal to l/g, and they must be coprime. \n\nSo, for each edge, once we have confirmed that l is divisible by g, we can compute k = l/g. Then x and y must be coprime factors of k such that x*y =k. \n\nBut how do we assign x and y to the nodes? Since x and y are coprime,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on given GCD and LCM values for each road between two lawns. The solution involves checking constraints and using a graph traversal approach to assign valid mushroom counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity**: For each edge, ensure that the LCM is divisible by the GCD. If not, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.\n2. **Graph Construction**: Treat each lawn as a node and each road as an edge with constraints.\n3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse the graph and assign mushroom counts while respecting the constraints from each edge.
