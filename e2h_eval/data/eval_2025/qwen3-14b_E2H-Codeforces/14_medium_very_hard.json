He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those n's in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros of n! equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that correspond to m. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. As n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for example, when n increases by 1, f(n) can increase by 0 or 1 or more. Wait, no. Because when n is a multiple of 5, adding it would add at least one 5. But if it's a multiple of higher powers like 25, then it adds more.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, the key is that for each m, there's a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. However, sometimes there might be no n's for a given m. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's a range of numbers that give exactly 5 zeros. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's take the example given. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. \n\nThe trailing zeros for 5! is 1. For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7, 8, 9. Then 10! has 2 zeros. So the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. Hence, the count is 5.\n\nSo for m=1, there are 5 possible n's. So the problem is to find all n's such that f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these n's?\n\nThe approach could be:\n\n1. Find the minimum n where f(n) = m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find the minimum n for a given m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the possible n's by using binary search. But since the function f(n) is non-decreasing, perhaps we can find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but for each m, there may be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's? Or maybe more? Wait, let's think. For example, when m=5, what is the possible n's?\n\nLet me compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 25 and ... wait, there's no n where f(n) is 5? Because when you go from 24 (which gives 4) to 25 (which gives 6). So for m=5, there's no solution. Hence, the output would be 0.\n\nSo for some m's, there's no n. So the problem requires us to check for that.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem would be:\n\nFor a given m, find all n's such that f(n) = m. How?\n\nFirst, find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then find the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the count is (largest - smallest + 1), but only if such n exists.\n\nBut how to find the smallest and largest n for a given m?\n\nBut how do we find if there exists any n such that f(n) = m?\n\nLet me think. The function f(n) is non-decreasing. So for each m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. But for some m, there's no such n. For example, m=5 in the case above.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n- Find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Let's call this high.\n\nIf such n exists (i.e., there is at least one n with f(n) = m), then the answer is the numbers from low to high inclusive. The count is high - low + 1.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound of n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nWe can use binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to find the first occurrence of m in the f(n) sequence, and the last occurrence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's first find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. How?\n\nWe can perform a binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this value 'left'. Then check if f(left) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this 'right'. Then the numbers between left and right-1 would be the numbers where f(n) = m. But only if f(left) is m.\n\nSo for example, if left is the first n with f(n) = m, and right is the first n with f(n) = m+1, then the numbers from left to right-1 would have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nSo the count is right - left.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take m=1. The first n where f(n) >=1 is 5. The first n where f(n)>=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 1 zero. So 9-5+1 = 5 numbers. But according to right-left, right is 10, left is 5. So right - left is 5, which is correct.\n\nYes. So the count is right - left. But only if f(left) == m.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Find the lower bound (left) where f(n) = m. This can be done by finding the first n where f(n) >= m, and check if f(n) is m.\n\n2. Find the upper bound (right) where f(n) = m. This can be done by finding the first n where f(n) >= m+1. Then the upper bound is right-1.\n\nIf the left's f(n) is not m, then there is no solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute left as the minimal n where f(n) >= m. If f(left) != m, then return 0.\n\n- Compute right as the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers from left to right-1 are the solutions.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is right - left.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor a given m, compute left and right as described, then check if f(left) is m. If yes, then the answer is right - left numbers, which are left, left+1,..., right-1.\n\nNow, how to compute f(n) efficiently?\n\nThe function f(n) is the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the term is zero.\n\nSo implementing that is straightforward.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut what's the possible range for binary search?\n\nWell, the minimal n for which f(n) >= m is somewhere between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count of trailing zeros is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms contribute more). But perhaps even lower. But for binary search, we can set the upper bound as 5*m. However, for m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is acceptable for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search for the left (the first n where f(n) >=m) would be in the range [0, 5*m], and similarly for the right.\n\nBut let me think again. For example, for m=5, the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25? Let's see:\n\nf(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) is 5 + 1 = 6. So the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is greater than m=5. Hence, there is no solution for m=5. So the code would check if f(left) is equal to m. In this case, it's 6 != 5, so output 0.\n\nSo the code needs to do that.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nGiven m:\n\n1. Compute left = find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\n2. Check if f(left) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n3. Else, compute right = find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\n4. The answer is the numbers from left to right-1. The count is right - left.\n\nSo now, how to implement the binary search for finding the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nFunction to find the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*target (or something like that). While low < high:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2.\n\nIf f(mid) >= target, then high = mid.\n\nElse, low = mid + 1.\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for high? Well, for target m, the upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count of zeros is at least m. Because 5*m//5 = m, and higher terms add more. So for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct n. For m=5, 5*5=25, which gives 6 zeros.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better upper bound. But for the sake of code, 5*m is acceptable. However, for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code can proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, write a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        cnt += n\n    return cnt\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the binary search function.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for the case where target is 0? But in our problem, m starts from 1. So for the problem, we don't need to handle that.\n\nOnce we have this function, for a given m, we can find left = find_min_n(m).\n\nThen check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find right = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers from left to right-1 are the solutions.\n\nSo the count is right - left.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 1. That's 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1, which equals m. So proceed.\n\nThen find right = find_min_n(2). What is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2?\n\nLet's see. For n=10, count_zeros(10) is 2. But what about 9? count_zeros(9) is 1. So the minimal n is 10. So right=10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: m=5. Let's compute left = find_min_n(5). Let's see.\n\nWhat's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 = 4. For 25: 6. So the minimal n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the answer is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample input's second case, where m=5 outputs 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see. For m=6, find_min_n(6) would find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6. Let's see:\n\nn=25: count is 6. So left is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. Then find right as find_min_n(7). What's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nLet's see: 25 gives 6. 26 gives 6. 27:6, 28:6, 29:6. 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1. Total 7. So the minimal n is 25? No. Wait, for 25, it's 6. For 30, it's 7. So the minimal n for target 7 is 25? No, because count_zeros(25) is 6, which is less than 7. So the binary search would proceed to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's compute that.\n\nSo the function would find 25 as low, but count_zeros(25) is 6 <7. So the binary search would proceed to higher numbers. Let me think.\n\nThe initial high is 5*7=35. Let's see. For mid= (0+35)/2= 17.5, etc. But eventually, the code would find that the minimal n is 25? No. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for 25, count_zeros is 6. For 25, the target is 7. So the code would have to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7. That would be 25? No. Let me compute for 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6. 26: same as 25, since 26//5 is 5, 26//25 is 1. 5+1=6. Same for 27, 28, 29. For 30, 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So the minimal n is 30. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So for m=6, left is 25, right is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse compute right = find_min_n(m+1). The answer is the list of numbers from left to right-1.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate these numbers and output the count followed by the numbers.\n\nBut for large m, say m=1e5, what is the maximum possible size of the list? For example, if m is such that there is a range of 5 numbers, then the code will output them. But how?\n\nBut for the code, generating the numbers from left to right-1 is straightforward. However, for very large ranges (like if m is such that there are 5 numbers), but for m up to 1e5, the maximum possible range is 5 numbers. Wait, why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by 1 when n crosses a multiple of 5, but sometimes increases by more than 1 (like when n is 25, which adds 2 zeros). So, for example, if m is 5, there's no solution. But if m is 6, then the numbers 25-29 have 6 zeros. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nWait, why is that?\n\nBecause when you have a number that is a multiple of 5, but not of 25, then adding 1 to n increases the count by 1. But when you cross a multiple of 25, the count increases by 2. So for example, when n increases from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). So between 24 and 25, there's a jump. Hence, for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nBut for the cases where the count_zeros increases by 1, the numbers would be 5 consecutive numbers. For example, m=1, the numbers 5-9 (5 numbers). So the code would generate that.\n\nSo the maximum possible k is 5. So for any m, the answer is either 0 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers. So the code can generate the list as [left, left+1, ..., right-1].\n\nBut how to generate that list? For example, if left is 5, right is 10, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the list is range(left, right). So in Python, list(range(left, right)).\n\nSo the code would:\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   numbers = list(range(left, right))\n\n   print(len(numbers))\n\n   print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, for m=1, the code would generate numbers from 5 to 10-1=9. Which is 5,6,7,8,9. Correct.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the case where m is 0? But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the code doesn't need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, the code must read m from input. However, the input is given as a list of strings, but according to the sample input, perhaps the input is given as a single line. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is ['1', '5'], which seems to be two test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps that's a mistake in the way the sample is presented. Because the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single m per input.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. So the code should read a single integer m from stdin. However, the sample input shows something else. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nIn the first sample, input is '1' and output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input '5' output is '0'.\n\nBut perhaps the sample is showing two separate test cases. So the code should read m from input, and process it.\n\nBut the code is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout. So the code should read a single integer m.\n\nSo, the code should read m as input().strip().\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the input is given as a list of test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first input is m=1, and the second is m=5.\n\nBut for the code, the input is a single integer. So the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the required answer.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute the answer as discussed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function.\n\nBut for Python, the code would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        cnt += n\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    right = find_min_n(m+1)\n    numbers = list(range(left, right))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code would output len(numbers) = 5, and the numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that the numbers are more than 5? For example, if there's a case where there are 6 numbers?\n\nBut according to the previous reasoning, that's not possible. Because the count_zeros(n) increases by at least 1 when n increases by 5. So for example, if there's a range where count_zeros(n) increases by 1, then the numbers would be 5 consecutive numbers. But if there's a case where the count_zeros increases by 1 when n increases by 1, then there's a possibility of more numbers? Wait, no. Because for example, when n is not a multiple of 5, then count_zeros(n) is same as count_zeros(n-1). So, for example, for n=6, count_zeros is same as 5. So the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have same count. So the length is 5.\n\nBut what if the count_zeros increases by 1 when n increases by 5? For example, when n is 25, count_zeros increases by 2. So for m=6, the numbers are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about m=2?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nfind_min_n(2) would be 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. So 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Their factorials have 2 zeros. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. 11! is same as 10! * 11, which has 2 zeros. Same for 12, 13, 14. 15! has 3 zeros. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code would find left=25, right=30. So numbers from 25 to 29. 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=0. Not allowed.\n\nCase 2: m=5. As discussed earlier, returns 0.\n\nAnother case: m=24. Let's compute what's the count_zeros(99) ?\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 = 19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Hmm. Maybe not. Let me think of another example.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut for m=1e5, what is the value of 5*m? 5*1e5=500,000. Which is acceptable for binary search.\n\nBut what about when m is 1e5, and the code computes find_min_n(m) with high=5*1e5=500,000. But perhaps the actual n needed is higher. For example, if m is 1e5, then the required n is such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's think about the maximum possible n. For example, for m=1e5, the required n is around 5*1e5. But perhaps the code's upper bound is sufficient.\n\nBut let's think: for n=5*target, count_zeros(n) is at least target. Because 5*target//5 = target. So for example, for target=1e5, 5*target is 500,000, count_zeros(500,000) is 500,000//5 + 500,000//25 + ... which is 100,000 + 20,000 + 4,000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,  etc. Which is definitely larger than target. So the binary search will find the correct n.\n\nBut for the code, the upper bound of 5*target is sufficient.\n\nBut what if m is very large, like 1e5? For example, the code's find_min_n(1e5) will run with high=5*1e5. But for the binary search, each step is O(log(5*target)), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would run in log2(5e5) ≈ 19 steps. Each step calls count_zeros, which is O(log n) steps. So overall, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. Then process as discussed.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is for two separate test cases. But the problem says that the code must read input from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m...\n\nSo the code should read one integer m from input. But the sample input seems to have two test cases. But that's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, in the first sample input, the input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, and the output is 0.\n\nBut the code should read one m per run.\n\nSo the code should read m from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m as int(input().strip())\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps that's part of the way the sample is presented. For example, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is as shown.\n\nSo the code is written as follows.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout. So the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        cnt += n\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n    left = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        right = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(left, right))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code would output 5 followed by the numbers. But the sample output shows '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code prints len(numbers) followed by the numbers. So for the first sample, the code outputs 5 and then the numbers. But the code uses print(len(...)) and then print('...') which would output two lines. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. The first line is the count, the second line is the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second case is m=5, which outputs 0. So the code would print 0.\n\nBut what about when the numbers list is empty? Well, the code checks if count_zeros(left) is m. So in that case, the code would not enter the else clause.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's test for m=5.\n\nleft = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\nThe target is 5. The binary search starts with low=0, high=25.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search for target=5.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=25.\n\nmid = 12. count_zeros(12) = 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). 2 <5 → low=13.\n\nNext, low=13, high=25. mid= (13+25)//2= 19. count_zeros(19) = 3 (19//5=3). Still <5 → low=20.\n\nlow=20, high=25. mid=22. count_zeros(22) is 4. <5 → low=23.\n\nlow=23, high=25. mid=24. count_zeros(24)=4. <5 → low=25. Now low=high=25. Exit loop. Return 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → print 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nleft = find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\ntarget is 6. high is 5*6=30.\n\nbinary search:\n\nlow=0, high=30.\n\nmid=15. count_zeros(15) = 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0. total 3 <6 → low=16.\n\nmid= (16+30)/2=23. count_zeros(23) is 4 (23//5=4). <6 → low=24.\n\nmid= (24+30)/2=27. count_zeros(27) is 5 (27//5=5). <6 → low=28.\n\nmid= (28+30)/2=29. count_zeros(29)=5. <6 → low=30.\n\nNow low=30, high=30. return 30. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. Which is not equal to 6. So the code would output 0? But that's not correct. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, no. For m=6, what is the correct answer?\n\nLet me compute for n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So why isn't the code finding that?\n\nAh, because the code's find_min_n(6) is trying to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6. So for n=25, count_zeros is 6. So during the binary search, why didn't it find 25?\n\nLet me re-simulate the binary search for target=6.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5*6=30.\n\nLet me think of the steps again.\n\nStep 1: low=0, high=30.\n\nmid = (0+30)//2 = 15. count_zeros(15) is 3 <6 → low=16.\n\nNow low=16, high=30. mid=(16+30)//2 = 23. count_zeros(23) is 4 <6 → low=24.\n\nlow=24, high=30. mid= (24+30)/2=27. count_zeros(27) is 5 <6 → low=28.\n\nlow=28, high=30. mid=29. count_zeros(29) is 5 <6 → low=30. Now low=30, high=30. return 30.\n\nBut count_zeros(30) is 7. But there exists n=25 where count_zeros is 6. Why didn't the binary search find it?\n\nBecause the high was set to 5*target=30. But during the binary search, the code is looking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6. But in this case, the code is not finding 25. Because during the binary search steps, the code is not considering numbers less than 30. So why?\n\nBecause the initial high is 30, but the minimal n is 25. So why didn't the code find it?\n\nAh, because during the binary search steps, the code is moving low up, but perhaps the code is missing some steps. Let me retrace.\n\nLet me think again for target=6.\n\nLet me think of the binary search steps again.\n\nInitial low=0, high=30.\n\nmid is 15 → count is 3 <6 → low=16.\n\nmid is (16+30)/2 = 23 → count is 4 <6 → low=24.\n\nmid is (24+30)/2 = 27 → count is 5 <6 → low=28.\n\nmid is (28+30)/2=29 → count is 5 <6 → low=30. Now low=30, high=30. return 30.\n\nBut the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6 is 25. Why didn't the code find it?\n\nBecause the code's high is set to 30. But during the binary search steps, the code is not considering values between 25 and 28. Because the code's mid is calculated as (low + high) // 2.\n\nWait, what's the problem here? Why isn't the binary search finding 25?\n\nAh, because the initial high is 30, but the code's binary search is not considering lower values. For example, when low is 0 and high is 30, mid is 15. But there's a possibility of lower numbers. But why is the code not finding it?\n\nBecause during the binary search, the code is trying to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target. But in this case, the code is not checking 25 because the mid steps are not reaching it.\n\nSo what's wrong with the binary search logic?\n\nLet me think. For target=6, the code's high is set to 30.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are counted and efficiently finding the range of values for `n` that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial. The count of trailing zeros can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n\n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest and largest values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps us quickly narrow down the possible values of `n`.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we find the smallest `n` (let's call it `left`) where the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`, we check if this count is exactly `m`. If not, there are no valid `n` values. Otherwise, we find the smallest `n` (let's call it `right`) where the count of trailing zeros is at least `m+1`. The valid range of `n` values will be from `left` to `right-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        cnt += n\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n    left = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        right = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(left, right))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target value. The upper bound for the binary search is set to `5 * target` which ensures that we cover all possible values of `n` that could yield the required number of trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input value `m`, uses `find_min_n` to determine the smallest `n` with at least `m` trailing zeros. It then checks if this `n` actually has exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, it prints 0. Otherwise, it finds the next smallest `n` with at least `m+1` trailing zeros and prints the range of valid `n` values.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
