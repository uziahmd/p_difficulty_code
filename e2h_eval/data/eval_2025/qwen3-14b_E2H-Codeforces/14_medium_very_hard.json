Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for a given m, I need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see why. For 5!, there's one 5 (from 5). Then 6! adds another 5? No, 6 is 6, but 5 is already counted. Wait, the count for 5 is 1, for 6 it's still 1. Because 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. Then for 25, 25/5 is 5, etc. So for n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, same as 5. So the count for 5-9 is 1. So that's why the sample says 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the possible n's such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nThe key idea here is that for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if m is 5, then what?\n\nWait, let's think about how the trailing zeros function works. The count increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but sometimes by more. Like when n is 25, then the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So the count function is non-decreasing. So for each m, there could be a range of n's that give exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how to find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, if I can find the smallest n where the count is m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there might be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose m is such that there's a unique n that gives exactly m zeros. Or maybe there are 5 numbers. Wait, in the sample, m=1, there are 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nBecause for n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, it's still 1. Because 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So adding 1. So for numbers from 5 to 9, the count is 1. Then for n=10, the count is 2. So the numbers 5-9 (five numbers) have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nSo the way to find the numbers is to find the lower and upper bounds of n that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimal n where the count is m. Then find the maximal n where the count is m. Then if there are numbers between them, that's the list.\n\nBut how to find these values?\n\nLet me think. The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, there may be a range of n's where the count is exactly m. However, some m's may not exist. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there is no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me compute for n=24: count is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25, it's 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there is no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the first thing is to check whether there exists any n such that the count is m. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find all n's that satisfy this.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For a given m, determine if there exists any n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\n2. If yes, find all such n's.\n\nBut how to find them?\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach. Since the count_zeros function is non-decreasing, for a given m, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if that n's count is exactly m. Similarly, find the maximum n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n that would have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nLet me think: For example, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m is the first occurrence of m. The maximal n is the last occurrence of m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the possible n's.\n\nBut how to find those?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\nThen find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m+1. Let's call this high. Then all numbers from low to high-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because once the count reaches m+1, all numbers beyond that will have at least m+1 zeros. So the numbers between low and high-1 (inclusive) will have exactly m zeros. So the count of numbers is high - low.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) equals m? Well, perhaps using binary search.\n\nWait, but for example, if m is not present, then there's no solution. So first, we need to check if there exists any n with count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this value x. Then check if count_zeros(x) is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this y. Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the ones with exactly m zeros. So the count is y - x.\n\nBut how to compute x and y?\n\nWe can use binary search for this.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven m:\n\n1. Find the lower bound (x) where count_zeros(x) = m.\n\n   To find x, perform a binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n2. Find the upper bound (y) where count_zeros(y) = m+1. Similarly, perform binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n3. The numbers between x and y-1 (inclusive) are the valid n's. The count is y - x.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample input m=1:\n\nFind x where count_zeros(x) >= 1. The minimal x is 5, since count_zeros(5)=1. Then check if count_zeros(5) is 1. Yes.\n\nThen find y where count_zeros(y) >= 2. The minimal y is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the valid ones. Which is 5 numbers. So y - x is 10 -5 =5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see.\n\nFind x where count_zeros(x) >=5. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25)=6. So the minimal x is 25? Because count_zeros(25) is 6 which is >=5. But then check if count_zeros(x) is 5? No. So there is no solution. Hence output is 0.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the count_zeros function. That's straightforward: for a given n, compute sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nNow, the binary search part. How to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search for this can be done between low=0 and high=5*m. Because for example, m=1, the minimal n is 5. 5*m is 5, which is sufficient. For higher m, say m=100,000, the n would be around 5*100,000=500,000. But perhaps even higher? Wait, because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is n/5 + n/25 + ... which is at least n/5 = m. So that's sufficient for the upper bound in the binary search.\n\nBut maybe there's a better upper bound. However, for the purposes of binary search, even if the upper bound is larger than needed, the binary search will work.\n\nSo the binary search for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have that, we can check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then no solution.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call that y. Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) as described.\n\nImplement a helper function find_min_n(target) which returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target. If there is no such n (but for our problem, since target is m, and m is given as up to 1e5, and n can be up to 5e5 or so, but for the problem, perhaps the target is always achievable? Well, for example, for m=1, it's achievable. But for m=5, it's not. So the helper function needs to return the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target, even if that's higher than necessary.\n\nSo for example, if target is 5, and the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25, which gives 6 zeros. So in that case, the count_zeros(x) is 6 !=5, so no solution.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from x to y-1 inclusive. So the count is y -x.\n\nthen output the count, followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut how to find find_min_n(target)?\n\nImplementing binary search for that.\n\nThe binary search for find_min_n(target):\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*target (or some higher number). But for large targets, 5*target could be very big. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. But for that, the count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5/5 + 5e5/25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 8e2 + ... which is more than 1e5. So 5*target is sufficient as upper bound.\n\nBut maybe even 5*target is not enough? Let's see. For example, if target is 1, then 5*1=5, which is the correct value. For target=2, 5*2=10. count_zeros(10) is 2. So yes.\n\nBut for example, if target is 6. Let's see. For n=25, count_zeros is 6. So 5*target is 30. So the binary search will find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nSo the upper bound is sufficient.\n\nSo the binary search for find_min_n(target) can be done between low=0 and high=5*target.\n\nBut for the case where target is 0? Well, in our problem, m starts at 1, so target is m, which is >=1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code for find_min_n:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nOnce this returns, check if count_zeros(low) == target.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut first, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the given m, compute x = find_min_n(m), then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0. Else compute y = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers are x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nBut let's test with sample input m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. Then find_min_n(2) returns 10. So numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example, m=5. find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. find_min_n(6) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) returns 25? Or 25?\n\nWait, count_zeros(25) is 6. So for target=7, find_min_n(7) would be looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet's compute for n=25: 6. n=26: same as 25. n=29: same. n=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the numbers between 25 and 29 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 6 zeros. So 29-25+1=5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a single integer. Wait, the example shows that the input is given as ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The example shows that the input is given as ['1', '5'], but that's probably part of the sample input. Wait, the problem's sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are handled, but the actual problem says that the input is a single integer m. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input description says: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows ['1', '5'] which may be a mistake. Or perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, but the original problem says that the input is a single m. Maybe the sample input is for two different test cases. For example, the first input is m=1, output is 5 numbers, and the second input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut in the code, the user is supposed to read a single integer m from standard input. So the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows something else. But perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, where the sample input is for multiple test cases. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m.\n\nBut regardless, the code should read a single integer m from input.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input. Then compute as per the steps.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for the case when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n) as a helper function.\n\nImplement find_min_n(target) as a helper function.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code will be:\n\nRead m from input. Let's assume that the input is read as a single integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is m=1, which outputs 5 numbers. The second case is m=5, which outputs 0.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = y -x\n        print(k)\n        if k >0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. The code would generate range(x, y) which is range(5,10) which is 5,6,7,8,9. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(x, y) is [x, y-1]. So yes.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Well, in the code, when we check if count_zeros(x) ==m, then y is find_min_n(m+1). So for example, if m is 5, x would be find_min_n(5) which returns 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the code would print 0.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers? For example, when m=6, the code returns x=25, y=30. So k=5. So the code prints 5 followed by 25,26,27,28,29. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct. But let's test for m=5.\n\nLet's compute x = find_min_n(5). What's the value of x?\n\nLet's think. For target=5, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) = 4. n=24: 4. n=25: 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. Then count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the code outputs 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. x is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6. Then y is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(7) would search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=25: 6.\n\nn=29: 29//5=5, 29//25=1. Total 6. Still 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So the minimal n is 30. So y=30. So the numbers are 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nx is find_min_n(2). Let's see. For n=10, count_zeros is 2. So x=10. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) = 2. 11: same. 12: same. 13: same. 14: same. 15: 3. So yes.\n\nSo the code would output 5 numbers: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.\n\nBut wait, what about n=15? count_zeros(15) is 3. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about m=3?\n\nx = find_min_n(3) is 15?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. Then find_min_n(4) is 20. So numbers from 15 to 19. Which is 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(15) = 3. 16: same. 17: same. 18: same. 19: same. 20: 4. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there is exactly one n?\n\nFor example, m=24. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's think of a case where there is only one n. Is that possible?\n\nSuppose m is such that there is a number n where count_zeros(n) = m, but count_zeros(n+1) = m+1. For example, when n is 25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is also 6. So no. So the numbers 25-29 have count_zeros 6. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers.\n\nWhat about when n is 5^k?\n\nFor example, n=125. count_zeros(125) is 31 (125//5=25, 25//5=5, 5//5=1. Sum is 25+5+1=31). Then count_zeros(126) is same as 125. So the numbers from 125 to 129 would have 31 zeros. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps for all m, the number of possible n's is either 0 or 5?\n\nWait, but what about m=31?\n\nThe numbers from 125 to 129 would have 31 zeros. So 5 numbers. Then for m=31, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is 31 + something?\n\nWait, but when there's a jump of more than 1. For example, when m is 5, which is skipped.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nBut what if there is a case where there is only 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 numbers?\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine m=4. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). Then count_zeros(21) is 4. ... up to 24. Then 25 gives 6. So the numbers 20-24 (5 numbers) have count 4. So again 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=2. As before, 5 numbers.\n\nSo perhaps for all m that exist, there are exactly 5 numbers. Except for some cases?\n\nWait, what about m=0? Well, the problem doesn't consider it. But for m=0, the numbers are 1-4, which is 4 numbers. But m=0 is not part of the problem.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So perhaps for all m >=1, the number of n's is either 0 or 5?\n\nBut why? Because the count_zeros function increases by 1 for each multiple of 5, but sometimes increases by more. So for example, when you have a number like 25, which adds two 5s.\n\nSo when the count_zeros(n) increases by more than 1, there are some m's that are skipped. But for the m's that are present, they are covered by a range of 5 numbers.\n\nBut why 5? Because when you have a normal increase (by 1), then the numbers from n to n+4 (if the next increase is at n+5) would have the same count. For example, when n is 5, then 5,6,7,8,9 (5 numbers) have count 1.\n\nBut when the increase is by more than 1, like when you have 25, which adds 2 to the count. So for m=6, the numbers are 25-29 (5 numbers). So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo for all m that exist, the answer is 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause for the count_zeros function, the difference between consecutive numbers is either 0 or 1 (except when you cross a multiple of 5, which can add more). So when the count_zeros(n) is exactly m, then the next number n+1 has the same count, unless n+1 is a multiple of 5. So for example, if n is 24, count_zeros is 4. Then n+1=25, count_zeros increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). So between 24 and 25, the count increases by 2. Thus, the m=5 is skipped.\n\nBut for the existing m's, the numbers that generate them are in a range of 5 numbers. Because when the count increases by 1, the numbers are in a range of 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the count increases by 1, but the next count increases by 1 again. For example, when n is 25, count is 6. Then n=26, count is 6. n=30, count is 7. So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So 5 numbers again.\n\nSo the code returns 5 numbers for any m that exists.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only 1 number? For example, if the count_zeros increases by 5?\n\nNo, that's impossible. Because the count_zeros increases by 1 for each multiple of 5. So for example, when you have n= 5^k, the count increases by k. But even then, the numbers before that would have count_zeros(n) = m, and the next numbers would have count_zeros(n) = m + something.\n\nBut for example, when m is 31, the numbers are 125-129. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo in all cases, the number of n's is 5, except when there are no solutions.\n\nSo the code's output is either 0 or 5 numbers. But wait, the sample input shows 5 numbers. But what if there is a case where the numbers are less than 5?\n\nWait, let's think of m=24. Let's find the x and y.\n\nFor m=24, find x = find_min_n(24). Let's see:\n\nLet me think. For example, 24*5=120. count_zeros(120) is 120//5=24, 120//25=4, 120//125=0. Total 24+4=28. Which is higher than 24. So the x is somewhere lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=24. Let me think.\n\nLet me compute count_zeros(99):\n\n99//5 = 19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Not enough.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24 (100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0. 20+4=24). So x is 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then y is find_min_n(25). Let's compute that.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is same. ... until 104. Then for 105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. 21+4=25. So y=105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo for m=24, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nBut what about m=25?\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. So x is 105. Then find_min_n(26). Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. 22+4=26. So y=110. So numbers from 105 to 109: 5 numbers.\n\nSo again 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut for the case where k is 5, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers. However, in the code, when k is y -x, which is 5, then the code prints '5' and then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, when k is 5, the code prints the numbers as range(x, y), which is x to y-1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the code returns k=0? For example, m=5, the code prints 0.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nIn the sample input, for m=1, the code prints 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, when k is 5, the code prints '5' and then the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when k is 5, the code uses 'range(x, y)' which is 5 elements. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, the code for the output is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nif k>0:\n\n    print(' '.join(...))\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is 5, the second line is the numbers.\n\nBut the code would print the first line as k, then the second line as the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when k is zero? The code prints 0, and nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in the code, for the case when k is zero, the code prints 0. For other cases, it prints k, then the numbers.\n\nBut the code in the main function:\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = y -x\n\n    print(k)\n\n    if k>0:\n\n        print(' '.join(...))\n\nBut wait, when k is zero? How can that happen?\n\nBecause x is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m. And count_zeros(x) == m. Then y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1. So y is >=x. So y -x is >=0.\n\nBut when is y -x zero? Only when x is such that count_zeros(x) = m, and count_zeros(x) >= m+1. Which implies that m = m+1, which is impossible. So y-x can't be zero. So k is always >=1?\n\nNo. For example, if m is such that x is the minimal n with count_zeros(x) =m, and the next number x+1 has count_zeros(x+1) =m+1. Then y would be x+1. So k = y -x = 1. So the code would print 1 and the numbers from x to x (i.e., just x).\n\nBut how can this happen?\n\nLet's think of a case where the count_zeros increases by 1 when moving from x to x+1. For example, when x is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. count_zeros(6) is 1. So no. But suppose there's a case where count_zeros(x) = m, and count_zeros(x+1) = m+1. Then y = x+1, so k = x+1 -x =1. So the code would output 1 and the number x.\n\nBut how can this happen?\n\nLet me think. For example, if x is 24. count_zeros(24) is 4. Then x is for m=4. Then y is find_min_n(5) which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So k = 25 -24 =1. So the code would output 1 and the number 24. But that's wrong, because count_zeros(24) is 4, which is m=4. Then the numbers that have exactly 4 zeros are 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. So 5 numbers. So why is the code returning k=1?\n\nAh, here's a mistake in the code. Because in this example, when m=4, the code computes x = find_min_n(4). Let's compute that.\n\nFor target=4, find_min_n(4) returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=4.\n\nLet me compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4. So x=20. Then y is find_min_n(5). For target=5, find_min_n(5) returns 25. So k = 25-20=5. Which is correct, because numbers 20-24 (5 numbers) have count 4. So the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nSo why did I think earlier that x=24? Because I made a mistake in the example.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut let's think of a scenario where the code would return k=1. Let's imagine that for some m, the minimal x is such that the next number has count_zeros(x+1) = m+1. So for example, if m=6. Let's say that x is 25 (count_zeros=6). Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So k=5. So code is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. So why in the previous example, when m=4, the code returns 5 numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. Therefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1. Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. Output is 0.\n\nNow, code for m=5:\n\nx = find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nNow, code for m=6: returns 5 numbers 25-29.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in the code, when k is y -x, which is 5 in the sample, then the code prints '5' followed by the numbers.\n\nBut the code for printing the numbers is:\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nBut in Python, range(x, y) includes x, x+1, ..., y-1. So for example, x=5, y=10: range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the main function",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the range of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Using binary search, we can efficiently find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`. Similarly, we find the smallest number where the count is at least `m+1`.\n3. **Range Calculation**: The valid range of numbers `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros is between the smallest number found for `m` and the smallest number found for `m+1` minus one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = y - x\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible range of values.\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input value `m`, determines the smallest number `x` with at least `m` trailing zeros, checks if it exactly has `m` trailing zeros, and then finds the smallest number `y` with at least `m+1` trailing zeros. The valid range of numbers is from `x` to `y-1`, and these numbers are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of numbers using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of `m`.",
