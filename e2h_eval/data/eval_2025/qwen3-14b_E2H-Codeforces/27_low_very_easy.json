On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. \n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we reverse it, the overall sequence has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what reversing a subarray does. For example, if the original array is [1,2,1,2], reversing the subarray from index 2 to 3 (assuming 1-based) gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So the entire array becomes non-decreasing, hence the maximum length is 4.\n\nBut how do I approach this for any given array? Let's think about the properties of the original array and how reversing a subarray can help.\n\nThe longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) for the original array can be computed, but the problem allows us to reverse any subarray once. Our goal is to find the best possible reversal to maximize the LNDS.\n\nSince the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to model this efficiently. Let's think about the optimal scenario. The best possible scenario is when the entire array is non-decreasing. If that's already the case, then the answer is n. Otherwise, we need to find a way to reverse a subarray that can fix some parts of the array.\n\nBut how to find which subarray to reverse?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. The original array has some 1s followed by 2s. But if there are 2s followed by 1s, that's a problem. Reversing a subarray that contains such a segment could help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is to take a segment where there's a dip from 2 to 1, and reverse it to make it a rise from 1 to 2.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nAnother approach: since the array can be reversed in any interval, the maximum LNDS after reversal would be the maximum between the original LNDS and the best possible improvement from reversing a subarray.\n\nSo, perhaps I can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS of the new array, and take the maximum. However, with n up to 2000, this approach would be O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3), which for n=2000 would be around 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but the original array is made of 1s and 2s. Let's think about the LNDS of the original array. The maximum possible LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but only if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus some number of transitions from 2 to 1.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you can fix some of those transitions. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing that part would turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is better.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is to take the first occurrence of a 2 followed by a 1, reverse that pair, and then the rest. But that might not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the best possible way to merge the 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing sequence by reversing a single subarray.\n\nAnother idea: The maximum possible length of the LNDS after reversal is equal to the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s minus the number of inversions (transitions from 2 to 1) that can't be fixed by reversing a subarray.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the total number of elements minus the number of inversions (i.e., 2 followed by 1) that can't be removed by reversing a subarray. But how to find that?\n\nWait, let's think about the original array. Suppose there are k transitions from 2 to 1. Each such transition contributes to a decrease in the LNDS. But reversing a subarray that contains some of these transitions can eliminate some of them.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, consider a segment where there are multiple 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that entire segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, thus eliminating all those transitions. But if the segment includes both 2s and 1s, reversing it would flip the order.\n\nSo, perhaps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we aim to find the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, we can take advantage of their binary nature to optimize our solution.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Binary Nature of Elements**:\n   - The array consists only of `1`s and `2`s.\n   - A non-decreasing sequence will be a series of `1`s followed by `2`s.\n   - Any `2` followed by `1` is an inversion that breaks the non-decreasing property.\n\n2. **Reversing a Subarray**:\n   - Reversing a subarray can help fix such inversions.\n   - Specifically, if a segment contains a `2` followed by a `1`, reversing it would turn it into a `1` followed by a `2`.\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - We can precompute the number of `1`s and `2`s in the original array.\n   - The best possible LNDS length is the total number of elements if the sequence is already non-decreasing.\n   - Otherwise, we look for segments where reversing can reduce the number of `2 → 1` transitions.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Algorithm:\n\nWe can iterate through the array to count the number of `2 → 1` transitions. Then, we simulate the effect of reversing a segment that reduces these transitions as much as possible.\n\nThe optimal solution involves:\n- Counting the total number of `1`s and `2`s.\n- Counting the number of `2 → 1` transitions in the original array.\n- If there are no such transitions, the answer is the full length of the array.\n- Otherwise, we can reverse a segment that eliminates one or more of these transitions, which increases the LNDS.\n\nHowever, instead of brute-forcing all possible reversals, we can directly compute the maximum possible LNDS by considering how many such transitions we can eliminate.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    \n    count_1 = a.count(1)\n    count_2 = a.count(2)\n    \n    # Number of \"2 -> 1\" transitions\n    trans = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n            trans += 1\n    \n    # If there are no such transitions, the whole array is non-decreasing\n    if trans == 0:\n        print(n)\n    else:\n        # We can eliminate at most one \"2 -> 1\" transition by reversing a segment\n        # So the maximum possible length is total elements minus the number of transitions\n        print(n - trans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The code reads the input and counts the number of `1`s and `2`s.\n- It then counts the number of `2 → 1` transitions.\n- If there are no such transitions, the array is already non-decreasing, and the answer is `n`.\n- Otherwise, the maximum possible LNDS is `n - trans`, since each such transition represents a break in the non-decreasing order, and reversing a segment can fix at least one such break.\n\nThis approach runs in linear time, making it highly efficient for large inputs up to `n = 2000`.",
