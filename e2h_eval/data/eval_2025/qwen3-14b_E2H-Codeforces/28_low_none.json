String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: we can modify the string through certain operations, and the final string after these modifications must end up with the character g. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that we can obtain character g from the string s with some modifications. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, the string s must be such that through some modifications, you end up with the character g. But how does that work? Because each modification reduces the length of the string by one. For example, modifying once takes a string of length ≥2 and replaces the last two characters with one. So, after several modifications, the string will eventually be reduced to a single character, which is the result of those operations. But the problem says that the original string s must be such that when you perform some number of modifications (possibly zero), you end up with the character g. Wait, but the original string s is the one that's considered beautiful. Wait, the first condition says that the string s must consist of exactly n 0s and m 1s. Then, the second condition is that after performing some number of modifications, you can get the character g. But what does that mean for the original string?\n\nWait, the problem says that the string s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:\n\n1. It consists of exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n2. We can obtain character g from s via some number of modifications.\n\nSo, the question is: How many such strings s are there?\n\nBut how do the modifications affect the final character? Let's think about what the modifications do. Each modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with a new character. The rule for the replacement is: if the two characters are both 0, replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0. Wait, no: the problem says, \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, for example, replacing two zeros gives a 1, and any other pair (like 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, or 1 and 1) gives a 0.\n\nSo, the process of modifying the string until it's reduced to one character is equivalent to applying some kind of operation that combines pairs of characters. But the order in which you perform the operations might not matter. Because each operation reduces the length by one, so for a string of length L, you need L-1 operations to get down to one character. However, the way you combine the characters may affect the final result. But perhaps there's a way to model this as a binary operation that's associative, so that the order doesn't matter. Let's think about that.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a string of three characters: a, b, c. If you first combine the last two (b and c) into d, then combine a and d into e. Alternatively, if you combine a and b into e', then combine e' and c into f. Are e and f the same? Let's see. Let's take an example. Suppose the original string is 0, 0, 0. \n\nFirst approach: combine last two 0s into 1, then combine 0 and 1 into 0. Result is 0.\n\nSecond approach: combine first two 0s into 1, then combine 1 and 0 into 0. Same result. So in this case, the order doesn't matter. Another example: 0, 1, 0. Let's see. First combine last two (1 and 0) into 0. Then combine 0 and 0 into 1. Result is 1. Alternatively, combine first two (0 and 1) into 0, then combine with 0: 0 and 0 becomes 1. Same result. Hmm. Interesting. What about combining different orders? Maybe the operation is associative. If that's the case, then the final result depends only on the number of 0s and 1s in the original string, but how?\n\nWait, but the operation is similar to XOR? Let's think. Let's think about the operation of combining two characters. Let me think: when you combine two characters, the result is 1 if both are 0, else 0. Let me think of this as a function f(a, b) = 1 if a == b == 0, else 0. Wait, but that's not the same as XOR. For example, XOR of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be formed with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones such that through a series of allowed modifications, we can reduce the string to the character `g`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Modifications**: Each modification reduces the string length by 1 by replacing the last two characters with a single character. The replacement rule is:\n   - If both characters are '0', replace with '1'.\n   - Otherwise, replace with '0'.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The final result after all possible modifications depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of zeros in the original string. This is because each modification operation effectively reduces the number of zeros by 1 if the pair is not both zeros, and increases the number of zeros by 1 if the pair is both zeros (but this is then replaced by a '1'). However, the parity of the number of zeros determines the final result after all possible reductions.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: We need to count the number of valid strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that can be reduced to `g`. This involves checking if the parity of `n` matches the required result for `g`.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the numbers can be large, we use modulo $10^9 + 7$ for all calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef comb(n, k, fact, inv_fact):\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n\ndef precompute_factorials(max_n, MOD):\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    return fact, inv_fact\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        m = int(input[idx+1])\n        g = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, m, g))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    max_nm = 0\n    for n, m, g in cases:\n        max_nm = max(max_nm, n, m)\n    \n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to max_nm\n    fact, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_nm, MOD)\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, m, g in cases:\n        total = 0\n        # Check if it's possible to reduce the string to g\n        # The final result depends on the number of 0s\n        # Let's think about what the final result would be based on the number of 0s\n        # Suppose the number of 0s is cnt_0, and the number of 1s is cnt_1\n        # The process of combining reduces the string to one character, which is determined by the parity of the number of 0s\n        # Wait, let's think again: For example, if you have a string with 0s and 1s.\n        # Each operation reduces the length by 1. Eventually, you end up with a single character.\n        # The value of that character depends on the number of 0s and how they are combined.\n        # But according to the note in the problem, the first sample has \"01\" and \"10\", which can be reduced to 0.\n        # Let's see:\n        # \"01\" can be reduced in zero steps (already length 2?), but wait, the initial string length is n + m.\n        # Wait, the problem says that the modifications can be done any number of times, including zero. So, the original string must be reducible to g via some number of operations. But the original string can be of any length >= 1. But how can a string of length 1 be modified? It can't. So for the string to be reducible to g, it must be that either:\n        # - The string is already of length 1 and equals g, or\n        # - There exists a sequence of operations leading to g.\n        # However, for the problem's purposes, the string s must be such that after performing some number of operations (possibly zero), you end up with g. But the problem allows any number of operations, so even if the string is of length 1, it must equal g. Otherwise, if it's longer, you can perform operations to reduce it to a single character.\n        # Therefore, the final character after all possible operations (which reduces the string to one character) must be g. Therefore, the problem reduces to: the final character after reducing the string to one character via the allowed operations must be g.\n        # Now, the question is: given the counts of 0s and 1s, what is the final character?\n        # Let's consider the process of reduction. Each operation replaces two characters with one. The replacement rule is:\n        # if both are 0: replace with 1\n        # else: replace with 0\n        # Let's model this as a function. Suppose we have a string with c0 zeros and c1 ones. What is the final character after all reductions?\n        # Let's think recursively. Let's say we have a string with c0 zeros and c1 ones. The final character depends on the parity of c0.\n        # Wait, here's an observation: the final character is 1 if the number of zeros is odd, and 0 otherwise. Or is it the opposite? Let me think.\n        # For example, in the first sample input: n=1, m=1. The strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Let's see:\n        # For \"01\", you can't perform any modification (length 2). So the final character is the result of modifying once. But wait, the problem says that we can perform some number of modifications. So, for a string of length 2, we can perform one modification. Let's do that:\n        # \"01\" → replace the two last characters (0 and 1) with 0. So the result is 0. Which matches the sample's g=0. Similarly for \"10\".\n        # Now consider a string with 3 zeros and 0 ones. The string is \"000\". Let's reduce it:\n        # First, combine last two 0s into 1 → \"01\". Then combine 0 and 1 into 0. Final result is 0. The number of zeros was 3, which is odd. But the result is 0.\n        # Another example: 2 zeros. String \"00\". Combine into 1. Result is 1. Number of zeros is even. Result is 1.\n        # Another example: 1 zero. Can't perform any operation. So the result is 0. Which is odd.\n        # Another example: 4 zeros. Reduce step by step:\n        # \"0000\" → combine last two to get 1 → \"001\" → combine last two (0 and 1) to get 0 → \"00\" → combine to get 1. The result is 1. Number of zeros was 4 (even) → result is 1.\n        # So the pattern seems to be: the final result is 1 if the number of zeros is even, and 0 if the number of zeros is odd. Because when you have an even number of zeros, the result is 1; when odd, it's 0. Wait, but in the first example with 3 zeros, the result was 0 (odd). With 2 zeros, result was 1 (even). With 1 zero, result is 0 (odd). With 4 zeros, result is 1 (even). So yes, the final result is 1 if the number of zeros is even, 0 otherwise.\n\n        # Therefore, the final character is 0 if the number of zeros (n) is odd, and 1 if even. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\n        # Let me rephrase: the final character is 1 if the number of zeros is even, and 0 if it's odd. Because in the case of 3 zeros, the final result was 0 (odd number of zeros). For 2 zeros, result was 1 (even). For 1 zero, result is 0 (odd). For 4 zeros, result is 1 (even).\n\n        # Therefore, the final character is determined by the parity of the number of zeros. So, for the string to be reducible to g, the parity of n (number of zeros) must satisfy:\n        # if g == 0: n is odd\n        # if g == 1: n is even\n\n        # However, there is a catch: the string must have at least one character. So if the string is of length 1, then it must be equal to g. For example, if n=1 and m=0, then the string is \"0\", which is reducible to 0. If g is 0, then it's valid. If the string is \"1\" (n=0, m=1), then it's reducible to 1.\n\n        # But according to our previous analysis, the parity of n (number of zeros) determines the final result. However, for a string with length 1 (n + m = 1), the number of zeros is either 0 or 1. So for n=1, m=0: n is odd → result is 0. Which matches. For n=0, m=1: n is even (0) → result is 1. Which matches.\n\n        # So the conclusion is: the final character is 0 if the number of zeros is odd, and 1 if even. Therefore, for the string to be reducible to g, the number of zeros (n) must be such that:\n        # if g == 0: n is odd\n        # if g == 1: n is even\n\n        # However, there's another condition: the string must be reducible to a single character. Which is always possible, since you can perform (n + m - 1) operations to reduce it to one character. So regardless of the initial string, it can be reduced to a single character. Thus, the only condition is that the parity of n matches the required g.\n\n        # So, the answer is the number of ways to arrange n zeros and m ones, such that the parity of n is correct.\n\n        # Now, check if the required parity is satisfied.\n\n        if g == 0:\n            if n % 2 == 1:\n                # valid, count combinations\n                total = comb(n + m, n, fact, inv_fact)\n            else:\n                total = 0\n        else:  # g == 1\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                total = comb(n + m, n, fact, inv_fact)\n            else:\n                total = 0\n\n        results.append(total % MOD)\n\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Factorials**: Factorials and their modular inverses are precomputed up to the maximum required value to efficiently compute combinations.\n2. **Combination Calculation**: The number of ways to arrange `n` zeros and `m` ones is calculated using combinatorial formulas.\n3. **Parity Check**: Based on the required character `g`, we check if the number of zeros `n` has the correct parity (odd for `g=0`, even for `g=1`).

Thus, the only condition is that the parity of n matches the required g.\n\n        # So, the answer is the number of ways to arrange n zeros and m ones, such that the parity of n is correct.\n\n        # Now, check if the required parity is satisfied.\n\n        if g == 0:\n            if n % 2 == 1:\n                # valid, count combinations\n                total = comb(n + m, n, fact, inv_fact)\n            else:\n                total = 0\n        else:  # g == 1\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                total = comb(n + m, n, fact, inv_fact)\n            else:\n                total = 0\n\n        results.append(total % MOD)\n\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
