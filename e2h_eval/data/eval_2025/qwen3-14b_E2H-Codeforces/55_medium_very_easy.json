    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping certain adjacent characters. Let me think about the allowed swaps. \n\nThe problem says that I can swap adjacent '0's and '1's, and adjacent '1's and '2's. But I can't swap '0's and '2's directly. So, what does that mean for the order of the characters?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, perhaps 0s can be moved past 1s and 2s via a series of swaps? Wait, no. Because if I have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, maybe I can move them past each other through the 1s. For example, suppose I have \"0 1 2\". I can swap the 0 and 1 first, making it \"1 0 2\", then swap the 0 and 2? No, wait, because the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, or between 1 and 2. So the 0 and 2 can't be directly swapped. But in the example, the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So maybe there's a way to arrange the characters such that all 0s come before 1s, and 1s come before 2s? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, let me think. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but 0 can't be directly swapped with 2. However, maybe through a series of swaps, we can move a 0 past a 2. Let's see: suppose I have a 0 followed by a 2. But they can't be swapped directly. However, if there is a 1 between them, maybe I can move the 0 to the right of the 1 and then the 2 can be moved left past the 1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake \"0 2\". Can't swap. So they can't be swapped. But if there's a 1 in between, like \"0 1 2\". Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. I can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, swap 0 and 2? No, that's not allowed. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 can't get past the 2. So in this case, the 0 is stuck before the 2. But what about the 1 and 2? Well, they can be swapped. So in this case, the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1, but then the 2 can be moved to the left of the 1, but not past the 0. Hmm. So perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because they can't be swapped directly, and there's no way to move them past each other. \n\nWait, but if there's a 1 between them, maybe you can move the 0 to the right of the 1 and the 2 to the left of the 1. For example, let's say I have \"0 1 2\". Let me try to move the 0 to the right of the 2. \n\nFirst, swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, swap 0 and 2? Not allowed. So that's stuck. Alternatively, swap the 1 and 2 first. Original is 0 1 2. Swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Now, can I swap the 0 and 2? No. So again, stuck. So the 0 can't move past the 2. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. So in other words, any 0 that comes before a 2 in the original string will still be before it in the final string. Because you can't swap them. So that's a key insight here.\n\nSo the conclusion is that 0s can be rearranged among themselves and with 1s, and 1s can be rearranged among themselves and with 2s. But 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So their relative order is fixed. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think again. Suppose I have a 0 followed by a 2. Since they can't be swapped, they can't be moved. So in the final string, the 0 will be before the 2. But if the original string has a 2 followed by a 0, then they can't be swapped either. So the 2 will stay before the 0. So the relative order between 0s and 2s can't be changed. \n\nBut the 1s can be moved around both 0s and 2s. Because 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. So for example, a 1 can be moved to the left of a 0, or to the right of a 2. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: the positions of 0s and 2s are fixed relative to each other. The 1s can be moved freely between 0s and 2s. But how can we arrange the 1s optimally?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. For example, suppose the original string is \"0 2 1\". Then, since the 0 and 2 can't be swapped, their order remains as 0 followed by 2. However, the 1 can be moved between them. So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0 (but how?), since the 1 can be swapped with 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string is \"0 2 1\". But the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. However, the 2 and 1 can be swapped. So first, swap the 2 and 1 to get \"0 1 2\". Then, the 0 and 1 can be swapped to get \"1 0 2\". So now the 1 is before the 0. But that's allowed because the 1 can be swapped with the 0. \n\nSo in this example, the 1 was moved from after the 2 to between the 0 and 2, and then further to before the 0. So the 1 can be moved freely between 0s and 2s. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s are fixed, but 1s can be placed anywhere between them. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached by grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering that the 0s and 2s must remain in their original relative order. However, the 1s can be arranged in between. \n\nBut how to model this? Let me think. The idea is that the 0s and 2s can't be swapped, so their order in the original string must be preserved in the final string. However, the 1s can be moved around. So, the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but insert the 1s in between them in such a way that the overall string is minimized.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved between the 0s and 2s. For example, if there are 0s and 2s in the original string, but the 1s can be moved to the front, but only if they are in the correct positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be formed by:\n\n- Collecting all the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and then inserting the 1s in between them as much as possible. But how?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved to any position between the 0s and 2s. For example, consider the original string as a sequence of blocks of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the minimal string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and then arrange the 1s as much as possible in between them. But how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the sample input: \"100210\" → output is \"001120\".\n\nOriginal string is '1', '0', '0', '2', '1', '0'.\n\nThe 0s and 2s in the original string are in the order: 0, 0, 2, 0. So in the output, the 0s and 2s are arranged as 0, 0, 0, 2. But how?\n\nWait, the original order of 0s and 2s is: the first 0 is at position 2 (original index 1?), then another 0 at position 3, then a 2 at position 4, then a 0 at position 6. So their relative order is 0, 0, 2, 0. So the final string must have these same 0s and 2s in that order. But in the output, the 0s and 2s are arranged as 0, 0, 0, 2. Which is the same relative order as before. Because the 0s and 2s are in the same order as in the original string. So the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s are inserted between them.\n\nWait, but how can the 0s and 2s be arranged in the same relative order as the original string? Because the original string's 0s and 2s may have other characters (like 1s) between them. But since we can move 1s around, perhaps the 0s and 2s can be grouped together. \n\nWait, for example, in the original string, the first 0 is followed by a 0, then a 2, then a 1, then a 0. So the 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 0, 2, 0. In the output, the 0s and 2s are ordered as 0, 0, 0, 2. Which is the same order as before. Because the original order of 0s and 2s is 0, 0, 2, 0. So the 0s and 2s can be reordered as 0, 0, 0, 2. How is that possible?\n\nAh, because the 0s and 2s can be rearranged among themselves if they are connected via 1s. Wait, but earlier analysis said that 0s and 2s cannot be swapped. But in this example, the original order is 0, 0, 2, 0. So the third element is 2, and the fourth is 0. But in the output, the 2 is after the three 0s. How is that possible? Because the original string had the 2 followed by a 1 and then a 0. So perhaps the 0 that comes after the 2 can be moved to the left of the 2 via the 1s. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think. Let's take the part of the string that includes the 2 and the 0. For example, the substring \"2 1 0\". The 2 and 0 can't be swapped directly. But the 1 can be swapped with the 2 (so 1 and 2 can be swapped), and the 1 can be swapped with the 0. So perhaps the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2 and then the 0 can be moved to the left of the 1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 2 1 0.\n\nSwap 2 and 1: 1 2 0. Then swap 2 and 0? No, that's not allowed. So can't do that. Alternatively, swap 1 and 0: 2 0 1. Then swap 2 and 0? No. So that's not helpful. So how can the 0 be moved to the left of the 2?\n\nWait, maybe there's a way. Let me think again. The original string is \"2 1 0\". The 0 can't be moved past the 2. So in this case, the 2 comes before the 0 in the original string, and in the final string, the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the relative order between the 2 and the 0 is fixed. So in the original example, the 2 comes before the 0, so in the final string, the 2 must come before the 0. But in the output given, the 0s and 2s are ordered as 0, 0, 0, 2. So the 2 is after all the 0s. Which implies that the original order of 0s and 2s must have been such that the 0s were before the 2. \n\nIn the original input, the 0s and 2s are in the order: first two 0s, then a 2, then a 0. So the 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 0, 2, 0. So in the final string, the 0s and 2s must appear in that order. So the 2 must come after the first three 0s. Because the 2 is originally after the first two 0s, but before the last 0. But how can the 0 that is after the 2 be moved to the left of the 2? That would require the 0 to be before the 2 in the final string, but the original order has the 2 before the 0. Which would be impossible. \n\nBut in the sample input, the output is \"001120\". Let's look at the 0s and 2s in the original and output. \n\nOriginal input: 1 0 0 2 1 0. The 0s and 2s are in the order [0, 0, 2, 0]. The output is 0 0 1 1 2 0. So the 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 0, 2, 0. Which is the same as the original. So the 2 is after the first two 0s, and before the last 0. But in the output, the 2 is after the first three 0s. Wait, no. The output is 0,0,1,1,2,0. So the 0s and 2s are 0,0,2,0. Which is the same order as before. So the 2 is between the first two 0s and the last 0. But in the output, the 2 is placed after the first two 0s, but the last 0 is after the 2. So the original order is maintained. \n\nSo how did the 1s get inserted between the 0s and 2? Well, the 1s can be moved around. So the idea is that the 0s and 2s are kept in their original relative order, and the 1s are placed in between them as much as possible, but also possibly before or after. \n\nSo the approach to solving the problem is:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then collect all the 1s, and insert them into the positions between the 0s and 2s, in a way that minimizes the lex order. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother way to think: since the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. So, the minimal lex string is obtained by:\n\n- Arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, but arrange the 1s in between them in such a way that they are as far to the left as possible. Because 1 is less than 2, but greater than 0. So, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would help in making the string lex smaller.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a group of 0s, then a group of 2s. Inserting 1s between them would make the string lex smaller. Because 0 < 1 < 2. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, inserting 1s between them would make the string 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2...1.\n\nBut how can we arrange the 1s optimally? Since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Split the original string into two parts: the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s. \n\n2. Then, arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s in such a way that the overall string is minimized.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. The 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. For example, if the original string has the 0s and 2s as [0, 0, 2, 0], then the final string must have those same elements in that order. The 1s can be placed anywhere between them. \n\nSo, the minimal lex string would be to place as many 1s as possible as early as possible. But since 1 is larger than 0 but smaller than 2, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would be better. \n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s in the best way. For example, between two 0s and 2s, inserting 1s would be better. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence, and between each pair of consecutive elements in this sequence, we can insert some number of 1s. Also, before the first element and after the last element.\n\nBut since we want the lex smallest string, we should insert as many 1s as possible before the 2s and after the 0s. For example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s would allow the 0s to be followed by 1s, then 2s. Which is better than 0 followed by 2. \n\nBut how to decide where to put the 1s. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence of elements. For example, the sequence could be something like [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s can be placed in any positions between these elements. Also, before the first element, and after the last element.\n\nTo minimize the lex order, the 1s should be placed as left as possible. Because placing them earlier in the string would make the string lex smaller. However, we have to consider the elements around them. \n\nFor instance, if we have a 0 followed by a 2. Inserting 1s between them would result in 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s. Because 0 < 1 < 2. \n\nBut if the 0 is followed by another 0, inserting 1s between them would not be helpful. Because 0 followed by 1s followed by 0 would be worse than 0s followed by 0s. Because 0 is better than 1. \n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert all 1s in between the 0s and 2s in the sequence of 0s and 2s. But where exactly?\n\nLet me think. Between two elements in the 0s and 2s sequence, we can insert some 1s. The decision of where to insert the 1s depends on the elements before and after the insertion point.\n\nFor example, if between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s is beneficial. If between a 0 and a 0, inserting 1s would not be beneficial. Similarly, between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s would not be beneficial. \n\nWait, but between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than 2 followed by 0. Because 2 is larger than 1, but 0 is smaller than 1. So in this case, inserting 1s between a 2 and a 0 would make the string lex larger. Because the 2 is followed by 1, which is worse than 2 followed by 0. \n\nSo the rule is: between two elements in the 0s and 2s sequence, insert the 1s only if the current element is 0 and the next is 2. Because inserting 1s between them would give 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2...1. \n\nAlternatively, if the current element is 0 and the next is 0, inserting 1s between them would lead to 0...1...0, which is worse than 0...0...1. \n\nWait, but in that case, the 1s could be placed after the 0s. \n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s, and then for each position between the 0s and 2s, determine whether inserting the 1s there would improve the lex order. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAn alternative approach is to collect all the 1s and then arrange them in the positions where they can contribute the most to the lex order. \n\nLet me think of the entire process as follows:\n\nWe can split the original string into three parts: the 0s, the 1s, and the 2s. But no, because the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order, and the 1s can be placed in between. \n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n1. Iterate through the original string and collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed_chars'.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s in a separate list, say 'ones'.\n\n3. Now, the problem is to insert the 'ones' into the 'fixed_chars' in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest possible.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nThe key idea is that inserting the 1s between certain positions in the 'fixed_chars' list can help. For example, inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is good. But inserting between a 0 and a 0 is bad, because inserting 1s there would increase the lex order. Similarly, inserting between a 2 and a 0 is also bad.\n\nSo the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in the positions where inserting them would not cause the string to be worse. \n\nSo, the best places to insert the 1s are:\n\n- Before the first element of 'fixed_chars' (if that element is 2, inserting 1s before would be better, since 1 is smaller than 2).\n\n- After the last element of 'fixed_chars' (if that element is 0, inserting 1s after would be worse, since 1 is larger than 0).\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s?\n\nLet me think of the 'fixed_chars' as a sequence of elements. For each position between elements (including before the first and after the last), we can insert some 1s. The question is where to insert them to get the lex smallest string.\n\nBut since inserting 1s into positions where they can be placed before higher elements (like 2s) is better. So, for example, inserting all the 1s before the first occurrence of 2 in the fixed_chars would be optimal. \n\nWait, but the fixed_chars may have a mix of 0s and 2s. For example, fixed_chars could be [0, 0, 2, 0]. So inserting 1s between the first two 0s would not be helpful, but inserting between the 0 and 2 would be helpful, and inserting between the 2 and 0 would not be helpful.\n\nSo, the idea is that we can insert all the 1s in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not make the string worse. \n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the 'fixed_chars' list as a sequence of elements. We can iterate through the positions between the elements and decide where to insert the 1s. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to insert as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not cause the string to be worse. \n\nFor example, inserting 1s before the first occurrence of a 2 in the fixed_chars. Because inserting 1s before the 2 would make the string lex smaller. \n\nBut if the fixed_chars starts with 2, then inserting 1s before it would be better than after. \n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- We can insert all the 1s into the positions between the elements of fixed_chars where inserting them would not increase the lex order. \n\nBut how to find those positions? \n\nLet me think of the following approach. We can insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where the current element is 0 and the next element is 2. Because inserting 1s between them would make the string lex smaller. \n\nAlternatively, for the entire fixed_chars list, the 1s can be inserted in the earliest positions where inserting them would not cause a problem. For example, inserting 1s as far left as possible. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Since inserting 1s in front of any 2 in the fixed_chars would be better than leaving them after. For example, if there is a 2 in the fixed_chars, inserting 1s before it (as much as possible) would be better. \n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Collect all the 1s into a list.\n\n- Iterate through the fixed_chars list, and for each position between elements (including before the first and after the last), decide whether inserting 1s here would be beneficial.\n\nBut how to decide that?\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a sequence. For each position i in the sequence (from 0 to len(fixed_chars)), where inserting the 1s would be between fixed_chars[i-1] and fixed_chars[i] (with i=0 being before the first element, and i=len(fixed_chars) being after the last element). \n\nFor each such position, inserting the 1s here would be optimal if the character before the insertion point (or the first element if inserting at the beginning) is 0 or 1, and the character after the insertion point (or the last element if inserting at the end) is 2 or 1. \n\nWait, but since the 1s can be inserted anywhere. However, inserting them in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed before higher elements would be better. \n\nAnother way: since the 1s are all the same, inserting them as far left as possible would be better. For example, inserting all 1s at the beginning of the string. But that's only possible if the first element in fixed_chars is 0 or 1. \n\nBut if the first element in fixed_chars is 2, inserting 1s before it would be better than inserting them after. \n\nSo, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible position in the fixed_chars sequence where inserting them would not cause the string to be worse. \n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Initialize a list called 'result' which is initially empty.\n\n- Initialize a pointer for the 1s (say, ones_ptr = 0).\n\n- Iterate through the fixed_chars list. For each element in fixed_chars, we can insert as many 1s as possible before it, if that is beneficial.\n\nBut how to determine when to insert them.\n\nAlternatively, think of the fixed_chars as a sequence, and for each position between elements, decide whether inserting 1s here is better than inserting them elsewhere. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to insert all the 1s into the positions between 0s and 2s, and also before the first 2, and after the last 0. \n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as consisting of a sequence of 0s and 2s. For example, [0, 0, 2, 0]. \n\nWe can insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. So between the second 0 and the 2. Also, before the first 0, between the 0s, between the 2 and the 0 (but that's not helpful). \n\nBut inserting the 1s before the first 0 would be better than inserting them after. Because 1 is larger than 0, but inserting them before the first 0 would make the string start with 1 followed by 0s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So inserting 1s before the first 0 is not helpful. \n\nSo the optimal positions to insert the 1s are:\n\n- Before the first occurrence of 2 in the fixed_chars. Because inserting 1s here would place them before the 2, which is better than having them after. \n\n- Also, between any 0 and 2. \n\nBut how to find all such positions. \n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be inserted into the fixed_chars in such a way that all 1s are placed before any 2s, and after any 0s. \n\nBecause 1 is less than 2, but greater than 0. So inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would be optimal. \n\nSo the idea is to collect all the 1s and insert them into the positions between the 0s and 2s. \n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a sequence. For example, the fixed_chars could be [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s can be inserted between the 0s and the 2, and after the 2 (but before the next 0). However, inserting 1s between the 2 and the 0 would make the string 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than 2 followed by 0. So that's not helpful. \n\nThus, the best way is to insert all the 1s before the first occurrence of 2 in the fixed_chars. \n\nWait, but in the sample input, the fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s are [1, 1]. Inserting them before the first occurrence of 2 (which is at index 2) would insert them between the two 0s and the 2. So the resulting fixed_chars would be [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0], which is the sample output. \n\nYes, that matches. \n\nAnother example: if the fixed_chars is [2, 0], then inserting the 1s would be before the 2 (since inserting them there would make the string start with 1s followed by 2, which is better than 2 followed by 1s. But since the fixed_chars is [2, 0], and the 2 comes before the 0. But inserting 1s before the 2 would be better. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCollect all the 1s into a list. \n\nThen, iterate through the fixed_chars list, and find the first occurrence of a 2. Insert all the 1s before that 2. \n\nIf there are no 2s in the fixed_chars, then the 1s can be inserted after all the 0s (since there are no 2s to insert before). \n\nIf there are no 0s in the fixed_chars (i.e., the fixed_chars consists of 2s), then the 1s can be inserted before the first 2. \n\nBut what if there are 0s and 2s in the fixed_chars, but no 2s before some 0s. Like [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. Inserting all 1s before the first 2 would be the best option. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Collect all the 1s into a list.\n\n- Find the first occurrence of 2 in the fixed_chars. If there is one, insert all the 1s before it. \n\n- If there is no 2 in the fixed_chars, then insert all the 1s after the existing 0s (since they are all 0s, and inserting 1s after them would be worse than inserting them before. Wait, but inserting them before would be better. Because inserting them before the 0s would make the string start with 1s followed by 0s, which is worse than 0s followed by 1s. \n\nWait, for example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 0], then inserting the 1s before them would give [1, 1, 0, 0], which is worse than [0, 0, 1, 1]. So in this case, inserting the 1s after the fixed_chars is better. \n\nSo the logic is:\n\nIf there are no 2s in the fixed_chars, then inserting the 1s after the fixed_chars (since they are all 0s and inserting them after would be better than inserting them before).\n\nIf there are 2s in the fixed_chars, then inserting the 1s before the first 2. \n\nBut what if there are 2s and 0s in the fixed_chars. For example, [0, 2, 0]. Inserting the 1s before the first 2 (which is at index 1) would insert them between the first 0 and the 2. Then, the 1s are between 0 and 2, which is good. The rest of the fixed_chars is [2, 0], and inserting 1s between them would be bad, but we don't do that. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCollect all the 1s into a list called ones.\n\nCollect the fixed_chars as the list of 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\nIf there are any 2s in fixed_chars:\n\n   find the first index where the character is 2. Insert all the ones before this index.\n\nElse:\n\n   insert all the ones after the fixed_chars.\n\nBut then, how to handle the case where there are multiple 2s. For example, fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]. Inserting the 1s before the first 2 would be the best option. \n\nOnce the 1s are inserted before the first 2, the rest of the fixed_chars is processed normally. \n\nBut what about inserting the 1s in between other positions. For example, if there is a 2 later in the fixed_chars, but inserting the 1s before the first 2 is sufficient. \n\nThis seems to cover all cases. \n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input. \n\nSample input: '100210' → fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The ones are [1, 1]. \n\nThere are 2s in fixed_chars. The first occurrence of 2 is at index 2. Insert the ones before this index. \n\nSo the new list would be:\n\nfixed_chars[0:2] + ones + fixed_chars[2:] → [0, 0] + [1, 1] + [2, 0] → [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0], which is the sample output. \n\nAnother example: input is '20'. The fixed_chars is [2, 0]. There are 2s. First occurrence of 2 is at index 0. Insert the ones before it. So if there are ones, say, [1], then the new list is [1] + [2, 0] → '120'. But the original input is '20' and the output is '20'. But according to the sample input, the third case is input '20' and output '20'. Which makes sense because there are no 1s. \n\nAnother example: input '210'. The original string is '2', '1', '0'. The fixed_chars is [2, 0]. The ones are [1]. The first occurrence of 2 is at index 0. Insert the 1 before it. So the new list is [1] + [2, 0] → '120', which is better than the original '210'. \n\nBut wait, can the 1 be moved before the 2? \n\nOriginal string is '210'. The allowed swaps are between 1 and 2, and between 0 and 1. So the 1 can be swapped with the 2 to get '120', which is the case. So yes. \n\nAnother example: input '210' → output '120'. \n\nAnother example: input is '12' → fixed_chars is [2], ones are [1]. Insert before the first 2 → [1, 2], which is better. \n\nAnother example: input is '012' → fixed_chars is [0, 2]. ones is [1]. Insert before the 2 → [0, 1, 2]. Which is the minimal possible. \n\nWhat about input '021'? The fixed_chars is [",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Characters**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string while maintaining their relative order. These characters cannot be rearranged relative to each other.\n2. **Collect 1s**: Collect all '1's from the input string as they can be freely moved around '0's and '2's.\n3. **Insert 1s Strategically**: Insert all collected '1's before the first occurrence of '2' in the fixed characters list. If there are no '2's, append all '1's after the fixed characters list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is formed by placing '1's optimally where they contribute the most to minimizing the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of '2' in fixed\n    first_two_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(fixed)):\n        if fixed[i] == '2':\n            first_two_index = i\n            break\n    \n    if first_two_index != -1:\n        # Insert all ones before the first '2'\n        result = fixed[:first_two_index] + ones + fixed[first_two_index:]\n    else:\n        # No '2's, append all ones after fixed\n        result = fixed + ones\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(minimum_ternary_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Extract Fixed Characters**: The loop iterates through the input string, separating '1's into a separate list and keeping '0's and '2's in their original order in another list (`fixed`).\n2. **Determine Insertion Point**: The code checks for the first occurrence of '2' in the `fixed` list. If found, it inserts all '1's before this position.\n3. **Construct Result**: If there are no '2's, all '1's are appended at the end of the `fixed` list. This ensures the smallest lexicographical order by placing '1's optimally relative to '0's and '2's.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the optimal placement of '1's to achieve the desired result.",
