The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So we have n+2 towns arranged on a line from 0 to n+1. For towns 1 to n, each has a 50% chance of having a radio tower. Then, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to find the probability that such an assignment is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what configurations of towers allow for such a setup. The key is to model the valid tower placements and then compute their probabilities.\n\nFirst, the signal power assignment must ensure that each town is covered exactly once. Let's think about how the towers can be arranged. \n\nFor example, if there are two adjacent towers, say at positions i and i+1, then their signals can't overlap in a way that covers the same towns. Wait, but maybe not. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach tower's signal with power p covers towns from i-p+1 to i+p-1 (since |c - i| < p → c is in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], right? Wait, for example, if p is 2, then |c -i| < 2 implies c can be i-1, i, or i+1. So the range is from i - p + 1 to i + p -1. Because p-1 is the maximum distance. So the length of coverage is 2p-1 towns. But since the towns are integers, the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. So for a tower at position i with power p, it covers towns from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. So for any tower at position i, its power p must satisfy that i - p + 1 > 0 and i + p - 1 < n+1. Or wait, no: because the signal reaches towns c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered by any tower, for every tower at position i, we must have that |0 - i| >= p. Which implies that p <= i. Similarly, for town n+1, the same applies: p <= (n+1 - i). \n\nBut when assigning the signal powers, we can choose them as needed. So the question is: given a subset of towers (some of the towns 1..n have towers), can we assign signal powers so that each town is covered exactly once, and the ends are not covered?\n\nLet me think of the conditions that the tower positions must satisfy. \n\nThis feels similar to some kind of interval covering problem. Maybe the valid tower configurations are those that form a certain structure, like non-overlapping intervals or something else.\n\nLet me consider the example given. For n=5, towers at 2,4,5. Then the signal power for 2 is set to 2, which covers towns 1, 2, 3. Then 4 and 5 have power 1, covering their own town. So each town is covered exactly once. \n\nWhat's the pattern here? It seems that each tower is responsible for covering a segment of towns, and these segments don't overlap. Also, each tower's coverage must be such that it's exactly covering a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as needing to partition the towns 1..n into ranges, each covered by exactly one tower. And for each such range, the tower must be placed in such a way that it can cover that range. \n\nFor example, if a tower is placed at position i and is responsible for covering towns from a to b, then the power p must be such that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p -1. So the length of the interval is 2p-1. Also, the tower must be at the center of this interval. So for the interval [a, b], the tower must be at (a + b)/2. Which implies that the length of the interval must be odd, and the tower is at the middle. \n\nWait, but for the interval [a, b], the length is (b - a + 1). Let's see: for a tower at i with power p, the interval is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. So the length is (i + p -1) - (i - p + 1) + 1 = 2p - 1. So the length is 2p-1. Therefore, for a tower to cover a certain interval",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly placing radio towers in towns 1 through n, there exists a way to set their signal powers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered at all.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: Each tower can be placed with a 50% probability. The key challenge is to ensure that the configuration of towers allows for valid signal power assignments that meet the coverage constraints.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to count valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n3. **Transition Logic**: For each position `i`, we consider two scenarios:\n   - No tower at position `i`: Then the configuration up to `i-1` must be valid.\n   - Tower at position `i`: Then the previous tower must be at position `i-1` or earlier, ensuring non-overlapping coverage.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses for division operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns considered\n    dp[1] = 1  # only town 1, can have a tower and set power 1\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i, so dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: tower at i, then we need to check if there's a tower at i-1\n        # or a tower at some position j < i-1 such that the coverage doesn't overlap\n        # However, the valid configuration is when the tower at i covers exactly i\n        # which requires that there is no tower at i-1, or that the previous tower\n        # is placed such that it does not cover i. But this seems complex.\n        # Actually, the recurrence is dp[i] += dp[i-2], because if there's a tower at i,\n        # then the previous tower must be at i-2 or earlier, but this is tricky.\n        # Wait, looking at the sample input for n=2: answer is 1/4, which corresponds to\n        # towers at both 1 and 2.
