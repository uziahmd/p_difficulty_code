            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is a tile. The output for each case is the minimal draws needed.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each of the three given tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If not, determine how many more tiles are needed to form one.\n\nBut since she can draw any tiles, including duplicates, I need to consider all possibilities of adding tiles to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nCase 1: Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: If not, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nSo, for each possible scenario, what's the minimal steps?\n\nLet's first think about checking whether the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu): all three must be same tile. Like 9m, 9m, 9m. So check if all three are same.\n\nFor a sequence (shuntsu): they must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. Like 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So the three tiles must be in same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo for the initial three tiles, check if either of these conditions is met.\n\nIf yes, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding, there exists a mentsu.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles can form a triplet with one more tile (like two of the same, and adding another), then the answer would be 1. Or if they can form a sequence by adding one tile (like 1s, 2s, 4s, adding 3s gives a sequence).\n\nBut how do I check all possibilities?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, the possible ways to form a mentsu after adding some tiles. The minimal steps would be 0, 1, 2, or maybe even 3? Well, but the question says that she can draw any tiles, so perhaps the minimal steps can be determined by considering the best possible way.\n\nLet me think about possible cases where the answer is 0, 1, 2, etc.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p. The current tiles don't form a mentsu. However, adding one tile (say 1p) would allow 2p, 3p, 1p to form a sequence (1p, 2p, 3p). So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would form a triplet (needs 1 more tile). Alternatively, adding 3m would form a sequence (1m, 2m, 3m). So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m gives a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nBut if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m, then answer is 0.\n\nNow, the problem is to find for the given three tiles, what's the minimal steps to reach a state where there's a mentsu.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each possible way to form a mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute how many tiles need to be added to reach that state, and take the minimum over all possibilities.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nLet me think about each possible mentsu that can be formed with the existing tiles plus some added ones.\n\nFor example, for the triplet case:\n\nSuppose there are two tiles of the same type. Then adding one more tile would form a triplet. So the required steps would be 1.\n\nOr, if there's one tile of a certain type, then adding two more tiles of that type would form a triplet. So steps would be 2.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nSo perhaps I need to consider all possible triplet and sequence possibilities and calculate the minimal steps needed for each.\n\nBut how to generate all possible possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, for the given three tiles, what's the minimal steps required to form a triplet or a sequence",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking for existing valid mentsu and, if none exist, calculating the minimum additional tiles required to form one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Count Frequencies**: For each tile, count how many times each tile appears. This helps in determining how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet.\n3. **Check for Triplet Possibility**: Determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet by considering the frequency of each tile.\n4. **Check for Sequence Possibility**: For each suit, check if the numbers on the tiles can form a sequence by considering possible additions of tiles to complete the sequence.\n5. **Determine Minimum Draws**: Calculate the minimum number of tiles required from both triplet and sequence possibilities and return the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef min_tiles_to_win(tiles):\n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    # Check for triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return 0\n    # Check for sequence\n    # All same suit?\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n    for t in tiles:\n        if t[1] != suit:\n            break\n    else:\n        # same suit, check if numbers are consecutive\n        nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            return 0\n    \n    # Not already a mentsu, need to calculate min draws\n    # Count frequency of each tile\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        freq[t] += 1\n    \n    # Check for possible triplet\n    max_count = max(freq.values())\n    if max_count == 2:\n        # Need 1 more\n        triplet_need = 1\n    elif max_count == 1:\n        # Need 2 more\n        triplet_need = 2\n    else:\n        triplet_need = 2  # if there's a triplet already, but that's handled earlier\n    \n    # Check for possible sequences\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for t in tiles:\n        suits[t[1]].append(int(t[0]))\n    \n    min_seq_need = float('inf')\n    for s in suits:\n        nums = suits[s]\n        nums.sort()\n        # Try to find the minimal tiles to add to form a sequence\n        # Check all possible sequences of length 3\n        # We can try to extend the current numbers\n        # For example, if we have [1,2,4], we can add 3 to make 1-2-3 or 2-3-4\n        # Or if we have [1,3,5], we can add 2 and 4 to make 1-2-3 or 3-4-5, etc.\n        # So for the current numbers, find the best possible sequence\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences that can be formed with the current numbers plus some additions\n        # Let's consider all possible sequences that can be formed with 3 numbers in the same suit\n        # Find the minimal number of tiles needed to complete any such sequence\n        \n        # For each number in the list, check what sequences can be completed\n        # Also, consider sequences that may not yet be present\n        # For example, if we have [1,2], then adding 3 would complete 1-2-3\n        # If we have [1,3], adding 2 would complete 1-2-3\n        # If we have [2,3], adding 1 would complete 1-2-3\n        # So for all possible sequences, check if we can form it with current tiles plus some additions\n        \n        # To find the minimal additions, we can check all possible sequences that can be formed with the current numbers\n        # and see what's the minimal required\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences of 3 consecutive numbers in 1-9\n        # For each such sequence, check how many of its elements are already present in nums\n        # The required additions would be 3 minus the count of existing elements in the sequence\n        # Then take the minimal over all sequences\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences\n        possible_sequences = []\n        for i in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n            possible_sequences.append(seq)\n        \n        # For each possible sequence, compute how many tiles are missing\n        min_seq_add = float('inf')\n        for seq in possible_sequences:\n            count = 0\n            for num in seq:\n                if num in nums:\n                    count += 1\n            needed = 3 -
