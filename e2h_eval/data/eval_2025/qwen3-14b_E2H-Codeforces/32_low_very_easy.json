Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when I remove one element, I want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to check for each element, what happens if I remove it. Then compute the instability for each case and pick the minimum. But wait, if the array is large (like n=1e5), this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. Because for each element, finding max and min would take O(n) time, leading to O(n²) total time. That's way too slow for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let me think: the original array's max and min are known. But when we remove an element, how does that affect the new max and min?\n\nLet's think about the original array sorted. If the array is sorted, then the max is the last element, the min is the first. If I remove an element, the new max and min would be determined by the remaining elements. But perhaps, for the optimal case, the best is to remove either the first element or the last element (the min or max), but maybe not always.\n\nWait, but maybe the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the cases where we remove the first element, the last element, or some other elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the sorted array. Suppose the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. The original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, when we remove one element, the new instability will be the difference between the new max and new min.\n\nIf we remove the first element (a[0]), then the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. The instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf we remove the last element (a[-1]), the new max is a[-2], and the new min is a[0]. Instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut there's also the possibility that removing some other element (not the first or last) might lead to a better result. For example, if the array is [1,3,3,7], the original instability is 6. If we remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. Which is better than removing the first element (which would give 3-3=0? Wait no. Wait the original array is [1,3,3,7]. If you remove the first element (1), the array becomes [3,3,7], instability is 7-3=4. If you remove the last element (7), the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. So in that case, the best is to remove the last element. But the example says that removing 7 gives instability 2, which is correct. So the answer for that case is 2.\n\nBut how to find the minimal instability?\n\nWait, if the array is sorted, then the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[n-2] - a[0]) and (a[n-1] - a[1]) and ... other possibilities? Or perhaps, the minimal instability is the minimum between the two options (removing first or last element) and other options where the max and min are adjusted based on the removed element.\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, then the instability after removing any element is the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements. So for the sorted array, when you remove an element, the new max and min can be:\n\nIf the element removed is not the first or last, then the new max is still the last element, and the new min is the first element. So the instability remains the same as before. So in this case, removing any element except the first or last would not change the instability. Therefore, the only way to reduce the instability is to remove either the first or last element.\n\nWait, that's an important insight. Let me think again. Suppose the array is sorted. Then, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove any element that's not the first or last, then the new array's min is a[0], max is a[-1], so instability is same as before. Therefore, the only way to get a lower instability is to remove either the first element or the last element. Because if you remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and max is a[-1], so instability is a[-1] - a[",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us efficiently determine the potential new minimum and maximum values when removing elements.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: After sorting, the minimal instability can be achieved by either removing the first element or the last element. This is because removing any other element does not change the min or max values of the array.\n3. **Calculate Instability**: Compute the instability for both cases (removing the first element and removing the last element) and return the minimum of these two values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1])\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n- **Instability Calculation**: \n  - Removing the first element results in the instability being calculated as `a[-2] - a[0]`.\n  - Removing the last element results in the instability being calculated as `a[-1] - a[1]`.\n- **Efficiency**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and computing the minimum instability is done in constant time, making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for large inputs up to 100,000 elements.",
