Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b candles he collects, he can make one new candle. And this new candle can be used again, which in turn will become another burned-out one. So it's like a process that can loop until he can't make any more candles.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of hours. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, so 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. Now, he uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned ones. He can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 burned candle. Which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Now 2 burned. Not enough for 3. But wait, maybe there's another way? Wait, the example output is 8. Let me check. 6 + 2 = 8? Oh, but then after using the two new ones, he has 2 burned. But 2 is less than 3. So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the sample. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and the number of burned candles. Initially, the total hours is a. Then, the burned candles are a. Then, while the number of burned candles is >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, we take the number of burned candles, divide by b (integer division?), get the number of new candles. Add that to the total hours. Then, the new burned candles are the number of new candles (since each new candle is used once, and then becomes burned again). But wait, the process is:\n\nEach time you make new candles from the burned ones. So, for example, if you have x burned candles, you can make x // b new ones. Then, those new ones are used, which adds x//b hours. And then those x//b candles become burned again. So the process continues.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think with variables.\n\nLet's say we have:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nThen, while burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = new_candles + (burned % b) \n\nWait, because after making new_candles, the remaining burned candles are the remainder (burned % b) plus the new_candles that are now burned after being used. Wait, no. Because when you make new_candles, you use up (new_candles * b) burned candles. So the remaining burned candles would be (burned - new_candles * b) + new_candles. Because the new_candles are used, so they become burned again. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nOriginal burned candles: let's say we have 'burned' number. We take as many as possible to make new candles. For each new candle made, we need b burned ones. So, the number of new candles is (burned // b). Then, after making them, how many burned candles are left?\n\nThe number of burned candles used is (new_candles * b). So remaining is (burned - new_candles * b). But then, the new_candles are used, so they become burned again. So the total burned is (burned - new_candles * b) + new_candles.\n\nYes. So, for example, in the first sample:\n\nInitial burned is 4. b is 2.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2=2. So burned becomes 4 - 2*2 = 0 + 2 = 2. Then, in next iteration, 2 >= 2. new_candles is 1. burned becomes 2 - 2*1 = 0 +1 =1. Then, 1 < 2. So stop.\n\nSo total hours is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nYes. So the process is:\n\nWe can model this with a loop. Let's code this.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nloop:\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles \n\nrepeat until burned < b.\n\nSo that's the algorithm.\n\nNow, let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4, burned is 4.\n\nloop:\n\nburned >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2=2. total is 4+2=6. burned is (4%2=0) +2 = 2.\n\nloop again: 2 >=2. new_candles=1. total is 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1 =1. loop ends.\n\nSo output 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal is 6, burned is 6.\n\nloop: 6 >=3. new_candles=2. total becomes 6+2=8. burned is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So loop ends. Output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burned is 5. loop: 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burned is 0 +1 =1. loop ends. So total 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Initial total 5, burned=5.\n\nloop: 5//3=1. total is 5+1=6. burned is 5%3=2 +1=3. loop again: 3//3=1. total 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So total 7.\n\nYes. So that seems to work.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen, initialize total = a, burned =a.\n\nloop while burned >=b:\n\n    new_candles = burned //b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned %b) + new_candles \n\nreturn total.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b. Then process as above.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead input as two integers. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 4 2, the second is 6 3. But the input is given as a single line with two integers. Wait, the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. So for example, the first input line is '4 2', and the output is 7.\n\nSo the code would read a and b from input. Then compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. Let's test this code with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 4 2:\n\ntotal starts at 4, burned 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew = 4//2=2. total 6. burned = 0 +2 =2.\n\nLoop again: new=2//2=1. total 7. burned is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. Output 7.\n\nSecond example: 6 3.\n\ntotal is 6, burned 6.\n\nnew=6//3=2. total 8. burned is 0 +2=2. loop ends. Output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output 5+1=6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Output 7.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase when a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because burned is 1 <2.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. burned is 2. new is 1. total becomes 3. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. total is 3. Then new is 1. total 4. burned is 0 +1 =1. loop ends. So output 4.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total 7, burned 7.\n\nLoop: 7//3=2. total becomes 7+2=9. burned is 7%3=1 +2=3.\n\nLoop again: 3//3=1. total 10. burned is 0+1=1. loop ends. So total 10.\n\nYes. Let's check manually:\n\n7 hours. Then 7 burned. Make 2 new (using 6), 2 hours. Now burned is 1 + 2 =3. Make 1 new. 1 hour. Burned is 0 +1=1. Total 7+2+1=10. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, considering he can reuse the burned-out candles to make new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Burned Candles**: After each hour, the burned-out candles are collected. These can be reused to make new candles.\n3. **Reuse Process**: For every `b` burned-out candles, Vasily can make one new candle. This process is repeated until there are not enough burned-out candles left to make a new one.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Continuously check if there are enough burned-out candles to make new ones. If so, calculate the number of new candles, add the hours they provide, and update the count of burned-out candles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburned = a\nwhile burned >= b:\n    new = burned // b\n    total += new\n    burned = burned % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour. The variable `burned` keeps track of the number of burned-out candles.\n2. **Loop for Reuse**: As long as the number of burned-out candles (`burned`) is at least `b`, we can make new candles. The number of new candles made is calculated by integer division of `burned` by `b`.\n3. **Update Total Hours**: Each new candle contributes an additional hour of light, so the total hours are incremented by the number of new candles.\n4. **Update Burned Candles**: After making new candles, the remaining burned-out candles are updated to the remainder from the division plus the new candles that will be burned out after use.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and reusing candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources and correctly calculating the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.",
