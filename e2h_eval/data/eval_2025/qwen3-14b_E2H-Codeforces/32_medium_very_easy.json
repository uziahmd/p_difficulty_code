    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the max minus min of the array. So, the problem is to figure out which element to remove so that the max and min of the remaining array have the smallest possible difference.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, what happens when we remove it. But if I do that naively, for each element, I have to compute the max and min of the array without that element. However, for n up to 1e5, that would be O(n^2) time, which is not feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to precompute the max and min for all possible cases. Let's think. For example, if the array is sorted, then removing an element would affect the max and min in certain ways. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose the array is sorted. Let's say the original array is sorted as a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}. Then, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, if we remove an element, the new instability depends on which element we remove.\n\nIf I remove the first element (a[0]), then the new array's min is a[1], and max is a[-1]. So instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf I remove the last element (a[-1]), then the new instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nIf I remove some element in the middle, say a[i], then the min is still a[0] and the max is a[-1], unless the element removed is the only one that was contributing to the max or min. Wait, no. If the array is sorted, then removing any element in the middle won't affect the max or min. Because the max is the last element, and the min is the first. Unless you remove the first or last element.\n\nSo, for example, if the array is sorted, then the instability after removing an element is:\n\nif the element is the first one: new instability is a[-1] - a[1]\n\nif the element is the last one: new instability is a[-2] - a[0]\n\nif the element is somewhere in the middle: the instability is a[-1] - a[0], same as before.\n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. So, in this case, the minimal instability would be either the original instability (if we remove a middle element), or the instability when removing the first or last element. But wait, maybe not. Because if the array is sorted, then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If we remove the first element, then the new instability is a[-1] - a[1], which could be smaller than the original. Similarly for removing the last element.\n\nBut for elements in the middle, removing them doesn't change the max and min. So the instability remains the same as original. Therefore, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (original instability, a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if the array is sorted, and we have multiple elements with the same value? Like in the first example: [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, the original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 7-1=6. So the minimal is 2. Which is achieved by removing the last element.\n\nSo according to this, the minimal instability is the minimum between the original instability (if we remove a middle element), and the two possibilities when removing the first or last element.\n\nBut in this case, the original instability is 6. The options are:\n\nremove first element: instability is a[-1] - a[1] =7-3=4\n\nremove last element: a[-2]-a[0] =3-1=2\n\nso the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the answer is min( (a[-1]-a[0]), (a[-1]-a[1]), (a[-2]-a[0]) )\n\nWait, but in this case, the original instability is a[-1]-a[0], which is 6. But the minimal is achieved by removing the last element, which gives a[-2]-a[0].\n\nSo, the conclusion is that when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and a[-1] - a[0] if we remove a middle element). Wait, but the a[-1] - a[0] is the original instability, which is not better than the other options. So for the sorted array, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if the array has more than two elements. For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove the first element, the instability is 4-2=2. If we remove the last element, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove any other element, the instability is 4-1=3. So the minimal is 2. So the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]) ), which in this case is 2.\n\nSo, the idea is that when the array is sorted, the best possible instability is the minimum between removing the first element (so the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]), or removing the last element (so the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]). Because those are the two options that can reduce the instability. Removing any other element would leave the instability as a[-1] - a[0], which is higher than the two options.\n\nSo the approach is to sort the array, and then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? Like in the second example, where input is 2 elements, 1 and 100000. Then, after removing one element, the array has one element, so instability is 0. So for n=2, the answer is 0. But according to the above approach, when n is 2, the sorted array is [1, 100000]. Then, a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - a[1] (but a[1] is 100000, so 0). Similarly a[-2] - a[0] is 1 - 1 = 0. So the min is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then, compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has more than two elements, but removing some element in the middle could lead to a lower instability?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 3, the instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 5, the instability is 6-1=5. So, no improvement. But if we remove 6, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is better. So according to the previous approach, the answer would be min( a[-1]-a[1] = 6-3=3, a[-2]-a[0] =5-1=4. So the minimum is 3. Which is correct. So in this case, the answer is 3.\n\nBut in this case, the best option is to remove the first element (the 1) or the last element (the 6). Wait, no. Wait, the array is [1,3,4,5,6]. If we remove the first element, the array becomes [3,4,5,6], instability is 6-3=3. If we remove the last element, the array becomes [1,3,4,5], instability is 5-1=4. So the minimum is 3. Which is the a[-1] - a[1] (since a[-1] is 6, a[1] is 3).\n\nSo the approach of considering the two cases (removing first or last element) gives us the correct answer.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If we remove 5, the instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 6, instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, instability is 6-2=4. So the minimal is 4. Which is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1] =6-2=4 and a[-2]-a[0]=5-1=4). So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 5. If we remove the first element, the instability is 5 (6-2=4?), wait:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Remove first element: [2,3,4,5,6], instability is 6-2=4. Remove last element: [1,2,3,4,5], instability 5-1=4. So the answer would be 4. Which is the minimum between 6-2=4 and 5-1=4. So yes.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. Then, the original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So the answer is 4. Which is a[-2] - a[0] (5-1=4).\n\nSo the approach of taking the minimum between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0] gives the correct answer.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what about if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]. Suppose we remove 3, but that's not the first or last element. Then the instability is 8-1=7, which is worse than the original instability. So the minimal is achieved by removing the first or last element.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum of the two values: (max after removing first element, min after removing first element) and (max after removing last element, min after removing last element). But how to compute that?\n\nOnce the array is sorted, the max after removing the first element is a[-1], the min is a[1]. So the instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nSimilarly, removing the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nSo, the answer is the minimum between these two values.\n\nBut why not consider other possibilities? Like, maybe removing some element in the middle that allows the max and min to be closer.\n\nBut in the sorted array, if we remove an element that's not the first or last, the max and min of the array remain the same. For example, if you have array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and you remove 3, the max is 5, the min is 1. So instability is 4, which is same as original. So removing any middle element doesn't help. Thus, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the two options of removing the first or last element.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array, then compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nBut wait, what if the array has n=3 elements?\n\nFor example, [1, 2, 3]. If we remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If we remove 3, instability is 2-1=1. If we remove 2, instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 1. Which is min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 1]. Then, after removing any element, the instability is 0. So the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] =1-1=0, and a[-2] - a[0] =1-1=0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 5, 5, 5]. The sorted array is [1,5,5,5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 5-5=0. If we remove 5 (any of the others), the instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 0. Which is a[-1] - a[1] (5-5=0). So the code would compute that.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and the array.\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- If n is 2, then the answer is 0 (because after removing one element, the array has one element, so instability is 0).\n\nWait, but according to the code for n=2, the sorted array is [a[0], a[1]]. Then, a[-1] - a[1] is a[1] - a[1] =0. a[-2] - a[0] is a[0] - a[0] =0. So the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code can handle that case.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3?\n\nFor example, n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The answer is min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    min_instability = min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\n    print( min_instability )\n\nWait, but what about when n is larger than 2?\n\nYes, for n >=2.\n\nBut for n=2, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] which is a[1] - a[1] =0, and a[-2] -a[0] is a[0] -a[0] =0. So min is 0. So even if n=2, the code can be handled by the same formula.\n\nSo perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nsort the array.\n\nthen compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nand that's the answer.\n\nBut for n=2, the a[-1] is a[1], and a[1] is the same as a[-1], so the first term is zero. Similarly for the second term. So the code works.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list.\n\nSort list.\n\nif n == 1: ... but n is at least 2.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nresult = min( sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1], sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0] )\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, let's test the first example.\n\nFirst example input is 4 elements [1,3,3,7]. sorted is [1,3,3,7]. Then:\n\nsorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1] → 7-3 =4.\n\nsorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0] →3-1=2. So min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond example input is 2 elements [1,100000]. sorted is [1, 100000]. Then:\n\nsorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1] → 100000 - 100000 =0.\n\nsorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0] →1-1=0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) →1.\n\nAnother example: n=3, [1, 3, 5]. min(5-3=2, 3-1=2) →2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 6]. sorted is [1,2,5,6]. min(6-2=4, 5-1=4) →4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]. sorted. min(8-3=5, 7-1=6) →5. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead n from input, then read the list. Sort it, then compute the min between the two options.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1]\n\n    option2 = sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nBut wait, even when n is 2, the code can be handled by the same calculation. For example, sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1] is sorted_a[1] - sorted_a[1] = 0. Same for option2. So the code can be written without checking for n=2. So:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\noption1 = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1]\n\noption2 = sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0]\n\nprint( min(option1, option2) )\n\nBut for n=2, sorted_a[-1] is the second element, sorted_a[1] is the same. So option1 is 0. Similarly for option2. So the code works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na_sorted = sorted(a)\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]\n\n    option2 = a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would have a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1] is a_sorted[1] - a_sorted[1] =0. So the code can be written without the n==2 check. So the code can be simplified as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na_sorted = sorted(a)\n\noption1 = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]\n\noption2 = a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]\n\nprint( min(option1, option2) )\n\nBut for n=2, a_sorted[-1] is a_sorted[1], and a_sorted[-2] is a_sorted[0]. So yes, option1 is 0, option2 is 0. So min is 0. So the code works for all n >=2.\n\nSo the code can be written like that.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: 7 - 3 =4\n\noption2: 3 -1 =2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]\n\noption1: 100000 - 100000 =0\n\noption2: 1 -1 =0 → min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. option1 is 3-2=1, option2 is 2-1=1. min is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. option1 is 1-1=0, option2 is 1-1=0. min is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. option1 is 5-2=3, option2 is 4-1=3 → min is 3.\n\nSo code seems to work.\n\nThus, this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element.
