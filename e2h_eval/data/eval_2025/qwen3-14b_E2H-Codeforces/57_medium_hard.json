His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in the Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the points from the first and second tours, but they are not linked to names. So, we have to consider all possible pairings of the first and second tour points for the participants, and determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have, given that his total is at least x.\n\nSo, the key here is that for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but since the a's and b's are separate lists, we can pair them in any way. However, Vasya is one of the participants, and there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that their sum is >=x. Our task is to find the best possible rank (minimum possible) and worst possible rank (maximum possible) that Vasya can have, considering all possible pairings.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank: We want to maximize Vasya's total points so that he is as high as possible. Because if he has the highest possible total, then he can be in first place. But how?\n\nWait, the best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged in such a way that as many as possible people have lower totals than him. But since we can arrange the pairings, we can choose for Vasya the maximum possible a_i + b_j, and then arrange other pairings to minimize the number of people with higher totals than him.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by how many people can have a total higher than Vasya's maximum possible total. Wait, no. Because for the best case, we can choose Vasya's total to be as high as possible. Then, the best possible rank is 1 if there's no one else with a higher total. But how do we find that?\n\nWait, the best possible rank for Vasya would be when he has the maximum possible total (so that as few as possible people can have higher totals). For example, if he can have a total of S, then the number of people who can have a total higher than S is the number of people who can have a_i + b_j > S. But how do we compute that?\n\nBut to maximize his total, we need to take the maximum possible a_i + b_j. But since the pairings are arbitrary, how can we find the maximum possible sum for Vasya? Well, the maximum sum is the maximum a_i plus the maximum b_j. Because we can pair the maximum a with the maximum b. So, for the best case, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible, which is max_a + max_b.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another combination where the sum is even higher? No, because the maximum possible sum is the sum of the top a and top b. So that's correct.\n\nOnce we have that, we can calculate how many people can have a sum higher than that. But since we can arrange the pairings, perhaps we can arrange that no one else has a sum higher than that. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the pairings are arbitrary. So, for the best case, we can arrange that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and arrange the other pairings so that as few as possible people have higher sums. So, for the best possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible number of people who can have a sum higher than Vasya's sum. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way to pair the a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is the maximum. But how to check that?\n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, so there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x. But for the best possible rank, we can choose that pair for Vasya, and then arrange the rest in a way that no one else has a higher sum than him. So, the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a sum for Vasya that is higher than all possible other pairings. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, and then count the number of participants that can have a sum higher than that. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because when you pair the a's and b's, you can't have all possible combinations. For example, if you pair the maximum a with the maximum b for Vasya, then the other participants can't use those same a and b. So, perhaps the way to find the best possible rank is:\n\nFor the best case, we want to select a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, and then arrange the rest of the pairs such that as few as possible have a sum larger than that.\n\nBut how can we compute the minimal number of people that have a sum larger than Vasya's sum?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of an approach.\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can choose Vasya's sum to be the maximum possible. Let's say that maximum possible sum is S. Then, we need to find how many people can have a sum greater than S. However, since the pairings are arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange that no one else has a sum higher than S. Because if S is the maximum possible sum (i.e., the sum of the top a and top b), then no other pairing can have a higher sum than that. Because if you take any other a and b, their sum would be less than or equal to that maximum.\n\nWait, that's true. For example, suppose the maximum a is A, and maximum b is B. Then, the sum A + B is the maximum possible. So, if Vasya takes that pair, then no other participant can have a higher sum. So, in that scenario, Vasya's best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut what if there are multiple people that can have that same maximum sum? For example, if there are multiple a's equal to A, and multiple b's equal to B. Then, if Vasya takes one of them, the other participants can have other pairs that also sum to A+B. In that case, the jury can assign Vasya's rank as 1, or as low as possible depending on their choice. But since the problem says that in case of same points, the jury can assign the places as they like. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya is placed first, even if others have the same sum.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is 1. Wait, but that's only if there exists a possible pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum. Which is possible by choosing the maximum a and maximum b for him.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1? But in the first sample input, the output is 1 for the best. Let me check the first sample:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, all a's and b's are 1. So Vasya's sum is 2. All participants have 2. So the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign it), and worst is 5.\n\nSo yes, the best possible rank is 1. So for the best possible rank, the answer is always 1, unless there is no way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum. Wait, but how can that happen? Because the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i +b_j >=x. So for the best case, we can select that pair (i,j) for Vasya, and then arrange others. But if that pair's sum is the maximum possible, then the best rank is 1. Otherwise, if there's a higher sum possible, then we can choose that.\n\nWait, but how can we choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya? Because for the best case, we want to maximize his sum. So the maximum sum he can have is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j. So regardless of x, as long as there exists a pair that gives him at least x, we can choose the maximum possible sum for him, which would be the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut why in the second sample input, the best is 1? Let me check the second sample:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n6 7\n\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nThe output is 1 5.\n\nIn that case, the maximum a is 6 (from the first list), and maximum b is 8. So sum is 14. So Vasya can have 14. Then, other participants can't have higher than that. So best possible rank is 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Unless there is some constraint that I'm missing. But according to the problem statement, the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So, the teacher can choose any pair (i,j) for Vasya as long as a_i +b_j >=x. So for the best possible rank, we can choose the pair (i,j) that gives the maximum possible sum, which would allow Vasya to be first.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is 1. So for the output, the first number is always 1. But wait, in the first sample input, the output is 1. But what if there's a scenario where even the maximum possible sum for Vasya is not higher than others? No, because the maximum possible sum is the maximum possible. So if you pair the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya, then no one else can have a higher sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the output is always 1. Wait, but why does the sample input 2 have output 1 as the best? Because that's the case. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. But why? Because the problem allows us to arrange the pairings such that Vasya has the maximum possible sum, thus making him first.\n\nBut then why does the first sample output have 1 as the best? Because that's correct. So the first part of the answer is always 1. But why does the problem have that as part of the question? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible place that Vasya could have. So, for the best possible, the teacher needs to find the minimal possible rank. So, the best possible is 1, but perhaps in some cases, even if Vasya's sum is maximum, there are other participants with the same sum. However, the problem states that in case of same points, the jury can assign the places. So for the best possible, the teacher can arrange that Vasya is first. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the first part of the output is always 1. Therefore, the first part is easy. Now, the main problem is to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nNow, the worst possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still at least x), and the other participants are arranged in such a way that as many as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. For the worst case, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i +b_j >=x, and then arrange the other pairings to maximize the number of participants with a sum higher than Vasya's sum. Then, the worst possible rank is that number plus 1.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Choose a sum S for Vasya such that S is >=x, and as small as possible. Because that would allow more people to have higher sums than him.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are multiple possible S values. For example, if x is 2, and there are possible S values of 2, 3, etc. Choosing the smallest possible S (i.e., exactly x) would allow more people to have higher sums than him. So for the worst case, we want to select the minimal possible S (>=x) for Vasya. Because that would allow the maximum number of people to have higher sums.\n\nBut how to find that minimal S?\n\nBut how to find the minimal S that is achievable. Because the minimal S is x, but it's possible that there's no pair (a_i, b_j) with sum exactly x. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So, the minimal S is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\nBut for the worst case, we need to choose the minimal S (>=x) that can be achieved. Because that would allow the maximum number of people to have higher sums than him.\n\nBut how to find that minimal S? Well, the minimal possible S is x. If there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum exactly x, then we can take that. Otherwise, the minimal S is the minimal sum that is >=x. But how to find that?\n\nBut perhaps for the worst case, we can take any S that is >=x, but to maximize the number of people with higher sum, we need to choose the minimal possible S. Because if S is higher, then there may be fewer people with higher sums. So, the worst case would be when Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still at least x).\n\nSo, the approach for the worst case is:\n\nFind the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). Then, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than S. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible S that is >=x? Well, the minimal S is the minimal value that is >=x and can be formed by a_i + b_j for some i and j.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, we can take S as the minimal possible value that is >=x. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal S is x, but if there is no such pair, then it's the next possible. However, how do we find that?\n\nBut perhaps for the worst case, we don't need to find the exact minimal S. Instead, we can consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that are >=x, and for each such pair, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum higher than that pair's sum. Then, the worst possible rank is the maximum among all these numbers plus 1. However, this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFor the worst case, the idea is to choose a sum S for Vasya (>=x) such that as many other participants as possible have a sum higher than S. To maximize this count, S should be as small as possible (but still >=x). Therefore, we need to find the minimal S (>=x) that can be achieved by some pair, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum higher than S.\n\nBut how to find the minimal S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, we can choose any S >=x, and find the maximum number of people that can have a sum higher than S. But to find the worst possible rank, we need to choose the S that gives the maximum number of people with higher sum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: find the minimal possible S (>=x) such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum S, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum higher than S.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, we can take S as the minimal possible value that is >=x, and then compute the maximum number of people that can have a sum higher than S. However, how to find this S?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal S is x. So, let's first check if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum exactly x. If yes, then we can take that as S. If not, then the minimal S is the minimal sum that is greater than x and can be achieved by some pair.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we can consider all possible S that are >=x. For each such S, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum higher than S. Then, take the maximum of these numbers, and add 1 to get the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, trying all possible S is not feasible. Therefore, we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the worst case, the maximum number of participants that can have a higher sum than Vasya is determined by the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be arranged to have a sum higher than S, where S is the sum chosen for Vasya. However, since the pairings are arbitrary, we need to find the maximum possible number of such pairs, given that one pair (for Vasya) is fixed.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the problem is that the pairings are permutations. That is, each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. So, when considering the worst case, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya (with sum S >=x), and then arrange the remaining pairs in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum > S.\n\nSo, the question becomes: For a given S (sum for Vasya), what's the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, given that one pair is fixed (a_i, b_j) = (some pair with sum S), and the rest are paired optimally.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut for the worst case, we need to choose S (>=x) such that this maximum number is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to find this S?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nFor the worst case, the optimal S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Because that allows more people to have higher sums.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that have sum >=x. Among these, find the one with the minimal possible sum. Let's call this S_min.\n\n2. Then, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum higher than S_min. This is done by pairing the a's and b's in a way that as many pairs as possible have sum > S_min, while using one pair (for Vasya) with sum exactly S_min.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut how to find S_min? Well, S_min is the minimal sum that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). How can we find this?\n\nWell, to find the minimal possible sum >=x, perhaps we can sort the a array and b array, then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, take the minimal among all those.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can do the following:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal S_min is the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nYes. For example, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search on the sorted b array to find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for each a_i, we can find the minimal possible b_j that satisfies the condition, and then take the minimal sum over all these possibilities.\n\nBut since the a and b arrays are sorted, this can be done in O(n log n) time.\n\nOnce we have S_min, we can proceed to compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than S_min.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nOnce S_min is determined, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that a_i + b_j > S_min, given that one of the pairs is fixed to have sum exactly S_min. However, since the pairings are arbitrary, we can arrange the rest of the pairs to maximize the count.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe problem is similar to the maximum matching problem. Let me think.\n\nWe need to pair a_i and b_j such that as many as possible pairs have sum > S_min, and exactly one pair has sum S_min (for Vasya). However, since the sum S_min is fixed, and we can arrange the pairings, how can we maximize the number of pairs with sum > S_min?\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible number of pairs with sum > S_min is equal to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed between a and b such that their sum exceeds S_min, minus 0 or 1, depending on whether such a pair exists.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S_min, and then subtract 0 if we can have one pair with sum exactly S_min. Or perhaps, the maximum number is the maximum possible pairs with sum > S_min, and then we can have one pair with sum S_min (if possible) without affecting the count.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that there are m pairs that can be formed with sum > S_min. Then, the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min is m, but since we need to reserve one pair for Vasya (sum S_min), perhaps we need to check if there exists a pair with sum exactly S_min. If yes, then the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min is m - 0 (because we can have that pair as Vasya's, and the rest m pairs can be used for others). Wait, no. Because the total number of pairs is n. So, if there are m pairs that can be formed with sum > S_min, then the maximum possible is m, but we have to make sure that there is at least one pair with sum S_min (for Vasya). However, perhaps the way to arrange the pairings is to have as many pairs as possible with sum > S_min, and one pair with sum S_min.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min, given that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x (which is S_min).\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S_min, and if that number is k, then the worst case rank is k + 1. But how to compute k?\n\nWait, here's the idea:\n\nTo compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum greater than S_min (the minimal sum that Vasya can have), we can find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum > S_min. Let's call this count 'k'. Then, the worst possible rank is k + 1. Because Vasya's sum is S_min, which is <= all other sums (but some may be equal). However, if there are participants with sum equal to S_min, they can be placed after Vasya. But since the jury can arrange the ranks, in the worst case, all those with higher sum are before Vasya, and those with equal are after. So, the rank is k + 1.\n\nBut how to compute 'k'?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with a_i + b_j > S_min. How to compute this?\n\nThis is a classic problem. One approach is to sort the a array in ascending order, and the b array in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet, such that a_i + b_j > S_min. This is a greedy approach.\n\nAlternatively, here's the standard approach for maximum pairs with sum > target:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers: start from the end of b (max elements) and for each a_i (starting from the beginning), find the first b_j that when paired with a_i gives a sum > target. Once found, we can pair them and move both pointers.\n\nWait, here's a standard approach:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). Count = 0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > target:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis gives the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > target.\n\nYes, that's the standard approach for this kind of problem.\n\nSo, applying this approach, we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S_min. Let's call this count 'k'.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is k + 1. Because there are k participants with sum higher than S_min, and Vasya's sum is S_min. So, he can be placed after them, giving rank k+1.\n\nBut wait, what if there are other pairs with sum equal to S_min? For example, if there are multiple pairs with sum equal to S_min, but we have already accounted for them. However, since we are trying to maximize the number of pairs with sum > S_min, those pairs with sum equal to S_min are not counted. So, in this case, the count k is the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min, and then the rest can be pairs with sum <= S_min. Since Vasya's sum is S_min, which is >=x, and there is at least one such pair (as per problem statement), the worst case rank would be k + 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n1. Find S_min, the minimal sum >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n   To find this:\n\n   Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n   For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Take the minimal sum across all these possibilities.\n\n   Alternatively, find the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\n   However, how to find S_min? Let's think again.\n\n   For example, suppose we have a sorted a and sorted b. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j where a_i + b_j >=x. Then, S_min is the minimal among all a_i + b_j.\n\n   But how to do that efficiently?\n\n   Let's sort a in ascending order and sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since b is sorted, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search on b to find the first element that is >= (x - a_i). Then, the minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + b_j (where j is the found index). Then, among all these, take the minimal sum.\n\n   However, for some a_i, there may be no such b_j. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So, we can safely proceed.\n\n   Once we find S_min, we can proceed to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min, which is 'k', and then the worst possible rank is k + 1.\n\nBut wait, how to find S_min?\n\nLet me think of code steps for that:\n\nSort a and sort b.\n\nInitialize min_sum to some large value.\n\nFor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   target = x - a[i]\n\n   find the first j in b where b[j] >= target.\n\n   if such j exists:\n\n       current_sum = a[i] + b[j]\n\n       if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n           min_sum = current_sum\n\nSo, after checking all a_i, min_sum is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut since the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, min_sum will be found.\n\nOnce we have S_min, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min. Then, the worst possible rank is k + 1.\n\nBut what if there are multiple pairs with sum equal to S_min? For example, if S_min is 2, and there are multiple pairs with sum 2. Then, when we compute k, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min, then Vasya's pair is one of the S_min pairs. The others can be arranged to have sum <= S_min, so they won't contribute to the count. Thus, the worst possible rank is k + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting all together, the steps for the solution are:\n\nFor the best possible rank: always 1.\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\n   Find S_min as the minimal sum >=x.\n\n   Compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S_min, call it k.\n\n   Worst rank is k + 1.\n\nBut how to compute S_min correctly?\n\nAnother approach: the minimal sum >=x is the minimal between all possible a_i + b_j >=x. To find this, we can generate all possible pairs, but that would be O(n^2), which is impossible for n=1e5.\n\nThus, the approach with sorted arrays and binary search is needed.\n\nSo, the code steps for S_min:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize min_sum to a very large value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the smallest index j in b where b[j] >= target.\n\n   if such j exists:\n\n       current_sum = a_i + b[j]\n\n       if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n           min_sum = current_sum\n\nBut this may not capture all possibilities. For example, for a particular a_i, there may be multiple b_j that satisfy a_i + b_j >=x, and the minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + the minimal b_j that satisfies the condition. So the above approach is correct.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, for each a_i, we can use bisect_left on the sorted b array to find the first element >= (x - a_i). Then, if that index is within the array, then take that b_j and compute the sum. Then, track the minimal sum across all a_i and their corresponding b_j.\n\nOnce we have S_min, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min using the two-pointer approach.\n\nBut what if there are multiple ways to get S_min? For example, different pairs can give the same S_min. But the approach remains the same.\n\nOnce that is done, the worst possible rank is k + 1.\n\nBut let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1], sorted.\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1], sorted.\n\nFor each a_i (all 1):\n\ntarget is 2-1=1. The first b_j >=1 is index 0. So current_sum is 1+1=2. So min_sum is 2.\n\nThen, compute k: maximum number of pairs with sum > 2. Since all a and b are 1, sum is 2. So no pairs have sum > 2. Thus, k=0. Worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1? But the sample output says 5. Wait, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, the sample output for the first input is 1 5. So according to our approach, the worst rank is 0 +1 =1. But sample says 5. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because S_min is 2. The maximum number of pairs with sum > 2 is zero. So, in that case, the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But according to the sample, the worst is 5.\n\nThis indicates a flaw in the approach.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-examine the first sample. All participants have a sum of 2. So, for the worst case, Vasya's sum is 2, and all other participants also have sum 2. Thus, the worst possible rank is 5, because the jury can assign him the last position. But according to the approach, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min is zero. Thus, the worst rank is 0 +1 =1. Which contradicts the sample.\n\nSo, clearly, the approach is wrong.\n\nWhat's the error here?\n\nThe error is in the assumption that the worst possible rank is k +1, where k is the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min. However, in the case where all participants have sum equal to S_min, then k is zero, and the worst possible rank is n (since all participants are equal, and the jury can assign Vasya the last place). So, the formula is not correct.\n\nThus, the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, the problem is that the formula k + 1 is not sufficient. Because when there are other participants with sum equal to S_min, they can be placed after Vasya, increasing his rank.\n\nSo, how to account for that?\n\nLet me think again. The worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants that have sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, plus the number of participants that have the same sum as Vasya and are placed before him. But since the jury can arrange the ranks, in the worst case, all participants with higher sum are placed before him, and all participants with equal sum are placed after him. Thus, his rank is (number of participants with higher sum) + 1.\n\nBut in the case where there are participants with equal sum, they are placed after him. So, the formula is correct.\n\nBut in the first sample, the number of participants with higher sum is zero. So, the worst possible rank is 0 +1 =1. But the sample says 5. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no! Because in this case, Vasya is one of the participants. So, the total number of participants is n. The number of participants with sum strictly greater than S_min is zero. But how many participants have sum equal to S_min?\n\nAll n participants. So, in this case, the worst possible rank is n. Because the jury can arrange all of them to be placed after Vasya, but that's not possible. Wait, no. The problem says that if there are ties, the jury can assign the places as they like. So, for the worst possible rank, the jury can arrange that Vasya is placed last among all the tied participants. So, the rank is the number of participants with higher sum (zero) plus the number of participants with equal sum (n) and then the rank is (number of higher) + 1 (if all equal are placed after him). Wait, no. For example, if there are m participants with higher sum than Vasya, and k participants with equal sum, then the worst possible rank is m + k + 1? Or m +1?\n\nNo, the rank depends on how many people are placed before him. For example, if there are m people with higher sum, and k people with equal sum, then the worst possible rank is m + k + 1? No, because in the worst case, the jury can place all the people with higher sum before him, and all people with equal sum after him. Thus, his rank is m + 1. Because the people with equal sum are after him. So, the number of people before him is m. Thus, his rank is m + 1.\n\nBut in the first sample, m is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 =1. But the sample says 5. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because in this case, Vasya is one of the participants. So, when we count the number of participants with higher sum than S_min, which is zero, but there are n participants with sum equal to S_min. So, the total number of participants with sum equal to S_min is n. However, Vasya is one of them. So, the number of participants with sum equal to S_min and not Vasya is n-1. So, the jury can arrange them to be placed after Vasya. Thus, his rank is m + 1 = 0 + 1 =1. But according to the sample, it's 5.\n\nThis indicates a fundamental error in my reasoning. So what's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-express the problem. The worst possible rank is when Vasya is placed as low as possible. So, in the case where all participants have the same sum, the jury can place him in the last position. So, his rank is n. But according to the previous logic, it would be 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo the mistake is that the formula k + 1 is not considering the number of participants with equal sum. How to adjust this?\n\nAh! Because the formula assumes that all participants with sum equal to S_min are placed after Vasya, but that's not the case. The formula counts k as the number of participants with sum greater than S_min. However, the number of participants with sum equal to S_min is (total_pairs_with_sum_equal_to_S_min) - 1",
