Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) can't have incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n\nHmm. So the problem is essentially taking the flow values given for each edge and directing them properly. But how?\n\nFirst, let's think about the flow conservation. For each vertex except the source and sink, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. Also, the source has no incoming edges, so all its edges must be outgoing. Similarly, the sink's edges must be incoming? Not sure about that. Wait, the sink (vertex n) can have outgoing edges, but since it's the sink, the total flow into it should be the maximum flow. However, in this problem, the flow is already given as maximum, so maybe the direction assignment needs to ensure that the flow is valid.\n\nBut how do I model this? Maybe think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. Also, the directed graph must be acyclic. Oh right, because the problem says that the obtained directed graph should not have cycles. That's an important constraint.\n\nSo the key here is to find a way to direct the edges such that:\n\n- Flow conservation holds for intermediate nodes.\n- The source has no incoming edges.\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nHow can we approach this?\n\nOne idea is to model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that they form a DAG. Since the graph is connected, maybe we can find a topological order of the nodes, and then direct the edges according to that order. But how does that relate to the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps the underlying graph is a flow network with capacities given by the ci values. But since the problem states that the flow is already determined (the ci values are the flow volumes), we just need to assign directions that are consistent with the flow.\n\nWait, but in a flow network, the flow through an edge can be in either direction. However, the problem gives us the flow amounts, and we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nAnother thought: For each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges entering must equal the sum leaving. Which implies that the total flow into the node (from edges) is zero. So, for each node v (not source or sink), the net flow (sum of flows on edges directed out minus sum of flows directed in) must be zero. Wait, no: the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So the net flow (outgoing - incoming) is zero. Which is the same as the flow conservation condition.\n\nSo the problem is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node (except source and sink), the net flow is zero. And also, the directed graph has no cycles. Plus, source has no incoming edges.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a problem where we need to find a way to assign directions to edges so that the flow conservation is satisfied and the graph is a DAG.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined based on some topological ordering. For example, if we have a topological order of the nodes, then all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nWait, but the flow conservation requires that for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges going out equals the sum on edges going in. If we arrange the edges in a DAG, perhaps we can model this as a flow that is a circulation except for the source and sink.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the flow is a valid flow. The source's outflow is the maximum flow, and the sink's inflow is the same. But how to model that?\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the flow as a directed graph. For each edge, the direction is determined. The flow conservation holds for all nodes except source and sink. Also, the source has no incoming edges, so all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink can have edges directed towards it or away from it, but since it's the sink, the net flow into it must be equal to the maximum flow.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can construct a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. But how?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation constraints and is acyclic. The key constraints are:\n\n1. Flow conservation at all intermediate nodes (i.e., sum of incoming flows equals sum of outgoing flows).\n2. The source node (vertex 1) must have no incoming edges.\n3. The resulting directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Ordering**: To ensure the directed graph is acyclic, we can use a topological sort. We start by assigning a topological order where the source node (vertex 1) is first and the sink node (vertex n) is last.\n2. **Flow Conservation**: For each node, we maintain a balance between the incoming and outgoing flows. This is done by using a priority queue (min-heap) to process nodes with a net outflow, ensuring we direct edges from nodes with excess flow to those with deficit flow.\n3. **Edge Direction Assignment**: As we process each node, we direct edges from the current node to its neighbors, adjusting the flow balances accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Build the flow balance\n    balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        balance[a] += c\n        balance[b] += c\n\n    # The source (1) has no incoming edges, so all edges from 1 are outgoing\n    # So, we need to subtract the flow from 1's balance\n    # Wait, no.

For each node, the balance is the total flow on edges connected to it. But for the flow conservation, the net outflow should be zero for intermediate nodes.

Similarly, the sink can have any balance.\n\n    # Wait, the correct way is to think about the net outflow from each node. For intermediate nodes, net outflow is zero. For source, net outflow is the total flow. For sink, net inflow is the total flow.\n\n    # Let me think again: For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Therefore, the net outflow (outgoing - incoming) is zero. For the source, net outflow is the total flow. For the sink, net inflow is the total flow.\n\n    # However, the problem gives us the flow values for each edge, and we need to assign directions such that these conditions are met.\n\n    # To model this, we can think of each edge as contributing to the balance of its endpoints. When we direct an edge from u to v, we subtract the flow from u's balance and add it to v's balance. So, for each node, the balance should be zero (except source and sink).\n\n    # So the algorithm is:\n    # 1. Initialize a balance array where balance[u] is the sum of flows of edges connected to u.\n    # 2. For the source node (1), its balance should be the total outflow. So, we need to subtract all flows from its edges from its balance. Wait, no. The balance for each node is the total flow on its edges.

This ensures that edges are directed in a way that avoids cycles and maintains flow conservation.\n4. **Edge Direction Assignment**: For each edge, the direction is determined based on the current node's balance. If the source node (1) is processed, all its edges are directed away from it. For other nodes, edges are directed based on whether the current node has a positive or negative balance, ensuring flow conservation.\n\nThis approach ensures that the resulting directed graph is acyclic and meets all flow conservation requirements.",
