            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem statement thoroughly.\n\nSo, the problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a growing string S. Each time a character (0 or 1) is appended to S, I have to compute the answer after each step.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n- Each English letter has a Morse code of length 1-4, made of 0s and 1s. However, four specific strings (0011, 0101, 1110, 1111) are invalid and don't correspond to any letters. All others of length 1-4 are valid.\n\n- The task is, after each modification to S, find the number of non-empty sequences of letters that can be represented by some substring of S. For example, if S is \"111\", then substrings like \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", etc., each can be a letter. But sequences like \"TT\" (which is \"11\") would be counted as a separate sequence.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such substring that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the four invalid ones) contributes to the count. But sequences of letters are formed by splitting the string into valid Morse codes. Wait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the note says that for the first sample where S is \"111\", the possible sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. How does that work?\n\nAh, right! Because each substring of S that is a valid Morse code represents a letter. Then, any sequence of letters that can be formed by splitting the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code. But the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's not about splitting the entire string into Morse codes. Instead, each substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the four invalid) corresponds to exactly one letter. Then, any sequence of letters that can be formed by taking one or more of these substrings (but not overlapping?), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the note gives an example. Let's take the first sample input where S is \"111\".\n\nThe substrings of S are:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (positions 0), \"1\" (pos 1), \"1\" (pos 2).\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 0-1), \"11\" (positions 1-2).\n\nLength 3: \"111\".\n\nEach of these substrings is a valid Morse code (since none of the forbidden strings are present). Now, each of these substrings represents a letter. So, the number of possible sequences is the number of ways to split the string into valid Morse code parts. Wait, but the note counts sequences like \"TT\", which is two letters. How does that happen?\n\nAh, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's not about splitting the entire string into Morse codes, but rather, each individual substring that is a valid code is considered as a single-letter sequence. Then, the total number of sequences is the number of valid substrings, plus the number of sequences formed by combining multiple valid substrings.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. For example, in the first sample, the valid substrings are:\n\nEach occurrence of \"1\", \"11\", \"111\" (each of which is a valid code). So there are 3 (for length 1) + 2 (for length 2) + 1 (for length 3) = 6 substrings. But the note says the answer is 7. So that suggests that the answer isn't just the count of valid substrings. Because the sample output after three steps is 7.\n\nWait, the note says that after three steps, the answer is 7. The sample input is three '1's. So S is \"111\". The note lists seven sequences:\n\nT, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT.\n\nSo how do these correspond to the substrings? Let's think:\n\nEach valid substring represents a letter. So each of these substrings is a single letter. But the sequences are sequences of letters. So for example, the substring",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a growing string `S` in Morse code after each modification. The solution involves efficiently tracking valid Morse code substrings and their contributions to the total count of sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: Identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") are invalid.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Tracking**: Use a DP array to keep track of valid Morse code substrings ending at each position in the string `S`.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ for all calculations.\n4. **Efficient Updates**: After each character is appended to `S`, update the DP array to reflect new valid Morse code substrings and compute the total number of valid sequences.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    invalid = set([\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"])\n    \n    # dp[i] will store the number of valid sequences ending at position i\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    s = []\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        c = operations[i]\n        s.append(c)\n        current = ''.join(s)\n        \n        # Check all possible substrings ending at i\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l + 1 < 0:\n                continue\n            substr = current[-l:]\n            if substr in invalid:\n                continue\n            if l == 1:\n                dp[i+1] = (dp[i+1] + 1) % MOD\n            else:\n                dp[i+1] = (dp[i+1] + dp[i - l + 1] + 1) % MOD\n        \n        # Sum all dp entries up to current position\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(i+1):\n            total = (total + dp[j]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Invalid Morse Codes**: A set of invalid Morse code strings is defined for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array tracks the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position. If a substring is valid, update the DP array to include new sequences formed by appending this substring to previous valid sequences.\n5. **Total Count Calculation**: After processing each character, compute the total number of valid sequences by summing up all values in the DP array up to the current position, applying modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient updates and maintains correctness by leveraging dynamic programming to track valid sequences incrementally.",
