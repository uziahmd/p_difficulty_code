The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, like the first one, the perimeter of the rectangle. But how is that calculated? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, 3x3: the perimeter cells are the outermost layer. So for a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W or H cells, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So yes, 2*(W + H - 2) equals that. So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w' x h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that each subsequent ring is possible. For example, if the current dimensions are such that the rectangle is too small to have a ring. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), which ensures that each ring can be formed. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, then sum them all.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for the first ring, the rectangle is 3x3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So the first ring is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output of 28.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is (7 -4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the plan is: loop from 1 to k, for each i, calculate the current width and height as w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then compute 2*(w_i + h_i - 2) for each, sum all those.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read w, h, k from input, then initialize total = 0, loop i from 1 to k, compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h - 4*(i-1), add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to total. Then print total.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1)). So for each ring, the perimeter is calculated based on that rectangle. So yes, that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. For example, when k is 0? But according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the rectangle becomes very small. For example, if w and h are 3, and k is 1. Which is handled correctly.\n\nAnother example: if w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7, perimeter 2*(7+7-2)",
