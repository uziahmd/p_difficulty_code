The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, say the first one. The perimeter of the rectangle. But how is that calculated? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows contribute W cells each, and the left and right columns contribute (H-2) each. Because the corners are already counted in the top and bottom.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the perimeter cells is 2*(w + h - 2). Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is 2*(width + height) - 4 (since each corner is counted twice). Wait, let me think again. Suppose width is W and height is H. The total cells in the border would be W*2 + (H-2)*2. Which equals 2(W + H) - 4. Because for example, if W=3, H=3, then it's 3*2 + (3-2)*2 = 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8 cells. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But for that rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(w' + h' - 2). So adding all those perimeters for each ring from i=1 to k.\n\nWait, but what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, when i increases, the dimensions might become less than 3? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. Because the input says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can have only one ring. For a 7x7, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. Which would make the second ring: 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. So 3x3, which is valid.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum them all.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total\n\nWait, but let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. Then current_w = 3, current_h =3. perimeter is 2*(3 +3 -2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So current_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. For i=1: 7,9 → 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2: current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1) =5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current_w",
