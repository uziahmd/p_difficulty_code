Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about assigning directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions. The key points are:\n\n1. The flow must be a maximum flow. But since the flow values are already given (ci for each edge), our task is just to assign directions correctly.\n2. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow must equal outgoing flow. So it's a conservation of flow condition.\n3. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n4. The directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think about the structure of the graph. Since the graph is connected and we need to direct edges without cycles, perhaps a tree-like structure? Or maybe a DAG with some constraints.\n\nWait, the directed graph must be acyclic. So, if we can assign directions such that the graph is a DAG, and also satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: since the flow is maximum, the residual graph should have no augmenting paths. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows into the node must equal the sum of flows out. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow on edges incident to it must be even? Wait, no. Because each edge contributes to either incoming or outgoing. So for each node, sum of all flows on edges (since each edge is directed either into or out of the node) must be zero. Wait, no. Because the sum of incoming equals sum of outgoing. So the total sum for the node is (sum incoming) - (sum outgoing) = 0. Which implies that sum incoming = sum outgoing. Therefore, for each node, the sum of flows on all edges connected to it must be even? No. Because the sum of incoming plus outgoing is twice the sum of incoming (since sum incoming equals sum outgoing). So the sum of all flows on edges connected to the node must be twice the sum of incoming. Therefore, the total sum must be even. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so we don't need to check that.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a directed graph where the flow is valid. But since the flow is already determined (the ci's are fixed), we need to assign directions such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nWait, but the flow conservation is already satisfied by the given ci's? No, because the ci's are the flow values. So the sum of flows into a node (excluding source and sink) must equal the sum of flows out of the node. But how does that relate to the ci's?\n\nWait, the ci's are the flow through each edge. So for each edge, the direction determines whether it contributes to the incoming or outgoing flow of its endpoints.\n\nFor example, if an edge is directed from u to v, then for u, it's an outgoing flow, and for v, it's an incoming flow.\n\nSo, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of all flows on edges directed towards v must equal the sum of all flows on edges directed away from v.\n\nSo the problem reduces to directing each edge such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into the node equals the sum of flows directed out of the node.\n\nAdditionally, the source (node 1) must have all edges directed away from it (so no incoming edges), and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHow can I model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a directed graph with these properties. One possible way is to construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. But how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow conservation is satisfied, and then find a topological order.\n\nBut how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nWait, considering that the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps the underlying graph is a DAG with the source and sink. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the problem as a flow network where each edge has capacity ci, and the flow is exactly the given ci. But since the problem states that the flow is maximum, perhaps the residual graph has no augmenting paths. However, I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that the flow conservation holds. This seems like a problem related to Eulerian trails. For example, in an undirected graph, if the sum of flows on edges adjacent to a node is even, then there's an Eulerian trail. But here, the sum for each node (except source and sink) must be even? Because for each node, the sum of flows on edges is equal to 2 * (sum of incoming flows). So the total sum must be even. But the problem says that the input is always valid, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nWait, for each node (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges connected to it must be even. Because for each such node, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows, so the total sum is twice the incoming sum, hence even.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is valid, so we can assume that.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as an Eulerian trail problem. For example, for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges connected to it is even. So, for each such node, the number of edges with odd degrees (but here, the flows are given, not the degrees). Hmm, perhaps not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the flow as a directed graph. For each node except source and sink, the in-degree (sum of flows) equals the out-degree (sum of flows). For the source, the out-degree sum is the total flow, and in-degree is zero. For the sink, the in-degree sum is the total flow, and out-degree is zero. But how to model this.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges such that these conditions hold.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that the net flow (outgoing minus incoming) for each node is as required.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAnother approach: For each node, except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges adjacent to it must be even, as discussed. Let's denote for each node v, the total flow value as T(v) = sum_{edges incident to v} c_i. For the source and sink, T(1) = sum of flows on edges adjacent to 1, which must equal the total flow (since source has no incoming edges, all edges are outgoing, so the sum of outgoing flows is the total flow). Similarly, T(n) is the sum of flows on edges adjacent to n, which must be the same as the total flow. For other nodes, T(v) must be even.\n\nBut how to assign directions.\n\nWait, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows directed out of v. Which means that the difference between the sum of flows directed into v and the sum directed out of v is zero. Which implies that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero.\n\nBut for the source, the net flow is the total flow (outflow - inflow = total flow - 0 = total flow). For the sink, it's -(total flow).\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to assigning directions to edges so that the net flow for each node is as follows:\n\n- For node 1: net flow is total_flow (sum of all flows on edges incident to it).\n- For node n: net flow is -total_flow.\n- For other nodes: net flow is zero.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to achieve this.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding a directed graph where each edge has a flow of ci, and the net flow at each node is as specified.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net flow (sum of outgoing flows minus sum of incoming flows) is as required.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of each edge as contributing +ci to one node and -ci to the other. For example, if an edge is directed from u to v, then u's net flow increases by ci, and v's net flow decreases by ci.\n\nSo, for all edges, the sum of their contributions (as directed) must result in the required net flows for each node.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote for each node v, the required net flow is:\n\n- For v = 1: net_flow = total_flow (which is the sum of all flows on edges incident to 1, since all edges are directed away from 1)\n- For v = n: net_flow = -total_flow\n- For others: net_flow = 0\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut how to find the direction of each edge so that the sum of contributions (ci for outgoing, -ci for incoming) for each node equals the required net_flow.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations, but solving it directly would be computationally intensive for large graphs.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions accordingly. For example, process the nodes in a topological order and assign directions from earlier nodes to later ones. But how to ensure that the net flows are correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the net flow for each node is known. This is equivalent to finding an Eulerian trail, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's another thought. If we can find a directed graph where each node's net flow is as required, then the problem is solved. But how?\n\nThe net flow for each node is given. Let me think of the problem as a flow network where each edge has capacity ci, and the flow is exactly ci. Then, the net flow at each node is as required. But since the flow is fixed, this is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net flow at each node matches the required value.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where the net flow for each node is as required. Let's consider that for each edge, we can choose to direct it from u to v or from v to u. Each choice contributes to the net flow of u and v.\n\nLet me model this as a system of equations. For each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (if directed away from v, +ci, else -ci) equals the required net_flow[v].\n\nBut solving this system for large graphs (up to 2e5 nodes and edges) is not feasible directly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model this as a graph where we need to assign directions to edges such that the net flow is correct. Let me think of the net flow for each node.\n\nLet’s denote that the required net flow for node v is D[v]. Then, for each edge (u, v), if we direct it from u to v, then D[u] += ci, D[v] -= ci. If we direct it from v to u, then D[u] -= ci, D[v] += ci.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign directions to edges such that the final D[v] is as required.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the D[v] values. For the source node 1, D[1] = total_flow. For the sink node n, D[n] = -total_flow. For other nodes, D[v] = 0.\n\nBut how to compute the total_flow?\n\nThe total_flow is the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source. Because the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it are directed away, so the total_flow is the sum of all ci for edges connected to 1.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate that? Well, for the source node 1, the sum of all flows on edges connected to it must be the total flow, since those edges are directed away from the source. So the total_flow is sum of ci for edges connected to node 1.\n\nBut for the problem, the total_flow must be equal to the sum of flows on edges connected to the sink, but that's handled automatically once the directions are set.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph with the required net flows. Let me create a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the net flows are satisfied. How?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node has a certain \"excess\" of flow. For example, the source has an excess of total_flow, the sink has -total_flow, others have zero. To balance this, we need to route the flow through the edges.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding a flow in a graph where each edge has capacity ci, but the flow is exactly ci. However, since the flow is fixed, perhaps we can model it as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that the flow is routed from nodes with excess to those with deficit.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the standard max-flow algorithms. Suppose we construct a directed graph where each edge is directed from a node with positive excess to a node with negative excess. But how to do this systematically.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of finding an orientation of the edges that forms a directed acyclic graph (since the output requires it) and satisfies the net flows.\n\nLet me think of the nodes as being arranged in a topological order. Let's say that we arrange the nodes in such a way that all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. Then, the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, how to assign directions to edges based on this order to satisfy the net flows.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Assign a topological order to the nodes. The first node is the source (node 1), and the last is the sink (node n). Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order such that the net flows are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. Compute the required net flows for each node. For node 1, D[1] = total_flow (sum of flows on edges connected to it). For node n, D[n] = -total_flow. For others, D[v] = 0.\n\n2. Now, we need to assign directions to edges such that for each edge (u, v), the direction is chosen so that the net flows are adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: This problem is equivalent to finding an Eulerian orientation for the graph with the given net flows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow decomposition. Since each edge must carry exactly ci units of flow, and the directions must be chosen so that the net flows are correct.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. Let's build a DAG where the edges are directed from nodes with higher potential to lower potential. For example, assign to each node a potential value such that for every edge, the direction is from the node with higher potential to the lower one. Then, the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to assign potentials such that the net flows are correct.\n\nLet me think of the potentials as the net flow. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that for each node v, we have a potential p[v]. For each edge (u, v), if p[u] > p[v], then we direct it from u to v. Otherwise, from v to u. This ensures that the directed graph is acyclic (assuming potentials are unique and ordered).\n\nBut how to choose the potentials so that the net flows are correct.\n\nThe net flow for node v is the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction) * ci. For example, if an edge is directed away from v, then it contributes +ci to the net flow of v. If directed into v, then -ci.\n\nSo, the net flow for node v is sum_{edges incident to v} (direction) * ci.\n\nBut how to model this with potentials.\n\nAlternatively, think of the net flow for node v as the sum of all flows leaving v minus the sum of all flows entering v. Which equals the sum over edges incident to v of (direction) * ci.\n\nBut how to relate this to potentials.\n\nLet me consider that for each edge (u, v), the direction is determined by the potential difference. Suppose that the direction is from u to v if p[u] > p[v], else from v to u. Then, the net flow for node v is the sum of ci for all edges where v is the source (i.e., p[v] > p[other end]) minus the sum of ci for edges where v is the sink (p[other end] > p[v]).\n\nBut how to set the potentials so that the net flow for each node is as required.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model this as a system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the potentials can be assigned such that the net flow for node v is D[v], which is the required net flow.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the net flow for node v as D[v] = sum_{edges incident to v} (direction) * ci.\n\nIf we can find potentials p[v] such that for each edge (u, v), the direction is determined by p[u] and p[v], and the net flow for each node is D[v], then the problem is solved.\n\nBut how to find such p[v].\n\nAnother thought: Let me model the net flow for node v as D[v] = sum_{edges incident to v} (direction) * ci. Let's imagine that for each edge (u, v), the direction is from u to v. Then, this contributes +ci to u's net flow and -ci to v's net flow. Alternatively, if the direction is from v to u, then it contributes +ci to v and -ci to u.\n\nBut how to find the direction assignments.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph with certain net flows, which is equivalent to finding a directed graph where the net flow for each node is D[v].\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding a flow in a graph where each edge has capacity ci, and the flow is exactly ci. But since the flow is fixed, the direction of each edge is determined by the flow direction.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's model this as a directed graph where the net flow for each node is D[v]. This is equivalent to finding a directed graph where the sum of flows leaving the node minus the sum entering equals D[v].\n\nBut how to find such a graph.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow network where each edge has capacity ci, and we need to find a flow that satisfies the net flow requirements. But since the flow is exactly ci (each edge is used to its full capacity), this is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net flows are correct.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the required net flow for each node. For node 1, it's the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. For node n, it's -sum of flows on edges connected to it. For others, zero. Wait, no. Because for node 1, since it has no incoming edges, all edges are directed away, so the net flow is sum of flows on edges connected to it. Similarly for node n, the net flow is -sum of flows on edges connected to it. But what about other nodes?\n\nWait, no. For other nodes, the net flow must be zero. Because the sum of inflows equals the sum of outflows.\n\nSo, the required net flow for each node is:\n\nD[1] = total_flow (sum of flows on edges connected to 1)\n\nD[n] = -total_flow\n\nD[v] = 0 for v not 1 or n.\n\nBut how to compute total_flow?\n\nTotal_flow is the sum of flows on edges connected to node 1. Because all edges connected to node 1 are directed away from it, so their contribution to the net flow of node 1 is +ci for each such edge.\n\nSo, the total_flow is sum of ci for edges incident to node 1.\n\nOnce we have the D[v] values, how to assign directions to edges.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of finding a directed graph where each edge has flow ci (i.e., direction is chosen, and the flow is ci), and the net flow for each node is D[v].\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a flow in a graph where each edge has capacity ci, and we need to send exactly ci units of flow through each edge. But since the flow is fixed, this is more of a circulation problem.\n\nBut how to find such a flow.\n\nAnother idea: Let's treat this as a directed graph and perform a DFS or BFS, assigning directions as we go. For example, start from node 1, and for each edge, direct it away from node 1. Then, for other nodes, direct edges in a way that balances the net flows.\n\nBut this might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the net flows are D[v]. Let's imagine that we can model this as a directed graph and use a BFS approach.\n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n- Start by directing all edges connected to node 1 away from it. This ensures that node 1 has no incoming edges.\n\n- For other nodes, we need to balance their net flows. For example, if a node has a positive net flow (which it shouldn't, since D[v] is zero for non-source/sink nodes), we need to direct edges to reduce that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of maintaining the net flow for each node. Initially, after directing edges connected to node 1, the net flow of node 1 is correct, and for other nodes, their net flows may be incorrect.\n\nFor example, suppose there's an edge between node 2 and node 3. Initially, if it's directed from 2 to 3, then node 2's net flow increases by ci and node 3's decreases by ci. If this causes their net flows to be unbalanced, we need to adjust the direction.\n\nBut how to do this systematically.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using a priority queue or some kind of traversal.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. We can arrange the nodes in a topological order, and for each edge, direct it from the earlier node in the order to the later node. But how to determine the topological order such that the net flows are satisfied.\n\nWait, but how to choose the topological order. Perhaps we can build a directed graph incrementally, ensuring that the net flows are balanced as we go.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG. We can construct this DAG by building a tree structure rooted at node 1, and directing all edges away from the root. However, this may not account for the flow conservation requirements.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the nodes are processed in a certain order, and for each node, the excess flow is passed along edges to other nodes.\n\nLet me try to think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the required net flows D[v] for each node.\n\n2. For node 1, all edges are directed away from it. This contributes to D[1] and the adjacent nodes.\n\n3. For other nodes, we need to ensure that their net flows are zero. For example, if a node has a positive net flow (say, due to edges directed away from it), we need to direct some edges into it to balance it.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of balancing the net flows. For each node, the current net flow is some value. We need to adjust the directions of edges connected to it to balance this.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a node u with current net flow of +x. We need to find an edge connected to u that can be reversed to decrease the net flow of u by 2*ci (since reversing the direction of an edge changes the net flow of u by -2*ci).\n\nBut how to find such edges and process them.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using a BFS or DFS approach, where we track the current net flows and adjust them by flipping edges.\n\nLet me outline this idea:\n\n- Initialize the net flow for each node as follows:\n\n   For node 1: all edges connected to it are directed away, so for each such edge (u, v), if u is 1, then D[1] += ci, and D[v] -= ci. Similarly for other edges.\n\nWait, but initially, we need to assign directions to edges. How to do this?\n\nActually, initially, the net flows are not computed yet. So, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize all net flows to zero.\n\nFor each edge, we can assign a direction (initially arbitrary), and then adjust the net flows accordingly. However, this may not lead us to the correct net flows.\n\nBut perhaps, we can use a greedy approach:\n\nStart by directing all edges away from node 1. For each edge connected to node 1, direct it from node 1 to the other node. This ensures that node 1 has no incoming edges.\n\nThen, for other nodes, check their net flow. For example, if a node v has a net flow that is not zero, we need to find an edge connected to v and reverse its direction to adjust the net flow.\n\nBut how to choose which edge to reverse.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a BFS or DFS approach, where nodes with non-zero net flows are processed, and their edges are adjusted.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- For each edge, initially direct it from node 1 to the other node if it's connected to node 1. For other edges, perhaps direct them arbitrarily (like from lower-numbered to higher-numbered node), but this may not work.\n\n- Then, for each node v (except 1 and n), if its current net flow is not zero, find an edge connected to v and reverse its direction. This will change the net flow of v by 2 * ci (since reversing the direction of an edge changes the net flow of v by -2 * ci if the edge was previously directed away from v, or +2 * ci if it was directed into v).\n\nBut how to choose which edge to reverse.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph where we process nodes with non-zero net flows and adjust edges to eliminate their imbalance.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian trail, where we adjust the degrees to make them even by adding edges. Here, we adjust the net flows by reversing edges.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose node v has a net flow of +x. We need to find an edge connected to v and reverse it so that x decreases by 2*ci. We continue this until all nodes have zero net flow.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nThis sounds like a possible approach. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nWe maintain for each node its current net flow. Initially, after directing all edges connected to node 1 away from it, the net flows for node 1 and its neighbors are set accordingly.\n\nFor other nodes, their net flows are initially set based on the initial edge directions.\n\nThen, for each node v (not 1 or n), if its net flow is not zero, we find an edge connected to v and reverse its direction. This changes the net flow of v by -2*ci (if the edge was directed away from v before reversal), or +2*ci (if it was directed towards v before reversal). But how to choose which edge to reverse.\n\nBut how to find such edges. For example, if a node v has a positive net flow, we need to find an edge connected to v that is directed away from it (so that reversing it would decrease the net flow of v by 2*ci).\n\nAlternatively, we can choose any edge connected to v and reverse it, which will change the net flow of v and the other endpoint of the edge.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. However, it may require multiple passes over the edges, which could be time-consuming for large graphs. But perhaps with a BFS or DFS approach, we can process the nodes and edges efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the directions of all edges. For edges connected to node 1, direct them away from node 1. For other edges, direct them arbitrarily (e.g., from the lower-numbered node to higher-numbered node, but this may not be necessary).\n\n2. Compute the current net flow for each node.\n\n3. For each node v (excluding 1 and n), while its net flow is not zero:\n\n   a. Find an edge connected to v. Let's say the edge connects v to u.\n\n   b. Reverse the direction of this edge.\n\n   c. Update the net flows of v and u accordingly.\n\nBut how to choose the edge in step 3a.\n\nThis seems like a problem that could be addressed with a queue. Whenever a node has a non-zero net flow, we add it to a queue and process it. When we process it, we find an edge connected to it, reverse it, and update the net flows of the two nodes involved.\n\nBut how to choose the edge. For example, if the current node is v, and it has a net flow of x, we can pick any edge connected to v. Let's say the edge is between v and u. Reversing it will change the net flow of v by -2*ci (if the edge was directed away from v) or +2*ci (if it was directed towards v). But since we're trying to balance the net flow, we need to choose an edge that can help us reduce the imbalance.\n\nBut how to know which direction the edge is currently in. For example, if the edge is directed from v to u, then reversing it would subtract 2*ci from v's net flow and add 2*ci to u's net flow.\n\nSo, during processing, when we find a node v with non-zero net flow, we can select any edge connected to v. Let's say we select an edge (v, u). If the edge is directed from v to u, then reversing it will reduce v's net flow by 2*ci and increase u's by 2*ci. If the edge is directed from u to v, then reversing it will increase v's net flow by 2*ci and decrease u's by 2*ci. \n\nBut this may not help us directly. However, the idea is that by reversing edges, eventually, all net flows will be zero.\n\nThis approach is similar to the one used in finding an Eulerian trail by adjusting the degrees.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of a possible implementation:\n\n- Use a queue to keep track of nodes that have non-zero net flow.\n\n- For each node in the queue, pick any adjacent edge and reverse it. Then, update the net flows of the two nodes involved in the edge.\n\n- Add the other node (u) to the queue if its net flow has changed.\n\nBut why would this process terminate? Because each reversal changes the net flows, and eventually, the net flows will reach zero.\n\nBut how to ensure that this process terminates. For example, suppose that we have a cycle of nodes with non-zero net flows, and the reversals keep bouncing the net flows around. However, since the total sum of net flows is zero (since the net flow of node 1 is total_flow, node n is -total_flow, and others are zero), the process should eventually terminate.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, the problem states that a solution exists, so this process must eventually terminate.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, the question is: How to represent the edges and their directions, and how to quickly find an adjacent edge for a given node.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read the graph, storing for each edge its endpoints and ci. Also, for each edge, track its direction (initially, for edges connected to node 1, direction is from 1 to other node. For other edges, perhaps direction is set arbitrarily, like from lower to higher node).\n\nWait, but for edges not connected to node 1, how to set their initial direction. For example, if we have an edge between u and v, neither of which is node 1. How to choose the initial direction. It could be arbitrary, but choosing a direction that doesn't create cycles may help. However, since the final directed graph must be acyclic, this initial direction may not matter as long as the process of reversing edges leads to an acyclic graph.\n\nBut how to ensure that the final graph is acyclic. Because during the reversal process, edges may be reversed multiple times, leading to cycles.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The process described above may result in cycles, which violates the problem's requirement that the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nSo, this approach may not work because it doesn't ensure acyclicity.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the previous idea is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the final directed graph is acyclic.\n\nSo, what's another approach?\n\nLet me think back to the requirement that the directed graph must be acyclic. One way to ensure this is to arrange the nodes in a topological order and direct all edges from earlier nodes to later nodes. This way, there are no cycles.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a topological order of the nodes such that, when all edges are directed from earlier to later nodes in the order, the net flows are satisfied.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Assign a topological order to the nodes. The source (node 1) is first, the sink (node n) is last. All other nodes are in between.\n\n- For each edge, direct it from the node that appears earlier in the topological order to the one that appears later.\n\n- This ensures that the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, the question is, how to choose the topological order such that the net flows are satisfied.\n\nBut how to compute this order.\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can model the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed according to the topological order, and the net flows are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, think of the topological order as a linear extension of the DAG. Once the topological order is chosen, the directions are fixed.\n\nBut how to choose the order.\n\nLet me think of the following: The net flow for each node (except source and sink) is zero. So, the net flow for the source is total_flow, and for the sink is -total_flow.\n\nIn the directed graph, the source must have all edges directed away from it, and the sink must have all edges directed towards it.\n\nBut how to arrange the other nodes in the topological order so that the net flows are satisfied.\n\nPerhaps the topological order is determined by the flow values. For example, nodes with higher potential (in terms of flow) come earlier in the order.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic and that the net flow for each node is known.\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each node's net flow is D[v], and we want to assign directions to edges such that the net flows are satisfied and the graph is acyclic.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, start with node 1 and process nodes in a certain order, directing edges away from processed nodes.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. Build a directed graph where the nodes are processed in a certain order (like a BFS or DFS traversal starting from node 1), and for each edge, direct it from the processed node to the unprocessed node.\n\n2. After directing all edges this way, adjust the directions of edges to satisfy the net flows.\n\nBut again, this may not ensure the net flows are satisfied.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign a topological order and then direct each edge according to this order. Now, the problem becomes finding a topological order such that the net flows are satisfied.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nLet me think of the net flows as a measure of how much \"flow\" needs to leave a node. For example, the source has a net flow of total_flow, meaning it needs to send out that much flow. Other nodes have net flow zero, meaning the flow entering equals the flow leaving. The sink has a net flow of -total_flow, meaning it receives total_flow.\n\nSo, in the directed graph, the flow is conserved except for the source and sink.\n\nThis is similar to a flow network, where the flow is conserved except for the source and sink.\n\nNow, in such a flow network, the directed graph is acyclic. How to construct such a graph?\n\nOne possible way is to construct a DAG where all edges are directed from the source to the sink, passing through intermediate nodes. This suggests that we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal from the source, directing edges in the direction of traversal.\n\nBut how to ensure that the net flows are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Perform a BFS starting from node 1, and for each edge, direct it from the node that was discovered earlier in the BFS to the one discovered later. This ensures that the directed graph is acyclic.\n\n- Then, for each node, compute the net flow based on the directions assigned.\n\n- If the net flows are not correct, we need to adjust the directions of some edges.\n\nBut how to adjust them while maintaining the acyclic property.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the maximum flow conditions and is acyclic. The key requirements are ensuring that each node (except the source and sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flow, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph contains no cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Net Flow Calculation**: Calculate the required net flow for each node. The source (node 1) should have all its edges directed away from it, and the sink (node n) should have all its edges directed towards it.\n2. **Topological Order**: Use a topological sort approach to ensure the directed graph is acyclic. Nodes are processed in a way that ensures edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes in the topological order.\n3. **Edge Direction Assignment**: Traverse the graph using BFS starting from the source node, directing edges from the node being processed to its neighbors. This ensures acyclicity and helps in balancing the flows.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n    \n    # Initialize direction: 0 means a->b, 1 means b->a\n    direction = [0] * m\n    \n    # First, process all edges connected to node 1\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(1)\n    visited[1] = True\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # BFS to assign directions from node 1\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for v, e_idx in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                direction[e_idx] = 0 if (edges[e_idx][0] == u and edges[e_idx][1] == v) else 1\n                q.append(v)\n    \n    # Now, build the directed graph and check for net flows\n    # We need to adjust directions to satisfy the net flows\n    # For this, we can use a queue to process nodes with non-zero net flow\n    # Compute initial net flows\n    net_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = edges[i]\n        if direction[i] == 0:\n            net_flow[a] += c\n            net_flow[b] -= c\n        else:\n            net_flow[b] += c\n            net_flow[a] -= c\n    \n    # Now, process nodes to balance net_flow\n    # We'll use a queue to handle nodes with non-zero net_flow\n    q = deque()\n    for v in range(1, n + 1):\n        if v == 1 or v == n:\n            continue\n        if net_flow[v] != 0:\n            q.append(v)\n    \n    # For each node in the queue, find an edge to flip\n    while q:\n        v = q.popleft()\n        if net_flow[v] == 0:\n            continue\n        # Find any adjacent edge\n        for u, e_idx in adj[v]:\n            if u == v:\n                continue\n            # Check current direction\n            a, b, c = edges[e_idx]\n            if (a == v and direction[e_idx] == 0) or (b == v and direction[e_idx] == 1):\n                # Edge is directed away from v\n                # Reversing it will subtract 2*c from net_flow[v]\n                direction[e_idx] ^= 1\n                net_flow[v] -= 2 * c\n                net_flow[u] += 2 * c\n                if net_flow[u] != 0:\n                    q.append(u)\n                break\n            elif (a == v and direction[e_idx] == 1) or (b == v and direction[e_idx] == 0):\n                # Edge is directed towards v\n                # Reversing it will add 2*c to net_flow[v]\n                direction[e_idx] ^= 1\n                net_flow[v] += 2 * c\n                net_flow[u] -= 2 * c\n                if net_flow[u] != 0:\n                    q.append(u)\n                break\n    \n    # Output the directions\n    for d in direction:\n        print(d)\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into nodes and edges.\n2. **Direction Initialization**: Edges connected to the source node (1) are initially directed away from it using BFS.\n3. **Net Flow Calculation**: After initial direction assignment, net flows for each node are calculated based on the current edge directions.\n4. **Balancing Net Flows**: A queue is used to process nodes with non-zero net flows.
