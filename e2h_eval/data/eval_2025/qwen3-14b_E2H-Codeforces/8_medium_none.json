Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) can't have incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n\nHmm. So the problem is essentially taking the flow values given for each edge and directing them properly. But how?\n\nFirst, let's think about the flow conservation. For each vertex except the source and sink, the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows. Since the edges are undirected, but we have to assign directions, this seems like a problem of finding a valid orientation of the edges such that these constraints are met.\n\nBut how do I model this? Maybe think of it as a directed graph where the flow is conserved. But since the flow is already given (the ci's), perhaps the direction of each edge determines how the flow contributes to the in/out of each node.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the flow is already a maximum flow. So the given ci's are the flow values on each edge. Our job is to assign directions so that the flow is valid. But how?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the total flow into v must equal the total flow out of v. But since each edge's flow is fixed, the direction determines whether it's contributing to the in-flow or out-flow of a node.\n\nSo for each edge between ai and bi with flow ci, if we direct it from ai to bi, then ai's out-flow increases by ci, and bi's in-flow increases by ci. Alternatively, if we direct it the other way, then bi's out-flow increases and ai's in-flow increases.\n\nBut how can we find such directions?\n\nAnother thought: the flow conservation condition implies that for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even? No, wait. Because for each node, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. Therefore, the total sum of all flows (in + out) would be twice the sum of outgoing flows. But since each edge's flow is counted once as either incoming or outgoing, the sum of all flows for the node must be even? Wait, no. Because the sum of incoming and outgoing is the same. Let me think: for a node v, sum_in = sum_out. So sum_in + sum_out = 2*sum_in. But sum_in + sum_out is the sum of all flows on edges incident to v. Therefore, for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on its edges must be even. Wait, but the problem says that the given ci's form a maximum flow. So maybe that's already guaranteed. But how does that help me?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is conserved. But how to assign directions?\n\nAnother approach: think of the flow as a directed graph. Since the flow is a maximum flow, the residual network has no augmenting paths. But I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. Oh right! The output must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). So the directed edges must form a DAG. Also, the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. So maybe we can arrange the directions in a way that forms a DAG, such as a topological order.\n\nBut how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nHmm. Let's think of the problem as building a DAG with the given flow values. Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can construct a DAG by arranging the nodes in some order and directing edges accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph where the edges are directed from a node with lower rank to higher rank in some topological order. Then, the DAG would have no cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) would be the first in the topological order, so no incoming edges.\n\nBut how to ensure flow conservation for the intermediate nodes?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-degree equal to out-degree. But again, how to model that?\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. For each edge, direction determines which way the flow is going. For the flow to be valid, the net flow (outgoing minus incoming) for each node except source and sink must be zero. For the source, the net flow is the total outflow minus inflow (which should be the total flow value, since it's the source). Similarly for the sink, it's the opposite.\n\nBut the problem says that the given ci's are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of all flows leaving the source (after assigning directions) should be equal to the maximum flow value, and similarly for the sink. However, the problem doesn't require us to compute the maximum flow, but rather to assign directions to the edges given their flow values.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the sum of flows on edges adjacent to the source must be equal to the maximum flow. But I don't know the actual maximum flow value here. However, the problem says that the given ci's are part of the maximum flow. So the sum of flows on edges adjacent to the source (directed away from the source) must be equal to the total max flow. But how can I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in-flow and out-flow. How?\n\nLet me consider that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. Because sum_in = sum_out, so sum_in + sum_out = 2 * sum_in. But sum_in + sum_out is the total of all flows on edges adjacent to v. So that sum must be even. But since the problem says that a solution exists, this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to use that?\n\nMaybe model this as an Eulerian trail problem. For example, if we consider the graph as undirected, and for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges adjacent to it is even. Then, perhaps there's an Eulerian path or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges adjacent to it must be even. Because sum_in = sum_out, so sum_in + sum_out = 2 * sum_in. Which is the total of all flows on edges adjacent to that node. Therefore, that sum must be even. Which is possible only if the sum of ci's for edges adjacent to that node is even. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so that must be the case.\n\nBut how to proceed from here?\n\nAnother idea: for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges adjacent to it is even. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node (except source and sink) has even degree (but in terms of flow, not number of edges). But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as contributing to the in/out of nodes. The direction of the edge determines which node's in/out it contributes to.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of equations. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows directed into v must equal the sum of flows directed out of v. But how to model that.\n\nBut solving such a system for large n (up to 2e5) is not feasible directly.\n\nAlternative approach: since the directed graph must be acyclic and have no cycles, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions based on that order. For example, if we have a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last, then all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. But then, how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nWait, but in such a setup, for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows coming into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows going out (to later nodes). How can that be ensured?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a topological order and assigning directions according to that order. But how to find such an order that satisfies the flow conservation constraints.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has equal in-flow and out-flow. This seems challenging.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Assign directions to edges such that the resulting graph is a DAG with topological order starting with the source and ending with the sink. Then, for each node in the middle, the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to assign the directions?\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal. For example, during traversal, when visiting a node, we can direct edges from the current node to the next node. But how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree structure, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any DAG as long as the flow conditions are met. So perhaps we can construct a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. How?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. For each node, calculate the total flow of edges incident to it. Let's call this total_flow[v]. For the source, this is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. Similarly for the sink.\n\nBut for the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow (since it's the source). For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, the net outflow for node v is (sum of flows directed out of v) - (sum of flows directed into v). For nodes except source and sink, this must be zero. For the source, it must be equal to the total flow (which is the maximum flow value). For the sink, it must be negative of that.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, let's compute the difference between the sum of flows directed out of v and the sum directed into v. For non-source/sink nodes, this must be zero. For the source, it's positive (equal to the total flow), and for the sink, it's negative.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: think of this as a directed graph where for each node except source and sink, the net outflow is zero. So, the sum of all flows directed out of v is equal to the sum of flows directed into v. Which is equivalent to the sum of flows directed out of v being equal to half of the total_flow[v], assuming that total_flow[v] is even. But since the problem states that a solution exists, this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to assign directions so that for each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows directed out of v is equal to half of the total_flow[v].\n\nWait, because for each node v, total_flow[v] is the sum of all flows on edges incident to v. When we direct the edges, each edge contributes to either the outflow or inflow of v. So for node v, the sum of outflows is equal to (sum of flows on edges directed away from v). Similarly, the sum of inflows is sum of flows on edges directed towards v. And for non-source/sink nodes, these two sums must be equal. Therefore, the sum of outflows is exactly half of the total_flow[v].\n\nSo for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows directed away from v must be exactly total_flow[v]/2.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to assign directions to edges such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from it is exactly half of the total_flow[v].\n\nBut how can we achieve this?\n\nThis feels similar to an Eulerian trail problem, where each node has even degree. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a flow network where we need to find a directed graph such that for each node, the sum of flows directed away is exactly the required value. But again, how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows directed away from v is exactly total_flow[v]/2.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in one direction or another. For each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is S[v], where S[v] is total_flow[v]/2. For the source, S[1] is the total_flow[1]/2? Or maybe not. Wait, for the source, the net outflow is the total flow (since it's the source), which is the sum of all flows on edges directed away from it minus those directed towards it. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it are directed away. So for the source, the sum of flows directed away is total_flow[1], and the sum of flows directed towards it is zero. Hence, the net outflow is total_flow[1], which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the sink, all edges connected to it must be directed towards it, so sum of flows directed into it is total_flow[n], and sum directed away is zero. Net inflow is total_flow[n], which is correct.\n\nBut for the other nodes, we need sum of flows directed away from them to be exactly half of their total_flow.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that for each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is exactly total_flow[v]/2.\n\nHow can we compute this?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of edges with certain constraints on the sum of flows for each node.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently for large n and m?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: this is similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian trail, but with weights. For example, if we imagine that each node has a certain \"excess\" that needs to be balanced by the direction of edges.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the Eulerian trail:\n\nFor each node v (except source and sink), we can think of the total_flow[v] as the sum of flows on edges adjacent to v. We want the sum of flows directed away from v to be exactly half of that. So, for each node, the difference between the flows directed away and towards it must be zero. Which is equivalent to the net outflow being zero.\n\nNow, for the source, the net outflow is total_flow[1], and for the sink, it's -total_flow[n].\n\nBut how to model this as a flow problem?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of assigning directions to edges so that for each node, the net outflow is known. This is similar to a flow problem where we have to find a directed graph with certain net outflows for each node.\n\nBut how to model this? Well, the net outflow for a node is (sum of flows directed away) - (sum of flows directed towards) = net_outflow.\n\nFor each node v, the net_outflow is:\n\n- For v=1: total_flow[1] (since all edges are directed away)\n- For v=n: -total_flow[n] (since all edges are directed towards)\n- For others: 0\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges so that these net outflows are achieved.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAnother idea: think of this as a directed graph where each edge contributes +ci to the net outflow of one node and -ci to the other. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then u's net outflow increases by ci, and v's net outflow decreases by ci (because the flow is directed away from u and towards v).\n\nSo, the problem is to assign directions to edges so that the net outflow for each node is as required.\n\nBut how to model this? It's like a system of equations where for each edge, we choose a direction, and that affects the net outflow of two nodes.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network. Wait, but perhaps we can model it as a graph where we need to find an assignment of directions such that the net outflow for each node is correct.\n\nBut how to find such an assignment?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to find for each edge a direction, such that the sum of ci for edges directed away from node v is equal to the required value. Let's denote for each node v, required_outflow[v] = (if v is source, total_flow[v]; if v is sink, 0; else total_flow[v]/2). Wait, no. Because for the source, the required_outflow is total_flow[v], which is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. For the sink, required_outflow is zero (since all flows are directed into it, so the net outflow is zero minus the sum of flows directed into it, which is -total_flow[n]. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the required net outflow.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nThe net outflow for node v is (sum of flows directed away) - (sum of flows directed towards) = net_outflow[v].\n\nFor the source, since all edges are directed away, net_outflow[v] = sum of all flows on edges connected to it. Which is the maximum flow value.\n\nFor the sink, since all edges are directed towards it, net_outflow[v] = -sum of all flows on edges connected to it. Which is -max_flow.\n\nFor other nodes, net_outflow[v] = 0.\n\nSo the problem becomes: assign directions to edges such that for each node v, net_outflow[v] is as described.\n\nNow, how can we model this? For each edge between u and v, choosing to direct it from u to v will add ci to net_outflow[u] and subtract ci from net_outflow[v]. Choosing the other direction would subtract ci from net_outflow[u] and add ci to net_outflow[v].\n\nSo, the problem is to find for each edge a direction (u→v or v→u) such that the sum for each node is correct.\n\nThis looks like a problem of finding a flow in a graph where each edge has a capacity of 1 (since it can be directed in one of two ways), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a system of equations. For each node v, the sum over edges incident to v of (direction choice) * ci = required_net_outflow[v].\n\nBut how to solve this system?\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each edge can contribute +ci or -ci to the net outflow of its endpoints. But how to find such assignments?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a DFS or BFS approach, adjusting the directions based on the required net outflow.\n\nAnother idea: treat the problem as building a directed graph where each node has a required net outflow. For example, for the source, the required is total_flow[source], for the sink it's -total_flow[sink], and for others it's 0. Let's call this required_net[v].\n\nWe can model this as follows: for each node, we need to have the sum of flows directed away minus flows directed towards equal to required_net[v].\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where we can perform a DFS traversal, and assign directions based on the required net outflow.\n\nFor example, start with the source. All edges connected to the source must be directed away from it (since it can't have incoming edges). Once we direct those edges, we can process their other ends, adjusting the required_net for those nodes accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this step by step.\n\nSuppose I have a node u. I have a certain required_net[u]. For each edge connected to u, if I direct it away from u, then that contributes +ci to the required_net[u]. If I direct it towards u, it contributes -ci to required_net[u].\n\nBut I need to adjust the required_net of the nodes as I assign directions.\n\nWait, but the required_net for each node is fixed. So for example, for the source, required_net is fixed as total_flow[source]. But when we direct edges away from the source, that contributes to the required_net of the source. So, for example, if we have an edge between source and node v, directing it from source to v adds ci to the required_net of the source. Since the required_net of the source is already fixed as the sum of all flows on edges connected to it, this suggests that all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it, because otherwise, the required_net would not be achieved.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the source, required_net is equal to the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. So, if any edge connected to the source were directed towards it, that would subtract ci from the required_net of the source, which would make it impossible to reach the required value. Hence, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Similarly, for the sink, all edges connected to it must be directed towards it.\n\nAh! That's an important observation. Because the required_net for the source is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it, which is achieved only if all edges connected to the source are directed away from it. Because each such edge contributes +ci to the required_net of the source. Similarly for the sink: required_net is -sum of flows on edges connected to it, which is achieved only if all edges connected to it are directed towards it. So this gives us a way to handle the source and sink edges.\n\nSo, for all edges connected to the source (vertex 1), we direct them away from the source. For all edges connected to the sink (vertex n), we direct them towards the sink.\n\nOnce we have handled those edges, what about the other nodes? For the other nodes, their required_net is zero. So, for each of them, the sum of flows directed away from them must equal the sum of flows directed towards them.\n\nSo, how to handle the remaining edges?\n\nLet me think of the remaining edges as forming a subgraph where each node's required_net is zero. Now, for each node in this subgraph, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it must equal the sum of flows directed towards it.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the in-degree (weighted by flow) equals the out-degree. Which is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation. In an undirected graph, an Eulerian orientation is one where each node has equal in-degree and out-degree, which is possible if and only if every node has even degree. But in this case, the degrees are weighted by the flow values. So, for each node, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Which is guaranteed by the problem's conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as an Eulerian orientation problem, where we find a direction for each edge such that for each node, the sum of flows directed away is equal to half of the total_flow of that node. Since the total_flow of the node is even, this is possible.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nOne approach is to build an Eulerian trail for each connected component of the remaining graph (after handling the source and sink edges). However, since the original graph is connected, and after removing edges connected to the source and sink, the remaining graph may be disconnected, but perhaps we can still find such orientations.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a directed graph where we can perform a DFS traversal, and for each edge, assign a direction based on the traversal. For example, during traversal, when visiting a node u and encountering an edge to node v, if v hasn't been visited yet, direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, direct it from v to u. However, this may not ensure the flow conservation conditions.\n\nWait, but this approach is similar to building a directed tree, but again, how to ensure the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n1. Compute for each node, the required_net. For source, required_net is sum of flows on edges connected to it. For sink, it's -sum of flows on edges connected to it. For others, it's zero.\n\n2. For all edges connected to the source, direct them away from the source.\n\n3. For all edges connected to the sink, direct them towards the sink.\n\n4. For the remaining edges, we need to assign directions such that for each node (not source or sink), the sum of flows directed away equals the sum directed towards.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think of the remaining edges. For these edges, their endpoints are not the source or sink. For each such edge, we need to assign a direction. Let's say we have a graph where each node has a balance (the required_net). For example, initially, after handling the source and sink edges, the balance for each node is:\n\nbalance[v] = required_net[v] - (sum of flows on edges directed away from v so far).\n\nBut since required_net[v] is zero for non-source/sink nodes, and we have already directed edges connected to source and sink, the balance for each node is now adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think again.\n\nAfter directing edges connected to the source and sink, the required_net for the source is achieved, and similarly for the sink. For other nodes, their required_net is zero, but the edges connected to them that are already directed (due to being connected to source or sink) may have contributed to their balance.\n\nSo for example, suppose a node v is connected to the source via an edge with flow c. We directed that edge away from the source (so from source to v). This contributes +c to the source's required_net (which is correct) and -c to the required_net of v (since the edge is directed towards v, which means that v's net outflow is decreased by c).\n\nBut the required_net for v is zero. So, this implies that for v, the sum of flows directed away from it must be equal to the sum directed towards it. However, after directing the edge from source to v, v's net outflow is (sum directed away) - (sum directed towards) = (0) - (c) = -c. Which is not zero. Hence, we need to adjust this by directing other edges connected to v to balance this.\n\nThus, the problem becomes for each node v (not source or sink), after handling the edges connected to source and sink, we need to assign directions to the remaining edges such that the net outflow is zero.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding a directed graph where each node has a certain initial imbalance, and we need to assign directions to edges to balance it.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. For example, if we have a graph where each node has an initial imbalance (the amount that needs to be adjusted), and we can assign directions to edges to adjust the imbalances.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nAn idea is to perform a DFS traversal of the graph, and for each edge, direct it in a way that helps balance the current node's imbalance. For example, during traversal, when visiting a node u, we look for an undirected edge (u, v) that hasn't been directed yet. If the current node u has a positive imbalance (meaning it needs to send out more flow), we direct the edge from u to v, which reduces the imbalance of u by ci (since this contributes +ci to u's net outflow) and increases the imbalance of v by ci. Then, we proceed to process v recursively.\n\nBut how does this work?\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nEach node has a balance. Initially, after handling edges connected to source and sink, the balance for each node is computed as follows:\n\nbalance[v] = required_net[v] - (sum of flows directed away from v) + (sum of flows directed towards v). Wait, no. The required_net[v] is the desired net outflow. The current net outflow is (sum directed away) - (sum directed towards). So, the balance is required_net[v] - (current net outflow). We need to adjust this balance to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the current deficit. For each node v, the current deficit is the amount of flow that needs to be directed away from it to reach the required net outflow.\n\nInitially, for the source, after directing all edges away from it, the deficit is zero. For the sink, after directing all edges towards it, the deficit is zero. For other nodes, their deficit is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each node v, the required_net is zero. The current net outflow is (sum of flows directed away) - (sum directed towards). The deficit is required_net - current net outflow. But required_net is zero, so deficit is -current net outflow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nFor the required_net[v], which is the desired net outflow for node v, we have:\n\ndesired_net_outflow[v] = sum_directed_away[v] - sum_directed_towards[v].\n\nFor the source and sink, this is fixed. For other nodes, this must be zero.\n\nSo, during processing, for other nodes, we need to ensure that this equation holds.\n\nAfter handling edges connected to source and sink, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum_directed_away and sum_directed_towards may already have some values. The remaining edges need to be directed to adjust these sums to satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me think of the following variables for each node v:\n\ncurrent_out = sum of flows directed away from v (so far)\n\ncurrent_in = sum of flows directed towards v (so far)\n\nFor non-source/sink nodes, desired_out - desired_in = 0 → current_out - current_in + delta = 0, where delta is the adjustment from the remaining edges.\n\nBut how to compute delta?\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the remaining edges must be directed in such a way that (current_out + added_out) - (current_in + added_in) = 0. Since added_out and added_in are determined by the directions of the remaining edges. For each edge between u and v, if directed from u to v, then added_out[u] += ci, added_in[v] += ci. If directed from v to u, then added_out[v] += ci, added_in[u] += ci.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a DFS-based approach, where for each node, we track the excess of flow that needs to be sent out. For example, if a node has a surplus of flow (i.e., current_out - current_in is less than zero), then it needs to send more flow out through its remaining edges.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nWe can model this as a graph where each node has an excess value. The excess is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out from the node (or received, if negative). For non-source/sink nodes, the excess is initially computed as (current_out - current_in). Wait, no. Because the desired is current_out - current_in + (added_out - added_in) = 0. So added_out - added_in = -(current_out - current_in).\n\nBut added_out - added_in for the remaining edges is equal to the net outflow from the node due to those edges. So, for each node, the sum of added_out - added_in must be equal to -(current_out - current_in). Let's call this value the required adjustment for the node.\n\nSo, for each node v, the required adjustment is:\n\nrequired_adjustment[v] = -(current_out - current_in) = current_in - current_out.\n\nThis is the amount that needs to be added to the net outflow of the node through the remaining edges.\n\nIf required_adjustment[v] is positive, that means the node needs to have more net outflow from the remaining edges. If it's negative, the node needs to have less net outflow (i.e., more net inflow) from the remaining edges.\n\nHow to assign directions to the edges to achieve this?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, during a DFS traversal, whenever we visit a node u with a positive required adjustment (needs to send out more flow), we look for an undirected edge (u, v) that hasn't been processed yet. We direct it from u to v, which contributes +ci to the required adjustment of u (since this adds to the net outflow of u), and subtracts ci from the required adjustment of v (since this adds to the net inflow of v, which is equivalent to subtracting from the required adjustment of v). Then, we recursively process v.\n\nBut how to ensure that this process terminates correctly?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose node u has required adjustment of +5. We find an edge to node v. Directing it from u to v reduces the required adjustment of u by ci (since the edge contributes +ci to the net outflow of u, which was part of the required adjustment). Wait, no. The required adjustment for u is the amount that needs to be added via the remaining edges. When we direct the edge from u to v, the net outflow from u via this edge is +ci. So, the required adjustment for u is reduced by ci, since that contribution is now accounted for. Similarly, the required adjustment for v is increased by ci, since this edge contributes -ci to the net outflow of v (i.e., net inflow of ci, which is equivalent to adding -ci to the net outflow).\n\nSo, during processing, whenever we have a node with a positive required adjustment, we find an edge and direct it away from it, thus reducing its required adjustment and increasing that of the other node. This way, the required adjustment for the current node decreases, and we can continue processing.\n\nThis seems similar to the standard algorithm for finding an Eulerian trail. Let's try to formalize this:\n\nInitialize for each node v (excluding source and sink) the required adjustment as current_in - current_out.\n\nThen, for each node v (excluding source and sink), if required adjustment is not zero, we perform the following:\n\n- Start a DFS from v.\n\n- While there are unprocessed edges:\n\n   - Take an edge (u, v) that is unprocessed.\n\n   - If the current node u has a required adjustment > 0, direct the edge from u to v. Subtract ci from u's required adjustment and add ci to v's required adjustment.\n\n   - Else, direct the edge from v to u. Add ci to u's required adjustment and subtract ci from v's required adjustment.\n\nBut how to manage this in code?\n\nAlternatively, during the traversal, whenever we visit a node, we check if its required adjustment is positive. If so, we look for an adjacent edge that hasn't been processed yet. We direct it away from the current node, and then proceed to the other end of the edge, adjusting the required adjustments accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that the required adjustments are gradually reduced to zero.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps in code:\n\n- First, compute for each node the initial required adjustment (current_in - current_out). This is done after handling the edges connected to the source and sink.\n\n- For each edge that is not connected to the source or sink, we need to process it.\n\n- We can use a data structure to keep track of the unprocessed edges for each node. For example, an adjacency list where each entry contains the list of edges not yet directed.\n\n- Then, for each node, if its required adjustment is not zero, we start a traversal.\n\nBut how to avoid cycles? Because the directed graph must be acyclic. However, the way we assign directions during traversal (like in a DFS) would create a DAG. Because each edge is directed from the current node to another, and we process it once. So, the resulting directed edges would form a DAG, as long as we don't revisit nodes in a way that creates cycles.\n\nWait, but during the traversal, if we process edges in a way that forms a tree, then the directed edges would form a DAG. However, the traversal could potentially create cycles if not handled properly. But since we are processing edges until all required adjustments are zero, perhaps this approach ensures that the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, the problem allows any DAG as long as the flow conditions are satisfied. So even if during the traversal, the directions create a cycle, but somehow the flow conditions are met, but the problem requires the directed graph to have no cycles. So this approach might not guarantee a DAG.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So our approach must ensure that.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. How can we ensure that the directed edges form a DAG?\n\nAn alternative approach is to arrange the nodes in a topological order and direct edges from earlier nodes to later ones. However, how to determine this order?\n\nBut how to find such an order that also satisfies the flow conservation conditions?\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. So, if we can find a topological order of the nodes where the source is first, the sink is last, and for each node, the edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. This would ensure a DAG.\n\nBut how to find such an order that also satisfies the flow conservation conditions?\n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. We need the order to determine the directions, but the directions depend on the flow conservation.\n\nBut perhaps we can combine the two steps. For example, perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal order. During this traversal, we can adjust the directions of edges to meet the flow conservation requirements.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire graph as a DAG, with the source at the beginning and the sink at the end. Then, for each",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The key steps involve ensuring that each vertex (except the source and sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flows, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the total flow for each vertex. For the source (vertex 1), all edges must be directed away from it. For the sink (vertex n), all edges must be directed towards it.\n2. **Balance Calculation**: For each vertex (excluding the source and sink), compute the initial balance based on the flows of edges already directed due to the source and sink.\n3. **DFS Traversal**: Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to process remaining edges.
