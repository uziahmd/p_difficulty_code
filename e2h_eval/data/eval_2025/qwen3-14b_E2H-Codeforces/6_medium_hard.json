Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration is exactly x, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where their durations add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. That means either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts.\n\nThe challenge is to find the minimal sum of costs for such pairs.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. Need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) or O(n).\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can compute its duration. Let's denote duration as d. So for each voucher, d = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe need two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x. And they don't overlap.\n\nSo, for each voucher, if we can find another voucher with duration (x - d), which doesn't overlap with it, then we can consider their sum of costs.\n\nBut how to efficiently find for each voucher, the minimal cost of a voucher with duration (x - d) that does not overlap with it?\n\nBut considering all possibilities, perhaps we can pre-process vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where key is duration, and value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted in some way.\n\nThen, for each voucher with duration d, we check if there exists a voucher with duration (x - d). Then, among those vouchers, find the ones that don't overlap with the current voucher, and find the minimal cost.\n\nBut even that approach may be too slow if done naively. Because for each voucher, checking all vouchers with the required duration could take O(n) time per voucher, leading to O(n^2) time overall.\n\nSo, need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the non-overlapping condition. For two vouchers (li, ri) and (lj, rj), they don't overlap if ri < lj or rj < li. So, for a given voucher A, to find vouchers B that end before A starts, or start after A ends.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal cost of such B vouchers?\n\nLet's suppose we have for each duration d, a sorted list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Also, maybe for each duration, we have a sorted list of start times and end times.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for a voucher A with end time r, we can find all vouchers B with duration (x - d) that end before A's start time (i.e., rj < li). Or, vouchers B that start after A's end time (i.e., lj > ri).\n\nWait, but how can we find the minimal cost for vouchers that end before li, or start after ri?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a voucher A with start li and end ri. We need to find vouchers B with duration (x - d), where d is the duration of A. Let's call target_d = x - d. Then, for B, we need to find those B that end before li (so that ri < lj?), wait no. Wait, the non-overlapping condition is that ri < lj or rj < li. So for B to not overlap with A, either:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. So rj < li.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. So lj > ri.\n\nSo for voucher A, we need to find vouchers B with duration target_d that satisfy either of these two conditions.\n\nNow, for each voucher A, if we can find the minimal cost of vouchers B with target_d that end before li (case 1), and the minimal cost of vouchers B with target_d that start after ri (case 2), then take the minimum between them (if any exist), and then combine that with the cost of A.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each voucher A:\n\n- Compute d = duration of A. Check if x - d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the vouchers). If not, skip.\n\n- For target_d = x - d:\n\n   - Find the minimal cost of a voucher B with duration target_d that ends before A's start time (li). \n\n   - Find the minimal cost of a voucher B with duration target_d that starts after A's end time (ri).\n\n   - Take the minimum between these two (if available) and add to A's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find these minima?\n\nFor that, perhaps for each duration, we can have two sorted lists:\n\nFor duration d:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for case 1 (B ends before A's start time li), we can find all vouchers B with end time < li, and find the minimal cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2 (B starts after A's end time ri), we can have a list sorted by start time. Then, find all vouchers B with start time > ri, and find the minimal cost among them.\n\nBut how to do that quickly?\n\nFor example, for case 1, if we have a list of vouchers for target_d, sorted by end time. Then, for a given li, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time less than li. Then, among all vouchers up to that point, what is the minimal cost? So we need a structure that allows us to query the minimum cost in the prefix up to a certain index.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, if the vouchers are sorted by start time, then for a given ri, we can find the first voucher with start time > ri, and then find the minimal cost in the suffix from that index onwards.\n\nThis suggests that for each duration, we need to pre-process two arrays:\n\nFor case 1 (end before li):\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by end time, and for each position in this list, a prefix minimum of cost.\n\nFor case 2 (start after ri):\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by start time, and for each position in this list, a suffix minimum of cost.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, group them by their duration. For each duration d, we'll have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (for case 1), and a prefix min array.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (for case 2), and a suffix min array.\n\nBut how to build these structures?\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nFor the case 1 (end before li), we can sort the vouchers by end time. Then, for each voucher in this sorted list, we can compute a prefix minimum array. So for example, if the sorted list is [v1, v2, v3, ...], sorted by end time, then prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost between v1 to vi. Then, given a li, we can binary search the largest end time that is less than li. Let's say that index is k. Then the minimum cost in the first k+1 elements is prefix_min[k].\n\nSimilarly, for case 2 (start after ri), we can sort the vouchers by start time. Then, for each position in this sorted list, compute a suffix min array. For example, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from vi to the end. Given a ri, we can binary search the first start time that is greater than ri. Let's say the index is m. Then, the suffix_min[m] would give the minimum cost in the sublist starting at m.\n\nSo for each duration d, we have:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by end time, with prefix min array.\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by start time, with suffix min array.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher A, we can process as follows:\n\nCompute d = duration of A. target_d = x - d.\n\nIf target_d is not present in the duration map, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nFor case 1:\n\nCheck if there are vouchers in target_d's end-sorted list with end time < A's li.\n\nTo find this, we can take the end_sorted list for target_d, and perform a binary search for the largest end time less than li. If such exists, get the prefix_min up to that index. Then, the minimal cost for case 1 is that value.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nCheck if there are vouchers in target_d's start-sorted list with start time > A's ri.\n\nTake the start_sorted list for target_d, perform a binary search to find the first start time greater than ri. Then, if such exists, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost for case 2.\n\nWe can then take the minimum between case1 and case2, add to A's cost, and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut we also have to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as voucher A. However, since we are considering all pairs (i,j) where i and j are different, but when we process each voucher A, and look for vouchers B with target_d, which may include A itself if target_d is equal to d and x is 2d. But since we are looking for two different vouchers, we need to ensure that B is not the same as A.\n\nWait, but when we process voucher A, and look for vouchers B with duration target_d, which could be same as A's duration. So, for example, if x is 2d, then target_d is d. So, when we check for B vouchers with duration d, which includes A. However, the B voucher must be different from A.\n\nSo, in that case, when we look up in the case1 and case2, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as A. But how?\n\nThis complicates things. Because for example, if the voucher A is part of the list for target_d, then during the processing, when we find the minimal cost in the list, it might include A's own cost. Which would be invalid because we need two different vouchers.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nOne approach is, during the preprocessing for each duration, to store all vouchers, and during the binary search steps, when we find a possible B, check if it's the same voucher as A. However, this seems complicated, especially when the same voucher is present multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing, when we find a candidate B, we can check if the voucher is different. But how?\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. Because for each voucher A, when we find the minimal cost for case1 and case2, we need to ensure that the B voucher is not A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAnother idea: when building the data structures, for each duration, the list includes all vouchers. However, when we process voucher A, and check for B's with target_d, we can check whether the minimal cost found includes A. If it does, then we need to find the next minimal cost, excluding A.\n\nBut that sounds complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice. But no, the problem says that i and j must be different. So, for example, if x is 2d, and there's only one voucher with duration d, then it's impossible. But if there are two vouchers with duration d, then we can pair them.\n\nBut during the processing of voucher A (with duration d), when we look for B's with duration d, and the minimal cost is found in the list. However, if the minimal cost is A's own cost, then we need to find the next minimal cost in the list (excluding A). But how?\n\nThis seems tricky. How can we handle this?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each voucher A, when checking for B's with target_d, we can process the entire list, but ignore the voucher A itself. However, this would require that during the binary search steps, we can exclude A from the list. But how?\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe another approach is to allow for the possibility that the same voucher is considered, but then during the final check, subtract that case.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem's constraints, the number of cases where the same voucher is considered is negligible. However, that's not safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have two copies of the list. One that includes all vouchers, and another that excludes the current voucher. But that's not feasible.\n\nHmm. Let's think of an example. Suppose voucher A is part of the target_d list. When we process A, we look for B's in the target_d list. The minimal cost in the list may include A's own cost. So, in that case, the pair (A, A) is invalid. So, during the processing, we need to ensure that the B is not A.\n\nBut how?\n\nOne possible way is to note that for each voucher A, when considering B's with target_d, we can check if the minimal cost comes from a voucher that is not A. If the minimal cost is from A, then we need to find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of voucher A, when we look for B's in the target_d list, we can check if there's at least one other voucher in the list. Because if the list has multiple vouchers, then even if the minimal cost is A's cost, there's another voucher with possibly the same or higher cost. But if the list has only one voucher, which is A, then it's invalid.\n\nBut this approach would not work in all cases. For example, if there are two vouchers with the same duration and same cost. Then, the minimal cost is the same, and we can pair them.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing, when we find the minimal cost in the case1 or case2, we can check if that minimal cost comes from a voucher that is not A. But how?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think again. For each voucher A, when we are looking for B's with target_d, the B can be any voucher except A. So during the processing, when we look up the minimal cost for case1 and case2, we have to make sure that the B is not the same as A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nMaybe the following approach: for each voucher A, when we process it, we can check for the target_d. For the target_d's case1 and case2, we can check if there exists any voucher B in the list that is not A and satisfies the non-overlapping condition. If so, take the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nOne possible way is to pre-process for each duration, the sorted lists and prefix/suffix min arrays. Then, when we find the minimal cost for case1, we check if the minimal cost is from a voucher that is not A. If not, then we need to find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. For example, if the minimal cost is A's cost, then we need to find the next minimal cost in the same list. However, how can we do that quickly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the prefix min array, but also track for each position which voucher is the one contributing to the min. But that would complicate the data structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the same voucher to be considered and then subtract that case. But that would require checking for each possible pair.\n\nBut perhaps, given the time constraints, the problem can be handled by considering that when the same voucher is considered, it's possible that there's another voucher in the list. For example, if the minimal cost is from A, but there's another voucher with the same cost, then it's okay.\n\nBut how can we know that?\n\nThis seems like a tricky part. However, perhaps for the problem's purposes, the code can proceed as follows: during the processing, for each voucher A, when looking for B's in the target_d list, we can check if there's at least one voucher B that meets the condition (non-overlapping) and is different from A. If so, then take the minimal cost. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut how to check if there's such a B?\n\nWell, during the processing, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if the voucher that provides that minimal cost is not A. If yes, then use it. Otherwise, check if there are other vouchers in the list that meet the condition.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing, when we find the minimal cost for case1, we can check if that minimal cost is from a voucher that is not A. If not, then we need to find the next minimal cost in the list. However, this would require more complex data structures, like for each prefix, storing the min cost and the count, etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps, given the time constraints, we can proceed with the initial approach, allowing for the same voucher to be considered, but then during the processing, when we find that the voucher is the same as A, we can skip it. However, how can we know if the minimal cost is from A?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed with the initial approach, and then during the final answer, if the minimal cost is found by pairing a voucher with itself, then we can check if there's another voucher in the same group.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to proceed with the initial approach, and then during the case where the same voucher is considered, we can check if there are at least two vouchers in the target_d group. But even that may not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing, for each voucher A, when looking for B's with target_d, we can process the case where B is not A. For example, in the case where the target_d is the same as A's duration, and during the binary search, we can exclude A from the list. However, this would require modifying the data structures on the fly, which is not feasible.\n\nAnother idea: when building the data structures for each duration, we can have all vouchers. Then, when processing voucher A, during the case1 and case2 checks, if the minimal cost is found, we can check if there exists a voucher B in that list that is not A and satisfies the condition. If so, take the minimal cost. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor example, suppose in case1, the minimal cost is found in the prefix up to index k. The prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost. Now, if the voucher that gives this minimal cost is A, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the prefix that are not A. If yes, then take the next minimal cost.\n\nBut how to know which voucher gives the minimal cost?\n\nThis seems to require storing not just the minimal cost, but also the indices of the vouchers contributing to the minima. Which would complicate the data structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each duration, the list of vouchers is stored with their li, ri, and cost. Then, during the processing, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if there exists a voucher in the list that meets the condition and is not A. However, this would require checking all possible vouchers in the list, which would be O(n) again, leading back to O(n^2) time.\n\nThis is not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps, for the purpose of solving the problem, we can proceed under the assumption that the same voucher is not used twice. That is, during the processing, if the voucher A is the only one in the target_d list, then it's invalid. Otherwise, even if the minimal cost is from A, there's another voucher that can be used. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if the target_d list has two vouchers, A and B, and A is the only one that meets the non-overlapping condition. Then, B may not meet the condition. So, in this case, even though there are two vouchers, the only one that meets the condition is A, and thus the pair (A, B) is invalid.\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps the correct way to handle this is to allow the same voucher to be considered, but then during the pairing, if the voucher is the same, we ignore it. However, how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered, but during the check, we can verify that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nLet me think. For example, during the case1 processing for voucher A, when we find that the minimal cost in the prefix is some value, but we need to make sure that there exists at least one voucher in the prefix that is not A. How?\n\nWell, during the binary search step, if the voucher A is in the target_d list, then during the processing of case1, the voucher A would be included in the list. So, if the voucher A's end time is less than li (which is the start time of A itself), that's impossible. Because li is the start time of A, and ri is the end time of A. So for case1, B's end time must be less than li. But for voucher A, ri >= li. So, B's end time (which is ri) can't be less than li. Therefore, voucher A cannot be part of the case1 for itself. Because the end time of A is ri >= li, and case1 requires B's end time < li. Therefore, for voucher A, case1 can't include A itself. Similarly, for case2, the B's start time must be greater than ri. But for voucher A, its start time is li <= ri. So, voucher A's start time is not greater than ri. Therefore, voucher A can't be part of case2 for itself.\n\nTherefore, when processing voucher A, the case1 and case2 checks for B's in target_d will not include voucher A itself. Because voucher A's end time is ri >= li, and case1 requires B's end time < li. Since B's end time is ri_B < li_A. But A's own end time is ri_A >= li_A. So, if B is A, then ri_B = ri_A >= li_A. Therefore, B's end time is not less than li_A. Hence, case1 for voucher A cannot include A itself. Similarly, case2 requires B's start time > ri_A. For voucher A, its start time is li_A <= ri_A. So, B can't be A in case2.\n\nSo, this implies that when processing voucher A, the case1 and case2 for B's in target_d will not include voucher A itself. Therefore, there's no need to worry about overlapping with A. Thus, the initial approach is safe.\n\nThat's a crucial insight! Because voucher A can't be part of the case1 or case2 when considering itself. Therefore, during the processing, when we find the minimal cost for case1 and case2, we don't have to worry about including the same voucher. Because the conditions for case1 and case2 ensure that B is different from A.\n\nThis simplifies things a lot. So, no need to worry about the same voucher being considered. Because during the case1 and case2 processing, the B vouchers can't be the same as A.\n\nSo, the initial approach can proceed safely.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, grouped by duration. For each duration d, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time, with prefix min array.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time, with suffix min array.\n\nThen, for each voucher A:\n\n   d = duration of A.\n\n   target_d = x - d.\n\n   if target_d is not in the dictionary, continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process case1 and case2:\n\n      case1: find B with duration target_d, end time < li_A. The minimal cost of such B.\n\n      case2: find B with duration target_d, start time > ri_A. The minimal cost of such B.\n\n      take the minimum between case1 and case2, add to A's cost. Update the global minimum.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this.\n\nNow, how to implement the preprocessing.\n\nLet's think about building for each duration d:\n\nFor case1 (end-sorted list with prefix min):\n\nSort the vouchers by end time. Then, for each position i in the sorted list, compute prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost). So, the prefix_min array allows us to find the minimal cost in the first k elements.\n\nFor case2 (start-sorted list with suffix min):\n\nSort the vouchers by start time. Then, for each position i in the sorted list, compute suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current voucher's cost). So, the suffix_min array allows us to find the minimal cost from position i to the end.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher A, we can perform the following steps:\n\nFor case1:\n\ntarget_d = x - d_A.\n\nCheck if target_d exists in the duration map.\n\nIf yes:\n\n   get the end_sorted list for target_d.\n\n   perform a binary search on this list to find the largest end time that is less than li_A.\n\n   if such exists, then get the prefix_min up to that index, and that's the minimal cost for case1.\n\nFor case2:\n\n   get the start_sorted list for target_d.\n\n   perform a binary search to find the first start time that is greater than ri_A.\n\n   if such exists, get the suffix_min from that index, which is the minimal cost for case2.\n\nNow, how to perform the binary search for case1 and case2.\n\nFor case1: end_sorted list is sorted by end time. We want to find the maximum end time that is less than li_A. So, this is equivalent to finding the upper bound of li_A - 1, and taking the index before that.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can be used. For example, using bisect_left to find the insertion point of li_A in the end_sorted list. Then, the index is insertion_point - 1.\n\nWait, but the end_sorted list is a list of vouchers sorted by end time. So, for each voucher in the list, we can extract the end time. So, perhaps for each duration, we can have a list of end times, and a list of prefix mins.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- A list of end times, sorted.\n\n- A list of prefix mins.\n\nSo, for example, for duration d, end_list = [voucher.end for voucher in sorted_vouchers], and prefix_min = [ ... ].\n\nSo, for case1, given li_A, we can perform a binary search on end_list to find the rightmost element less than li_A. The index of that element would give us the position to get the prefix_min.\n\nSimilarly, for case2: the start_sorted list is sorted by start time. We want to find the first start time that is greater than ri_A. The bisect_right function can be used. For example, using bisect.bisect_right(start_list, ri_A) gives the insertion point, which is the first element greater than ri_A. Then, if the insertion point is less than len(start_list), then the suffix_min from that index is the minimal cost.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nstart_list is sorted. We want to find the first start time > ri_A. Using bisect.bisect_right(start_list, ri_A) gives us the index where elements after are > ri_A.\n\nSo, for the start_list, if the insertion index is m, then all elements from m onwards are start times > ri_A. Then, the suffix_min[m] is the minimal cost for those elements.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the preprocessing:\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are tuples (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut for each duration, we need to process the vouchers. So:\n\nfor each voucher in all_vouchers:\n\n   d = voucher.duration\n\n   if d not in duration_dict:\n\n       create new entries for end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min.\n\n   append voucher's end to end_list.\n\n   append voucher's start to start_list.\n\nOnce all vouchers are added, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\n   sort the end_list and compute prefix_min.\n\n   sort the start_list and compute suffix_min.\n\nWait, but for the end_list, we need to sort the vouchers by their end time. So, for each duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration, then sort them by end time, then extract the end times into end_list. Similarly for start_list, sort the vouchers by start time, then extract the start times into start_list.\n\nWait, but the vouchers may have same start or end times. But the sorting is straightforward.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nfor a given duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration. Then:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.end)\n\nend_list = [v.end for v in sorted_by_end]\n\nprefix_min is computed as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_by_end)-1:\n\n   prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.start)\n\nstart_list = [v.start for v in sorted_by_start]\n\nsuffix_min is computed as follows:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n   suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, then during the processing of each voucher A, we can perform the steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read n vouchers. For each, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nThen, group the vouchers by their duration.\n\nThen, for each duration in the group, process the sorted lists and prefix/suffix mins.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher A:\n\n   d = duration of A.\n\n   target_d = x - d.\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process case1 and case2.\n\n      for case1:\n\n         get the end_list and prefix_min of target_d.\n\n         find the largest end time < li_A.\n\n         if exists, get the prefix_min value.\n\n      for case2:\n\n         get the start_list and suffix_min of target_d.\n\n         find the first start time > ri_A.\n\n         if exists, get the suffix_min value.\n\n      then, take the minimum between case1 and case2, if any, and add to A's cost. Update the global minimum.\n\nFinally, after processing all vouchers, if the global minimum was found, output it, else -1.\n\nNow, handling the binary search steps.\n\nFor case1:\n\nWe have the end_list sorted in ascending order. We want to find the largest value in end_list that is less than li_A.\n\nThis can be done with bisect_left.\n\nFor example, using the bisect module:\n\nimport bisect\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(end_list, li_A) - 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nbisect_left returns the insertion point for li_A in end_list. All elements before the insertion point are <= li_A. Wait, no. The bisect_left function finds the first position where li_A can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. So for a list sorted in ascending order, elements before the insertion point are <= li_A? No, elements before are <= li_A?\n\nActually, bisect_left returns the first index where the element is >= li_A. Wait, no. Let me think of an example. For example, if the list is [1,3,5], and we search for 2. bisect_left returns 1, since inserting 2 at index 1 would keep the list sorted. The elements before index 1 are [1], which are less than 2. Elements from index 1 onwards are >= 2.\n\nSo, if we want the largest element less than li_A, then the insertion point is the first index where the element is >= li_A. So, the largest element less than li_A is at index insertion_point -1, provided that insertion_point > 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(end_list, li_A)\n\nif insertion_point == 0:\n\n   no elements less than li_A.\n\nelse:\n\n   max_index = insertion_point - 1.\n\n   min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[max_index]\n\nBut we need to make sure that insertion_point is not zero. Also, if insertion_point is zero, then there are no elements less than li_A.\n\nSimilarly, for case2:\n\nWe have start_list sorted in ascending order. We want the first start time that is greater than ri_A. This is the same as finding the insertion point for ri_A + 1, or using bisect_right.\n\nFor example, using bisect.bisect_right(start_list, ri_A). This returns the insertion point after any existing entries of ri_A. So, all elements before the insertion point are <= ri_A. All elements from insertion_point onwards are > ri_A. So, if insertion_point is less than len(start_list), then the elements from insertion_point onwards are valid.\n\nSo, for case2, the minimal cost is suffix_min[insertion_point], if insertion_point < len(start_list).\n\nSo, for example:\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(start_list, ri_A)\n\nif insertion_point < len(start_list):\n\n   min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[insertion_point]\n\nelse:\n\n   no such voucher.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, we need to represent the vouchers. Let's think of each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). For each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nThen, group them by duration.\n\nNow, for each duration in the group, we need to process sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost, duration) )\n\n# Preprocessing: group by duration\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# Now, for each duration in duration_dict, process sorted lists and prefix/suffix mins\n# We'll create another dictionary, say, processed_data, which maps duration to (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\nprocessed_data = dict()\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    # For this duration, process the vouchers\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n    \n    # Sort by end time for case1\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])  # x[1] is ri\n    end_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_by_end:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n        prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n    \n    # Sort by start time for case2\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])  # x[0] is li\n    start_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n    # compute suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    \n    # Store in processed_data\n    processed_data[d] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\n\n# Now, iterate through each voucher and check for possible pairs\nmin_total_cost = float('inf')\n\nfor li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n    target_d = x - duration\n    if target_d not in processed_data:\n        continue\n    # process case1 and case2\n    # case1: find vouchers in target_d with end < li\n    end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = processed_data[target_d]\n    # find insertion point for li in end_list\n    insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(end_list, li)\n    if insertion_point > 0:\n        # possible case1\n        case1_cost = prefix_min[insertion_point - 1]\n        min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, case1_cost + cost)\n    # case2: find vouchers in target_d with start > ri\n    insertion_point_case2 = bisect.bisect_right(start_list, ri)\n    if insertion_point_case2 < len(start_list):\n        case2_cost = suffix_min[insertion_point_case2]\n        min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, case2_cost + cost)\n\nif min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(min_total_cost)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the processed_data is built for each duration. However, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, the vouchers_list is the list of vouchers with that duration. Then, sorted_by_end is sorted by end time (ri), and sorted_by_start is sorted by start time (li).\n\nBut in the code, for the case1, the end_list is the list of ri's sorted. And during the binary search, we are searching for li of the current voucher. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by end time with a prefix minimum cost array for quick lookup of minimum costs for vouchers ending before a certain date.\n   - Another sorted by start time with a suffix minimum cost array for quick lookup of minimum costs for vouchers starting after a certain date.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (such that their durations sum to the required value) that does not overlap. We use binary search to efficiently find these valid pairs and compute the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess data for each duration\n    processed_data = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        \n        # Sort by end time and compute prefix min\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        \n        # Sort by start time and compute suffix min\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        \n        processed_data[d] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        target_d = x - duration\n        if target_d not in processed_data:\n            continue\n        end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = processed_data[target_d]\n        \n        # Case 1: find vouchers with end < li\n        insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(end_list, li)\n        if insertion_point > 0:\n            case1_cost = prefix_min[insertion_point - 1]\n            min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, case1_cost + cost)\n        \n        # Case 2: find vouchers with start > ri\n        insertion_point_case2 = bisect.bisect_right(start_list, ri)\n        if insertion_point_case2 < len(start_list):\n            case2_cost = suffix_min[insertion_point_case2]\n            min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, case2_cost + cost)\n    \n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: This allows efficient checking of complementary durations.\n- **Preprocessing**: Sorting and creating prefix/suffix minimum arrays enable quick lookups for minimum costs.\n- **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds valid non-overlapping vouchers for each voucher considered, ensuring the solution handles large inputs within acceptable time limits.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible valid pairs while maintaining a time complexity that is feasible for large input sizes.",
