Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j such that their durations sum to x, and they don't overlap. Also, they must be different vouchers.\n\nSo the approach is to find all pairs of vouchers where duration_i + duration_j = x, and they don't overlap. Then find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nBut considering the constraints, n can be up to 2e5, so checking all pairs (O(n²)) would be way too slow. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Let's first pre-process the vouchers by their durations. For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration equal to (x - duration_i). Then, for those pairs, check if they don't overlap.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all possible vouchers with the required duration could be expensive unless we can find a way to efficiently query for the minimal cost vouchers that are non-overlapping.\n\nAlternative idea: For each voucher, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The first voucher is the one with duration d, and we need a second voucher with duration (x - d) that ends before the first voucher starts. So for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find the minimal cost voucher j with duration (x - d) where rj < li.\n\nCase 2: The second voucher is the one with duration (x - d), and we need a voucher j with duration (x - d) that starts after ri. So for voucher i with duration d, find the minimal cost voucher j with duration (x - d) where lj > ri.\n\nIf we can find for each voucher, the minimal cost in these two cases, then we can compute the overall minimum.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find those minimal costs?\n\nLet's think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For each possible duration, we can have a list of vouchers. Then, for a given duration d, we can look into the group for (x - d) and find the minimal cost vouchers that meet the required conditions.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost vouchers that end before a certain day (for case 1) or start after a certain day (for case 2)?\n\nFor case 1: For a voucher i with duration d, we need vouchers in the group of (x-d) that end before li. So for each such voucher j, rj < li. To find the minimal cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: vouchers j in group (x-d) with lj > ri.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each voucher i, and for the group of duration (x - d_i), find the minimal cost voucher in that group that ends before li (case 1) or starts after ri (case 2).\n\nHow can we do this efficiently?\n\nFor each duration value, we can pre-process the vouchers in that group. For example, for a group of vouchers with duration t, we can sort them by their end time (r) and also by their start time (l). Then, for a given li, we can perform a binary search in the sorted list of end times to find all vouchers with r < li, and take the minimum cost among them. Similarly, for start times, we can sort by l and find the earliest l that is greater than ri, and take the minimum cost.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal cost for vouchers that end before a certain day? Let's think about for a group of vouchers with duration t. Suppose we have all vouchers in this group sorted by their end time. Then, for a given li, we can find all vouchers in this group with rj < li. Among these, we want the minimal cost. But how to get that quickly?\n\nIf we can, for each duration t, have the vouchers sorted by their end time, and also have a prefix minimum array. For example, if the vouchers are sorted by end time in ascending order, then for each position in the sorted list, we can store the minimum cost from the beginning up to that position. Then, for a given li, we can binary search to find the largest rj that is less than li, and then take the prefix minimum up to that index. That would give the minimal cost in that group for vouchers ending before li.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case, where we need vouchers starting after ri. For this, we can sort the vouchers in the group by their start time, and have a suffix minimum array. So, for a given ri, we can binary search to find the first voucher with lj > ri. Then, the suffix minimum from that index onwards gives the minimal cost in that group.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. Create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, we'll sort them by end time (for case 1) and by start time (for case 2), and build prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nWait, but for each duration, we need to have two sorted lists? Or maybe for each duration, we can have two sorted structures: one sorted by end time (for case 1) and another sorted by start time (for case 2). Alternatively, for each duration, we can have two separate sorted lists.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration t, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time (r) for case 1 (find vouchers ending before li)\n- Sorted by start time (l) for case 2 (find vouchers starting after ri)\n\nBut perhaps for each duration, we can have:\n\nFor case 1: vouchers sorted by end time, and for each position, the prefix min cost.\n\nFor case 2: vouchers sorted by start time, and for each position, the suffix min cost.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary called duration_dict. For each duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, we process the vouchers as follows:\n\n- Sort the vouchers by their end time (r) in ascending order. Then, create a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers. So for any end time, when we find the latest voucher with end time < li, we can take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n- Also, sort the vouchers by their start time (l) in ascending order. Then, create a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from i to end. So for a given ri, we can find the first voucher with l > ri, and then take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nOnce this preprocessing is done, for each voucher in the original list, we can check if (x - duration_i) exists in duration_dict. If it does, then we can check both cases (case1 and case2) for that voucher.\n\nSo for each voucher i with duration d, we check if (x - d) is a valid duration (i.e., present in duration_dict). If not, skip. Otherwise, for the group of vouchers with duration t = x -d:\n\nCase1: Find vouchers in t's group that end before li. So for the sorted list of vouchers in t's group by end time, find the maximum end time less than li. Then, the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nCase2: Find vouchers in t's group that start after ri. So for the sorted list of vouchers in t's group by start time, find the first start time greater than ri. Then, the minimal cost from that position onwards.\n\nFor each of these two cases, if found, we can compute the sum of the current voucher's cost and the found minimal cost. Then keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut there's a catch: when checking case1 and case2, the voucher j can't be the same as voucher i. Because the problem says i and j must be different. However, in our approach, when we process voucher i, we are looking for vouchers in the t group (t = x -d). If voucher i's duration is d, then t is x -d. So if x -d is equal to d (i.e., x is even and d = x/2), then we need to make sure that when we look for vouchers in the t group, we don't include voucher i itself.\n\nWait, but when x is even and d = x/2, then the two vouchers would have duration d each. So, for example, voucher i has duration d, and we're looking for another voucher j with duration d. So during processing, when we check for case1 and case2, we need to ensure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. How to handle this?\n\nWell, during the processing of voucher i, when we check for the group t = x -d, which is same as d if x is even. So, for example, if we have a voucher i with duration d, and we are looking for vouchers in the same group (t = d), then when looking for j, we need to exclude voucher i.\n\nBut how can we do that? Because during the preprocessing, the group for duration d includes all vouchers with that duration, including voucher i.\n\nSo, for example, when processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers in the group t (which is same as d), we need to find the minimal cost in the group excluding voucher i.\n\nThis seems tricky. How to handle this?\n\nOne approach is to, for each voucher i, when checking the group t, check whether the voucher j is different from i. However, since we are looking for the minimal cost, perhaps we can check if the minimal cost in the group is achieved by a voucher that is not i.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher i, when we look for the minimal cost in the group t, we can check if the minimal cost comes from a voucher that is not i. However, if the minimal cost in the group is from voucher i itself, then we need to find the next minimal cost in the group.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How to handle that?\n\nAnother idea: when building the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays, we can have all vouchers in the group. Then, for a voucher i, when we are processing it, and the group is t = x -d, which may be same as d, we can check if the voucher i is part of the group. If yes, then during the case1 and case2 checks, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in case1, when we find the minimal cost in the group t that ends before li, we need to check if that minimal cost is from voucher i. If yes, then perhaps we need to find the second minimal cost in that group.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy. How can we do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration group, we can have multiple entries. But when processing voucher i, we can temporarily remove it from the group and then query the min. But that's not feasible for large n.\n\nAlternatively, during the case1 and case2 checks, when we find the minimal cost in the group, we can check whether that voucher is the same as the current voucher. If it is, then we can check if there's another voucher in the group with the same minimal cost, or find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut this seems complex and may not be efficient.\n\nWait, but what if we allow the same voucher to be considered, but then later when we process voucher j, we will check again for voucher i. So, for example, if voucher i and j are the same, but the code would process voucher i and j, but during processing, the code would generate pairs (i,j) and (j,i). However, since the problem requires i≠j, but in that case, if the code allows i and j being same, but during the processing, we have to avoid that.\n\nBut in our approach, when processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers in the group t, which may include voucher i itself. However, since the code would check for vouchers that end before li (case1) or start after ri (case2), and voucher i's own end time is ri. So, for case1, when looking for vouchers ending before li (voucher i's li), the voucher i's own end time is ri. Since the voucher i's li is li, and the voucher i's end time is ri. So, for case1, when we look for vouchers ending before li, the voucher i's end time is ri, which is >= li (since li <= ri). So, in case1, the voucher i cannot be included. Therefore, in case1, the group t's vouchers that end before li cannot include voucher i. So, for case1, when processing voucher i, the group t's vouchers that are considered are not including voucher i.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. Let's think about case1: for voucher i, we are looking for vouchers j in group t where rj < li. Now, voucher i's own r is ri. Since li is the departure day of voucher i. And ri is the return day of voucher i. So, ri >= li. So, rj (the return day of voucher j) must be < li. But voucher i's ri is >= li. So, voucher i's own r is not less than li. Therefore, when processing case1, the voucher i itself is not part of the group that we are checking. Therefore, when we look for vouchers j in group t that end before li, the voucher i is not part of that group. Thus, there's no need to worry about overlapping with the current voucher i in case1.\n\nSimilarly, in case2: looking for vouchers j in group t with lj > ri. The current voucher i's lj is li. But for case2, we are looking for vouchers j with lj > ri. Voucher i's lj is li, but ri is the return day of voucher i. So, if voucher i is in the group t, then lj is li. But for case2, we are checking if lj > ri. So, voucher i's lj is li. So, if li > ri (which is impossible, since li <= ri), then it would be included. But since li <= ri, the voucher i's lj (li) is not greater than ri. Therefore, when processing case2, the voucher i itself is not part of the group being considered. Hence, when looking for vouchers j in group t that start after ri, voucher i is not part of that group. Therefore, there's no need to worry about the same voucher being considered here.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach can proceed without worrying about duplicate vouchers. Because when processing voucher i, the group t's vouchers considered in case1 and case2 do not include voucher i.\n\nThat's a relief! So, the initial approach is safe. Because when processing voucher i, the group t's vouchers that are considered for case1 and case2 are not including voucher i itself.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n- Compute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\n- Check if (x - d_i) exists in the duration_dict. Let's call this target_duration.\n\n- If target_duration exists, then for the group of vouchers with duration target_duration, check case1 and case2.\n\nSo, for case1: find the minimal cost of vouchers in target_duration group that end before li. Then add it to voucher i's cost.\n\nFor case2: find the minimal cost of vouchers in target_duration group that start after ri. Then add it to voucher i's cost.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement the case1 and case2 efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the data for each duration.\n\nFor each duration t, we have two sorted lists:\n\n- A list sorted by end time (r), and for each position, the prefix_min array. This helps in case1.\n\n- A list sorted by start time (l), and for each position, the suffix_min array. This helps in case2.\n\nSo, for example, for each duration t, we can have:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers with duration t, key=lambda x: x.r)\n\nprefix_min_end = array where prefix_min_end[i] is the minimum cost from sorted_by_end[0] to sorted_by_end[i]\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers with duration t, key=lambda x: x.l)\n\nsuffix_min_start = array where suffix_min_start[i] is the minimum cost from sorted_by_start[i] to the end.\n\nOnce these are precomputed, then for a given li (case1), we can perform a binary search on sorted_by_end to find the largest r_j that is less than li. Then, the prefix_min_end up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case2, given ri, perform a binary search on sorted_by_start to find the first l_j that is greater than ri. Then, the suffix_min_start from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo, the steps for preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration t in duration_dict:\n\n   sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers in t group by r)\n\n   create prefix_min_end array:\n\n      prefix_min_end[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\n\n      for i from 1 to len(sorted_by_end)-1:\n\n          prefix_min_end[i] = min(prefix_min_end[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\n   sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers in t group by l)\n\n   create suffix_min_start array:\n\n      suffix_min_start[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\n\n      for i from len(sorted_by_start)-2 down to 0:\n\n          suffix_min_start[i] = min(suffix_min_start[i+1], sorted_by_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i, when we need to check for case1 and case2, we can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, for case1:\n\nWe need to find in the target_duration group (t) the minimal cost of vouchers with r_j < li.\n\nSo, in the sorted_by_end list of t group, we can perform a binary search to find the rightmost element with r_j < li. Let's say that index is idx. If idx is -1 (no such element), then case1 is not possible. Else, the minimal cost is prefix_min_end[idx].\n\nSimilarly, for case2:\n\nWe need to find in the target_duration group the minimal cost of vouchers with l_j > ri.\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list of t group, perform a binary search to find the leftmost element with l_j > ri. Let's say that index is idx. If idx is len(sorted_by_start), then no such element. Else, the minimal cost is suffix_min_start[idx].\n\nSo, the key is to perform these binary searches.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, how to handle the binary search for case1 and case2.\n\nFor case1, in the sorted_by_end list (sorted by r in ascending order), find the largest r_j < li. So, the binary search can be done using bisect_left or bisect_right.\n\nFor example, using the bisect module:\n\nWe can collect all the r values in a list, say ends = [v.r for v in sorted_by_end].\n\nThen, using bisect_left to find the insertion point of li in ends. The insertion point gives the first element >= li. So, the number of elements less than li is insertion_point. So, the index is insertion_point -1. If insertion_point is 0, then there are no elements < li.\n\nSo, for example, if insertion_point is k, then all elements before k are < li. So, if k == 0, then no elements. Else, the max index is k-1.\n\nSimilarly, for case2, in the sorted_by_start list (sorted by l in ascending order), find the first element with l_j > ri. Using bisect_right for ri in starts = [v.l for v in sorted_by_start]. The insertion point gives the first element > ri. So, if insertion_point is 0, then all elements are > ri? No. Wait, bisect_right returns insertion point after any existing entries of ri. So, for example, if starts is [1,2,3,4], and we search for 2, bisect_right returns 2. So elements before index 2 are <= 2. So elements from index 2 onwards are > 2.\n\nSo, the insertion point gives us the first index where l_j > ri. Then, if insertion_point is less than len(starts), then there are elements from insertion_point onwards that satisfy l_j > ri. The minimal cost in that range is the suffix_min_start[insertion_point].\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read n vouchers. For each voucher, compute its duration (ri - li + 1). Store all vouchers in a list.\n\nThen, group the vouchers by their duration. For example, using a dictionary, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration in the dictionary, preprocess the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, along with their prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher in the original list. For each voucher, compute d_i = duration. Check if (x - d_i) is present in the duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\nElse, for the target duration t = x -d_i:\n\n   Check case1 and case2.\n\nFor case1:\n\n   In the t group's sorted_by_end list, find the minimal cost of vouchers with r_j < li.\n\n   How?\n\n   Get the list of ends (r values) in sorted_by_end. Use bisect_left to find insertion point of li. If insertion_point is 0, no such elements. Else, the index is insertion_point -1. The minimal cost is prefix_min_end[insertion_point -1].\n\nFor case2:\n\n   In the t group's sorted_by_start list, find the minimal cost of vouchers with l_j > ri.\n\n   Get the list of starts (l values) in sorted_by_start. Use bisect_right to find insertion_point of ri. If insertion_point is len(starts), then no such elements. Else, the minimal cost is suffix_min_start[insertion_point].\n\nIf either case1 or case2 gives a valid cost, then add it to the current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the global minimum was found, output it. Else, output -1.\n\nNow, some edge cases to consider:\n\n- When x is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no. Wait, the input says x can be 2 <= n, x <= 2e5. Wait, no. The first line says n and x, with 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.\n\nSo x can be as low as 2. So, for example, if x is 2, then each voucher must have duration 1 and 1. So, two vouchers with duration 1, non-overlapping.\n\nBut in the code, for each voucher with duration d, the target duration is x -d. So for x=2, if a voucher has duration 1, target duration is 1. So, the code will check for vouchers with duration 1, and see if they are non-overlapping with the current voucher.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are multiple vouchers with same duration and overlapping, but some non-overlapping.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to represent the vouchers. Let's think about storing each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Then, for each duration group, we can have sorted lists.\n\nNow, in Python, for each duration in the duration_dict, we can precompute the sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess each duration group\npreprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start)\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n    # Process sorted_by_end and prefix_min_end\n    group = duration_dict[duration]\n    # sort by end time (r)\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # create prefix min\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for voucher in sorted_by_end:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher[2])\n        prefix_min_end.append( min_so_far )\n    # sort by start time (l)\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    # create suffix min\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n    # save in preprocessed\n    preprocessed[duration] = (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start)\n\n# Now, for each voucher, check for possible pairs\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor l_i, r_i, cost_i, duration_i in vouchers:\n    target_duration = x - duration_i\n    if target_duration not in preprocessed:\n        continue\n    # get the preprocessed data for target_duration\n    sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[target_duration]\n    # Case1: find vouchers in target_duration group with r_j < l_i\n    # get the list of r's in sorted_by_end\n    ends = [voucher[1] for voucher in sorted_by_end]\n    # find insertion point of l_i in ends\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l_i)\n    if idx > 0:\n        # there are elements before idx\n        min_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n        total = cost_i + min_case1\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n    # Case2: find vouchers in target_duration group with l_j > r_i\n    starts = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start]\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r_i)\n    if idx < len(starts):\n        min_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n        total = cost_i + min_case2\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but in the preprocessed data, for each duration, the group is stored as a list of (l, r, cost). So in the code above, when we process the target_duration, we get the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, which are lists of tuples (l, r, cost). Then, for the ends list, we collect voucher[1], which is r. For starts, voucher[0], which is l.\n\nBut in the code, the 'group' is a list of (l, r, cost). So yes.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1 = 3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo, vouchers have durations 3, 2, 2, 2.\n\nx is 5.\n\nLooking for pairs with durations adding to 5. For example, 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo for the first voucher (duration 3), target duration is 5-3=2. So check for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nIn the preprocessed data for duration 2, the group has three vouchers: (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Let's see how they are sorted.\n\nsorted_by_end: sorted by r. All have r=2, 6, 2. Wait, the vouchers are (l, r, cost):\n\nvoucher 2: (1, 2, 5) --> r=2\n\nvoucher3: (5,6,1) --> r=6\n\nvoucher4: (1,2,4) --> r=2.\n\nSo when sorted by r, the order would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or wait, sorted by r, then if same r, sorted by l? Or any order? Well, in Python, sorted is stable, but for same r, the order depends on the rest of the tuple. But in any case, the prefix_min_end would be computed correctly.\n\nBut for case1, for the first voucher (l_i=1, r_i=3). So looking for vouchers in target_duration (2) with r_j < l_i=1. So ends are [2, 2, 6] (assuming sorted_by_end is ordered by r. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher2: l=1, r=2, cost5.\n\nvoucher3: l=5, r=6, cost1.\n\nvoucher4: l=1, r=2, cost4.\n\nWhen sorted by r, the r's are 2, 2, 6. So sorted_by_end would be [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3], since their r's are 2, 2, 6. So ends = [2, 2, 6].\n\nNow, for case1, l_i is 1. So looking for r_j < 1. The ends list is [2, 2, 6]. bisect_left finds the insertion point for 1. Since all elements are >=1, insertion point is 0. So idx is 0. So idx>0 is false. So case1 is not possible.\n\nThen, case2: looking for l_j > r_i=3. The starts list for sorted_by_start is sorted by l. The vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher2 (l=1), voucher4 (l=1), voucher3 (l=5). So sorted_by_start would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. starts = [1,1,5]. bisect_right for r_i=3. The starts list is [1,1,5]. bisect_right(3) returns 2, because 3 is inserted after the existing 1s. So idx is 2. Which is less than len(starts) (3). So suffix_min_start[2] is 1 (the cost of voucher3). So total cost is 4 (voucher1's cost) + 1 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code would find this case.\n\nAnother voucher in the list is voucher2 (duration 2). target duration is 5-2=3. So check if there are vouchers with duration 3. Yes, the first voucher. So for voucher2, case1 and case2.\n\nFor case1: looking for vouchers with duration 3 (target_duration=3) with r_j < l_i (voucher2's l_i is 1). The voucher with duration 3 has r=3. So r_j < 1? No. So case1 not possible.\n\nCase2: looking for vouchers with duration 3 (target_duration=3) with l_j > r_i (voucher2's r_i is 2). The voucher with duration 3 has l=1. So l_j is 1. Is it > 2? No. So case2 not possible. So no contribution here.\n\nSimilarly for other vouchers. So the code would find the correct answer.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 --> duration 3\n\n2 4 1 --> duration 3\n\n3 5 4 --> duration 3\n\nEach voucher has duration 3. x is 2. So target_duration for each voucher is 2-3 = -1, which is not present. So no possible pairs. Output -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when two vouchers are in the same group and can be paired?\n\nFor example, if x is 4, and two vouchers with duration 2 each, non-overlapping.\n\nLet's say voucher1 is (1,2, cost 1), voucher2 is (3,4, cost 1). Then, for voucher1, target_duration is 2. Check in group of duration 2. For case1: looking for r_j < l_i (1). voucher2's r is 4, which is not < 1. So case1 no. For case2: looking for l_j > r_i (2). voucher2's l is 3>2. So the suffix_min_start would be 1. So total is 1+1=2.\n\nSimilarly, when processing voucher2, target_duration is 2. case1: looking for vouchers with r_j < 3. voucher1's r is 2 <3. So case1 would find that voucher, and sum is 1+1=2. So the code would find the correct answer.\n\nAnother test case: when there are multiple vouchers in the group. For example, group with duration t, and multiple options. The code should pick the minimal cost.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers in the same group, but some are overlapping and others not?\n\nThe code would find the minimal ones.\n\nNow, considering the code's efficiency.\n\nThe preprocessing for each duration group takes O(k log k) time, where k is the number of vouchers in the group. For all groups, this is O(n log n) total.\n\nFor each voucher, during processing, the case1 and case2 involve two binary searches and O(1) lookups. So total O(n log n) time.\n\nThus, the code should be efficient enough for n up to 2e5.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The way the preprocessed data is stored. For example, in the code, during preprocessing, for each duration, the group is stored as a list of (l, r, cost). But when we create the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, we have to make sure that the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake is in the way the starts and ends are collected. For example, in the code:\n\nfor case1:\n\nends = [voucher[1] for voucher in sorted_by_end]\n\nBut sorted_by_end is a list of (l, r, cost) tuples. So voucher[1] is r. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, starts = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start], which is l. Correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake is in the way the prefix_min_end and suffix_min_start are computed. For example, in the code:\n\nfor prefix_min_end:\n\nmin_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher[2])\n\nYes, voucher[2] is the cost.\n\nSimilarly for suffix_min_start.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the target_duration is zero. But according to the input constraints, x is at least 2, and duration_i is at least 1 (since li <= ri, so duration is ri - li +1 >= 1). So x - duration_i can be zero only if x is equal to duration_i. But since x >=2 and duration_i >=1, but for example, if x is 2 and duration_i is 2, then target_duration is 0. Which is not present in the duration_dict, so skipped.\n\nThus, the code would handle that.\n\nAnother possible case is when x is 0, but according to input constraints, x is at least 2. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses a defaultdict for duration_dict. Then, for each duration in duration_dict, preprocesses the data.\n\nBut in Python, when you loop through a defaultdict, you loop through all keys that have been added. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the code may have some issues with the way the preprocessed data is stored. For example, in the code:\n\npreprocessed = dict()\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n    group = duration_dict[duration]\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    ... etc.\n\nBut the group is a list of (l, r, cost) tuples. So yes.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nvouchers:\n\nvoucher0: l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration=3\n\nvoucher1: l=1, r=2, cost=5, duration=2\n\nvoucher2: l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration=2\n\nvoucher3: l=1, r=2, cost=4, duration=2.\n\nSo, duration_dict has keys 3 and 2.\n\nFor duration 2, group is [voucher1, voucher2, voucher3].\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by r. voucher1 and voucher3 have r=2, voucher2 has r=6. So sorted_by_end would be [voucher1, voucher3, voucher2], assuming that when r is same,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given value `x` and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently searching for pairs of vouchers that sum up to the required duration `x`.\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, we preprocess the vouchers to facilitate quick queries:\n   - Sort vouchers by their end time and create a prefix minimum cost array to quickly find the minimum cost of vouchers ending before a specific day.\n   - Sort vouchers by their start time and create a suffix minimum cost array to quickly find the minimum cost of vouchers starting after a specific day.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we use binary search to efficiently determine the minimum cost of valid non-overlapping vouchers from the preprocessed groups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[duration].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = dict()\n    \n    for duration in duration_dict:\n        group = duration_dict[duration]\n        # Sort by end time (r)\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        # Create prefix_min_end\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for voucher in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher[2])\n            prefix_min_end.append(min_so_far)\n        # Sort by start time (l)\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        # Create suffix_min_start\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n        # Store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[duration] = (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for l_i, r_i, cost_i, duration_i in vouchers:\n        target_duration = x - duration_i\n        if target_duration not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[target_duration]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers with r_j < l_i\n        ends = [voucher[1] for voucher in sorted_by_end]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l_i)\n        if idx > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n            total = cost_i + min_case1\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        # Case 2: find vouchers with l_j > r_i\n        starts = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r_i)\n        if idx < len(starts):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n            total = cost_i + min_case2\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, vouchers are sorted by their end and start times, and corresponding prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are created to facilitate quick range minimum queries.\n4. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher in the appropriate duration group that does not overlap.
