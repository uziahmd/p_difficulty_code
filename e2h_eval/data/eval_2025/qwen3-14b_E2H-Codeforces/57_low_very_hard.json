His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The key here is that the teacher has the first and second tour scores, but they are not paired. So for each participant, their total is the sum of a_i and b_j, but the pairing between a and b isn't known. However, we need to consider all possible pairings (though not explicitly generate them, since n can be up to 1e5) to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For the best possible rank, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible, so that he is placed first. For the worst possible rank, we want his total to be as low as possible, but still at least x, and arrange other participants' totals in a way that pushes him down as much as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let me think.\n\nFor the best possible rank: We need to maximize Vasya's total. Since he has to have a sum of at least x, the maximum possible sum he can have is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j where a_i and b_j are from the two lists. But wait, no. Because the actual pairing is such that each participant has exactly one a and one b. So, for example, if we have a_i and b_j, each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa. So the problem is to pair the a's and b's such that for Vasya's possible pairing (some a_i and b_j), his sum is at least x, and then determine the best and worst possible ranks he can get.\n\nBut the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So Vasya's actual total is some value >=x, but we need to find the best and worst possible positions he can get considering all possible pairings.\n\nWait, but how? Because the teacher has the a's and b's, but doesn't know which a is paired with which b. So the actual pairing is unknown. So for the best case scenario, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged to make him as high as possible. For the worst case scenario, we need to choose a pairing where his total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to push him down as much as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think again. For the best possible rank:\n\nWe want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he can be first). But even if his total is the maximum possible, others may have higher totals. Wait, no. Because in the best case scenario, we can arrange the pairings so that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by considering that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. But how to model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that the total results are sorted by the sum of points. So for the best possible rank, we want to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and as many others as possible have sums less than or equal to Vasya's. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible (so that he is first). But if there are other people with the same sum, he can be placed first. So the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a pairing where his sum is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSimilarly for the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible rank that Vasya can have. That would be when his sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others' sums are as high as possible, pushing him down.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor best place:\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (given that it's at least x). Then, count how many people can have a sum greater than this maximum. If there are k people with sum greater than Vasya's, then his best possible rank is k+1. But wait, no. Because if we can arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged such that as few as possible have higher sums than him.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum possible sum for Vasya? Well, the maximum possible sum he can have is the maximum of a_i + b_j for any i and j. But since each a_i and b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The key challenge is to consider all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find these ranks efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To determine the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his total score. This can be achieved by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour. We then count how many participants can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's maximum possible score.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: For the worst possible rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring it meets the minimum requirement (x). This involves pairing the lowest scores from the first tour with the lowest scores from the second tour. We then count how many participants can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum possible score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        if input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        cases.append((n, x, a, b))\n    \n    results = []\n    for case in cases:\n        n, x, a, b = case\n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n        b_sorted = sorted(b)\n        \n        # Best place\n        # Maximize Vasya's score: take max a + max b\n        # But since we need at least x, but he can have higher\n        # So for best place, we want to maximize his score.\n        # To find the best possible rank, we can assume Vasya has a_i + b_j as high as possible\n        # Then count how many people can have sum >= that value\n        \n        # To find the maximum possible sum for Vasya, it's the max a + max b\n        max_vasya = a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n        # Now, we need to count how many pairs (a_i, b_j) can have sum > max_vasya\n        # But since we can arrange the pairings optimally, we can choose to assign the best possible pairs to others\n        # Wait, no.
