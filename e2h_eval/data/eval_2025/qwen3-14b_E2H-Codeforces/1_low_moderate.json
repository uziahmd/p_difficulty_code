The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, say the first one. The border of a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border would be 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns have (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). Alternatively, maybe it's 2*(W + H) - 4, since each corner is counted twice. Let me check with example.\n\nTake a 3x3 rectangle. The border is 3*4 -4 = 8? Because 3*4 is 12, minus 4 gives 8. Which matches the first example input. So yes, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Wait, for a rectangle of size w x h, the perimeter in cells is 2*(w + h - 2). Because for example, 3x3: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8, which matches. So that's the formula.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the problem says the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but for the first ring, i=1, so the rectangle is (w - 0) × (h - 0) = original size. Then the border of that is the first ring. Then for the second ring, it's the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in each dimension. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the first ring is the edge. Then the second ring is two cells away from the edge. So for example, if the original plate is 7x9, then the first ring is the outermost border. The second ring would be a rectangle that's 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3 in width, and 9-4*(2-1)=5 in height. Wait, but then the rectangle is 3x5. But how does that make sense? Because the second ring is two cells away from the edge. Let me think: the first ring is the outermost. Then the next ring would be inside that, so the dimensions would be (original width - 2*2) and (original height - 2*2)? Because each ring takes 2 cells from each side. Wait, but the problem says that each ring is 1 cell wide. So the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells in. So for the second ring, the rectangle that's being considered is (original width - 4*(i-1))? Because for i=1, it's 0, then for i=2, it's 4*(1) = 4. So for example, for the second ring, the rectangle is (w-4) × (h-4). But then the border of that rectangle would be the second ring. So the formula for the perimeter for each ring i is 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ), which simplifies to 2*( (w + h - 4*(i-1)*2 - 2 ) )? Wait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe perimeter for a rectangle of size W × H is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because for example, 3x3 gives 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which is correct. So for each ring i, the W is (w - 4*(i-1)), and H is (h - 4*(i-1)). So the perimeter is 2*(W + H) -4. But wait, for each ring, we need to compute",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, we need to compute the total number of cells that form concentric rings around the plate. Each ring is defined as the border of an inner rectangle, and we must account for all such rings up to `k`.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- For each ring `i` (starting from 1), the corresponding inner rectangle has dimensions:\n  - Width: `w - 4*(i-1)`\n  - Height: `h - 4*(i-1)`\n  \n- The number of cells in the border (perimeter) of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` is:\n  $$\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (W + H - 2)\n  $$\n\n- This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows (each of length `W`) and the left and right columns (each of length `H - 2`), avoiding double-counting the corners.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. Initialize a variable to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n2. Iterate over each of the `k` rings.\n3. For each ring:\n   - Compute the current width and height.\n   - If the width or height becomes less than or equal to 0, break the loop (as no more valid rings can be formed).\n   - Compute the perimeter using the formula above.\n   - Add this to the total.\n4. Output the total number of gilded cells.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    wi = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    hi = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if wi <= 0 or hi <= 0:\n        break\n    perimeter = 2 * (wi + hi - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution\n\nFor input `'7 9 2'`:\n\n- **Ring 1**: `7x9` → Perimeter = `2 * (7 + 9 - 2) = 28`\n- **Ring 2**: `3x5` → Perimeter = `2 * (3 + 5 - 2) = 12`\n- Total = `28 + 12 = 40`\n\nWhich matches the expected output.\n\n---\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the result by iterating only up to `k` times and using simple arithmetic, ensuring it runs quickly even for maximum constraints.",
