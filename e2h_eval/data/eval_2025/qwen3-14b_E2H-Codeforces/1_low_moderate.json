    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. The gilded rings are added starting from the edge. The first ring is the outermost, then each subsequent ring is two cells inward. Each ring is made by taking the border of a rectangle that's smaller by 4*(i-1) in both width and height. Wait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Or maybe I should think about each ring as being formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that's shrinking by 2 cells each time. Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring (i=2) is the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in both dimensions. Because 4*(i-1) for i=2 is 4*1=4. So for each ring, the rectangle is smaller by 4*(i-1) in both width and height.\n\nBut how does that translate into the perimeter? Let me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side has length W or H, but the corners are counted twice. So subtracting 2 (since each corner is counted once in each side). Wait, for example, a rectangle of 3x3. The perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the four corners counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k. But wait, there's a catch. Because each subsequent ring is inside the previous one. However, the problem says that each ring is the border of the inner rectangle. So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that's 4 less in both dimensions. But wait, if the original is 7x9, then for i=2, the rectangle is 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Then the perimeter would be 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12? Wait, 3+5-2 is 6? Wait 2*(3 + 5 - 2) = 2*6=12. But 3x5 rectangle's perimeter cells would be 3*2 + (5-2)*2 = 6 + 6 = 12. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? For example, when i increases, the dimensions may become such that the rectangle can't form a valid perimeter. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, the first ring is the perimeter. For a 7x9, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. Which matches the third example where k=2.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i",
