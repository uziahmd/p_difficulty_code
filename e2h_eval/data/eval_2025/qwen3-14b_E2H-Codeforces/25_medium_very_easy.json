При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an overlap. And if possible, output one such s.\n\nSo, the problem says that when two same messages are sent consecutively, there's a possibility of an error where they merge. The merging happens by overlapping the end of the first message with the start of the second. But the overlap has to be a positive number of characters, less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) isn't considered an error. For example, if the message is \"abcd\", then getting \"abcd\" (the same as the original) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending without overlapping (like \"abcabc\") is not considered an error either.\n\nSo, our goal is to check if the input string t can be formed by such an overlapping of two copies of some string s. If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's denote the length of t as len_t. Since t is formed by two copies of s merged with some overlap, the total length of t would be 2*len(s) - overlap_length. Let's call the overlap length k. So len(t) = 2*L - k, where L is the length of s. Also, since k must be between 1 and L-1 (inclusive), we can express L in terms of len(t) and k.\n\nBut how do we find possible values of k and L?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible k (overlap length), we can check if there's a way that the first part of the string matches the last part of the string. For example, if the overlap is k, then the first L -k characters of the first s must match the last k characters of the second s. Wait, but since both messages are the same, the first s and the second s are the same. So the overlapping part must be a prefix of s that matches a suffix of s. So for example, if s is 'abab', then the suffix of length 2 is 'ab', which is also the prefix. So overlapping by 2 would result in the merged string being 'ababab' (since the first s is 'abab', the second is 'abab', overlapping by 2: the last two letters of the first are 'ab' and the first two of the second are 'ab', so combined it's 'abab' + 'ab' = 'ababab'? Or wait, the merged string would be the first s plus the second s with the overlapping part removed. So the merged string length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which equals len(t).\n\nSo for a given possible k, we can check if the first part of t (up to L -k) concatenated with the suffix of t (of length L) equals the original s. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's suppose that the original string s is such that when you take two copies of s and overlap them by k characters, you get t. So the merged string is s[0...L -k -1] + s. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. So the merged string would be s with the first L -k characters of s followed by the entire s. Wait no, because the overlapping part is the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s. So when merged, the total is the first s minus the last k characters, plus the entire second s. Wait, but that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nIf two copies of s are merged with an overlap of k characters, then the merged string is s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part removed. So the total length is len(s) * 2 -k. So the merged string would be s[0 ... len(s)-k-1] + s. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. So the merged string is the first s with its last k characters removed, plus the entire second s. But that would make the merged string length (len(s) -k) + len(s) = 2*len(s) -k. Which is correct.\n\nSo for the merged string t, it should be equal to the first s without the last k characters, followed by the entire s. So, the first part of t (the first len(s) -k characters) must be equal to the first part of s, and the rest of t (the next len(s) characters) must be equal to the entire s. Wait, but how can we find s here?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the merged string t is formed by overlapping two copies of s. So, the first copy of s has its last k characters overlapping with the first k of the second copy. Therefore, the entire t is s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part removed. Therefore, t must be equal to s[0...L-k-1] + s. Which implies that the length of t is (L -k) + L = 2L -k.\n\nSo, given t, we can try to find possible values of L and k such that:\n\n- len(t) = 2L -k\n- k is between 1 and L-1\n- The first part of t (length L -k) is a prefix of s, and the rest of t (the entire s) must be such that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s. Because when you merge, the overlapping part is the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s. Therefore, the first part of t (s without the last k) is s[0 ... L -k -1], and the second part is s. So the entire t is s[0 ... L -k -1] + s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s[0 ... L -k -1] + s. Which implies that the first part of t (length L -k) is s[0 ... L -k -1], and the rest of t (from position L -k onwards) is s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to the concatenation of s[0 ... L -k -1] and s. But since the entire t is of length 2L -k, which is (L -k) + L = 2L -k.\n\nBut how can we find s? Well, since the entire t is equal to s[0 ... L -k -1] + s, then the length of t is 2L -k. So, from this equation, we can express L as follows. Let me rearrange:\n\nlen(t) = 2L -k => k = 2L - len(t). But since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L - len(t) ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ len(t) +1 → L ≥ (len(t) +1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo combining these, L must be in the range [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t) -1]. Since L must be an integer, we can iterate over all possible L in this range.\n\nFor each possible L, we can compute k = 2L - len(t). Then, check whether k is between 1 and L-1. Wait, but according to the above, since L is chosen to satisfy those inequalities, k would be in that range.\n\nOnce we have L and k, we can check if the first part of t (length L -k) concatenated with the rest of t (which is of length L) equals s. But how?\n\nWait, the merged string is s[0 ... L -k -1] + s. So the entire t must be equal to that. Therefore, the length of t is (L -k) + L = 2L -k. Which is correct.\n\nBut since s is of length L, then the part of t after the first (L -k) characters must be equal to s. So, the substring of t starting at position (L -k) and of length L must be equal to s. Also, the first part of t (the first (L -k) characters) must be equal to the first (L -k) characters of s. But since s is the same as the substring of t starting at (L -k), then the first part of t must be equal to the first (L -k) characters of s. Which is the same as the first (L -k) characters of the substring of t starting at (L -k) (which is s).\n\nSo, putting it all together: For a given L, compute k = 2L - len(t). Then, check if the substring of t starting at (L -k) and of length L is equal to the substring of t starting at 0 and of length (L -k) + L = len(t). Wait, no. Wait, the first part of t is (L -k) characters, and the second part is s. So the entire t is the first part plus s. So the entire t must be equal to (first_part) + s. But since the first_part is the first (L -k) characters of s, and s is the substring of t starting at (L -k) of length L. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to (s[0 ... L -k -1]) + s. Therefore, the first (L -k) characters of t must be equal to the first (L -k) characters of s, which is the same as the first (L -k) characters of the substring of t starting at (L -k) of length L.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to check is: Let's take the part of t that is supposed to be s. That is, the substring from position (L -k) to the end. Let's call this candidate_s. Then, the first part of t (before (L -k)) must be the same as the first (L -k) characters of candidate_s. Also, the candidate_s must have a suffix of length k that is the same as its prefix of length k. Because when you merged the two copies of s, the overlapping part was the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. But since the two s's are the same, that requires that the last k characters of s are the same as the first k characters of s. So, candidate_s must have its first k characters equal to its last k characters.\n\nSo, for each possible L in the valid range, compute k = 2L - len(t). Then, check if the substring of t starting at (L -k) of length L is s_candidate. Then check if the first (L -k) characters of t are equal to the first (L -k) characters of s_candidate. Also, check that the first k characters of s_candidate are equal to the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nWait, but the first part of t is (L -k) characters, which is supposed to be the first (L -k) characters of s_candidate. Because s_candidate is s. So, for example, if the first part of t is s_candidate's first (L -k) characters, and the rest is s_candidate, then the entire t is s_candidate's first (L -k) characters plus s_candidate. Which is exactly what we want.\n\nSo, for a given L, let's compute k. Then, the length of the first part is (L -k). Let's see:\n\nSince k = 2L - len(t), then L -k = len(t) - L.\n\nSo, for example, len(t) is fixed. Let me take an example. Suppose len(t) is 11, like the first example input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (but wait, the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 characters long? Or maybe I'm mixing up examples. Anyway, let's take the first sample input, which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (probably 19 characters?), and the output is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 characters. Let's see. So len(t) is 19. For L=11, then k = 2*11 - 19 = 22 -19 = 3. So len(t) = 2L -k → 2*11 -3 = 22-3=19, which matches. Then, the first part of t is L -k = 11 -3 =8 characters. So the first 8 characters of t must be the first 8 of s_candidate. The s_candidate is the substring starting at 8 (since L -k is 8) and of length L=11. So positions 8 to 8+11-1 = 18. So the substring from 8 to 18 (assuming 0-based). Then, the first 8 characters of t should be equal to the first 8 characters of s_candidate. Also, the first k=3 characters of s_candidate must be equal to the last 3 of s_candidate. Let's check that.\n\nIn the first example, the s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (the output). Let's see: the first 8 characters of t are 'abrakada' (assuming the first part is correct). The first 8 characters of s_candidate are 'abrakada' (since s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters). So that matches. Also, the first 3 letters of s_candidate are 'abr', and the last 3 letters are 'bra'. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, but according to the example, the answer is correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Oh wait, no. Wait, the example says that the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. Let me check the actual example.\n\nWait the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (probably the output is 'abrakadabra'). Let me think. The original two messages are 'abrakadabra' each. When merged with an overlap of 1 character, the merged string would be 'abrakadabra' + 'abrakadabra' with the last 1 character of the first and the first 1 of the second overlapping. So the merged string would be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first is 11 letters, the second is 11, overlapping by 1, so total length is 11 + 11 -1 = 21. But the input here is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first example, the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let's count:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then, the input is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let me count:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. Wait maybe I'm getting the example wrong. The sample input for the first case is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' and the output is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is the merged string. Let me think again. Let's say the original s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Then, merging two copies with an overlap of 1 character would produce a string of length 11 + 11 -1 = 21. However, the first example's input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the example input is different. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nThe sample input is ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt'], and the outputs are ['YES\\nabrakadabra', ...].\n\nSo the first input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the merged string. The output is 'abrakadabra', which is length 11. Let's compute len(t) for this case. Let me count the letters in 'abrakadabrabrakadabra':\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nabrakadabra (11 letters) + brakadabra (but maybe overlapping). Let me count:\n\nLet me write the string as follows:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. But the first example's input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let me count:\n\na (1), b (2), r (3), a (4), k (5), a (6), d (7), a (8), b (9), r (10), a (11), b (12), r (13), a (14), k (15), a (16), d (17), a (18), b (19), r (20), a (21). So that's 21 letters. But the output is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. So for len(t) = 21, and L = 11, then k = 2*11 - 21 = 22-21=1. Which is allowed (k is 1, between 1 and 10). Then, the first part of t is len(t) - L = 21 - 11 = 10 characters. Wait, earlier I thought that L -k is len(t) - L. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nlen(t) = 2L -k → k = 2L - len(t)\n\nAlso, L -k = L - (2L - len(t)) = len(t) - L.\n\nYes. So, for len(t) = 21, L=11, len(t) - L is 10. So the first part of t is 10 characters. The s_candidate is the substring starting at position 10 (since len(t) - L is 10) and of length L=11. So positions 10 to 20 (assuming 0-based). The first 10 characters of t must be equal to the first 10 characters of s_candidate. Let's check:\n\ns_candidate is the substring from 10 to 20. Let's see:\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming 21 letters). The substring from index 10 is 'abrakadabra' (positions 10 to 20). So s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The first 10 characters of t are the first 10 letters of the original t, which is 'abrakadabr' (assuming the first 10 letters). The first 10 letters of s_candidate are 'abrakadabr', which matches. Then, the first k=1 characters of s_candidate is 'a', and the last k=1 is 'a' (since s_candidate ends with 'a'). So that's okay. Therefore, this satisfies the conditions. Thus, the answer is YES and s_candidate is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [(len(t) + 1)//2, len(t) - 1], compute k = 2L - len(t). Then, check:\n\n1. The substring of t starting at position (len(t) - L) and of length L is s_candidate.\n\n2. The first (len(t) - L) characters of t must be equal to the first (len(t) - L) characters of s_candidate.\n\n3. The first k characters of s_candidate must equal the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf all these are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, we need to loop through all possible L values. For each L in the range from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each L, compute k = 2L - len(t). Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. But according to earlier calculation, since L is in [(len(t)+1)//2, len(t)-1], then k should be in the required range. Let's check:\n\nFor example, len(t) = 21. L ranges from (21+1)/2 = 11 to 20.\n\nFor L=11, k=2*11 -21 = 1 → which is between 1 and 10 (L-1=10). Correct.\n\nFor L=20, k=2*20 -21= 19. Which must be <= L-1 = 19. So 19 is allowed. So yes.\n\nSo for all L in that range, k will be between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo the code can proceed as:\n\nLoop L from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1:\n\n   k = 2L - len(t)\n\n   check if len(t) - L >= 0 (but since L is up to len(t)-1, len(t) - L is >=1)\n\n   then:\n\n   start = len(t) - L\n\n   s_candidate = t[start : start + L]\n\n   first_part = t[0 : start]\n\n   check if first_part == s_candidate[0 : start]\n\n   check if s_candidate[0:k] == s_candidate[-k:]\n\n   if all conditions are met, return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's work, return NO.\n\nBut why do we need to check the first_part == s_candidate's first part? Because the merged string is supposed to be first_part + s_candidate. So the first_part must be the first part of s_candidate. Because the first_part is the first part of the original s, and s_candidate is the s.\n\nWait, the s_candidate is the s. So the first_part is the first part of the merged string, which is supposed to be the first (start) characters of s_candidate (since start = len(t) - L = L -k). Because the merged string is s_candidate's first (start) characters (which is s_candidate[0:start]) concatenated with s_candidate. So the first_part of t (t[0:start]) must be equal to s_candidate[0:start].\n\nSo yes, that check is needed.\n\nSo, for example, in the first example, the first_part is t[0:10], which is 'abrakadabr' and s_candidate is 'abrakadabra', which starts with 'abrakadabr' (the first 10 letters). So that check passes.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 'acacacaca' (output 'acaca').\n\nLet me see len(t) is 9. So possible L's are (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8.\n\nCheck for L=5: k = 2*5 -9 = 1. So start = 9-5 =4. s_candidate is t[4:4+5] = t[4:9] which is 'cacaca'? Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal string is 'acacacaca' (indices 0-8). For L=5, start is 9-5=4. So substring from 4 to 4+5=9 (but since the string is length 9, indices 4 to 8 inclusive. So the substring is t[4:9] which is 'c a c a c a'? Wait, the original string is a c a c a c a c a. So indexes 0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a, 5:c, 6:a, 7:c, 8:a. So for start=4, substring of length 5 is positions 4-8: a c a c a. So s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nThen, first_part is t[0:4] which is a c a c. The first 4 characters of s_candidate are a c a c. So that matches. Then, check if the first k=1 characters of s_candidate (a) equals the last 1 (a). Yes. So this is valid. Therefore, the answer is YES and s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is 'abcabc' → output is 'NO'.\n\nlen(t) is 6. Possible L's are (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil to 4? Wait, (6+1)//2 is (7)//2=3. So L ranges from 3 to 5 (since len(t)-1 is 5).\n\nFor L=3:\n\nk = 2*3 -6 = 0. Which is invalid. So no. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, L is in the range [(len(t)+1)//2, len(t)-1]. For len(t)=6, (6+1)//2 is 3.5 floored? Wait in Python, (6+1)//2 is 3 (since 7//2 is 3). So for L=3, k=2*3 -6=0. Which is not allowed. So this L is invalid. So why is it included in the loop? Because according to our earlier logic, the L's are chosen such that k is between 1 and L-1. But in this case, for L=3, k=0 which is not allowed. So perhaps our earlier logic is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because the range for L is [(len(t)+1)//2, len(t)-1], but for some L in that range, k may not be between 1 and L-1. Wait, but earlier we derived that for L in that range, k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nWait let me recheck. For len(t) =6, L ranges from (6+1)//2=3.5 → 3 (since integer division). So L starts from 3 to 5.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nk = 2*3 -6 = 0. Which is not allowed. So this suggests that our earlier logic was wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So the initial approach may have an error. Let's re-examine the inequalities.\n\nWe had:\n\nk = 2L - len(t)\n\nand for k to be between 1 and L-1:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n2L - len(t) ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ len(t) +1 → L ≥ (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nAnd:\n\n2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo for L to be in the range [ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ), len(t)-1 ].\n\nBut in the case of len(t)=6, (len(t)+1)/2 is 3.5. So L must be ≥ 3.5, i.e., L ≥4. So the L's are 4, 5.\n\nBut earlier in the code logic, the code was looping from (len(t)+1)//2, which for len(t)=6 is (7)//2=3. Which is incorrect. Therefore, the correct lower bound for L is ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ). However, since in Python, integer division is done with //, which truncates towards negative infinity, we need to calculate it properly.\n\nFor example, (len(t)+1)/2 may not be an integer. So for len(t) even or odd.\n\nSo for len(t) =6, (6+1)/2 is 3.5 → ceil(3.5) is 4.\n\nFor len(t) =5, (5+1)/2 is 3 → ceil(3) is 3.\n\nThus, the correct lower bound for L is ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ). But how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example:\n\nFor x = (len(t)+1)/2, ceil(x) can be written as (x + 0.5) // 1, but in integer terms, perhaps (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor example, len(t) is 6:\n\n(len(t)+1) =7. Divided by 2 is 3.5. Ceil is 4. Which is (7 +1) // 2 = 8//2=4.\n\nFor len(t) =5: (5+1)/2=3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1)//2 is 7//2=3.5 → no, but (5+1) is 6, divided by 2 is 3. So adding 1 and then doing integer division by 2 would be (len(t)+1 +1) //2 ?\n\nNo, perhaps the correct formula is (len(t) + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the formula for ceil(a / b) when a and b are integers. It can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for our case, ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ) = ((len(t)+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 = (len(t)+2) // 2.\n\nYes. Because:\n\nceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ) = floor( (len(t)+1 + 1)/2 )\n\nWait, for example, when len(t) is even:\n\nlen(t) =6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (6+1 +1)/2 = 8/2=4.\n\nWhen len(t) is odd: len(t)=5 → (5+1)/2=3 → ceil is 3. (5+1+1)/2 =7/2=3.5 → floor is 3. So that's correct.\n\nSo the lower bound for L is (len(t)+2)//2.\n\nTherefore, the code should iterate L from (len(t)+2)//2 to len(t)-1 inclusive.\n\nThis would fix the earlier problem with len(t)=6.\n\nSo for len(t)=6, the lower bound is (6+2)//2 = 8//2=4. So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nLet's check for L=4:\n\nk= 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Which is between 1 and 3 (L-1=3). Valid.\n\nFor L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -6=4. Which must be ≤5-1=4. So valid.\n\nSo for len(t)=6, possible L's are 4 and 5.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 'abcabc' (len=6). For L=4:\n\nk=2. start = len(t) - L = 6-4=2. So s_candidate is t[2:2+4] → t[2:6] is 'cabc'. Now, check if first_part (t[0:2] = 'ab') equals the first 2 characters of s_candidate (which is 'ca') → 'ab' vs 'ca' → no. So condition fails. Next, check for L=5:\n\nstart =6-5=1. s_candidate is t[1:1+5] = t[1:6] → 'bcabc' (positions 1 to 5: 'b','c','a','b','c'). Check first_part is t[0:1] = 'a'. The first 1 characters of s_candidate is 'b' → 'a' vs 'b' → no. So no match. Hence, returns NO, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code needs to loop L in the range [(len(t)+2)//2, len(t)-1].\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nCompute len_t = len(t).\n\nIf len_t is less than 2, then it's impossible (since two messages would require at least 2 characters, but with overlap. Wait, for example, len(t) = 2. Then possible L must be in [(2+2)//2=2, len(t)-1=1]. Which is impossible, so no solution. So in that case, output NO.\n\nSo, for len(t) < 2, output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop L from (len_t + 2) // 2 to len_t -1 inclusive:\n\n   compute k = 2*L - len_t\n\n   start = len_t - L\n\n   s_candidate = t[start : start + L]\n\n   first_part = t[0:start]\n\n   if first_part != s_candidate[0:start], continue\n\n   if s_candidate[0:k] != s_candidate[-k:], continue\n\n   else: return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf no such L found, return NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 2: 'acacacaca' (len 9). Let's see:\n\nlen_t=9.\n\nlower_L = (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5 (since 11//2 is 5 in Python).\n\nSo L ranges from 5 to 8.\n\nFor L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -9=1.\n\nstart=9-5=4. s_candidate is t[4:9] → indices 4-8 (assuming 0-based). Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: a c a c a c a c a → indexes 0-8.\n\nt[4] is a, t[4:9] is 'acaca' → s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nfirst_part is t[0:4] → 'acac'.\n\nCheck if first_part equals s_candidate[0:4] → 'acac' vs 'acac' → yes.\n\nCheck if first k=1 characters of s_candidate (a) equals last k=1 (a). Yes. So return YES and 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' (len 8). Output is 'ababab'.\n\nLet's see len_t=8. lower_L = (8+2)//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck for L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -8=2.\n\nstart=8-5=3. s_candidate is t[3:3+5] → t[3:8] → indices 3 to 7 (since 3+5=8). The string is 'abababab'.\n\nt[3] is 'a', t[3:8] is 'ababa'.\n\nfirst_part is t[0:3] → 'aba'.\n\nCheck if first_part equals s_candidate[0:3] → 'aba' vs 'aba' → yes.\n\nCheck if first 2 characters of s_candidate (ab) equals last 2 (ba)? No. So this fails.\n\nNext, L=6:\n\nk=2*6-8=4.\n\nstart=8-6=2. s_candidate is t[2:8] → len is 6. t[2:8] is 'ababab'.\n\nCheck first_part is t[0:2] = 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[0:2] is 'ab' → matches.\n\nCheck if first k=4 characters of s_candidate equals last 4. s_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\nfirst 4: 'abab', last 4: 'baba' → no. So no.\n\nNext, L=7:\n\nk=2*7 -8=6.\n\nstart=8-7=1. s_candidate is t[1:8] → len 7. The string is 'bababab'.\n\nCheck first_part is t[0:1] = 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[0:1] is 'b' → no match. So this fails.\n\nSo no solution? But the sample output says for input 'abababab' the output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nWait, what's the correct answer? According to the sample input, the fourth input is 'abababab', output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nSo let's see. The correct s_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). Let's see for len(t)=8. How can this fit into the code?\n\nFor s_candidate of length 6, then len(t) = 2*6 -k → 8 = 12 -k → k=4. So k=4. Which must be between 1 and 5 (since L=6, L-1=5). 4 is okay.\n\nSo for L=6, k=4. start = len(t) - L = 8-6=2. s_candidate is t[2:8] → which is 'ababab' (positions 2-7: 'a','b','a','b','a','b').\n\nCheck first_part is t[0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. If possible, we should return one such message `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: The problem specifies that two identical messages `s` can merge with an overlap of length `k`, where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`. The merged string `t` will then be of length `2 * len(s) - k`.\n2. **Range for Length of `s`**: We need to iterate over possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `L`). The valid range for `L` is derived from the equation `len(t) = 2L - k`, ensuring `k` is within the valid range.\n3. **Checking Validity**: For each possible length `L`, compute the overlap `k` and check if the string `t` can be split into parts that match the criteria for valid overlap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nlen_t = len(t)\n\nif len_t < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for L in range((len_t + 2) // 2, len_t):\n        k = 2 * L - len_t\n        start = len_t - L\n        # Check if start is valid (should be >=0)\n        if start < 0:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[start:start+L]\n        first_part = t[:start]\n        # Check if first_part matches the beginning of s_candidate\n        if first_part != s_candidate[:start]:\n            continue\n        # Check if the first k characters of s_candidate match the last k\n        if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t` and determine its length.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, immediately output \"NO\" as it's impossible to form a valid merge.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Loop through possible lengths `L` for the message `s`, starting from `(len(t) + 2) // 2` to `len(t) - 1`.\n4. **Calculate Overlap**: For each `L`, compute the overlap `k` and determine the starting index for the candidate substring `s_candidate`.\n5. **Validation Checks**: Ensure the first part of `t` matches the beginning of `s_candidate` and that the overlap part of `s_candidate` matches both its start and end.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid `s_candidate` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s_candidate`. If no valid candidate is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid configurations for the overlap, ensuring correctness while maintaining performance constraints.",
