Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about assigning directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are:\n\n- The flow must be a maximum flow, so the sum of outgoing flows from the source (vertex 1) must equal the total capacity of the edges leaving it. Also, for all intermediate nodes (not source or sink), inflow equals outflow. And the sink (vertex n) has no outgoing edges. Oh wait, the problem says that the directed graph shouldn't have cycles. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says that after directing the edges, the resulting directed graph must not have cycles. Also, vertex 1 has no incoming edges. So the direction assignments need to satisfy these constraints.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Let's think about the flow conditions first. For each node except source and sink, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. That's the flow conservation.\n\nBut since the flow is already given (the ci values), we just need to assign directions such that these conditions hold, and also the graph is acyclic.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the way to model this is to think of the flow as a directed graph where the flow is conserved. But how do I assign directions?\n\nAn idea: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a topological order. Because if the graph is acyclic, then there's a topological order. Then, for each edge, the direction would be from a lower-ranked node in the topological order to a higher-ranked one. But how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the flow conservation holds. For each node except source and sink, the inflow equals outflow. But how to ensure that?\n\nAnother thought: Since the flow is maximum, the residual graph must have no augmenting paths. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, the problem states that the flow is already given. The ci values are the flow through each edge. We just need to assign directions to them such that the flow conservation holds and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think of the flow conservation for each node. For any node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows entering equals the sum of flows leaving. Which implies that the net flow at v is zero. So for each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nSo the problem reduces to directing the edges so that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing edges. And the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that allows the flow conservation.\n\nWait, but the flow is fixed. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow on edges incident to v must be even? No. Because for each edge, the flow is counted once as either incoming or outgoing. So for example, if a node has edges with flows c1, c2, etc., the sum of all flows on edges incident to it must be even? Because the sum of incoming equals sum of outgoing. So total sum is 2 * sum of incoming (or outgoing). Therefore, the total sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says that the given flow values are part of a maximum flow, which implies that the flow conservation holds. Wait, but the original problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes for each edge. So the flow is already correct. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that Emuskald's algorithm found the flow volume for each edge but not the direction. So the flow is a valid maximum flow. Therefore, for the original undirected graph, when considering the flow as directed edges, the flow conservation holds. But since the direction wasn't determined, we need to assign directions such that the flow conservation is maintained and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how can we assign directions? Let me think of the flow as a directed graph. Since the flow is a valid maximum flow, the flow conservation holds. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source is equal to the maximum flow value. For each intermediate node, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. The sink has the sum of incoming flows equal to the maximum flow.\n\nBut how to assign the directions? Well, perhaps the flow is such that each edge's direction is from the source side to the sink side. But how to model that.\n\nAnother approach: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. Suppose we find a topological order of the nodes such that all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. Then, the graph is acyclic. Now, the question is: How to assign directions to edges such that the flow conservation is satisfied, and the directions form a DAG.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge has a direction. For the flow to be valid, the directions must be such that for each node except source and sink, inflow equals outflow. But the directions also need to form a DAG.\n\nWait, but the flow is already a valid flow. So, perhaps the underlying graph can be considered as a DAG. But how to find such directions.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Treat the graph as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that forms a DAG. For example, build a DAG by assigning directions based on a tree structure. Like, building a spanning tree where edges are directed away from the root (source) towards the sink. But how to handle the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, since the flow is a valid maximum flow, perhaps the residual graph has no augmenting paths. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. For each edge, the flow is either from ai to bi or bi to ai. The sum of flows into each node (except source and sink) must be equal to the sum of flows out of it. So for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with flow conservation. However, the challenge is to find such directions that also make the graph acyclic.\n\nBut how to construct this.\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps we can construct a directed acyclic graph by building a directed tree structure. For example, starting from the source, assign directions towards the sink. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG with a topological order where the source is the first node, the sink is the last, and all other nodes are in between. For each node in the topological order, the sum of flows on edges going into it from earlier nodes equals the sum of flows on edges going out to later nodes.\n\nBut how to determine such a topological order.\n\nWait, here's another idea. For each node, compute the net flow. Wait, but in the flow conservation, the net flow is zero for all nodes except the source and sink. But since the flow is already correct, the net flow for each node is zero. However, the direction of the edges determines how the flow is split. So, for example, if a node has edges with certain flows, the direction of those edges will determine whether they contribute to inflow or outflow.\n\nBut how can I assign directions such that for each node, the inflow equals the outflow.\n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum on edges directed out of it.\n\nBut how to find such a direction.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of building a directed graph with flow conservation. Suppose we have a directed graph where for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges is equal to the sum on outgoing edges. How can we assign directions to edges to satisfy this?\n\nThis seems similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but not exactly. Alternatively, for each node, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Because the inflow is equal to the outflow, so the sum of all flows on edges around the node is 2*inflow. Therefore, the sum must be even. However, the problem statement says that a solution exists, so this condition is already satisfied.\n\nBut how to assign directions.\n\nAnother approach: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal. For example, during a DFS, when you visit a node, you direct the edge from the parent to the child. But this might not account for the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that allows the flow to be a DAG. Let's imagine that the graph is a DAG with the source as the first node and the sink as the last. Then, for each node, the flow into it from earlier nodes equals the flow out to later nodes.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach. Let's construct a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation is satisfied. To do this, we can model the problem as follows:\n\nFor each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Let's denote this as:\n\nsum_{e in E(v)} (direction(e) ? -c_e : c_e) = 0 ?\n\nWait, no. For each node, the sum of flows on incoming edges is equal to the sum of flows on outgoing edges. So, for each node v, sum_{edges directed into v} c_e = sum_{edges directed out of v} c_e. Which implies that sum_{edges incident to v} c_e = 2 * sum_{edges directed into v} c_e. Therefore, the sum of all c_e for edges incident to v must be even. Which is guaranteed by the problem.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to directing the edges such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of the flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing edges. Additionally, the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nNow, how to model this. One possible way is to model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds and the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. Suppose we have a topological order of the nodes. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the node that comes later. This ensures that the graph is acyclic. Now, the problem becomes: find a topological order such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going into the node from earlier nodes equals the sum of flows on edges going out to later nodes.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG with the following properties:\n\n- The source (node 1) is the only node with no incoming edges.\n\n- The sink (node n) is the only node with no outgoing edges.\n\n- For all other nodes, the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing edges.\n\nBut how to find such a DAG.\n\nLet me think of this as a flow network. For each node, the net flow is zero (except source and sink). But the direction of edges determines the flow.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Since the graph is connected, perhaps we can build a directed tree rooted at the source, and assign directions accordingly. However, this might not account for all edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed from the node with a lower potential to a node with higher potential. If we can assign potentials to each node such that for each edge, the direction is from lower to higher potential, and the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how to find such potentials.\n\nAnother idea: For each node, compute the excess of flow. Wait, but the flow is already a valid maximum flow. So for the source, the net outflow is the maximum flow value, and for the sink, the net inflow is the same. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero. But how to model that with the directions.\n\nWait, the net outflow for a node v is (sum of flows on outgoing edges) minus (sum of flows on incoming edges). For nodes other than source and sink, this must be zero. So, for each node v, the sum of outgoing flows equals the sum of incoming flows.\n\nBut how to assign directions to achieve this.\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a system of equations. For each edge, we decide its direction (either ai→bi or bi→ai). Then, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows directed out of v.\n\nBut solving this system for large n and m is computationally expensive. However, given that the solution exists, perhaps there's a way to find a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. Let's consider the nodes as part of a directed graph, and we want to assign directions to edges so that the balance is zero.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of orienting edges in a graph to make it Eulerian. In that case, for each node, the number of edges directed in and out must be balanced. But here, the balance is in terms of the sum of flows, not the count of edges.\n\nBut perhaps we can think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. Which is similar to the concept of a flow network being a circulation, except that the source and sink have non-zero balances.\n\nBut how to assign directions.\n\nAnother thought: For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on all edges incident to v is even, as mentioned before. Let me denote this sum as S_v. Since the flow is conserved, S_v must be even. Let me define for each node v, the required in-flow is S_v / 2. Because in-flow equals out-flow, so in-flow is half of the total sum.\n\nSo for each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must be exactly S_v / 2.\n\nBut how to assign directions to achieve this.\n\nThis seems like a problem of choosing directions for edges such that each node v has a certain amount of in-flow.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with certain constraints. However, solving it for large n and m requires an efficient approach.\n\nWait, here's a possible way. Let's think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node has an in-degree (in terms of flow) of exactly S_v / 2. But how to find such a direction.\n\nBut how to compute this. For example, we can model it as a flow problem again. But perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as needing to have their in-flow adjusted. For example, for node v, the required in-flow is S_v / 2. Let's imagine that we can process the edges in a way that builds up this in-flow.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, and for each edge, direct it in the direction of traversal. But how to ensure the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the graph as a directed graph with the source as the root. For each node, we can compute the required flow that needs to pass through it. For example, the source has an out-flow equal to the maximum flow value. Each node along the path contributes to the flow.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, the problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and for each node, the in-flow is determined by the edges coming from earlier nodes in the order.\n\nLet's try this approach. Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each node, all edges that are directed into it come from earlier nodes, and edges directed out go to later nodes. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from earlier nodes) must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out (to later nodes). \n\nHow can we compute this?\n\nLet me think recursively. For the source node (node 1), which has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it must be directed outwards. Then, for each node in the topological order, we can calculate the required outflow, and direct edges accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the topological order and the required flows.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a directed acyclic graph where each node (except the source and sink) has a balance of zero. The source has a balance of -F (where F is the total flow), and the sink has a balance of +F.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the problem as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. Then, the directed graph must be acyclic. So, we can construct such a graph by building a DAG where the flow is routed from source to sink, and for each node, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nTo construct this, perhaps we can build a directed tree where each node (except the source) has exactly one parent, and the edges are directed from parent to child. But this would only account for some of the edges, and the rest would need to be directed appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is connected, we can build a spanning tree. For example, choose a spanning tree rooted at the source. For each edge in the tree, direct it away from the root. Then, for the non-tree edges, direct them in a way that maintains the acyclicity.\n\nBut again, the flow conservation is not addressed here.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each node, the required in-flow is S_v / 2. So, for example, if we can find for each node a set of edges that contribute to this in-flow, then we can direct those edges into the node and others out.\n\nBut how to find such a set.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each node has a certain demand. For instance, node v needs to have exactly S_v / 2 in-flow. The edges can be directed to meet this demand.\n\nBut how to model this as a graph problem.\n\nAnother idea: For each edge, if we can decide the direction based on which side of the node it contributes to the in-flow. For example, during a traversal of the graph, for each edge, we decide the direction based on the current state of the required in-flow for the nodes.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\n3 nodes, 3 edges:\n\nEdges:\n\n3-2 with flow 10\n\n1-2 with flow 10\n\n3-1 with flow 5.\n\nThe output directions are 1 (so 3→2?), 0 (1→2), 1 (3→1? No, the third edge is 3-1, and direction is 1, meaning bi→ai, which would be 1→3? Or wait, the input is given as ai, bi, ci. For each edge, di is 0 means ai→bi, else bi→ai.\n\nIn the first sample output, the directions are 1, 0, 1.\n\nSo for the first edge (3,2,10), di=1 → direction is 2→3.\n\nSecond edge (1,2,10) di=0 → 1→2.\n\nThird edge (3,1,5) di=1 → direction is 1→3.\n\nSo the directed edges are:\n\n2→3 (flow 10), 1→2 (10), 1→3 (5).\n\nNow, for node 2 (which is not source or sink), the inflow is 10 (from 1→2) and outflow is 10 (to 3). So it's balanced.\n\nFor node 1: no incoming edges, outflow is 10+5=15.\n\nFor node 3: inflow is 10+5=15, no outgoing edges.\n\nSo the directed graph is acyclic. The topological order could be 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo how was this direction chosen?\n\nIt seems that the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, with the source (1) having edges directed out, and the sink (3) receiving all flows.\n\nPerhaps the way to do this is to build a DAG with a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and for each node, the required in-flow is met by directing edges from earlier nodes to it, and directing edges to later nodes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Assign a topological order to the nodes, with source first and sink last.\n\n2. For each node in the order (excluding source and sink), direct edges from earlier nodes to it as needed to meet the required in-flow.\n\nBut how to compute the required in-flow for each node.\n\nLet me think again about the required in-flow for each node. For node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on all incident edges is S_v. The required in-flow is S_v / 2.\n\nSo for each node v, we need to select some subset of its incident edges to direct into v, such that the sum of their flows is S_v / 2. The remaining edges are directed out of v.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct into v.\n\nBut if we have a topological order, then all edges into v must come from earlier nodes in the order, and edges out go to later nodes.\n\nSo, during processing the nodes in topological order, for each node v, we can calculate how much more in-flow is needed, and direct edges from earlier nodes to v to meet this requirement.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet's think of it as follows:\n\n- We start with the source (node 1), which has no incoming edges. All edges connected to the source must be directed out of it. This contributes to the out-flow of the source.\n\n- For each subsequent node v in the topological order, we calculate the required in-flow (S_v / 2). We then look at all edges connected to v that are not yet directed. For each such edge, if the other end is already processed (earlier in the order), we can direct the edge towards v (since the other node is earlier). Otherwise, we direct it away from v (to the later node).\n\nBut how to ensure that the sum of flows on edges directed into v is exactly S_v / 2.\n\nThis seems like a problem of dynamically adjusting the direction of edges based on the current needs of the node.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an algorithm:\n\n1. Compute for each node v, the total sum of flows on incident edges, S_v. For nodes other than source and sink, required_in = S_v / 2.\n\n2. Choose a topological order of the nodes, with source first and sink last. How to choose this order? Well, since the directed graph is acyclic, any such order would work. But how to choose it. Perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source, and assign the order based on the traversal.\n\n3. For each node v in the topological order (excluding source and sink):\n\n   a. Calculate how much in-flow is needed: required_in.\n\n   b. Look at all edges incident to v that have not been directed yet. For each such edge, if the other end u is already processed (i.e., appears before v in the order), then we can direct the edge from u to v. This contributes to the in-flow of v. If the other end is not processed yet, we can direct the edge from v to u, contributing to the out-flow of v.\n\n   c. However, the sum of flows from directed edges into v must be exactly required_in. How to ensure this?\n\nThis seems challenging. For example, suppose that after directing all edges from earlier nodes to v, the sum of flows is less than required_in. Then, we need to direct some edges from v to later nodes to subtract from the required_in. But how?\n\nAlternatively, during the traversal, we can keep track of the current in-flow of each node. Initially, it's zero. For each node v in the topological order, we process its edges:\n\n- For each edge between v and u:\n\n   - If u has already been processed (is earlier in the order), then direct the edge from u to v, adding the flow to v's in-flow.\n\n   - If u hasn't been processed yet, then we can direct the edge from v to u, which doesn't contribute to v's in-flow (since it's outgoing).\n\nAfter this, the in-flow of v may be less than required_in. How to adjust this?\n\nAh, but this approach might not work because it depends on the order in which edges are processed. For example, if a node has multiple edges to later nodes, and the required_in is not met by the edges from earlier nodes, we need to find some way to adjust the directions.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea inspired by the fact that the graph is connected and a solution exists. We can build a directed graph as a DAG by performing a BFS or DFS, directing edges away from the source. For example, during BFS, whenever we visit a node, we direct the edge from the parent to the child. This ensures that the graph is a DAG (tree structure). Then, for the remaining edges, we can direct them in a way that maintains the DAG property.\n\nBut how to handle the flow conservation.\n\nBut in this case, the flow conservation might not be satisfied. For example, if a node has multiple children, the sum of flows on edges directed out may not match the sum of flows on edges directed in.\n\nSo this approach may not work.\n\nAnother idea: Since the flow is a valid maximum flow, the flow can be represented as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. But we need to find a direction for each edge that is consistent with this flow. However, the problem is that the original graph is undirected, and we have to choose directions that form a DAG.\n\nBut how to find such a direction.\n\nWait, what if we treat the flow as a directed graph, and then find a topological order of the nodes in this directed graph. If the directed graph has no cycles, then we're done. If it has cycles, we can break them by reversing some edges. But how to ensure that the flow conservation still holds.\n\nBut since the flow is already a valid flow, reversing an edge would change the flow conservation. For example, if an edge is part of a cycle, reversing it would change the inflow and outflow of the nodes involved.\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, since the flow is valid, the directed graph must have no cycles with net flow. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the directed graph that represents the flow. For example, for each edge, the direction is such that the flow is from ai to bi or bi to ai. This directed graph must satisfy flow conservation for all nodes except source and sink. But it may contain cycles.\n\nIf this directed graph is acyclic, then we're done. If not, then we need to find a way to reorient some edges to eliminate cycles while maintaining flow conservation.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nThis seems like a challenging problem. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's think back to the problem's requirements. The directed graph must be acyclic, and the flow conservation must be satisfied. One possible way to ensure acyclicity is to assign directions based on a topological order. So, if we can find a topological order of the nodes where the source is first and the sink is last, then directing all edges from earlier nodes to later nodes will ensure acyclicity. Now, the question is, can we assign directions in this way such that flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find a topological order of the nodes, with source first and sink last.\n\n2. For each edge, direct it from the node that appears earlier in the order to the one that appears later.\n\nBut how to ensure that this satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nThis approach would automatically ensure acyclicity, but flow conservation is not guaranteed. However, since the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps there exists such a topological order that makes this work.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows directed out of v. With the topological order, the edges directed into v come from earlier nodes, and edges directed out go to later nodes.\n\nLet me consider the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Let's call this in_flow_v. Similarly, out_flow_v is the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. We need in_flow_v = out_flow_v.\n\nBut since all edges are directed from earlier to later in the order, the out_flow_v is the sum of flows on edges from v to later nodes. And in_flow_v is the sum of flows on edges from earlier nodes to v.\n\nBut how to ensure that in_flow_v = out_flow_v.\n\nLet me think about the total sum of flows on all edges incident to v. Let's call this total_flow_v. Then, in_flow_v + out_flow_v = total_flow_v. And we need in_flow_v = out_flow_v. So total_flow_v must be even, which it is, as per the problem statement. So in_flow_v = out_flow_v = total_flow_v / 2.\n\nBut how to ensure that in_flow_v equals this value.\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. How to choose the topological order such that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from earlier nodes) is exactly total_flow_v / 2.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved greedily. Let's think of the nodes in a way that for each node, the sum of flows from its already processed neighbors is as close as possible to the required in_flow_v.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe we can use a priority queue where nodes are selected based on some criteria. For example, start with the source. For each node, once it's processed, we can calculate how much of the required in_flow for its neighbors is already covered by edges from this node.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node's required in_flow is known, and we need to assign directions such that for each node, the sum of flows from earlier nodes is equal to the required in_flow.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using a greedy approach with a BFS or DFS traversal, adjusting the direction of edges as needed.\n\nLet me try to outline an algorithm:\n\nInitialize a topological order with the source node.\n\nFor each node in the order, process its edges to unprocessed nodes. For each such edge, decide the direction based on the required in_flow of the unprocessed node.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: For each node v (not source or sink), the required in_flow is known. We can model this as a directed graph where each node must receive exactly required_in from earlier nodes.\n\nSo, during the traversal, when processing a node u, we can look at its unprocessed neighbors v. For each such neighbor, if we direct the edge from u to v, this contributes to the required_in of v. We can keep track of how much required_in each node has left to receive.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Initialize for each node v (not source or sink), required_in[v] = total_flow_v / 2.\n\n- Start with the source node in the topological order.\n\n- For each node u in the topological order:\n\n   - For each neighbor v of u that has not been processed yet:\n\n      - If required_in[v] > 0, then direct the edge from u to v. Subtract the flow from required_in[v].\n\n      - Else, direct the edge from v to u (but since v is not processed yet, this would mean the edge is directed from v to u, but u is already processed. This would imply that v is processed after u, and the edge is directed from v to u, which would violate the topological order. So this is not allowed.)\n\nWait, no. If u is processed and v is not processed, then the edge between u and v is directed from u to v (since u is earlier in the order). This contributes to the required_in of v. If required_in[v] is zero, then we cannot direct this edge from u to v, because that would add to v's in_flow, which is already at the required level. So what do we do in that case?\n\nThis suggests that the algorithm must ensure that when processing u, we only direct edges from u to v if doing so helps v reach its required_in.\n\nBut how to handle cases where required_in[v] is already met.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\n- For each node v, we track how much in_flow is still needed (initially required_in[v]).\n\n- When processing node u in the topological order, we look at all its adjacent edges that connect to unprocessed nodes v.\n\n   - For each such edge, if the flow of the edge is less than or equal to the remaining required_in[v], we direct the edge from u to v, subtract the flow from required_in[v], and mark v as processed (but wait, no, because v may have other edges to process).\n\nWait, this approach would not work, because v may have other edges to process. So, we can't mark v as processed until all its required_in is met.\n\nAlternatively, during the traversal, we can use a priority-based approach, such as selecting nodes with the least remaining required_in first.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the sample input again. For node 2 in the first sample, required_in is (10 + 10) / 2 = 10. When processing node 1, which is in the topological order first, it has an edge to node 2. Directing this edge from 1 to 2 contributes 10 to required_in[2], which meets its required_in. Then, node 2 is processed next, and its other edge to node 3 is directed from 2 to 3, contributing to node 3's in_flow.\n\nBut node 3's required_in is (10 + 5)/2 = 7.5? No, wait, the sum of flows on edges incident to node 3 is 10 (edge 3-2) + 5 (edge 3-1) = 15. So required_in is 15/2 = 7.5, but that's not possible since the flows are integers. Wait, this contradicts the problem statement, which says that the input is such that a solution exists. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, the first sample input has three edges:\n\nEdge 3-2 with flow 10.\n\nEdge 1-2 with flow 10.\n\nEdge 3-1 with flow 5.\n\nFor node 3, the incident edges are 3-2 (10) and 3-1 (5). Total is 15, which is odd. But earlier I said that the sum must be even. This contradicts the problem statement. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, this indicates a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says that the given flow is a maximum flow. For the flow to be valid, for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on incident edges must be even. But in this sample, node 3 is the sink (n=3), so it is allowed to have an odd sum. Ah! Right! The sink is node n, and the source is node 1. For the source and sink, the flow conservation doesn't apply. So for node 3 (sink), the sum of flows on incident edges is 15, which is okay.\n\nSo for the other nodes (like node 2 in the first sample), the sum of flows is 10 + 10 = 20, which is even. Required_in is 10.\n\nSo the algorithm should work for nodes other than source and sink.\n\nSo, returning to the algorithm idea:\n\nFor each node v (not source or sink), required_in[v] = total_flow_v / 2.\n\nNow, the idea is to process nodes in a topological order, and for each node u, direct edges from u to unprocessed nodes v, contributing to their required_in[v].\n\nBut how to ensure that required_in[v] is met.\n\nMaybe we can use a BFS-like approach, where we start with the source, and for each node u processed, we direct edges to unprocessed nodes v, and reduce their required_in[v] by the flow of the edge. Once a node v's required_in[v] reaches zero, it is added to the topological order for processing.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let's think:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- required_in for each node v (not source or sink) is S_v / 2.\n\n- The source is processed first. It has no required_in.\n\n- For each node v, maintain a list of adjacent edges.\n\nProcess:\n\n- Use a queue. Initially, the queue contains the source.\n\n- While the queue is not empty:\n\n   - Dequeue a node u.\n\n   - For each adjacent edge (u, v, c) where v is not processed yet:\n\n      - If required_in[v] > 0:\n\n         - Direct the edge from u to v.\n\n         - Subtract c from required_in[v].\n\n         - If required_in[v] becomes zero, enqueue v.\n\n      - Else:\n\n         - Direct the edge from v",
