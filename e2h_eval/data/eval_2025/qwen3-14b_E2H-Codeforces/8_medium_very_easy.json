Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) can't have incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says that the flow volumes are already given for each edge. My job is to direct them properly. So the key is to find a way to assign directions so that the flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each vertex except the source and sink, the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows. Also, the source has no incoming edges, which means all edges connected to it must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink can have incoming edges but no outgoing ones?\n\nWait, no. The sink is vertex n. The problem says that the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. But for the sink, there's no restriction on outgoing edges. However, since it's a maximum flow, the sink's in-flow would be the total maximum flow, and the out-flow would be zero? Not sure. But the flow conservation applies only to vertices between 1 and n.\n\nSo, how do I model this? Well, maybe I can model this as a directed graph where each edge has a direction, and the flow conservation holds. But how to find such directions.\n\nAnother thought: Since the flow is maximum, perhaps the underlying structure is such that the directed graph forms a DAG (since it's required to be acyclic), and we can arrange the directions in such a way that the flow is conserved.\n\nWait, the problem says that the resulting directed graph must not have cycles. So the directed graph must be acyclic. That's an important point. So, perhaps we can find a topological order of the nodes and assign directions accordingly. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each node (except the source and sink) has equal in and out flow. Also, the source has all edges directed out, and the sink has all edges directed in?\n\nBut how to model that. Let's think about the flow conservation. For any node v (not 1 or n), the sum of the flows on edges entering v must equal the sum of flows leaving v. Which is equivalent to saying that the net flow (outgoing - incoming) is zero. But since each edge contributes to either incoming or outgoing, depending on direction, this seems like a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed away from it equals the sum of flows on edges directed towards it.\n\nThis sounds similar to finding an Euler tour, but not exactly. Wait, maybe we can model this as a flow network and then find a way to assign directions based on some properties.\n\nAnother approach: Since the graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps we can construct a directed tree structure where each node's flow is balanced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, if the two endpoints are in the topological order, we can direct the edge from the earlier node to the later one. But how does that help with flow conservation?\n\nWait, but the flow conservation requires that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going out equals the sum on edges going in. Let's think of this as a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v equals the sum of flows directed towards v.\n\nThis is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges incident to v being even? No, because for each edge, the flow is counted once in either in or out. For example, if an edge is directed from u to v, then for u, it's an outflow, and for v, it's an inflow. So for each node v, the total outflow (sum of flows on edges directed away) minus inflow (sum of flows on edges directed towards) must be zero. Which implies that the total outflow equals the inflow. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even? No, because each edge is counted once in either outflow or inflow. For example, if a node has edges with flows c1, c2, c3, etc., then the total sum of flows on edges incident to it is (sum of all ci). For the node, the outflow is some subset of these, and the inflow is the rest. For the outflow to equal the inflow, the sum of all ci must be even? Because outflow = inflow implies that total sum is 2 * outflow. So yes, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. Wait, but the problem says that the given graph has a solution. So maybe this condition is already satisfied for all nodes except the source and sink?\n\nBut wait, the source (node 1) has no incoming edges, so all its edges are outgoing. So the sum of flows on edges incident to node 1 is the total outflow. For node 1, the inflow is zero. So the outflow is the total sum of flows on its edges. Similarly, for the sink (node n), the inflow is the total sum of flows on its edges, and the outflow is zero. For all other nodes, the sum of flows on edges must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how does this help me in directing the edges?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges directed out equals the sum of flows directed in. Which is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges incident to the node being even, but again, the problem ensures that this is possible.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nAnother thought: This seems similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian trail, but for each node (except source and sink) the in-degree and out-degree must balance. Wait, but here it's about the sum of flows, not the number of edges. So perhaps we can model it as a flow network where each edge's direction is determined by some flow conservation rules.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. Since the graph is undirected, but we have to assign directions, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow.\n\nNow, since the graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions accordingly. For example, if we can find a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last, then for each edge, we can direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. However, this might not satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation holds. How?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the problem as a directed graph. For each node v (not 1 or n), the net flow (outgoing - incoming) must be zero. For node 1, the net flow is the total flow (since all edges are outgoing). For node n, the net flow is negative of that (since all edges are incoming).\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can model this as a flow problem where we need to assign directions to edges such that the net flow for each node is as required.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. Let me think of it as a flow network, but with the given flows fixed. Wait, but the given flows are already part of the problem. So the problem is not to find the flows, but to assign directions to the edges given their flows.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the flow conservation. For each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Let's denote for each node v, the sum of flows on edges incident to it as S_v. For nodes other than 1 and n, S_v must be even, because the sum of outgoing flows equals the sum of incoming flows, which is S_v / 2 each. But since the problem says that a solution exists, we can assume that S_v is even for all such nodes.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to achieve this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as an Eulerian trail. For example, for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges is even. So, for each node, we can imagine that the flow is split into outgoing and incoming flows. However, since the flows are fixed, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has equal in and out flow.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nAn alternative idea: For each node except 1 and n, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Let's consider building a directed graph where for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it is equal to half of the sum of all flows on edges incident to it. Then, the problem reduces to finding such directions.\n\nBut how to compute this. It seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with certain constraints. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that forms a DAG. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal order. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that appears earlier in the order to the node that appears later. But again, how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nWait, but if we arrange the nodes in such a way that for each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going into v equals the sum of flows going out of v. How can this be achieved?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph where the flow conservation is maintained by constructing a spanning tree. For example, the source is the root, and all edges are directed away from the root. But this might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has a balance of zero. This is similar to the problem of finding a directed graph where each node's in-flow equals out-flow. Which is similar to an Eulerian circuit, except that we don't require all nodes to have even degrees.\n\nBut again, how to apply this here.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each node except 1 and n, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. So, we can treat each edge as a bidirectional edge with capacity equal to the flow. Then, for each node except 1 and n, we can split the edges into incoming and outgoing flows such that their sums are equal.\n\nBut how to do this. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where we need to find an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on outgoing edges is equal to the sum of flows on incoming edges. This seems like a problem that can be solved using a greedy approach.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the entire graph and model it as a directed graph. We can start by directing all edges away from the source. Then, for each node, we check if the flow conservation holds. If not, adjust the directions of edges connected to it.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that the graph is connected and the solution exists. Let's build a directed tree (like a spanning tree) rooted at the source. Then, for each edge in the tree, direct it away from the root. For non-tree edges, direct them in a way that doesn't create cycles. However, this may not account for the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the source is the only node with outflow and the sink is the only node with inflow. But again, how to assign directions.\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, there must be a topological order. Let's choose a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and all other nodes are in between. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. This will ensure that there are no cycles. Now, the question is, can we choose such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation conditions?\n\nBut how to find such a topological order.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that we can assign directions based on the topological order. For example, if we have a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last, then for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows directed out of v. How to ensure that?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, maybe we can model this as a system of equations. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows on edges directed into v. But since the direction of edges depends on their position in the topological order, perhaps there's a way to find a topological order that satisfies this.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet's think of the problem differently. Suppose that we treat the graph as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. Then, since the directed graph is acyclic, there must be a way to arrange the nodes in a topological order where each edge goes from earlier to later nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to build a DAG with the required flow conservation, and then output the directions accordingly.\n\nBut how to build such a DAG.\n\nAnother idea: Let's model this as a flow network where each edge has a capacity equal to its flow. Then, the problem becomes finding a flow that satisfies the flow conservation for all intermediate nodes. However, since the flows are already given, perhaps we can find a way to assign directions based on this.\n\nWait, but the flow values are already given. So, the direction of each edge determines whether it contributes to the outflow or inflow of the nodes. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then for u, this contributes to outflow, and for v, to inflow.\n\nBut since the flow conservation must hold, the net outflow for each intermediate node must be zero. So, for each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards it.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of equations. For each node v (not 1 or n), sum_{edges directed away from v} c_e = sum_{edges directed towards v} c_e. Which is equivalent to sum_{edges incident to v} c_e = 2 * sum_{edges directed away from v} c_e. So for each such node, the total sum of flows on incident edges must be even, which the problem says is true.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to satisfy this.\n\nThis feels like a problem where we can model it as a graph with potentials. For example, assign a value to each node such that for each edge (u, v), the direction is determined based on the potential difference. For instance, if the potential of u is higher than that of v, direct the edge from u to v. This would ensure that the graph is acyclic if the potentials form a strict ordering (like a topological order).\n\nBut how to assign the potentials such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen to balance the flow. For example, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows directed towards it. This is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v being equal to half the total sum of flows on edges incident to v.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where for each node, we need to select a subset of edges incident to it to be outgoing, such that their total flow is exactly half of the total sum of flows on edges incident to it.\n\nBut how to select these subsets for all nodes simultaneously.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a way to model this as a flow problem. For example, imagine that each node has a \"balance\" of flow that needs to be sent out. For node 1, the balance is the total flow of its edges. For node n, the balance is negative of that. For other nodes, the balance is zero. Then, the problem becomes finding a directed graph where each edge's direction contributes to the balance of its endpoints.\n\nBut how to model this. It seems like a flow problem where each edge can carry flow in one direction or the other, and the balances are the demands.\n\nWait! This sounds like a standard flow problem. Here's an idea: Let's model this as a flow network where each edge is a bidirectional edge with capacity equal to its flow. Then, we need to find a flow that satisfies the following:\n\n- For the source node (1), the net outflow is equal to the total flow of its edges (since all edges must be directed away from it).\n- For the sink node (n), the net inflow is equal to the total flow of its edges.\n- For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut how to model this. Wait, the problem is that the flow is already given. The direction of each edge determines whether the flow is added to the outflow or inflow of the nodes. So, for each edge between u and v, we can choose to add c to the outflow of u and inflow of v, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a flow assignment where for each node v (other than 1 and n), the total outflow equals the total inflow. And for node 1, outflow is the total of all its edges' flows, and for node n, inflow is the total of all its edges' flows.\n\nThis seems like a standard flow problem. Let me formalize it:\n\nFor each edge (u, v), we can choose to assign it as u -> v or v -> u. Each choice contributes +c to the outflow of u and -c to the outflow of v, or vice versa.\n\nThe goal is to find such assignments so that:\n\n- For node 1, the total outflow is equal to the sum of flows on all its edges.\n- For node n, the total inflow is equal to the sum of flows on all its edges.\n- For other nodes, total outflow equals total inflow (i.e., net outflow is zero).\n\nBut how to model this as a flow problem. Perhaps we can model it as a circulation problem with demands.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a directed graph where the flow conservation must be satisfied for all nodes except 1 and n. The net outflow for node 1 is the sum of its edges' flows (call this S_1), and the net outflow for node n is -S_n (since the inflow is S_n, which is equivalent to outflow being -S_n).\n\nBut how to model this. It's a problem of finding a flow that satisfies these demands.\n\nBut how to compute this. Let me think of it as a flow network where each edge can carry flow in either direction. However, since the flow is fixed (the value of c_i is fixed), the problem is to choose directions such that the net flow for each node is as required.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a flow algorithm, but since the flows are already given, maybe there's a way to model it as a bipartition problem.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. For each node v, let's compute the required net outflow. For node 1, it's the sum of all flows on edges incident to it. For node n, it's -sum of flows on edges incident to it. For all others, it's zero. Then, we need to assign directions to edges such that the net outflow for each node is as required.\n\nBut how to do this. Let's think of the net outflow for node v as D_v. For each edge (u, v), choosing to direct it from u to v adds +c to D_u and -c to D_v. Choosing the reverse direction adds -c to D_u and +c to D_v.\n\nBut the problem is to find directions such that for all nodes, D_v is as required.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of equations. For each edge (u, v), the choice of direction affects the D values. However, solving this system directly is not straightforward.\n\nBut here's an idea: The required net outflow for each node is D_v. For example, for node 1, D_1 = total_flow_1. For node n, D_n = -total_flow_n. For others, D_v = 0.\n\nNow, since the edges are undirected, the sum of all D_v must be zero. Let's check that:\n\nsum(D_v) = D_1 + D_n + sum_{others} D_v = total_flow_1 - total_flow_n + 0. \n\nBut what is total_flow_1 and total_flow_n? For the entire graph, the total flow from the source (node 1) must equal the total flow into the sink (node n). Because in a maximum flow, the total outflow from source equals the inflow to the sink. So, total_flow_1 must equal total_flow_n. Hence, sum(D_v) is zero. Which is a necessary condition for the existence of a solution. Since the problem states that a solution exists, this is guaranteed.\n\nSo, this seems like a feasible problem. Now, how to find such a flow.\n\nThis looks like a problem of finding a directed graph where each edge's direction contributes to the net outflow of its nodes. This can be modeled as a flow network with demands.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of it as a flow problem where we have to find a flow that satisfies the demands D_v for each node. However, each edge has a fixed capacity of c_i, but since the flow is fixed, perhaps it's more like a circulation problem.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem where we need to send exactly D_v units of flow from each node v. However, since each edge can carry flow in either direction, this seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network with capacities and demands.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with this.\n\nAnother idea: Since each edge can be directed in either direction, and the flows are fixed, we can model this as a directed graph where the net outflow for each node is D_v. This is equivalent to finding a directed graph where for each node v, the sum of flows on outgoing edges minus the sum of flows on incoming edges equals D_v.\n\nThis is exactly what we need. So, how to find such a directed graph.\n\nBut how to find this. One approach is to model this as a flow problem with demands and use a standard max-flow algorithm. However, since the problem is to find any valid assignment of directions, perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nWait, this seems similar to finding an Eulerian trail. For example, if we imagine that each node has a demand D_v, then for the directed graph to exist, the sum of D_v must be zero (which it is). But how to construct it.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a graph where each edge has to be directed in such a way that the net outflow of each node is D_v. This is equivalent to finding a flow in the undirected graph where each edge has capacity c_i, and the flow through the edge is exactly c_i (since the flow is fixed), and the net outflow for each node is D_v.\n\nBut since the flow through each edge is fixed, this is a problem of assigning directions to edges such that the net outflow is D_v for each node. This can be viewed as a problem of finding a flow where the flow through each edge is exactly c_i, and the net outflow is D_v.\n\nBut how to model this. It seems like a problem where we can model it as a directed graph and use a flow algorithm to find the directions.\n\nWait, but the flow is already fixed. So, for each edge, the flow is c_i in one direction or -c_i in the other. The problem is to choose the sign for each edge such that the net outflow for each node is D_v.\n\nThis seems like a system of linear equations. For example, for each edge (u, v), we have a variable x_e which is +1 if directed from u to v, -1 otherwise. Then, for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (x_e * c_e) must equal D_v.\n\nBut solving this system is computationally expensive for large graphs. However, since the graph is connected and a solution exists, perhaps there's a way to construct it greedily.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph problem where we can process nodes and assign directions to edges as we go.\n\nFor example, start with node 1. All edges connected to node 1 must be directed away from it (since it has no incoming edges). This contributes to the net outflow of node 1. Then, for each neighbor of node 1, we can adjust their net outflow accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle other nodes. Let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose we have a node v that is not the source or sink. We want its net outflow to be zero. Suppose we have some edges already directed, and others not. For each undirected edge connected to v, we can direct it in a way that helps balance the net outflow.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph with the following properties:\n\n- The net outflow of each node v is D_v.\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nTo ensure the directed graph is acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. So, for example, we can perform a BFS starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal order.\n\nBut how to ensure that the net outflow conditions are met.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\n3 3\nEdges:\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe nodes are 1, 2, 3. Source is 1, sink is 3.\n\nFor each node:\n\nNode 1: sum of flows is 10 (edge 1-2) + 5 (edge 1-3) = 15. So D_1 = 15.\n\nNode 2: sum of flows is 10 (edge 1-2) + 10 (edge 2-3) = 20. D_2 = 0.\n\nNode 3: sum of flows is 10 (edge 2-3) + 5 (edge 1-3) = 15. D_3 = -15.\n\nNow, we need to assign directions to edges so that the net outflow for each node is as above.\n\nIn the sample solution, the directions are:\n\nEdge 3-2: directed from 3 to 2 → contributes +10 to node 3's outflow and -10 to node 2's outflow.\n\nEdge 1-2: directed from 1 to 2 → contributes +10 to node 1's outflow and -10 to node 2's outflow.\n\nEdge 3-1: directed from 3 to 1 → contributes +5 to node 3's outflow and -5 to node 1's outflow.\n\nWait, but that would give:\n\nNode 1's outflow is 10 (from edge 1-2) and inflow is 5 (from edge 3-1). So net outflow is 10 - 5 = 5. But according to D_1, it should be 15. Hmm, this suggests that my previous understanding was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D_v. Let me re-examine the net outflow.\n\nThe net outflow for a node is the sum of flows on outgoing edges minus the sum of flows on incoming edges.\n\nIn the sample solution:\n\nFor node 1:\n\nOutgoing edges: edge 1-2 (10). Incoming edges: edge 3-1 (5). So net outflow is 10 - 5 = 5. But according to D_1, it should be 15. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, earlier calculation of D_v was incorrect. Let me re-calculate.\n\nThe D_v for node 1 should be the total outflow, which is the sum of all flows on edges incident to it. Because for node 1, all edges are directed away from it, so the net outflow is the sum of all flows on its edges.\n\nBut in the sample solution, node 1 has two edges: one directed away (10) and one directed toward it (5). So the net outflow is 10 - 5 = 5, which is not equal to the sum of flows on its edges (10 + 5 = 15). So my previous understanding of D_v was wrong.\n\nAh, this indicates a mistake in my earlier reasoning. What is the correct way to calculate D_v?\n\nLet me re-express the problem. For node 1, the net outflow must be equal to the total flow that leaves it. Since it's the source, all flow must originate from it. So the total outflow from node 1 must be equal to the maximum flow. But in the sample input, the maximum flow is 15 (since there's a path from 1 to 3 via 2, carrying 10 units, and another direct path carrying 5 units). So the net outflow for node 1 should be 15. But in the sample solution, it's 10 - 5 = 5. This suggests that my earlier understanding of D_v is wrong.\n\nThis indicates that I need to rethink the problem.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement. The flow must be a correct maximum flow. So, the net outflow from the source is the maximum flow value, and the net inflow to the sink is the same. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nSo for node 1, the net outflow is equal to the maximum flow value. For node n, the net inflow is equal to the maximum flow value. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut how to determine what the maximum flow value is. Well, the maximum flow value is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source, which is equal to the sum of flows on edges entering the sink.\n\nBut how to compute this. It seems that this is part of the problem. However, the problem says that the flow values are given, and we need to assign directions to edges such that the flow is a valid maximum flow.\n\nBut how to determine what the maximum flow value is. It seems that the given flows are already part of a maximum flow, and our task is to assign directions to edges to represent this flow.\n\nBut this is confusing. How can the flow values be given without knowing the maximum flow value? Well, the problem says that the given flows are for each edge, but it's up to us to assign directions to make it a valid maximum flow.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum flow value is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. Which must be equal to the sum of flows on edges entering the sink.\n\nBut how to ensure that when assigning directions.\n\nBut this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. How to determine which edges are leaving the source and entering the sink.\n\nBut the problem says that the solution always exists. So, perhaps the way to proceed is to assign directions to edges such that for each node v (not 1 or n), the net outflow is zero. For node 1, the net outflow is equal to the maximum flow value. For node n, the net inflow is equal to the maximum flow value.\n\nBut how to find this maximum flow value. It must be equal to the sum of flows on edges leaving the source, which is equal to the sum of flows on edges entering the sink.\n\nBut since the graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps we can compute this by finding the sum of flows on edges incident to the source, but directed away from it. However, this seems circular.\n\nLet me take the first sample input:\n\nEdges:\n\n3-2: 10\n\n1-2: 10\n\n3-1: 5\n\nThe maximum flow is 15 (as explained in the note). The source is 1, and the sink is 3. In the sample solution, the directions are:\n\nEdge 3-2: directed from 3 to 2 → this contributes to the inflow of 2 and outflow of 3.\n\nEdge 1-2: directed from 1 to 2 → outflow from 1.\n\nEdge 3-1: directed from 3 to 1 → inflow to 1, outflow from 3.\n\nSo for node 1, the outflow is 10 (from edge 1-2), and the inflow is 5 (from edge 3-1). Net outflow is 10 - 5 = 5. But this contradicts the maximum flow being 15. So clearly, my understanding of the net outflow is wrong.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial assumption about the net outflow is incorrect. What is the correct way to calculate it?\n\nLet me think: For a flow, the net outflow from a node is the total flow leaving the node minus the total flow entering it. For the source, this should be equal to the total maximum flow. For the sink, it should be equal to minus the maximum flow. For other nodes, it should be zero.\n\nIn the sample solution, the net outflow from node 1 is 10 (out) - 5 (in) = 5. But the maximum flow is 15. This doesn't match. So what's wrong here?\n\nLooking back at the note in the first sample input:\n\n\"In the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path 1->2->3, and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: 1->3.\"\n\nSo the total maximum flow is 10 + 5 = 15. \n\nIn this scenario, the flow from 1 to 2 is 10, then from 2 to 3 is 10. The flow from 1 to 3 is 5. So for node 1, the outflow is 10 + 5 = 15. For node 2, the inflow is 10 (from 1), and outflow is 10 (to 3). Net outflow is zero. For node 3, inflow is 10 (from 2) + 5 (from 1) = 15. So net outflow is -15.\n\nBut in the sample solution, the direction of the edge between 3 and 1 is from 3 to 1, which would mean that the flow is from 3 to 1, which is against the actual flow direction. This suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation or in my understanding.\n\nWait, the sample output for the first input is:\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\nFirst edge (3-2) is directed as 1 (bi -> ai?), no. Wait, the input edges are given as ai, bi, ci. The output di is 0 if the direction is ai->bi, else 1 (bi->ai).\n\nSo for the first input:\n\nThe three edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3 2 10 → output is 1 → direction is from 2 to 3.\n\nEdge 2: 1 2 10 → output is 0 → direction is from 1 to 2.\n\nEdge 3: 3 1 5 → output is 1 → direction is from 1 to 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output for the i-th edge is 0 if the direction is ai→bi, else 1 (bi→ai).\n\nSo for edge 3: ai=3, bi=1, ci=5. Output is 1, so direction is bi→ai → 1 → 3. So the edge is directed from 1 to 3.\n\nAh! So in the first sample, the direction of the third edge is from 1 to 3. So for node 1, this contributes to outflow of 5. The second edge is directed from 1 to 2, contributing outflow of 10. The first edge is directed from 2 to 3, contributing inflow to node 2 and outflow to node 3.\n\nSo for node 1: outflow is 5 + 10 = 15. Inflow is 0. Net outflow is 15, which matches the maximum flow.\n\nFor node 2: inflow is 10 (from edge 2), outflow is 10 (from edge 1). Net outflow is zero.\n\nFor node 3: inflow is 10 (from edge 1) + 5 (from edge 3)? No, the third edge is directed from 1 to 3, so it contributes to inflow of node 3. The first edge is directed from 2 to 3, contributing to inflow of node 3. So total inflow for node 3 is 10 + ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The key requirements are that the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows for all intermediate vertices, the source vertex has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must not contain any cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list to efficiently manage and traverse the edges.\n2. **Topological Sorting**: Use a topological sort to ensure the directed graph is acyclic. This involves processing nodes in a specific order where each node is processed only after all its dependencies (in terms of flow) have been addressed.\n3. **Flow Conservation**: Ensure that for each intermediate vertex (not the source or sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges.

During traversal, we direct edges from the current node to its neighbors, ensuring that the flow conservation is maintained.\n3. **Flow Adjustment**: For each node, we track the remaining flow that needs to be sent out. By directing edges appropriately during traversal, we ensure that intermediate nodes maintain flow conservation, and the final sink node accumulates the maximum flow without any outgoing edges.\n\nThis approach ensures that the resulting directed graph is acyclic and satisfies the flow conservation conditions for all intermediate nodes.",
