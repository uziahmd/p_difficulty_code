His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points for all participants, but not their names. So we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. Oh, right, the second line is a1...an for the first tour, third line is b1...bn for the second tour. But the actual pairing between a_i and b_j is unknown. Because the teacher doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. So for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the pairing is not known. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purpose of calculating Vasya's possible ranks, we can assume that Vasya is one of the participants, and his total is a_i + b_j where i and j are some indices. But how do we model this?\n\nThe best rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged to be as low as possible. The worst rank is when his total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the best and worst possible positions?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor the best possible position, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. Because then he can be ranked higher. So, for the best case, we can take the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. Then, the best possible rank is 1 if there's no one else with higher sum. But how?\n\nBut wait, the actual way to find the best possible rank is to imagine that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so that he is placed as high as possible). Then, count how many people have a sum strictly greater than his. But since we can choose any pairing, maybe the best scenario is that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged in such a way that as few as possible have higher sums.\n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, the number of people that have a sum strictly greater than that would be the minimal possible. So the best rank is 1 plus the number of people who have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. But since we can choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, perhaps we can take the maximum possible sum (which is max_a + max_b?), but only if that sum is >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we can take the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which is max_a + max_b). Then, the best rank is 1 if that's the highest possible. But how to count the number of people that can have higher sums than that? Well, if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a higher sum. Because the maximum possible sum is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b. So in this case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum? For example, if there are two people with a_i and b_j such that their sum is equal to the maximum. Then, in that case, the jury can assign them to be in any order. So for the best rank, Vasya can be considered as the first, even if there are others with the same sum.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. Because we can arrange the jury to give him the first place. But wait, maybe there are other people with higher sum than Vasya's sum. Wait, no. If Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a higher sum. Because the maximum possible sum is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b. So for example, if someone else has a_i = max_a, and b_j = max_b, then their sum would be the same as Vasya's. But if that's the case, then the jury can arrange their positions. So the best possible rank for Vasya is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, it's always 1? But that's not the case. Let's look at the first sample input. In the first example, all a_i and b_j are 1, so the sum is 2 for everyone. So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut in the second sample input, the best possible is 1. So yes, the best possible is 1. So why is that?\n\nBecause the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the rest are arranged in a way that as few as possible have higher sums. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but how do we find that? Because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b. So for example, in the second sample input:\n\nn=6, x=7.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe maximum a is 6, maximum b is 8. So 6+8=14. But in the sample explanation, Vasya's sum is 4+8=12. Wait, why isn't he taking 6+8? Because maybe that's not allowed? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual sum could be higher. But for the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, provided that it's at least x. So if the maximum possible sum is >=x, then that's the best scenario.\n\nBut in the second sample, the maximum possible sum is 6+8=14. Which is >=7. So then, why in the sample explanation, Vasya's sum is 12?\n\nAh, because the sample explanation shows that the best scenario is when he has 12, but that's because in that case, he is the only one with that sum. But maybe there's another scenario where he has 14. Let me check.\n\nIn the second sample, the best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is 14. Then, how many people have a sum higher than that? None. So his rank is 1. Which is better than the sample explanation. But according to the sample output, the best is 1. Which matches.\n\nSo why in the note, the sample explanation says that he can get 12 points. Because that's an example of how the best case can be achieved. But the actual best case is when his sum is as high as possible, which is 14. So why in the sample explanation, the best case is 12? Because perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, looking back at the note for the second test case:\n\nIn the best case scenario, Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.\n\nBut why not have 6 and 8 paired? Because that would be 14. So why isn't that considered?\n\nAh, because the problem states that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. But the actual sum could be higher. So in the best case scenario, we can have Vasya's sum as high as possible. So why is the sample explanation showing 12?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. But the actual sum could be higher. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is as high as possible (so that he's ranked as high as possible). However, the problem is that the pairing of a_i and b_j must be such that each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the teacher can't choose any arbitrary pairing for Vasya. Because the actual pairings are fixed for all participants, but they are unknown. So for example, in the second sample input, the actual pairings are some permutation of the a and b arrays. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i is paired with which b_j.\n\nSo, when considering the best possible scenario for Vasya, we need to find a pairing of a_i and b_j (each a and b used once) such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x, and for that pairing, the sum of Vasya's a_i and b_j is as high as possible. Then, in that scenario, the best possible rank is determined by how many people have a higher sum than him.\n\nWait, this changes things. Oh! Oh right! Because the pairings are fixed. So for example, the actual pairings are a permutation of the b array. So each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. Therefore, when trying to find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to consider that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and then compute the rank based on that pairing.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because the problem allows us to choose the pairing that gives the best possible rank for Vasya. So, for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing that maximizes Vasya's sum (as long as it's >=x), and then compute the rank based on that pairing.\n\nBut how to model this? Because for the best possible rank, the approach is to maximize Vasya's sum. Then, in that scenario, count how many people have a sum strictly greater than his. Then, the best possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to minimize Vasya's sum (but still >=x), and then count how many people have a sum strictly greater than his, and also account for those with the same sum (since in that case, the jury can assign Vasya to be last among them).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor best rank:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (given that there exists a pairing where this sum is achievable and >=x). Then, in that pairing, the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum is the count. The best rank is count + 1.\n\nFor worst rank:\n\n- Find the minimum possible sum that Vasya can have (given that it is >=x). Then, in that pairing, the number of people with sum strictly greater than his sum, plus the number of people with the same sum as him (since in the worst case, the jury can put him last among them). So the worst rank is count + 1.\n\nBut how to compute these maximum and minimum possible sums for Vasya?\n\nBut here's the problem: the pairing of a and b must be such that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j. So for example, if we want to maximize Vasya's sum, we need to pair his a_i with the largest possible b_j, and the rest of the pairs can be arranged in a way that doesn't affect this.\n\nWait, but how to model this? Because the pairing must be a bijection between a and b. So to maximize Vasya's sum, we can take the maximum a_i and pair it with the maximum b_j. Then, the rest of the pairs can be arranged as needed. But for the purpose of calculating the best possible rank, the other pairs can be arranged in such a way that as few as possible have a higher sum than Vasya's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but considering that each a_i and b_j can be used once. But that's not possible. For example, if we take the maximum a_i and maximum b_j, then they can be paired. But the rest of the pairs would be other elements.\n\nBut the problem is, how to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Since the pairing is a permutation of the b array. So, for the best case, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j, where the pairing is such that a_i is paired with b_j, and all other a's are paired with other b's. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, where we can choose any a_i and any b_j, but ensuring that the rest can be paired (i.e., the other a's and b's can be matched in some way). But since the problem says that there exists at least one such pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x, then for the best case, we can select the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j, regardless of the rest.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if you take the maximum a_i and maximum b_j, then that's possible. Because you can pair those two, and the rest can be paired arbitrarily. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Similarly, the minimum possible sum for Vasya is the minimum a_i + minimum b_j, but that's only if that sum is >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible sum (max_a + max_b). Then, the number of people with sum strictly greater than this value is zero, so his best rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the second sample input:\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nmax a is 6.\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nmax b is 8.\n\nSo max sum is 6+8=14. Then, in that pairing, the other pairs can be arranged. How many people have sum >14? None. So best rank is 1. Which matches the sample output. So why does the sample explanation say that Vasya's sum is 12? Because that's just an example of a possible scenario, but the best possible scenario is when his sum is 14.\n\nSo the sample output for the second test case is '1 5', which aligns with this.\n\nSo the approach for best rank is:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which is max_a + max_b). Then, the best rank is 1 (since no one can have higher than that sum, because that's the maximum possible sum).\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible sum? Well, it's simply the maximum a_i + maximum b_j.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple a_i's and b_j's. For example, suppose there are two a_i's with 5, and two b_j's with 5. Then pairing them gives 10, but the maximum sum is 10. So that's correct.\n\nSo for the best rank, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but what if there are other pairs that sum to the same maximum value? For example, if two people can have the same maximum sum. Then, in that case, the jury can arrange their positions, so Vasya can be first. So the best rank is 1.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. But why in the first sample input, the best is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo then, the best possible rank is always 1. But that seems too easy. What about when x is very large?\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's sum is at least x. So the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i + b_j, but that sum must be >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x. So that's guaranteed.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1.\n\nBut that's not possible. Let me think again. Suppose that the maximum a_i + b_j is 10, and x is 5. Then, Vasya can have 10. So his sum is 10. Then, the best possible rank is 1. But if there are other people with sum 10, then the jury can arrange the order. So yes, he can be first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nBut then why in the sample input, the first case's best is 1. Which matches. So why is that?\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. So for the best part, the answer is 1.\n\nThen, what about the worst possible rank?\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, given that it's >=x. Then, in that scenario, the worst possible rank is determined by how many people have a sum strictly greater than his, plus the number of people with the same sum as him (since the jury can arrange to put him last among those with the same sum).\n\nSo how to compute the minimal possible sum for Vasya?\n\nTo find the minimal possible sum that is >=x, we need to find the minimal possible value s such that s >=x, and there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s. Then, in that scenario, the worst possible rank is computed.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s?\n\nThis seems more complex.\n\nLet me think: For the worst possible scenario, we want to choose the minimal possible sum for Vasya (but still >=x), and arrange the rest of the pairings so that as many as possible people have a sum >= s. Because that would make Vasya's rank as bad as possible.\n\nSo, the approach for the worst possible rank is:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya has s, and then calculate how many people have a sum >= s. Then the worst possible rank is that count.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal s is the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x, but considering that there exists a pairing where Vasya's a_i is paired with b_j, and the rest can be paired. However, the problem is that the pairing is a bijection, so when choosing a_i and b_j for Vasya, the rest of the a's and b's have to be paired in some way.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal possible s for Vasya? For example, if we can choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but still >=x), and that the rest of the a's and b's can be paired.\n\nBut how to ensure that the rest can be paired? Well, since the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x. But for the minimal s, perhaps we can take the minimal s that is >=x, and then check if there exists a way to pair the rest. However, since the problem says that Vasya is present, it's guaranteed that there is at least one such pair. So perhaps the minimal s is the minimal possible a_i + b_j >=x. But how to find that?\n\nBut the problem is that the pairing of a and b affects the possible values. For example, if we take a_i and b_j for Vasya, then the remaining a's and b's must be able to be paired. However, since the problem says that there exists at least one possible pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x, but for our purposes, we need to find the minimal s (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and the rest can be paired.\n\nBut how to compute that? It's complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to find the minimal s as follows:\n\nThe minimal possible s is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x, and for which there exists a way to pair the rest of the a's and b's. But how to check that?\n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let's think differently. For the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible s that Vasya can have (s >=x), and then compute the worst possible rank based on that s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s? Well, the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by pairing some a_i with some b_j, and the rest can be paired. However, this seems difficult. But perhaps, for the purpose of finding the worst possible rank, the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, regardless of whether the rest can be paired. Because if there exists a pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x, then we can take that pair for Vasya, and pair the rest in any way. So the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x. So to find that, we can generate all possible a_i + b_j, filter those >=x, and take the minimal one. However, this approach is incorrect because the same a_i and b_j can't be used again. For example, if we have a_i = 3 and b_j = 4, and another a_k = 3 and b_l = 4, then pairing one of them for Vasya would leave the other available for pairing.\n\nBut the problem is that when you select a_i and b_j for Vasya, you have to remove them from the pool of available a and b. So for the minimal s, we need to find a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then the rest of the a's and b's can be paired. But how to find such a pair?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. However, given the constraints of n up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe minimal possible sum for Vasya is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x, but considering that after selecting this pair, the remaining a's and b's can be paired. However, how to ensure that?\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of the worst possible rank, the minimal possible s is the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. Because regardless of whether the rest can be paired, there exists some pairing where Vasya's sum is s. Because the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x. So if we can find the minimal s as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x, then we can use that for the worst case.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s? For example, take all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and find the minimal s >=x. However, that would be O(n^2), which is impossible for n up to 1e5.\n\nBut that's not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but for the worst case, we want to select for Vasya the minimal possible sum that is >=x. To find this, we can sort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then take the minimal of all such possible a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: Sort the a array in ascending order. Sort the b array in ascending order. For each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal of all a_i + b_j for these pairs.\n\nBut this approach would work because for each a_i, the minimal b_j that can be paired with it to reach x is found via binary search.\n\nBut wait, this is assuming that we can pair a_i with b_j. However, once we select a_i and b_j for Vasya, the rest of the a's and b's must be paired. However, this approach ignores that. But perhaps, in the worst case scenario, we can pair Vasya's a_i and b_j, and then pair the rest of the a's with the rest of the b's. But how to ensure that?\n\nBut this seems like a problem. For example, suppose we have a_i sorted and b_j sorted. If we pick a certain a_i and a certain b_j, but there's no way to pair the remaining a's and b's. However, the problem states that there is at least one valid pairing (the one that includes Vasya's pair). So perhaps, the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x, and the rest can be paired. But how to find that?\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of the worst case scenario, we can ignore the pairing of the rest and just consider the minimal s. Because even if the rest can't be paired, the problem says that there is at least one pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. So maybe the minimal s is indeed the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x, and for the worst case scenario, we can assume that the rest can be paired.\n\nBut how to find that minimal s?\n\nLet me think of an example. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nAll a_i and b_j are 1. x is 2. So the minimal s is 2. So the worst case scenario is that Vasya's sum is 2, and there are 5 participants with sum 2. So the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nIn the second sample input, x is 7. The minimal s is 4+3=7 (since there are pairs like 4+3=7, or 3+4=7, etc). So for the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is 7. Then, how many people have a sum >=7?\n\nWe need to find the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to >=7, but in the worst case scenario, we need to arrange the pairings such that as many people as possible have a sum >=7. But how?\n\nWait, for the worst case scenario, we want to maximize the number of people with sum >= Vasya's s. Because that would push Vasya's rank down. So for the worst possible rank, we need to select the minimal possible s (>=x), and then arrange the pairings such that as many as possible other people have sum >=s. Then, the worst rank would be the number of people with sum >s, plus the number of people with sum =s (since the jury can put Vasya last among them).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s (Vasya's sum) that is >=x. Let's call this s_min.\n\n2. Compute the maximum possible number of people that can have sum >= s_min. Because in the worst case, we want as many people as possible to have sum >=s_min. This will maximize the number of people that are ranked above or equal to Vasya, thus giving the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number of people?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let me think again.\n\nOnce s_min is determined, we can find how many pairs (a_i, b_j) can be formed such that a_i + b_j >= s_min. However, since each a and b can be used exactly once, this becomes a problem of maximum matching. But for large n, this is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to approximate this. For example, if we sort a and b in ascending order, then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that can be paired with it to reach s_min, and then greedily pair them. This is similar to the two-pointer technique.\n\nWait, let's think of this. Suppose we want to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= s_min. How can we compute that?\n\nThis is a classic problem. The approach is to sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the first available b_j that satisfies a_i + b_j >= s_min. This way, we maximize the number of pairs.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then use two pointers: for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that can be paired with it. Once paired, that b_j is no longer available.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize two pointers: i starts at 0 (start of a), j starts at n-1 (end of b).\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n   if a_i + b_j >= s_min:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       continue\n\nThis way, we pair the smallest a_i with the largest possible b_j, which allows us to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nYes, this is the standard approach for finding the maximum number of pairs that satisfy a_i + b_j >= target.\n\nSo, for the worst case scenario, once we have s_min, the maximum number of people that can have sum >=s_min is this count. However, since Vasya is one of them, the total number of people with sum >=s_min is count. So, in the worst case scenario, the number of people with sum >=s_min is count. But since Vasya is included in this count, the worst possible rank is count.\n\nWait, no. Because the count is the maximum number of people that can be paired with sum >=s_min. So if the count is m, then there are m people with sum >=s_min. But since Vasya is one of them, the worst possible rank is m (if all of them have the same sum, the jury can put him last). So the worst possible rank is m.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n- Find s_min, the minimal possible sum >=x that Vasya can have.\n\n- Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >=s_min. Let this be m.\n\n- Then, the worst possible rank is m.\n\nBut how to find s_min?\n\nEarlier, I thought that s_min is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x. However, this might not be possible to achieve, because when you select this pair, the rest of the pairs may not be able to be formed. But the problem says that there exists at least one valid pairing. So perhaps, the minimal s_min is the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j >=x, and then we can proceed.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s_min?\n\nTo find s_min, we can generate all possible a_i + b_j >=x, and find the minimal one. However, for large n, this is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSort a and b. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal of all these possible values.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since b is sorted, this can be done with binary search. For each a_i, the minimal b_j is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_i). Once found, the sum is a_i + b_j. We can collect all such possible sums and take the minimal one.\n\nBut this would give us the minimal s_min. However, this approach assumes that the b_j can be used for pairing with a_i. However, once we select this pair, the other pairs may not be possible. But again, since the problem says that there exists at least one valid pairing, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding s_min, which is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, this approach is correct. Because even if the rest of the pairs cannot be formed, the problem guarantees that there is at least one pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. So, perhaps the minimal s_min is indeed the minimal a_i + b_j >=x, and we can proceed with that.\n\nOnce s_min is found, then the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s_min is calculated using the two-pointer approach.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nBest rank is always 1.\n\nWorst rank is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s_min, where s_min is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, the minimal s_min is 2 (since all pairs sum to 2). Then, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=2 is 5. Hence, worst rank is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample input, x is 7. Let's compute s_min.\n\nThe a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], sorted as [3,4,4,4,5,6].\n\nThe b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4], sorted as [0,3,4,4,6,8].\n\nFor each a_i in sorted a, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nLet's go through each a_i:\n\na_i =3: need b_j >=7-3=4. The sorted b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]. The first b_j >=4 is 4 (index 2). So sum is 3+4=7.\n\na_i=4: need b_j >=3. The first b_j >=3 is 3 (index 1). sum is 4+3=7.\n\na_i=4: same as above. sum is 7.\n\na_i=4: same as above. sum is 7.\n\na_i=5: need b_j >=2. First b_j is 0? No. 0 is less than 2. Next is 3. So 5+3=8 >=7. sum is 8.\n\na_i=6: need b_j >=1. First is 0. 6+0=6 <7. Next is 3: 6+3=9 >=7. sum is 9.\n\nSo the minimal s_min is 7 (the minimal among all these possible sums).\n\nThen, we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7.\n\nTo compute that, we sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order.\n\na_sorted = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb_sorted = [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nNow, we use the two-pointer approach:\n\nInitialize i=0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b) =5.\n\ncount =0.\n\nCheck a[0] + b[5] =3+8=11 >=7 → count=1, j=4.\n\nNext, a[0] is 3, j=4 (b=6). 3+6=9 >=7 → count=2, j=3.\n\nNext, a[0] is 3, j=3 (b=4). 3+4=7 >=7 → count=3, j=2.\n\nNow, a[0] is 3, j=2 (b=4). 3+4=7 → count=4, j=1.\n\nNow, a[0] is 3, j=1 (b=3). 3+3=6 <7 → move to next a_i.\n\ni=1 (a=4). j=1 (b=3). 4+3=7 → count=5, j=0.\n\ni=2 (a=4). j=0 (b=0). 4+0=4 <7 → move to next a_i.\n\ni=3 (a=4). j=0 → same as before. <7 → move.\n\ni=4 (a=5). j=0 → 5+0=5 <7 → move.\n\ni=5 (a=6). j=0 → 6+0=6 <7 → no.\n\nTotal count is 5. So the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7 is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works for the sample.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor best rank: output 1.\n\nFor worst rank:\n\n- Find s_min, the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n- Then, compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >=s_min. Let this be m.\n\n- The worst possible rank is m.\n\nBut how to find s_min?\n\nAs discussed, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, then take the minimal of all these values. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\nSort the a array in ascending order.\n\nSort the b array in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i in a_sorted:\n\n   find the minimal b_j in b_sorted such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n   if such a b_j exists, record the sum a_i + b_j.\n\nTake the minimal of all these recorded sums. That's s_min.\n\nBut how to find the minimal b_j for each a_i?\n\nFor each a_i, the required b_j is >= (x - a_i). Since b_sorted is sorted, we can perform a binary search for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the scores from both tours and considering all possible pairings of these scores to determine the optimal and worst-case scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: \n   - The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can assume Vasya has the highest possible score by pairing the maximum score from the first tour with the maximum score from the second tour.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To determine the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimum possible score Vasya could have that is at least `x`. This is done by checking all possible pairs of scores from the first and second tours.\n   - Once we have the minimum score `s_min` that Vasya could have (which is at least `x`), we then calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a score greater than or equal to `s_min`. This is achieved using a two-pointer technique after sorting both score lists.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, x = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    # Calculate s_min\n    s_min = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first b_j >= target\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if idx < len(b_sorted):\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[idx]\n            if current_sum < s_min:\n                s_min = current_sum\n    # Now compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min\n    # Using two pointers\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= s_min:\n            count += 1\n            j -= 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    print(\"1\", count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the two lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n- **Sorting**: Both score lists are sorted to facilitate efficient calculation of minimum and maximum possible scores.\n- **Finding Minimum Score (s_min)**: For each score in the first tour, we use binary search to find the smallest score in the second tour that, when paired, results in a total score of at least `x`.\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: After determining `s_min`, we use a two-pointer technique to count the maximum number of participants who can have a score greater than or equal to `s_min`. This helps in determining the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks using sorting and binary search, leading to an optimal solution.",
