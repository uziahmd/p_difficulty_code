She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The browser has n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current open tabs' boundaries) or close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. \n\nThe key here is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to get rid of all tabs outside [l, r]. Let's think about what needs to be done. \n\nSo, the tabs that need to stay are from l to r. That means any tabs before l (indices 1 to l-1) and after r (indices r+1 to n) must be closed. \n\nBut how does the closing work? For example, if she closes all tabs to the left of the current position, that would remove all tabs from a (current min) up to i-1. Similarly for closing to the right. \n\nBut the challenge is figuring out the order of operations. Since each close operation can eliminate a bunch of tabs, but you have to position the cursor correctly to do so. \n\nLet me think about possible scenarios. \n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r], and the entire segment [l, r] is already open. Then, maybe no operations are needed. Wait, but what if there are tabs outside [l, r]? For example, if l=2, r=4, and n=6, then the tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed. But if the current position is 3 (which is inside [l, r]), then perhaps we can close the left and right parts. \n\nBut how? Let's take the first example given: input 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired output is 5. \n\nIn that case, the steps are:\n\nMove to tab 2 (from 3, moving left once), then close all tabs to the left (which would close tab 1). Then move to tab 3 (already there?), then move to tab 4 (two steps?), then close all tabs to the right (tabs 5 and 6). \n\nWait, but how many steps does that take? Let's count:\n\nMoving from 3 to 2: 1 second. Then closing left: 1 second. Then moving from 2 to 3 (but wait, after closing the left, the a (min) is now 2, since tab 1 is closed. So the current position is at 2. To move to 3, which is allowed. So moving right once (1 second). Then moving to 4 (another second). Then closing right (1 second). So total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. Which matches the example. \n\nSo the idea is that to close the left part, you need to position the cursor at the leftmost tab of the desired segment (l), then close left. Similarly for the right part, position the cursor at r, then close right. \n\nBut how to determine whether we need to do that? \n\nSo, the problem reduces to two possibilities: closing the left part and closing the right part. \n\nBut how to calculate the steps required for each. \n\nFirst, check if the current position is already in the [l, r] range. If not, then we need to move to the correct position. \n\nBut let's think about the steps needed to close the left and right parts. \n\nFor the left part: we need to close all tabs before l. To do that, we need to have the cursor at l. Because when we close all tabs to the left of the cursor, that would close everything up to l-1. \n\nSimilarly, for the right part, we need to have the cursor at r, then close all tabs to the right. \n\nBut what if l is already the leftmost tab? Then there's nothing to close on the left. Similarly for the right. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Determine if there are tabs to the left of l. If yes, then we need to close them. This requires moving to l, then closing left. \n\n- Determine if there are tabs to the right of r. If yes, then we need to move to r, then closing right. \n\nBut how to compute the time for moving to l or r. \n\nAdditionally, the initial position is pos. So, for example, if the current position is already at l, then moving to l takes 0 steps. \n\nBut what about when the current position is inside [l, r]?",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Cursor Positioning**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the appropriate positions (either `l` for closing left tabs or `r` for closing right tabs).\n3. **Operations Count**: Each move operation takes 1 second, and each close operation also takes 1 second. Thus, we need to account for both moving to the correct position and performing the close operation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current segment is already the desired one, no actions needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Check if we need to close tabs on the left\n    close_left = l > 1\n    # Check if we need to close tabs on the right\n    close_right = r < n\n\n    time = 0\n\n    # If closing left, move to l and close\n    if close_left:\n        # Time to move from pos to l\n        time += abs(pos - l)\n        # Then close left\n        time += 1\n\n    # If closing right, move to r and close\n    if close_right:\n        # Time to move from pos (after previous moves) to r\n        # But after closing left, the current position is l, so move from l to r\n        # Or if we didn't close left, then from original pos\n        if close_left:\n            move_from = l\n        else:\n            move_from = pos\n        time += abs(move_from - r)\n        time += 1\n\n    print(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Immediate Case**: If the segment [l, r] is already the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n), no operations are needed.\n2. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if there are tabs to close on the left (i.e., if `l > 1`) and on the right (i.e., if `r < n`).\n3. **Calculate Movement and Close Time**:\n   - For closing tabs on the left, move the cursor to `l` and close all tabs to the left.\n   - For closing tabs on the right, move the cursor to `r` from the current position (after any previous moves) and close all tabs to the right.\n4. **Sum Operations**: The total time includes both the movement steps and the close operations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum time required by focusing only on necessary movements and operations, leveraging the constraints provided.",
