Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. All of them must be the same. Then, check all the non-diagonal cells. They must all be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for a given n x n grid, where n is odd.\n\nThe main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0).\n\nFor each cell in these two diagonals, check if they are all the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n\nThen, for all other cells (those not on either diagonal), check if they are all the same, and that this character is different from 'd_char'.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\n2. Check all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n - 1, then it's part of the diagonals. Collect all these characters and check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but for the two diagonals, the overlapping cell is the center cell when n is odd. So for example, in a 5x5 grid, the center is (2,2), which is part of both diagonals. But that's okay, as it's just one cell.\n\nSo for the first step, collect all the characters in the diagonals. Then check if all of them are the same. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, collect all the other characters (non-diagonal cells). Check if all of them are the same, and that they are different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect these?\n\nLet me think about the loops.\n\nFor each row i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each column j from 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonal.\n\n      else: part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, for all cells, check whether they are in the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character as the reference. For example, check if all diagonal characters are equal to the first one.\n\nBut what if the grid is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so there are some cells.\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nCheck that all cells in the diagonals are the same. Let's get the first diagonal character (say, from (0,0)), then check for every cell in the diagonals that it's equal to that.\n\nBut wait, what if the grid has all diagonals as same, but the non-diagonals are same as each other but same as the diagonals? Then the answer is no, because the non-diagonals must be different.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Check that all diagonal cells are same. Let's call this d_char.\n\n2. Check that all non-diagonal cells are same. Let's call this o_char.\n\n3. Check that d_char != o_char.\n\nIf all three conditions are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read the grid. Let's say grid is a list of lists, or just a list of strings.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if it's on the diagonals. For that, i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, for all cells in the grid, we can iterate through each cell and check if it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first one as the reference. For example, the first cell (0,0) is part of the diagonals. Then, for all other cells in the diagonals, check if they are equal to this reference. If any is not, then return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, collect all the non-diagonal cells. Check if all of them are equal to each other and also not equal to the diagonal's reference.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nAlternatively, for all non-diagonal cells, check if they are equal to the o_char. But what is o_char? It's the first non-diagonal cell's character. But what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted once). The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal cells:\n\nTake the first non-diagonal cell (for example, (0,1) in n=3?), check if all others are same as that. But what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, but for n=1, but the input constraints say n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor each cell (i,j) in diagonals:\n\n   if grid[i][j] != d_char: return NO\n\nThen, check for non-diagonal cells:\n\nif there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, but for example, in n=3, there are 3*3 - 5 = 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, collect all non-diagonal cells. Take the first one as o_char. Then check that all others are same as o_char. Also, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nAlternatively, for all non-diagonal cells, check that they are same as each other and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells.\n\nLet me think of code structure.\n\nIn Python, for each line in the input, read as a string. So, grid is a list of strings.\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1:\n\nCheck if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1). If yes, then part of diagonals.\n\nSo, first, check all diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen, check the non-diagonal cells. For that, collect all non-diagonal cells. But how to check if they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to check that? Let's take the first non-diagonal cell. For example, check (0,1) if it's non-diagonal. But for n=3, (0,1) is non-diagonal (since 0+1=1, which is not equal to 2 (n-1=2). So yes.\n\nBut for the first non-diagonal cell, perhaps (0,1) is the first one. But maybe in some cases, the first cell is part of the diagonal. For example, in n=3, the first cell (0,0) is part of the diagonal. So the first non-diagonal cell would be (0,1).\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all of them. Then check that all are same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to collect them? Let's think of the following:\n\nWe can loop through all cells again. For each cell not on the diagonals, collect their characters.\n\nBut for checking, we can check if all of them are same as the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nAlternatively, for the non-diagonal cells, check if all are same as each other and different from d_char.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: first, check if there are any non-diagonal cells. Well, for n >=3, there are.\n\nSo, for example, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So four cells.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can check for the first non-diagonal cell. Let's loop through all cells in order, and find the first one that's not on the diagonals. Then, take its character as o_char. Then check that all other non-diagonal cells are equal to o_char and that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, and for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So that's not possible.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nAfter checking the diagonals, proceed to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nFind the first non-diagonal cell. For example:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        continue\n\n    break\n\nOnce found, then check all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can loop through all cells again, and check if they are not on the diagonals. For each such cell, check if it equals o_char. Also, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char? Then, the answer is no.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, then:\n\nCheck if there are any non-diagonal cells. Well, there are.\n\nNow, find o_char. Let's take the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nBut how to find that? Maybe in the same loop as checking the diagonals. Alternatively, loop through all cells again.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfound = False\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        break\n\nThen, after that, check all non-diagonal cells:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nAlso, check that o_char != d_char.\n\nIf all of that is true, then print \"YES\".\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for example, in n=3, the code would find the first non-diagonal cell, which is (0,1). Then check all non-diagonal cells against that.\n\nBut what if the first non-diagonal cell is not the same as others?\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nBut what if all the non-diagonal cells are same as d_char? Then, the check would fail because o_char would be same as d_char. So, in that case, the code would check that o_char != d_char, which would be false, and output NO.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen, find the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nOnce found, check all non-diagonal cells are same as o_char and o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nAnother approach: loop through all cells in order, and for the first cell that is not on the diagonals, take its value as o_char.\n\nBut for example, for n=3, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1).\n\nBut how to code that?\n\nIn code:\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nThen, after that, check all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nOnce o_char is found, check:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen check if o_char != d_char. If not, print \"NO\".\n\nElse, print \"YES\".\n\nSo, code:\n\nSo, after checking diagonals, then:\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So, no problem.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is >=3. So no problem.\n\nOnce o_char is found, then:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen, check if o_char != d_char. If not, print \"NO\".\n\nElse, print \"YES\".\n\nBut in code, how to do this?\n\nSo, after the above steps, we can check if o_char != d_char. If not, output \"NO\".\n\nElse, output \"YES\".\n\nBut what if the code reaches here?\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut what about cases where all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char?\n\nLike, suppose all cells are same. Then, the diagonals are same (all same), and the non-diagonal cells are same (same as d_char). Then, o_char == d_char, which is invalid. So output \"NO\".\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck diagonals: for each cell where i == j or i + j = 4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x (d_char is x)\n\ni=0, j=4: x (same as d_char)\n\ni=1, j=1: x (same)\n\ni=1, j=3: x (same)\n\ni=2, j=2: x (same)\n\ni=3, j=1: x (same?)\n\nWait, for i=3, j=1: i + j = 4. So yes, part of the diagonal. So grid[3][1] is x?\n\nLooking at row 3: 'oxoxo' → positions 0: o, 1: x, 2: o, 3: x, 4: o. So j=1 is x. So yes, part of the diagonal.\n\nBut for row 2, j=2: grid[2][2] is x. But the third row is 'soxoo' → so the third row is s o x o o. So yes, grid[2][2] is x.\n\nBut looking at row 2, j=0: i=2, j=0. i + j = 2, which is not 4. So not part of the diagonal. So, the cell (2,0) is s. Which is non-diagonal. So, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is o. Then, check all non-diagonal cells are o. But in row 2, cell (2,0) is s. Which is not o. So the code will detect that and return NO. Which matches the first sample output of NO.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals: cells (0,0)=w, (0,2)=w; (1,1)=w; (2,0)=w; (2,2)=w. All are w. So d_char is w.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells: (0,1) is s, (1,0) is s, (1,2) is s, (2,1) is s. So o_char is s. Check all non-diagonal cells are s. Then check s != w. So output YES. Which matches sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals: (0,0) is x. Check all diagonals. (0,0) x, (0,2) x. (1,1) x. (2,0) x. (2,2) e. Wait, (2,2) is e. So that's part of the diagonal. So in this case, the code will check that. For i=2, j=2: i == j (yes) so part of the diagonal. So grid[2][2] is e. Which is not equal to d_char (x). So the code would print NO. Hence, the third sample output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nBut in Python, for reading input, the code may have multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of inputs. But the problem says that the input is read from stdin. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given, it's given as a list of examples. However, the actual code needs to read from standard input.\n\nWait, the user provided sample input is given as a list of inputs. But the actual code must read from stdin. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut the code must read that from stdin. So the code is supposed to read one test case. Wait, but the sample input shows that the first input is a list of test cases. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, in the actual problem, the code must process one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code must read from stdin. So, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nWait, the problem's input is as follows: the first line is n, then n lines. So the code must process one test case. However, the sample input given in the problem shows multiple test cases. But that's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual code must read one input.\n\nBut the sample output is given as a list of outputs. So the code is supposed to read one test case, process it, and output the result.\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo, the code must read one test case. The sample input shows three test cases, but that's for the purpose of the example. So, the code must process one test case.\n\nWait, but the sample input given in the problem is written as a list of inputs, but that's perhaps for the purpose of the example. For example, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the first example would be:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich would produce the output NO.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? The problem says that the code must read from stdin. However, the problem's sample input shows multiple test cases. But looking back, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So, the code is supposed to process a single test case. Therefore, the sample input in the problem is perhaps a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nTherefore, the code must read n, then read n lines, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code will process one test case.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines.\n\nCheck for diagonals.\n\nCheck for non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck the diagonals.\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen, find the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nThen check all non-diagonal cells are same as o_char and o_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to code this in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, check the diagonals.\n\nBut note that sometimes, when reading lines, there may be leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters, so using strip() is okay.\n\nBut perhaps, better to read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in code:\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nNow, check the diagonals.\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() is not the best way. Perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut perhaps, for code, using return or breaking.\n\nBut in code, for the purposes of the problem, perhaps:\n\nOnce any of the checks fail, print 'NO' and exit.\n\nNow, after checking the diagonals, proceed to check non-diagonal cells.\n\nNow, find the first non-diagonal cell.\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal cells:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen check if o_char != d_char:\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n >=3, there are.\n\nBut for example, n=3, the code finds o_char as the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nBut what if the grid is such that all non-diagonal cells are same as o_char, but o_char is same as d_char?\n\nLike, all cells are same. Then, the code would check that, and print NO.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. For example, in code, perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut in code, for the code to work, perhaps:\n\nBut in Python, the code can use:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, check diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function is in sys module. So, perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in code, after detecting a problem, print 'NO' and break out of loops.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check diagonals\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\n# Now check all non-diagonal cells are o_char and o_char != d_char\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? But for n >=3, there are. For example, n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut in code, for the case where all cells are on the diagonals. But that's impossible for n >=3. Because for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2n-1 = 5. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal is 4.\n\nSo, the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid is ['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw']\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: 'w'\n\ni=0, j=2: 'w'\n\ni=1, j=1: 'w'\n\ni=2, j=0: 'w'\n\ni=2, j=2: 'w'\n\nAll same.\n\nThen find first non-diagonal cell. Let's see:\n\ni=0, j=0 is diagonal. i=0, j=1: not diagonal. So o_char is grid[0][1] = 's'.\n\nThen check all non-diagonal cells:\n\ncells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). All are 's'.\n\nThen check o_char (s) != d_char (w). Yes. So output YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid is ['xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: 'x'\n\ni=0, j=2: 'x'\n\ni=1, j=1: 'x'\n\ni=2, j=0: 'x'\n\ni=2, j=2: 'e' → which is not same as 'x'. So during the first check, it will print NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: all cells same. For example, n=3, all 'a's. Then diagonals are all 'a's. Then non-diagonal cells are all 'a's. So o_char is 'a' same as d_char. So code prints NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal are 'b's. Then code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal are 'b's. Then code returns YES.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if n=3, and the diagonals are all 'a's, but non-diagonal cells are all 'a's? Then code returns NO.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal cells are 'b's except one cell which is 'c'. Then code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, when reading input, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So using strip() is safe.\n\nBut in some cases, if the input lines have leading/trailing whitespace, the code would read it wrong. But according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So the code can safely read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in the code, the code reads:\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut for example, if the input is:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\ndef\n\nghi\n\nThen each line is read as 'abc', 'def', 'ghi'.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about the case where the first non-diagonal cell is not found? Well, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So the code will find o_char.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check diagonals\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Check non-diagonal cells\n\no_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if o_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\n# Check all non-diagonal cells are same as o_char\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the first non-diagonal cell is not found? For example, in n=1, but n is >=3. So no problem.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses sys.exit(), but in Python, it's better to import sys.\n\nBut the code starts with import sys.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code checks diagonals. For example, in row 2, column 0 (i=2, j=0): i + j = 2, which is not equal to 4 (n-1=5-1=4). So it's not part of the diagonal. But during the diagonal check, the code checks all cells in the diagonals. For example, cell (2, 2) is part of the diagonal. grid[2][2] is 'x' (the third row is 'soxoo', so index 2 is 'x'). But cell (2,0) is 's', which is not part of the diagonal. So during the diagonal check, the code checks all cells in the diagonals. But in the first sample input, the cell (2, 0) is not part of the diagonal. However, during the diagonal check, the code checks for all cells in the diagonals. For example, for i=2, j=2: yes. But for cell (2,0), it's not part of the diagonal, so it's not checked here.\n\nBut in the first sample input, during the diagonal check, the code checks all the diagonal cells. For example, in row 2, j=2 is part of the diagonal. But for row 2, j=0 is not. So during the diagonal check, the code would check all the diagonal cells. However, in the first sample input, the cell (2, 2) is 'x', which is same as d_char. But the code would pass the diagonal check. However, the non-diagonal cells include the cell (2,0) which is 's' which is not same as o_char (which is 'o').\n\nSo during the non-diagonal check, the code would find that cell (2,0) is 's', which is not equal to o_char (which is 'o'), thus printing NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', and non-diagonals are 'b's. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonals are 'a's. Output NO.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals of the square must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all characters on both diagonals are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure that all non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check the diagonals\nd_char = grid[0][0]\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Find the first non-diagonal character\no_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n            break\n    if o_char is not None:\n        break\n\n# Check all non-diagonal characters\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Check if the non-diagonal character is different from diagonal\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions. The first line gives the size of the grid `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks all cells on both diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left). If any cell on these diagonals does not match the first diagonal character (`d_char`), the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code identifies the first non-diagonal character (`o_char`) and then checks all other non-diagonal cells to ensure they match `o_char`. If any non-diagonal cell does not match `o_char`, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Final Check**: Finally, the code ensures that `o_char` (non-diagonal character) is different from `d_char` (diagonal character). If they are the same, the answer is \"NO\", otherwise \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal given the constraints.",
