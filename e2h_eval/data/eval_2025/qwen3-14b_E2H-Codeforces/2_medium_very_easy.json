Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all other cells (not on diagonals) are the same, and that this character is different from 'd_char'.\n\nHow to check the diagonals?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. For a cell to be on the main diagonal, i == j. For the other diagonal, i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if it's on either of these, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the other diagonal is 'y', then that's invalid. So first, we need to check that all the diagonal cells are the same. So collect all the diagonal cells and check that they are all the same.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n- Then check:\n   - All elements in diagonal_chars are the same.\n   - All elements in other_chars are the same.\n   - The diagonal_char is different from other_char.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no other_chars? Like when n=1? But the problem says n is at least 3 and odd. So n is 3 or more. For n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So total diagonal cells are 2*3 -1 =5. The other cells are 9-5=4. So for n=3, there are other cells.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse, part of others.\n\nNow, collect all diagonal characters and others.\n\nThen check:\n\nIf all diagonals are same, others are same, and the two are different.\n\nBut how to check if all elements in a list are the same?\n\nFor example, for diagonal_chars, take the first element, then check if all others are equal to it.\n\nSame for other_chars.\n\nBut what if there are zero other_chars? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=3, the other_chars would be 4 elements.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as a list of strings.\n\nCollect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nCheck:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 0: impossible since n >=3.\n\nBut for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since center is counted once).\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i == j or i + j == n-1]\n\nother_chars = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if not (i == j or i + j == n-1)]\n\nThen:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]: return NO\n\nElse, return YES.\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? For example, when n=1. But n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements. So for the code, it's safe.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the input constraints say n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string.\n\nThen collect the diagonal and other characters.\n\nCheck:\n\nif the diagonals have all same, others same, and different.\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, in that case, the code would check len(set(...)) which is 0. But in that case, the code would proceed. But for n=3, other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo code:\n\nBut in Python, if other_chars is empty, then len(set(other_chars)) is 0, which is not 1. So the code would return NO. Which is correct, because in that case, the other_chars is empty. But according to the problem statement, the other squares (non-diagonal) must have same letter. But if there are no other squares, then perhaps the condition is satisfied? Wait, no. Because the problem says that all other squares (those not on diagonals) must have same letter. But if there are no such squares, then that condition is vacuously true. But according to the problem's description, the diagonals must have same letters, and others must have same letters different from diagonals. However, if there are no others, then the second condition is not met. Because the problem says that the other squares must have same letter different from diagonals. But if there are no other squares, then that condition is not met. Because the other squares (which are none) have same letter (which is trivially true), but the problem says that the other squares must have same letter different from diagonals. But if there are no other squares, then the second condition is not met. Because the problem says that the other squares must have same letter different from the diagonals. But if there are no other squares, then the other squares (none) have same letter (which is true), but the problem requires that the other squares have same letter different from diagonals. So in this case, the other squares are none. So the condition is that the other squares (none) have same letter (which is true) and that letter is different from the diagonals. But since there are no other squares, how can we check that?\n\nBut according to the problem's input constraints, n is at least 3. For n=3, the number of non-diagonal squares is 4. So for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So in the code, for the case where n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with the steps above.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x\n\ni=0, j=4: x\n\ni=1, j=1: x\n\ni=1, j=3: x\n\ni=2, j=2: x\n\ni=3, j=1: x\n\ni=3, j=3: x\n\ni=4, j=0: x\n\ni=4, j=4: x\n\nWait, for i=2, j=2 is part of the main diagonal. And for i=2, j=2, i + j = 4, which is n-1 (n=5, n-1=4). So yes, that's part of the other diagonal. So for the diagonals, all the cells should be same. But in row 2, column 0 (i=2, j=0) is s. Wait no, the third row is 'soxoo' — so row 2 (assuming 0-based) is s o x o o. So for i=2, j=0 is s. But that is not on the diagonals. Because i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is not equal to 4. And i != j (2 != 0). So it's part of other_chars. But looking at the diagonals, the main diagonal for i=2, j=2 is x. The other diagonal for i=2, j=2 is also part of the other diagonal (since i + j = 4). So for the diagonals, all cells should be x. But looking at the grid:\n\nLooking at row 2, column 2 is x. What about row 2, column 0? That's not part of the diagonals. But what about the other cells on the diagonals?\n\nFor example, row 2, column 2 is x. What about row 0, column 4? It's x. Row 1, column 3: x. Row 3, column 1: x. Row 4, column 0: x. So all the diagonals are x. But in row 2, column 0 is s. But that's part of other_chars. Now, the other_chars are all the cells not on the diagonals. Let's see:\n\nIn row 0, columns 1, 2, 3: o, o, o. Then row 1, columns 0, 2, 4: o, o, o. Row 2, columns 0, 1, 3, 4: s, o, o, o. Row 3, columns 0, 2, 4: o, o, o. Row 4, columns 1, 2, 3: o, o, o.\n\nSo other_chars includes s, which is different from o. So the other_chars are not all same. Hence, the answer is NO, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Let's see:\n\nn=3.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nDiagonals: positions (0,0) = w; (0,2) = w; (1,1) = w; (2,0)=w; (2,2)=w. So all diagonals are w. The other cells are (0,1) s; (1,0) s; (1,2) s; (2,1) s. So other_chars are all s. So the diagonals are w, others are s. So answer is YES.\n\nThird sample input is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'. Let's check:\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) x; (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. So diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonals are not all same. So the answer is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines. For example, for the first input, the first line is 5, then 5 lines.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the input is given as per the sample input:\n\nThe first line is n, then n lines each with n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is a list of strings. For example, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the actual input for the code is via stdin. So the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: the first line contains integer n, then n lines of letters.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as a list of test cases. But for the code, the code must read from standard input. So for example, when the user runs the code, the input is given as per the problem's input format.\n\nSo for example, the first test case would be:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nAnd third:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo each test case is a single n followed by n lines. But the sample input shows that the input is a list of multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is presented as a list for the purpose of the example. However, the actual code must read one test case. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. But that's perhaps not the case. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut this is perhaps a way to represent multiple test cases. However, in reality, the code must process a single test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given as per the first line containing n, then n lines. So for each test case, the code reads n and then n lines. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. But the problem may be that the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases. But the original problem's input is for a single test case.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters. So the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. How?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The output is a list of three answers. But the problem says that the code must read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the sample input is a way to show that for three test cases, the outputs are as given. However, in practice, the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's input and output description:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. The output is to print \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. But how?\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich would be the first input. The output is NO.\n\nBut the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n. Which implies that there is only one test case.\n\nBut this is conflicting. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines of letters. So for each test case, the code reads n and then n lines. So the code must process one test case. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is the first input. The output is NO.\n\nBut the code must process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases for the purpose of the example, but the actual code must process one test case. However, the sample output shows that for each test case, the code outputs a string.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read from stdin. So the code must read a single test case. Therefore, the sample input is perhaps not in the standard input format. But this is a confusion.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is a list of three test cases. But that's probably not the actual input format. It's more likely that the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code must read one test case. However, the sample input is given in a way that suggests that the code must process multiple test cases. But this is not clear.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters. So the code is supposed to read one test case. Therefore, the sample input is perhaps a list of test cases, but the actual code must read one test case.\n\nBut in that case, the sample input is not correct. However, the sample input and output shows that the code must process multiple test cases. But that's not stated in the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that represents the input as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. But that would not make sense. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about that. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The sample output is given as a list of three outputs. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a problem. But looking at the problem's input description, the first line contains n, then n lines. So for each test case, the code must read n and then n lines. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the first line of the input is the first test case's n. Then the next n lines are the grid. Then comes another test case's n, etc.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', which is the first test case. Then '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw' is the second test case. So the code must read multiple test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to know when the input ends? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must process all of them. However, the problem's input description does not mention this. But the sample input shows multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as follows: first line contains n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first test case is given as a single block, then the second, etc. So the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut in that case, how to process them? For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', which is a single test case. But how is that represented in the input? For example, in the actual input, the first line is 5, then 5 lines. Then the next test case starts with 3, etc.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is a string that starts with 5, then the next lines are the grid. So perhaps the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of n followed by n lines.\n\nTherefore, the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process them accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code must process multiple test cases. But this is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again, the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the output is also a list of three outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code must read until EOF.\n\nSo the code needs to read multiple test cases. How to do that?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process them. But for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines of n letters.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly?\n\nAn alternative approach is to read all lines from stdin, and process them as follows:\n\nRead all lines into a list. Then process each test case by taking the first line as n, then next n lines as the grid. Then repeat for the remaining lines.\n\nBut how to handle this? For example, in the sample input, the first test case's input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code can read all lines as a list, and process them sequentially.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in a loop.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, split into a list. Then process each test case.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nIn Python, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() to get all lines.\n\nThen, process the lines as follows:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, for each test case, take the first line as n, then take the next n lines as the grid. Then process, and then move the pointer forward by n+1 lines.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think.\n\nInitialize a pointer i=0.\n\nWhile i < len(lines):\n\n   Read n = int(lines[i])\n\n   i += 1\n\n   grid = lines[i:i+n]\n\n   i += n\n\n   process grid.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' — but that's not how the input is structured. Wait, no. The actual input is given as per the problem's input description. For example, the first line is n, then n lines of the grid. So the code must read the lines as per that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '5' followed by 5 lines of the grid. Then the next line is '3' followed by 3 lines, etc. So the code must process each test case in this way.\n\nSo, the code must read multiple test cases, each starting with an n, followed by n lines.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines, and process them as per this.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        # process grid here\n\n        # compute and print result\n\nSo, for each test case, process the grid.\n\nNow, the code for processing the grid.\n\nAs discussed earlier, collect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nThen check:\n\nif all diagonal_chars are same, others are same, and different.\n\nSo, code for processing grid:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\n\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, when n=1. But n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1, but the code is not handling that. But according to the problem's input constraints, n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5, grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nProcessing:\n\ndiagonal_chars includes all the cells on the two diagonals. For example, the third row (i=2) has j=0, which is not on the diagonals. The cell (2,2) is on both diagonals. So the code collects all the diagonal cells.\n\nIn this case, the diagonal_chars includes the cell (2,2) which is x. However, the other cells in the diagonals are x. But the other_chars includes the cell (2,0) which is 's', which is not same as others. So other_chars will have elements like 's', 'o', etc. So the len(set(other_chars)) is not 1, hence output NO.\n\nSample test case 2: n=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal_chars are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w → all 'w'.\n\nother_chars are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s → all 's'. So output YES.\n\nThird test case: n=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal chars are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e → set is {x, e} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for the case when other_chars is empty (but n >=3, which can't happen), but code is safe.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, when other_chars is empty, len(set(other_chars)) is 0. So the code would print 'NO' because len(set(...)) != 1.\n\nBut in reality, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        diagonal_chars = []\n\n        other_chars = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                    diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        # Check conditions\n\n        if len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        elif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        elif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? For example, when n=1. But the code is not supposed to handle that. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 3. So in that case, other_chars will not be empty.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1. But the code would have len(set(other_chars)) = 0, which is not 1, so print 'NO'.\n\nBut in the problem, n is at least 3, so this case will not occur.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first test case's lines would be:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is processed correctly.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw → returns YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe → returns NO.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code is written.\n\nBut what about when other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', other_chars are 'b'. Then output YES.\n\nAnother edge case: diagonals are all 'a', other_chars are all 'a' → output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. For example, one diagonal has 'a' and other has 'b' → len(set(diagonal_chars)) is 2 → output NO.\n\nThus, the code handles all cases.\n\nNow, the code can be written as such.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all letters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read all input lines at once and process them sequentially.\n2. **Grid Processing**: For each test case, extract the grid dimensions and the grid itself.\n3. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Characters**: Separate the characters on the diagonals from those not on the diagonals.\n4. **Validation Checks**:\n   - Ensure all diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Ensure all non-diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Ensure the diagonal characters are different from the non-diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n            idx += 1\n        diagonal_chars = []\n        other_chars = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n                else:\n                    other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        # Check conditions\n        if len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing.\n- **Grid Extraction**: For each test case, the grid size `n` is read first, followed by `n` lines representing the grid.\n- **Character Separation**: Characters on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`) are collected separately from the rest of the grid.\n- **Validation**: Using set operations, we check if all characters on the diagonals are the same and if all non-diagonal characters are the same. Additionally, we ensure that the characters on the diagonals are different from those not on the diagonals.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and correctness in determining if the grid forms an \"X\".",
