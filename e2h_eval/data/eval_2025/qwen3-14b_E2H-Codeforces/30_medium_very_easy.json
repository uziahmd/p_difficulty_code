    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. The output should be the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves this maximum sum. \n\nHmm. So the key is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized. But since both players are taking digits, and each has exactly n moves, we need to make sure that in the end, both have exactly n digits. \n\nWait, the problem says that before each turn, they decide who will make the next move. So the sequence of moves is a string of H and M, with exactly n H's and n M's. And the order of choosing determines which digits each gets. \n\nThe challenge is to find the sequence of choices (H or M) that leads to the maximum possible sum of S1 and S2. \n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the digits are taken from the left, the first choice is to take the first digit. Let's say if Homer takes it, then he adds it to his number. Then, the next step depends on the remaining digits and the number of moves each has made so far. \n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. The state would be determined by the current position in the string (i.e., how many digits have been taken already), and the count of H and M moves made so far. \n\nBut wait, since the number of digits is 2n, and each move takes one digit, the state can be represented by the number of digits taken so far (let's say k), and the number of H moves made so far (h). Because the number of M moves is then k - h. But since each player must make exactly n moves, the total number of moves is 2n. So for the state, we can track how many H's have been chosen so far, and how many digits have been processed. \n\nAt each step, when there are k digits processed, the next move can be either H or M, provided that the number of H's doesn't exceed n and the number of M's doesn't exceed n. \n\nSo, for example, if we have processed k digits, and have h H's so far, then the next move can be H only if h < n, and M only if (k - h) < n (since M's count is (k - h) so far, and needs to be <=n). \n\nThe DP approach would be to memoize the maximum sum achievable from a given state (k, h). \n\nLet me think about the transitions. For each state (k, h), we can choose to take H or M. Let's say the current digit is A[k], because the first digit is taken at position 0. Wait, the initial A is a string of 2n digits. For example, in the sample input, the first example is '1234', n=2. So the digits are 1,2,3,4. The first move takes the first digit (1). \n\nSo, the state is determined by how many digits have been taken so far (k). For each k, the next digit to take is the (k)th digit in the original string. Wait, no. If k digits have been taken, then the next digit is the (k)th index (assuming zero-based). For example, initially, k=0, and the first digit is A[0]. \n\nSo, for each state (k, h), the next digit is A[k], and the choice is to take it as H or M. \n\nBut how do we compute the sum? Well, the sum is the sum of all digits taken by H and M. However, each digit's contribution depends on its position in their respective numbers. Wait, no! Wait, the problem says that the first player gets S1 dollars, which is the number formed by the digits he took. Similarly for S2. So the sum is S1 + S2. \n\nBut how do we compute that? For example, if Homer takes digits in positions 0 and 1, then his number is (digit0 * 10^1 + digit1 * 10^0). Similarly for Marge. But the sum depends on the order in which they take the digits. \n\nWait, but the problem says that each time a player takes a digit, it's added to their number. So for example, the first digit taken by Homer becomes the first digit of his number. Then, the next digit he takes is added to the right. So the value of his number is the digits in the order they were taken, multiplied by 10^... \n\nSo the sum S1 + S2 is the sum of the numbers formed by the digits each player took, in the order they were taken. \n\nBut this complicates the DP, because the contribution of a digit depends on its position in the player's number. For example, if Homer takes a digit at step i (when he has taken m digits before), then this digit contributes digit * 10^{n - m - 1} to his total. Wait, no. Because the number of digits he has is n, and the first digit he takes is the first digit of his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, then the next by 10^{n-2}, etc. \n\nWait, but when you take digits, each time you add to the end of your number. So the first digit taken by Homer is the first digit of S1, then the second is the second, etc. So the value of S1 is the sum of (digit_i * 10^{n - 1 - pos}), where pos is the position in which the digit was taken (0-based). For example, if Homer takes 3 digits, and the digits are [d0, d1, d2], then S1 is d0*100 + d1*10 + d2*1. \n\nSo, for each digit that a player takes, the contribution depends on when they take it. For example, if a player takes a digit as their m-th move (m starts at 0?), then the contribution is digit * 10^{n - 1 - m}. \n\nTherefore, the DP approach must track not just the current state (number of digits taken, and number of H moves taken), but also the current value of S1 and S2. But that's impossible for n up to 18, since 2n is 36 digits, and each S1 and S2 can be up to 1e36, which is way too big to track in a DP state. \n\nSo this suggests that a straightforward DP approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative idea: Since the sum S1 + S2 is the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values. For example, each digit is part of either S1 or S2, and its contribution depends on the position in which it was taken by the player. \n\nBut how can we model this? For each digit in the original A, when it's taken by a player, it's added to their number. The place value depends on the order in which the player took the digits. \n\nFor example, if a digit is taken by Homer as his k-th move (where k ranges from 0 to n-1), then it contributes digit * 10^{n-1 -k} to S1. Similarly for Marge. \n\nSo, the total sum is the sum over all digits of (digit * 10^{p} ), where p depends on which player took it and when. \n\nBut how to maximize this sum? \n\nThe problem reduces to assigning each digit to either Homer or Marge, with exactly n digits assigned to each, and for each player, the digits assigned to them are ordered in the order they were taken. The contribution of each digit is digit * 10^{ (player's number of digits - 1 - their order of taking) }.\n\nBut since the order of taking is determined by the sequence of choices, the position in which the digit is taken by the player depends on when they took it. \n\nFor example, suppose Homer takes a digit in the first move. Then, that digit is his first digit (position 0 in his number). If he takes another digit in his second move, that is position 1. \n\nSo, for each digit in the original A, the position in which it is taken by the player depends on the order of the moves. \n\nBut this seems very complex to model. How can we find the optimal assignment of digits to players and their order of taking? \n\nAlternative approach: Since the order of taking digits affects the place value, perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign the digits to the player who can get the maximum possible value for that digit. \n\nBut how? For example, a higher digit should be placed in the higher place value of either S1 or S2. \n\nBut the problem is that the place value depends on when the digit is taken. For instance, if a digit is taken early (as the first move of a player), it contributes more to the total sum than if it's taken later. \n\nSo, for each digit, we want to assign it to the player (H or M) such that the digit is placed in the highest possible place value. However, since each player has exactly n digits, and the order of taking is determined by the sequence of choices, this seems like a problem where we need to greedily assign the digits. \n\nBut how to model that? \n\nWait, think recursively. Suppose that we have a certain number of digits left to assign to H and M. Let's say that currently, Homer has taken h digits, and Marge has taken m digits. The next digit to take is the current first digit of A. We need to decide whether to assign it to H or M, considering that this choice will affect the place value of that digit. \n\nFor example, if we assign it to H now, then this digit will be in the (h+1)-th position of H's number. Wait, no. If Homer has already taken h digits, then taking this digit would be his (h+1)th move. Since he needs to take exactly n digits, the place value of this digit is 10^{n - (h+1)}? Or 10^{n - 1 - h}? \n\nYes. Because the first digit he takes is at position 0 (h=0), contributing 10^{n-1 -0} = 10^{n-1}. The second digit (h=1) contributes 10^{n-1 -1} = 10^{n-2}, etc. So when he takes the digit as his k-th move (k starts from 0 to n-1), the place value is 10^{n-1 -k}.\n\nSo, if currently Homer has taken h digits, then taking this digit would be his h-th move (since after taking, h increases by 1). Wait, no. Suppose he has taken h digits so far. Then, if he takes this digit, that's his (h+1)th move. But since he can take exactly n digits, h+1 <=n. \n\nSo, the place value of this digit would be 10^{n-1 - h}, since h is the number of digits he has taken before this move. \n\nSimilarly for Marge. \n\nSo, for each decision point, the current state is:\n\n- How many digits have been taken so far (k). Since the digits are processed in order, k is equal to the number of moves made so far. So, k = h + m, where h is the number of H moves taken so far, and m is the number of M moves taken so far. \n\nBut since each move takes one digit, the current digit to process is A[k], which is the (k)th digit of the original string. \n\nSo, the state can be represented by (h, m), but since m = k - h, and k = h + m, maybe we can just track h and the current position k. Wait, since k = h + m, and since m = (number of M moves taken so far). But since each move is either H or M, the total number of moves is k = h + m. \n\nBut since the total number of moves is 2n, and for the problem, we need to have h = n and m = n at the end. \n\nSo, the state can be represented by (current number of H moves taken, current number of M moves taken). But since m = k - h, where k is the number of moves so far (k = h + m). Alternatively, since k is the number of digits processed so far, and the next digit is A[k], we can track the state as (h, k). Because m is k - h. \n\nBut for the state, h can range from 0 to n, and k can range from 0 to 2n. However, since k must be equal to h + m, and m can't exceed n. So, for each k, h can be from max(0, k - n) to min(n, k). \n\nBut regardless, the state can be represented by (h, k). However, since k is h + m, and m can be derived from k and h, perhaps it's better to track (h, k). \n\nBut for the DP, perhaps the key is to track how many H moves have been made so far, and how many digits have been processed. \n\nThe DP function would be something like: dp(h, k) = maximum total sum achievable from this state onwards. \n\nAt each state (h, k), the next digit is A[k], and the options are:\n\n- If h < n, take this digit as H. Then, the contribution is digit * 10^{n-1 - h} (since this is the h-th move for H, so the exponent is n-1 - h). Then, the next state is (h+1, k+1).\n\n- If (k - h) < n (i.e., m = k - h < n), take this digit as M. Then, the contribution is digit * 10^{n-1 - (m)} where m is the number of M moves taken so far. Wait, m is k - h. Because m = (number of M moves taken so far) = (number of moves taken so far) - h = k - h. \n\nSo, when taking this digit as M, the number of M moves taken so far is m = k - h. Taking this digit as M would be the (m+1)th move for M. Therefore, the exponent is n-1 - m. \n\nSo, the contribution for this digit is digit * 10^{n-1 - (m)} = digit * 10^{n-1 - (k - h)}. \n\nSo, the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp(h, k) = max( \n\n   (digit * 10^{n-1 - h} ) + dp(h+1, k+1), \n\n   (digit * 10^{n-1 - (k - h)} ) + dp(h, k+1) \n\n)\n\nBut this is only if the respective options are available (i.e., h < n for the first option, and (k - h) < n for the second option). \n\nThe base case is when k = 2n. Then, there are no more digits to take, and the sum is 0. \n\nBut wait, the base case is when k reaches 2n. However, since each player must make exactly n moves, the DP is only valid for states where h <=n and (k - h) <=n, and at the end, when k=2n, h must be exactly n. \n\nSo, the DP approach is feasible. However, the problem is that for n=18, the maximum k is 36, and h can be up to 18. So the number of states is (n+1) * (2n + 1) = 19 * 37 = 703 for n=18. That's manageable. \n\nBut what about the memoization? For each state (h, k), we need to compute the maximum sum possible from that state. \n\nBut the problem is that the exponents can be very large. For example, 10^{n-1} could be up to 1e17, but since n is 18, 10^17 is manageable as a Python integer. However, for n=18, the maximum value of the sum would be 2* (10^18 - 1) * 1e18, which is way larger than 1e36, but Python can handle big integers. \n\nBut for memoization, the DP can be implemented with memoization. \n\nBut how to compute the 10^{n-1 - h} terms? Well, precompute the powers of 10 for each possible exponent. \n\nWait, for each possible h (from 0 to n) and m (from 0 to n), the exponents would be up to n-1. So for example, for Homer's moves, the exponent is n-1 - h, where h ranges from 0 to n-1. Similarly for Marge's moves, the exponent is n-1 - m, where m ranges from 0 to n-1. \n\nSo, for each possible position, we can precompute the power of 10. \n\nBut even without precomputing, for each state, we can calculate it on the fly. \n\nNow, the problem is that the DP needs to return not only the maximum sum, but also the path (the sequence of choices) that leads to that maximum sum. \n\nBut for the problem, we need to reconstruct the path. So, during the DP computation, we need to track not only the maximum sum but also the choice made (H or M) that led to that maximum. \n\nSo, the DP can be memoized with memoization of the best sum and the choice (H or M) that leads to it. \n\nBut for Python, memoization can be done with lru_cache, but since n can be up to 18, and the parameters h and k are small, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the digits are processed in order, and for each state (h, k), the digit is A[k]. \n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem would be:\n\n1. Precompute the digits of A as a list of integers. \n\n2. Implement a recursive DP function with memoization that, given h (number of H moves so far) and k (number of digits processed so far), returns the maximum sum possible and the choice (H or M) to take next. \n\n3. The base case is when k == 2n. In this case, the sum is 0. \n\n4. For each state (h, k), check if we can take H or M. \n\n   a. For H: if h < n. The contribution is digit * 10^{n-1 - h} plus the result of dp(h+1, k+1). \n\n   b. For M: if (k - h) < n. The contribution is digit * 10^{n-1 - (k - h)} plus the result of dp(h, k+1). \n\n5. Choose the option (H or M) that gives the higher sum. If both options are possible and give the same sum, choose either (the problem allows any of them). \n\nOnce the DP is computed, we can reconstruct the path by starting from (h=0, k=0) and making the choices. \n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nFirst, the digits can be stored as a list. Let's say, for the input A, we have a string, and digits = [int(c) for c in A].\n\nThen, the DP function can be memoized. However, in Python, for memoization with mutable parameters, we can use lru_cache with parameters converted to tuples. \n\nBut since n can be up to 18, and k can be up to 36, and h up to 18, the number of states is manageable. \n\nBut for the DP function, we need to return both the maximum sum and the choice. However, in Python, memoization with lru_cache can only return one value. So, perhaps we can split into two functions: one that returns the maximum sum, and another that reconstructs the path. \n\nAlternatively, during the DP, for each state, we can store the best choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum. \n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to first compute the DP table (the maximum sum for each state), and then reconstruct the path based on the choices made. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a memoization-based DP to compute the maximum sum for each state (h, k). Then, once the DP is filled, we can backtrack from (h=0, k=0) to build the sequence of choices. \n\nLet me think about how to code this. \n\nFirst, the digits are stored as a list. Let's say, digits = list(map(int, A_str)).\n\nThe DP function can be memoized. Let's write it as a recursive function. \n\nBut for memoization, in Python, using lru_cache with parameters h and k. \n\nBut since the digits are fixed, and the function depends on the current h and k, the function can be written as follows:\n\ndef dp(h, k):\n\n    if k == 2n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if memo contains (h, k):\n\n        return memo[(h, k)]\n\n    current_digit = digits[k]\n\n    max_sum = -infinity\n\n    choice = ''\n\n    # option to take H\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h))\n\n        next_sum = dp(h + 1, k + 1)\n\n        total = contribution_h + next_sum\n\n        if total > max_sum:\n\n            max_sum = total\n\n            choice = 'H'\n\n    # option to take M\n\n    m = k - h\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m))\n\n        next_sum = dp(h, k + 1)\n\n        total = contribution_m + next_sum\n\n        if total > max_sum:\n\n            max_sum = total\n\n            choice = 'M'\n\n    # if both options are possible and equal, choose one (e.g., prefer H?)\n\n    # but in the code, the first option (H) is checked first, so if both are equal, it will choose H. \n\n    memo[(h, k)] = (max_sum, choice)\n\n    return max_sum\n\nWait, but the memo would need to store the maximum sum and the choice. However, in Python, using memoization, perhaps it's better to split into two functions. \n\nAlternatively, for each state (h, k), we can compute the maximum sum, and then during backtracking, determine which choice (H or M) was taken. \n\nSo, first, we need to compute the maximum sum for each state. Once that is done, during backtracking, for each state (h, k), we check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the maximum sum for each state (h, k) using DP.\n\n2. Reconstruct the path by starting from (h=0, k=0) and at each step, choosing H or M based on which option gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum sum? Let's proceed with memoization. \n\nIn Python, for memoization, we can use lru_cache with a helper function. However, since n can be up to 18, and the digits are known, the function can be written as follows:\n\nBut the problem is that for the DP, the function needs to know the digits and the value of n. So, perhaps the code can be structured with a class or with the digits and n as global variables. \n\nBut in Python, for code submission, it's easier to use memoization with parameters. \n\nBut here's an alternative approach. Let's implement the DP with memoization using a memo table. \n\nBut for Python, recursion with memoization may hit stack limits for some cases, but for n=18, the depth is up to 36 steps, so it's manageable. \n\nSo, here's the code outline:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = list of integers of A.\n\nCompute memo as a dictionary, or use lru_cache.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using memoization via lru_cache with parameters h and k. \n\nBut since the digits are fixed, the function can be written as a nested function inside the main code. \n\nNow, the code for the DP function:\n\nBut for the exponents, 10 ** (n - 1 - h) can be precomputed, but for each call, it's easy to compute. \n\nBut for n up to 18, 10 ** (17) is manageable. \n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, recursion with memoization may be slow for some cases, but for n=18, 2n=36, and states (h, k) where h ranges from 0 to n, and k ranges from 0 to 2n, the number of states is O(n * 2n) = O(36*18) = 648 for n=18, which is very manageable. \n\nSo, the code can proceed with memoization. \n\nOnce the DP is computed, we need to reconstruct the path. \n\nReconstruction:\n\nStart with h=0, k=0. The sequence is built step by step. At each step, for the current state (h, k), check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum. \n\nBut how to know which choice was taken? Well, during the DP computation, we can track for each state (h, k) which choice (H or M) was selected. \n\nAlternatively, during reconstruction, for each (h, k), we can compute the possible options and see which one gives the maximum sum. \n\nBut since the DP function returns the maximum sum for a state, during reconstruction, for each (h, k), we can check both possibilities (if allowed) and see which one gives the same maximum sum. \n\nSo, during reconstruction:\n\nInitialize the result as an empty string.\n\ncurrent_h = 0\n\ncurrent_k = 0\n\nfor _ in range(2n):\n\n    check if taking H is possible and if it leads to the maximum sum.\n\n    if taking H is possible:\n\n        compute the sum if we take H: contribution_h + dp(h+1, k+1)\n\n    similarly for M. \n\n    choose the option with higher sum. \n\nBut this would require recomputing the DP for each step. Which is not efficient. \n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can store for each state (h, k) the choice that was made (H or M). \n\nThus, during the DP computation, for each state, we can store not only the maximum sum but also the choice made. \n\nSo, modifying the DP function to return both the maximum sum and the choice. \n\nBut in Python, memoization can be done with a memo table that stores tuples (max_sum, choice). \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nLet me think of writing a memoization function. \n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nWe can use memoization with lru_cache, but since the function returns both the maximum sum and the choice, perhaps we can split into two functions: one for computing the maximum sum, and another for tracking the choices. \n\nAlternatively, during the DP, for each state (h, k), we can store the best choice. \n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to first compute the DP table for the maximum sum, and then during backtracking, for each state, check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum. \n\nSo, for example, during the backtracking phase, for a given state (h, k), the current digit is digits[k]. \n\nIf the maximum sum for (h, k) is equal to the contribution from taking H plus the maximum sum of (h+1, k+1), then the choice is H. Otherwise, it's M. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nLet me think. For the current state (h, k), the maximum sum is:\n\nmax_sum = max( (option H sum), (option M sum) )\n\nSo during backtracking, we can compute for both options and see which one matches the max_sum. \n\nBut this requires recomputing the option sums. However, since the DP table is already computed, this is feasible. \n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the DP table is filled with maximum sums, then during backtracking:\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent_h = 0\n\ncurrent_k = 0\n\nfor _ in range(2n):\n\n    current_digit = digits[current_k]\n\n    # check if taking H is possible and gives the maximum sum\n\n    option_h_possible = current_h < n\n\n    option_m_possible = (current_k - current_h) < n\n\n    # compute the possible options\n\n    max_sum = dp_table[current_h][current_k]\n\n    # check if H is possible\n\n    if option_h_possible:\n\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - current_h))\n\n        next_sum_h = dp_table[current_h + 1][current_k + 1]\n\n        if contribution_h + next_sum_h == max_sum:\n\n            result.append('H')\n\n            current_h += 1\n\n            current_k += 1\n\n            continue\n\n    # else, check M\n\n    if option_m_possible:\n\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - (current_k - current_h)))\n\n        next_sum_m = dp_table[current_h][current_k + 1]\n\n        if contribution_m + next_sum_m == max_sum:\n\n            result.append('M')\n\n            current_k += 1\n\n            continue\n\n    # This should not happen, since the DP table is filled correctly.\n\nBut how to compute the dp_table? \n\nThe dp_table can be a 2D array where dp_table[h][k] is the maximum sum achievable from state (h, k). \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nWe can compute it using memoization with recursion, or using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach. \n\nFor bottom-up approach, since the state (h, k) depends on (h+1, k+1) and (h, k+1), we can fill the table in reverse order. \n\nThe base case is when k = 2n, then dp_table[h][k] = 0. \n\nFor other states, we compute the maximum between the possible options. \n\nBut for bottom-up, the order of filling the table is important. Since for a state (h, k), the next states are (h+1, k+1) and (h, k+1). So, we need to process the states in order of decreasing k. \n\nFor example, for k from 2n-1 down to 0. \n\nSo, the bottom-up approach can be implemented as follows:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (2n + 1). \n\nfor h in 0 ... n:\n\n    for k in 2n ... 0:\n\n        if k == 2n:\n\n            dp[h][k] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = digits[k]\n\n            max_sum = -infinity\n\n            # option H\n\n            if h < n:\n\n                contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n-1 - h))\n\n                next_sum = dp[h+1][k+1]\n\n                total = contribution_h + next_sum\n\n                if total > max_sum:\n\n                    max_sum = total\n\n            # option M\n\n            m = k - h\n\n            if m < n:\n\n                contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n-1 - m))\n\n                next_sum = dp[h][k+1]\n\n                total = contribution_m + next_sum\n\n                if total > max_sum:\n\n                    max_sum = total\n\n            dp[h][k] = max_sum\n\nBut wait, for the bottom-up approach, the order of processing k is from high to low. Because for a given k, the value of dp[h][k] depends on dp[h+1][k+1] and dp[h][k+1], which are for higher k. \n\nSo, for k in range(2n-1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in 0 ... n:\n\n        compute dp[h][k]\n\nThis way, when we compute dp[h][k], the values for k+1 are already computed. \n\nYes. \n\nOnce the dp table is filled, then we can proceed to reconstruct the path. \n\nNow, the code can be written in Python with this approach. \n\nBut for n up to 18, and 2n=36, the dp table will be (n+1) x (2n + 1) = 19 x 37 = 703 entries, which is manageable. \n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n from input. Read A as a string. \n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nThen, create a 2D array dp, with dimensions (n+1) x (2n + 1). \n\nBut since n can be up to 18, 2n is 36. So, for h from 0 to n (inclusive), and k from 0 to 2n (inclusive). \n\nBut in Python, initializing a 2D array can be done with a list of lists. \n\nThen, fill the dp table as described. \n\nOnce the dp table is filled, reconstruct the path. \n\nReconstruction steps:\n\nInitialize current_h = 0, current_k = 0. \n\nresult = []\n\nfor _ in range(2n):\n\n    current_digit = digits[current_k]\n\n    # check possible options\n\n    option_h_possible = current_h < n\n\n    option_m_possible = (current_k - current_h) < n\n\n    # compute max_sum from dp[current_h][current_k]\n\n    max_sum = dp[current_h][current_k]\n\n    # check H first\n\n    if option_h_possible:\n\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - current_h))\n\n        next_sum_h = dp[current_h + 1][current_k + 1]\n\n        if contribution_h + next_sum_h == max_sum:\n\n            result.append('H')\n\n            current_h += 1\n\n            current_k += 1\n\n            continue\n\n    # else check M\n\n    if option_m_possible:\n\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - (current_k - current_h)))\n\n        next_sum_m = dp[current_h][current_k + 1]\n\n        if contribution_m + next_sum_m == max_sum:\n\n            result.append('M')\n\n            current_k += 1\n\n            continue\n\n    # shouldn't reach here\n\nOnce the result list is built, output ''.join(result). \n\nBut what about when there are multiple options with the same max_sum? For example, if both H and M lead to the same sum. In this case, the code chooses H first. \n\nBut the problem allows any of the possible sequences. \n\nNow, the code for the bottom-up DP:\n\nBut in Python, the exponents can be precomputed. However, for each h and m, the exponents can be calculated as needed. \n\nBut for the code, the exponents can be calculated on the fly. \n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for n up to 18, 10^(n-1) can be up to 1e17, which is manageable. \n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\ndigits = [1,2,3,4]\n\nn=2.\n\nThe dp table for h from 0 to 2, k from 0 to 4 (since 2n=4).\n\nLet's think of the bottom-up approach. \n\nFor k=4 (which is 2n), dp[h][4] = 0 for all h.\n\nThen, for k=3:\n\nfor h in 0..2:\n\nLet's take h=0, k=3. \n\ncurrent_digit = 4.\n\noption H: h=0 < 2. contribution_h is 4 * 10^(2-1 - 0) = 4 * 10^1 = 40. next_sum is dp[1][4] = 0. total is 40. \n\noption M: m = 3 - 0 = 3. m < 2? No. So option M not possible. So dp[0][3] = 40. \n\nSimilarly, for h=1, k=3. \n\ncurrent_digit is 4. \n\noption H: h=1 <2. contribution_h = 4 * 10^(2-1 -1) = 4*10^0 =4. next_sum is dp[2][4] =0. total 4. \n\noption M: m=3-1=2 <2? No. So dp[1][3] =4. \n\nh=2, k=3: h is 2, which is equal to n=2. So option H is not possible. \n\nm=3-2=1 <2. So option M. contribution_m is 4 * 10^(2-1 -1) = 4*10^0=4. next_sum is dp[2][4]=0. total 4. \n\nSo dp[2][3] =4. \n\nThen, for k=2:\n\ncurrent_digit is 3. \n\nLet's take h=0, k=2. \n\noption H: possible. contribution is 3*10^(1) =30. next_sum is dp[1",
