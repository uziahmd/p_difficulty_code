She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So, the goal is to figure out the optimal steps to do this as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. All tabs are open, and the cursor is at pos. We need to close tabs not in [l, r]. So, the tabs that need to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], maybe there's no need to do anything. Wait, but maybe not. Because if l is 2 and r is 4, and the current position is 3, then closing tabs to the left and right would require moving to certain positions. But if the entire segment [l, r] is already open, but there are tabs outside that need to be closed. So, the steps would involve closing all tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nBut how to get to the positions where you can close those tabs. Let's break it down.\n\nThe process might involve:\n\n1. Moving to the leftmost tab (l) and closing all tabs to the left of it.\n2. Then moving to the rightmost tab (r) and closing all tabs to the right of it.\n\nOr maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps. Alternatively, perhaps we can close the left side first, then the right, or vice versa. But how does the movement work?\n\nWait, when you close tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of the unclosed tabs) change. For example, if you close all tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current position + 1? No, wait. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe note says that after closing some tabs, a and b are the min and max of the remaining tabs. For example, if initially there were 7 tabs and tabs 1, 2, 7 are closed, then a=3, b=6. So, when you close tabs, the a and b adjust accordingly. However, when you close tabs, the movement is constrained by the current a and b.\n\nBut in this problem, the initial state is all tabs open, and the process is to close tabs. So, during the process, the a and b are initially 1 and n. But once you close some tabs, they change. However, since the problem requires closing all tabs outside [l, r], the final a and b should be l and r. But during the process, the steps must be done in such a way that the closing operations are allowed.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is to first close all tabs to the left of l, then close all tabs to the right of r. Or the other way around. But how to reach the positions where you can perform these operations.\n\nLet me consider the steps required for closing the left part. To close all tabs to the left of l, you need to be at position l. Because when you are at position l, you can close all tabs to the left of it (i.e., from a to l-1). Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, you need to be at position r.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Move from the initial position to l. Then close left. Then move from l to r. Then close right. Or maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can first close the right side, then the left. But the movement steps would vary depending on the positions.\n\nBut what if l is already to the left of the current position? Let's take the first example input:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo the desired tabs are 2,3,4. The initial position is 3. So, the left part is tabs 1, which needs to be closed. The right part is tabs 5,6.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\nMove to 2 (from 3, takes 1 second). Then close all left (tabs 1). Then move to 4 (from 2, takes 2 seconds). Then close all right (tabs 5,6). So total steps: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4? But the example output is 5. Wait, the sample explanation says that the steps are:\n\nshift to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec?), then shift to 3 (another sec?), then to 4 (another), then close right (another). Wait, maybe each action is one second. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nEach second, she can do one of the following actions:\n\n- move left or right (each takes one second)\n- close all tabs to left or right (each takes one second)\n\nSo, the steps in the first example:\n\nShe starts at 3.\n\nShe moves to 2 (1 sec). Then closes left (1 sec). Now, the tabs to the left of 2 (which is 1) are closed. Now, the a is 2, b is 6. Now, she needs to close tabs to the right of 4. So, she needs to be at 4. So from 2, she can move to 3 (1 sec), then to 4 (another sec). Then close right (1 sec). So that's 1 (move) + 1 (close left) + 2 (moves) + 1 (close right) = total 5 seconds. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the total steps are:\n\nTime to move to l (if needed) + 1 (close left) + time to move from l to r (if needed) + 1 (close right). But maybe there are cases where you can do it more efficiently.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, the second sample input: 6 3 1 3. The desired segment is 1-3. The initial position is 3. So, she can just close all tabs to the right (since the current position is 3, and the tabs to the right are 4,5,6. So she can close them in 1 second. Hence the output is 1.\n\nAnother example: third input is 5 2 1 5. So all tabs are kept. So no need to do anything. Output is 0.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nWe need to check whether the current position is already in the [l, r] range. If not, then we need to move to the correct positions.\n\nBut the key is to find the minimal steps required to close the left and right parts. Let's think about the steps required:\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. Then nothing to do. So answer is 0.\n\nElse, we need to close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r).\n\nBut to close the left part, you need to be at l. To close the right part, you need to be at r.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Move from pos to l (if needed). Then close left (cost 1 sec).\n- Then move from l to r (cost |r - l| seconds). Then close right (cost 1 sec).\n\nOR:\n\n- Move from pos to r (if needed). Then close right (cost 1 sec).\n- Then move from r to l (cost |r - l| seconds). Then close left (cost 1 sec).\n\nWhich of these options is better? Well, the total steps would be:\n\nOption 1: steps to move to l + 1 (close left) + steps from l to r + 1 (close right) = (steps to l) + (steps from l to r) + 2.\n\nOption 2: steps to move to r + 1 (close right) + steps from r to l + 1 (close left) = (steps to r) + (steps from r to l) + 2.\n\nBut steps from l to r is |r - l|. Same as steps from r to l. So the difference between option 1 and option 2 is the steps to reach l vs steps to reach r.\n\nSo, which is better? Well, the minimal between the two options.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility: maybe you can close left and right in some other order, but perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range. Then, maybe you can close left and right in one step each.\n\nWait, suppose that the current position is in [l, r]. Let's say l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then to close the left part, you need to be at l=2. So you need to move from 3 to 2 (cost 1). Close left (cost 1). Then move from 2 to 4 (cost 2), close right (cost 1). Total 1+1+2+1 = 5 steps. But maybe there's a better way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can first close the right part. Let's see: move from 3 to 4 (cost 1), close right (tabs 5,6, etc. if any). Then move from 4 to 2 (cost 2), close left. That's same steps: 1+1+2+1 = 5. So same total.\n\nBut what if l is 2, r is 5, and pos is 3. Then, the steps would be:\n\nMove to 2 (cost 1), close left (1). Then move to 5 (cost 3), close right (1). Total 1+1+3+1=6 steps. Or move to 5 first (cost 2), close right (1), then move to 2 (cost 3), close left (1). Total 2+1+3+1=7 steps. So the first option is better.\n\nThus, the optimal approach is to choose the minimal between moving to l first or moving to r first. But in some cases, maybe it's possible to do both steps in a way that overlaps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are:\n\nIf the initial position is already in the [l, r] range, then the steps to reach l and r can be optimized. For example, if pos is in [l, r], then moving to l requires (pos - l) steps, and moving to r requires (r - pos) steps. So, the total steps for moving to l and then to r is (pos - l) + (r - l) steps. But if you first move to r, then to l, it's (r - pos) + (r - l) steps. Which is better depends on whether pos is closer to l or r.\n\nBut in terms of the overall steps, the total steps for the two options (close left first or right first) would be:\n\nOption 1: (steps to reach l) + (steps from l to r) + 2.\n\nOption 2: (steps to reach r) + (steps from r to l) + 2.\n\nSince steps from l to r is (r - l), and steps from r to l is same. So, the difference between the options is steps to reach l vs steps to reach r.\n\nSo, the minimal between (steps to l) and (steps to r) would determine which option is better. So, the total steps would be min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but steps_to_l is the steps needed to move from pos to l. How is that calculated?\n\nWell, the steps to move from pos to l is |pos - l|. Because you can move one step at a time. Similarly for steps to r.\n\nBut wait, in the case where l is to the left of pos, and r is to the right of pos. For example, if pos is in the middle of l and r. Then, moving to l and then to r would take (pos - l) + (r - l) steps. But moving to r first and then to l would take (r - pos) + (r - l) steps. Which is larger?\n\nDepends on whether pos is closer to l or r.\n\nBut in any case, the minimal between steps to l and steps to r would be the best choice.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at l? Then steps to l is 0. Then, steps to r would be r - l. So total steps would be 0 + (r - l) + 2 = r - l + 2.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at r? Then steps to r is 0, and steps to l is r - l. So same total.\n\nSo, the overall formula would be:\n\nIf l == 1 and r == n: 0 steps.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to calculate the steps required to close the left and right parts.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in [l, r]?\n\nIn that case, the steps to reach l is |pos - l|, and steps to reach r is |pos - r|.\n\nBut then, the total steps would be min( (steps to l) + (r - l) + 2, (steps to r) + (r - l) + 2 ) ?\n\nWait, no. Because in the case of moving to l first, steps to l is |pos - l|. Then, moving from l to r is (r - l) steps. Then, closing left and right takes 2 seconds. So total steps is (|pos - l| + (r - l) + 2).\n\nSimilarly, for moving to r first, steps is (|pos - r| + (r - l) + 2).\n\nBut why is that? Because the movement steps are |pos - l|, then movement from l to r is (r - l) steps, and then two closing steps. So the total steps is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut then, perhaps there's a better way. For example, if the initial position is already at l, then moving to l takes zero steps. Then moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps. Then two closes. So total is (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at r? Then steps to r is zero. Then moving from r to l is (r - l) steps. Then two closes. So same total.\n\nBut what about when l and r are adjacent? Like l=2, r=3. Then steps would be |pos - l| + 1 + 2 = |pos - l| + 3.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if the initial position is at l. Then you can close left (but there's nothing to the left of l, so maybe that's not needed). Wait, no. Because the left part is tabs less than l. So if l is 2, then closing tabs to the left of l (i.e., tab 1). So to close that, you have to be at l (2) and close left. So even if you are already at l, you need to perform that step.\n\nBut what if l is 1? Then there are no tabs to the left of l. So in that case, you don't need to close anything on the left. Similarly for r = n.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether l is 1 or not. If l is 1, then we don't need to close any tabs on the left. Similarly, if r is n, no need to close on the right.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps can be broken down into:\n\n- Need to close left? (if l > 1)\n- Need to close right? (if r < n)\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nIf l > 1: then need to move to l and close left. The steps for that are steps to reach l, plus 1 second for closing.\n\nIf r < n: then need to move to r and close right. The steps for that are steps to reach r (from previous position) plus 1 second for closing.\n\nBut the problem is that the order of closing left and right affects the steps. For example, if you close left first, then the movement to reach r is from l, but if you close right first, movement to reach l is from r.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be:\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed:\n\nmin( (steps to reach l) + (steps from l to r) + 2, (steps to reach r) + (steps from r to l) + 2 )\n\nBut steps from l to r is (r - l), steps from r to l is (r - l). So the difference is steps to reach l vs steps to reach r.\n\nSo, the total steps is min( steps_to_l, steps_to_r ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut steps_to_l is |pos - l|, steps_to_r is |pos - r|.\n\nWait, but if you choose to go to l first, then steps_to_l is |pos - l|. Then from l to r is (r - l) steps. Then you close right (1 sec). So total steps is steps_to_l + (r - l) + 1 + 1 = steps_to_l + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, if you choose to go to r first, steps_to_r + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo, the minimal between these two options is min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if l is 1 and r is n? Then no steps needed. So that's a special case.\n\nBut what if l is 1, but r < n? Then, we need to close the right part. So steps_to_r is |pos - r|. Then, close right (1 sec). So total steps is steps_to_r + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if r is n, but l > 1: steps_to_l + 1.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate the steps required for closing left and/or right.\n\nLet's think of the four possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Need to close left (l > 1) and need to close right (r < n).\n\nThen, the steps are min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nCase 2: Need to close left only (l > 1, r == n). Steps: steps_to_l + 1.\n\nCase 3: Need to close right only (r < n, l == 1). Steps: steps_to_r + 1.\n\nCase 4: No need to close either (l == 1 and r == n). Steps: 0.\n\nBut what if l is 1 and r is less than n? Then, you need to close right. So steps_to_r + 1.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at r? Then steps_to_r is 0, so total steps is 1.\n\nBut how to compute steps_to_l and steps_to_r?\n\nsteps_to_l = |pos - l|.\n\nsteps_to_r = |pos - r|.\n\nBut let's think of the first example:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nl is not 1, r is not 6. So case 1 applies.\n\nsteps_to_l is |3-2|=1.\n\nsteps_to_r is |3-4|=1.\n\nso min(1, 1) = 1. Then (4-2)=2. So total steps is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '6 3 1 3'. So l is 1, r is 3. Since r < n (6), we need to close right. So steps_to_r is |3 - 3| = 0. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: '5 2 1 5' → l is 1, r is 5. So case 4: 0 steps.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. So no steps needed. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So r < n. So steps_to_r is |2 - 3| = 1. So steps is 1 + 1 = 2. But wait, is that correct?\n\nLet's think: the user needs to close tabs to the right of 3 (tabs 4,5). To do that, she needs to be at 3. She is currently at 2. So she needs to move to 3 (1 sec), then close right (1 sec). Total 2 seconds. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=3, r=4. So l>1 and r <n. So steps_to_l is |2-3| = 1. steps_to_r is |2-4|=2. min(1,2) is 1. (r-l) is 1. So total steps 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Let's see:\n\nClose left first: move to l (3) from 2: 1 sec. Close left (tabs 1 and 2). Now, a is 3, b is 5. Then move from 3 to 4 (1 sec). Close right (tabs 5). So total steps 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n → case 1.\n\nElse if l > 1 → case 2 (only left to close).\n\nElse if r < n → case 3 (only right to close).\n\nElse → case 4 (already handled).\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = (l > 1)\n\n    need_right = (r < n)\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        steps_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n        steps_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n        min_steps = min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r)\n\n        total = min_steps + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif need_right:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible, since l == 1 and r == n is already handled\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what about when l is 1 and need to close right? For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. Then steps_to_r is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input where the output was 1. Input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3, n=6. So need_right is True. steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3. steps_to_r is |2-3|=1, steps is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nLike, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So need to close right (tabs 4,5). steps_to_r is |3-3| = 0. steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, n=5, pos=3. So need_left (2>1) and need_right (4<5). steps_to_l is 1, steps_to_r is 1. min is 1. r - l = 2. total is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the first example.\n\nBut what about when the current position is outside the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, n=6, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6). So steps_to_l is |1-2|=1. steps_to_r is |1-4|=3. min is 1. r - l is 2. total is 1+2+2=5 steps.\n\nHow would that work? Let's see:\n\nMove to l=2 (1 sec). Close left (tabs 1). Then move to r=4 (2 steps). Close right (1 sec). Total steps 1+1+2+1 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is 5, l=2, r=4. So steps_to_l is 5-2=3, steps_to_r is 5-4=1. So min is 1. So total is 1 + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So steps would be:\n\nMove to r (4) from 5: 1 sec. Close right (tabs 5,6?), but wait, r is 4, and n is 6. So closing right would close tabs 5 and 6. Then, need to move from 4 to l=2 (steps 2). Then close left (tabs 1). So total steps: 1 (move to r) + 1 (close right) + 2 (move to l) + 1 (close left) = 5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is n-1? Then need_right is true. So steps is steps_to_r + 1.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Then output 0.\n\nBut what if l is 1, r is n, but pos is somewhere else? Well, the code checks for l ==1 and r ==n, so output 0.\n\nSo, the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input: n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the input is given as four integers. For example, the first sample input is '6 3 2 4', which is n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the line as input, split into four integers.\n\nThen:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = l > 1\n\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        steps_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n        steps_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n        min_steps = min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r)\n\n        total = min_steps + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif need_right:\n\n        total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible, but handle it as 0?\n\n        total = 0\n\n    print(total)\n\nWait, but what if need_left is false and need_right is false? That's only possible if l=1 and r=n, which is already handled. So the else clause is not possible. So, perhaps in code, the else is redundant. But for code safety, perhaps it's better to have.\n\nBut let's think of possible cases. For example, if l=1, r=5, n=5. Then, l ==1 and r ==n. So handled in the first condition. So in the else part, need_left is false (l=1) and need_right is false (r=5 ==n). So the code would enter the else clause. But that's covered by the first condition.\n\nSo, the code should be okay.\n\nTesting sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. Not 1 and 6. So need_left is true (2>1), need_right is true (4 <6). steps_to_l is 1, steps_to_r is 1. min is 1. r-l is 2. total is 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. So need_right is true (3 <6). So steps is |3-3| +1 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So first condition is true. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3 → need_right. steps_to_r is |2-3|=1. steps is 1+1=2.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. need_right. steps_to_r is |5-3|=2. steps is 2+1=3. So steps: move from 5 to 3 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when l is 1 and r is less than n, but the pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 =1.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, pos=3. steps is 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, pos=5. So need_left and need_right. steps_to_l is |5-2|=3, steps_to_r is |5-4|=1. min is 1. (r-l)=2. total is 1+2+2=5 steps.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nMove to r (4) from 5: 1 step. Close right (tabs 5). Then move to l (2) from 4: 2 steps. Close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 1 +1 + 2 +1 =5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, n=6, pos=1. So need_left (3>1) and need_right (5 <6). steps_to_l is 2 (from 1 to 3), steps_to_r is 4 (from 1 to 5). min is 2. r -l is 2. total is 2 +2 +2 =6 steps.\n\nSteps: move to l (3) in 2 steps. Close left (tabs 1,2). Then move to r (5) in 2 steps. Close right (tab 6). Total steps: 2+1 +2+1 =6. Correct.\n\nSo code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n-1. Then need_right is true. So steps is steps_to_r +1. But what if pos is already at r? Then steps_to_r is 0. So total steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input as four integers. But the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with four integers. The examples show multiple lines, but perhaps the problem is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers ... \n\nSo the input is one line. But in the sample input, there are three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the sample input shows three lines, but the actual code should read one line. Wait, perhaps the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects to read one line. Wait, the original problem's sample input is:\n\nSample input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. So perhaps the original problem is for multiple test cases, but the problem description says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the original problem's input says:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers ... \n\nSo the input is one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. That's confusing. But looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user made a mistake. But in the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut this suggests that there are multiple test cases, each on separate lines. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again, the original problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is one line. The sample input must be three separate test cases. But the code should read one line of input. So the sample input is probably for multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the problem description. But for the purpose of solving this problem, the code should read one line of input.\n\nBut in the problem's note, the sample input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. So perhaps the actual problem is to read multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the only line of input\".\n\nThis is a contradiction. But perhaps the sample input is written as multiple lines for the sake of example, but in reality, the code should read one line. For example, in the problem statement, the first sample input is:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nOutput: 5\n\nBut the sample shows three inputs and outputs. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. However, the code should be written for a single test case. So the code will read one line of input, split into four integers, and output one line of output.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nRead a line from stdin, split into four integers.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n\nThen compute as per the logic above.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = l > 1\n\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        steps_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n        steps_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n        min_steps = min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r)\n\n        total = min_steps + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif need_right:\n\n        total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        total = 0\n\n    print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is less than n? Then need_right is true. So the code would compute steps_to_r + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. Not 1 and 6. So need_left and need_right. steps_to_l is 1, steps_to_r is 1. min is 1. r-l is 2. total = 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. need_right is true. steps_to_r is 0. total is 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3 → steps_to_r is |2-3|=1. total is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3 → steps_to_r is 5-3=2. total is 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: l=1, r=3, n=5, pos=1. steps_to_r is 2. total is 2+1=3. Which would be: move to r (3) in 2 steps, close right (tabs 4,5).",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs to minimize the time spent.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already includes all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Tabs to Close**: Check if there are tabs to close on the left (l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Minimum Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Tabs to Close**: Calculate the minimum steps required to move to either end of the segment [l, r] and then close the tabs on both sides.\n   - **Only Left Tabs to Close**: Calculate steps to move to the left end (l) and close the tabs.\n   - **Only Right Tabs to Close**: Calculate steps to move to the right end (r) and close the tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        need_left = l > 1\n        need_right = r < n\n        if need_left and need_right:\n            steps_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n            steps_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n            min_steps = min(steps_to_l, steps_to_r)\n            total = min_steps + (r - l) + 2\n        elif need_left:\n            total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        elif need_right:\n            total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        else:\n            total = 0\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n), no operations are needed.\n- **Tabs to Close**: Depending on whether tabs need to be closed on the left, right, or both sides, we calculate the optimal path:\n  - **Both Sides**: Move to the closer end of the segment first, then move to the other end and close the remaining tabs.\n  - **Single Side**: Directly move to the respective end and close the tabs, minimizing the movement steps.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by leveraging direct movement and closing operations, ensuring optimal performance.",
