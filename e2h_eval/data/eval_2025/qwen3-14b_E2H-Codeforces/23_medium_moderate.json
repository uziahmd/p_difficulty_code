In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For the initial three tiles, maybe they already form a mentsu. If so, the answer is 0. Otherwise, we need to check what's the minimum number of tiles needed to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible mentsu in the current hand. For example, if the three tiles are all the same, then it's a triplet. Or if they form a consecutive sequence in the same suit.\n\nBut since the initial hand is three tiles, there are different possibilities. Let's think about each case.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to see what's the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nFor example, if the current tiles can form a triplet with one more tile. Like, if two tiles are same, then adding another same tile would make a triplet. So, for example, if the current tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding another 1m would form a triplet. But maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer tiles. Wait, but in this case, the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. To form a sequence, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, adding a 3m would allow 1m, 2m, 3m. But that requires adding one tile. Alternatively, adding a 1m would make triplet. So the minimum here is 1.\n\nBut how to check all possibilities?\n\nThe approach should be: for the given three tiles, check all possible ways to form a mentsu by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number required.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about all possibilities for forming a triplet or a sequence.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then check for the possible ways to form a mentsu with adding 1 tile, then 2 tiles, etc., and find the minimal number.\n\nBut how to check for that?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases where adding 1 tile would suffice.\n\nCase 1: Triplet.\n\nIf two of the three tiles are same, then adding one more of that tile would form a triplet. For example, if there are two 1m, then adding another 1m would make a triplet. So, for this case, the answer would be 1.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. For example, if there are two pairs. Like, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding another 1m would form a triplet. But also, adding 3m would allow a sequence (1m, 2m, 3m). So in that case, the answer would be 1.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nCase 2: Sequence.\n\nIf the three tiles can be part of a sequence when adding one tile. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m would form a sequence (1,2,3). Or adding 5m would form a sequence (2,4,5?), no. Wait, sequences are three consecutive numbers. So for example, 1m, 2m, 3m is a sequence. So if the current tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m, adding a 3m would form a sequence. So that's one tile added.\n\nAlternatively, if the current tiles are 1m, 3m, 4m. Adding a 2m would form a sequence. So again, one tile.\n\nSo, for the case where the three tiles can form a sequence with one addition, the answer is 1.\n\nSo, the problem is to check if any of these possibilities exists. If yes, then answer is 1. Else, check for possibilities requiring adding two tiles.\n\nBut how to check for these possibilities?\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible sequences or triplets.\n\nFirst, let's process the input. The input is three tiles. Let's parse them into their components: number and suit.\n\nFor example, the three tiles could be stored as a list of tuples, like (number, suit).\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStep 1: Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nFor triplet: all three are same. So, if all three have same number and suit.\n\nFor sequence: check if the three numbers are consecutive, and same suit. For example, sorted numbers are x, x+1, x+2, and same suit.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, check if they form a triplet or a sequence. If any of those is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, if the current tiles do not form a mentsu, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios where adding one tile is enough.\n\nCase A: Can form a triplet with one tile added.\n\nThis would happen if there are two tiles of the same type. For example, two 1m. Adding another 1m gives triplet.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, count the frequency of each tile. If any tile has a count of 2, then adding one more of that tile would form a triplet. So, in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but what if there are two pairs? Like, for example, tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, the count for 1m is 2, and 2m is 1. So, adding a 1m would form triplet. So yes, answer is 1.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are all different, but two of them are same. For example, 1m, 1m, 2p. Then, adding another 1m would form triplet. So, answer is 1.\n\nCase B: Can form a sequence with one tile added.\n\nThis is more complex. How to check if adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nFor example, the current three tiles may have two tiles that can be part of a sequence, and adding one tile would complete it.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways. For example, the current tiles could be two consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1m, 2m, 3m. Wait, that's already a sequence. So, that would have been handled in step 1. But suppose the current tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence.\n\nAnother example: 1m, 3m, 4m. Adding 2m would form a sequence.\n\nOr 2m, 3m, 4m. Already a sequence.\n\nBut how to check if there's a possible sequence that can be formed by adding one tile.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles, we need to check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit, such that two of the three tiles are in that sequence, and adding one more would complete it.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For each suit present in the tiles, check for possible sequences.\n\nSuppose the three tiles are in the same suit. Let's take their numbers and sort them. Let's say they are a, b, c (sorted).\n\nIf they are in the same suit, then:\n\nIf the sorted numbers are x, x, x: already a triplet.\n\nIf they are x, x, x+1: then adding x+1 would form triplet. Or, if they are x, x+1, x+2: already a sequence.\n\nWait, but for the case where the three tiles are in same suit but not forming a sequence, but adding one tile can.\n\nSo, for example, if the three numbers are x, x, x+1. Then, adding x+1 would make triplet. Or, if they are x, x+1, x+2: already a sequence.\n\nBut if the three numbers are x, x+1, x+3. Then, adding x+2 would form a sequence (x, x+1, x+2), or adding x+3 would form x+1, x+2, x+3. Wait, but in that case, the current tiles are x, x+1, x+3. So adding x+2 would form a sequence of x, x+1, x+2. Or adding x+3 would form x+1, x+2, x+3 (but need to have x+2, which is not present). So that's not possible. So, only adding x+2 would make a sequence.\n\nSo, for the three numbers in same suit, sorted, we can check if there's a way to add one tile to form a sequence.\n\nBut how to check this.\n\nLet me think of the three numbers as a, b, c (sorted). So a <= b <= c.\n\nIf they are in same suit.\n\nCase 1: a == b == c: already triplet.\n\nCase 2: a == b < c. Then, possible to add another a to form triplet. Or check if adding c-1 to make a sequence. Wait, but in this case, a, a, c. If c is a+1, then adding a+1 (c) would form a triplet. Or, if a, a, c, and c is a+2, then adding a+1 would form a sequence (a, a+1, a+2). So for this case, adding one tile would be possible.\n\nAlternatively, if a, b, c are such that a and b are consecutive, and c is two higher than b. Like a=1, b=2, c=4. Then adding 3 would form a sequence 1,2,3. Or adding 4 would form 2,3,4 (but need 3). So in this case, adding 3 would be needed.\n\nSo, in general, for the same suit, we can check if the three numbers can be part of a sequence with one addition.\n\nSo, for the three numbers sorted, a, b, c:\n\nCheck if there's a sequence that can be formed by adding one tile. For example:\n\nIf the three numbers are x, x, x+1: adding x+1 (so triplet) or adding x-1 (if x>1) to form x-1, x, x. But that's possible only if x-1 exists. But since the tiles are 1-9, we can check.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to check for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit, and see if the current tiles have two of them, and then adding one more.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for the current three tiles in same suit, check whether they can form a sequence with one tile added.\n\nFor example, for the sorted numbers a, b, c:\n\nIf a, b, c are x, x, x+1: then adding x+1 (to get three x+1) would form a triplet. Or adding x-1 (if x>1) to form x-1, x, x. But that's a triplet. However, the question is whether adding one tile can form a sequence or triplet.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal is 1, because adding one tile can form either a triplet (if x is 2, then adding x would make three x's) or a sequence (if adding x+1, but wait, the current tiles are x, x, x+1. Adding x+1 would give two x+1s and two x's. Not enough for a sequence. Wait, no. For a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers. So, for example, if the current tiles are x, x, x+1. Then adding x+2 would form a sequence of x, x+1, x+2. But that requires adding one tile. So in that case, that's possible.\n\nWait, but the current tiles are x, x, x+1. Then adding x+2 would allow a sequence of x, x+1, x+2. But the current tiles have two x's. So, the sequence would need three consecutive numbers. So, if I have two x's and one x+1, adding x+2 would allow a sequence of x, x+1, x+2. But that requires that there are at least one x, one x+1, one x+2. So, in this case, adding x+2 would give that. So that's possible. But that would require adding one tile.\n\nAlternatively, adding x-1 would allow a sequence of x-1, x, x+1. But that would require that x-1 is present. So if the current tiles have x, x, x+1, adding x-1 would allow a sequence. So that's possible.\n\nSo, for the current tiles, in same suit, sorted a, b, c:\n\nCheck if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two of them are present in the current tiles, and adding one tile would complete it.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think of the three numbers a, b, c.\n\nIf there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two of them are present in the current tiles, and the third is missing.\n\nSo for example, in the case of a=1, b=1, c=2 (same suit). Then possible sequences are:\n\n1, 2, 3 (needs adding 3)\n\nor 0, 1, 2 (invalid, since numbers start from 1)\n\nor 1, 1, 2 (not a sequence). So, the only possibility is adding 3.\n\nSo, that would require adding one tile.\n\nSimilarly, for a=1, b=2, c=3: already a sequence.\n\nFor a=1, b=2, c=4: possible sequences are 1,2,3 (add 3) or 2,3,4 (add 3). So adding 3.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one tile.\n\nSo, for the same suit, sorted a, b, c, we can check if there's a possible sequence that can be formed with one addition.\n\nSo, the steps for checking if adding one tile would allow a sequence are:\n\nCheck if the three numbers can be part of a sequence with one addition. For example:\n\nIf the three numbers have two consecutive numbers and the third is one step away. Like, for example, 1, 2, 4. Then, adding 3 would create a sequence 1,2,3 or 2,3,4.\n\nBut how to check this programmatically?\n\nAnother approach: for each of the three tiles, check if there's a possible sequence that can be formed with one addition. For example, if two of the tiles are in a consecutive sequence, and the third is one step away.\n\nAlternatively, for the same suit, check if the three numbers can be arranged such that two of them are consecutive, and the third is either one less than the first, or one more than the third.\n\nWait, perhaps the following logic can be used:\n\nFor the three numbers sorted as a, b, c:\n\nIf the difference between a and b is 1, and between b and c is 1: then already a sequence.\n\nIf the difference between a and b is 1, and between b and c is 2: then adding c-1 would form a sequence of a, b, c-1 (but wait, that's not right). Wait, a is x, b is x+1, c is x+3. Then adding x+2 would form a sequence x, x+1, x+2. So, in this case, the current tiles have x, x+1, x+3. So adding x+2.\n\nSimilarly, if the difference between a and b is 2, and between b and c is 1: then adding a+1 would form a sequence.\n\nIf the difference between a and b is 2 and between b and c is 2: then adding a+1 and b+1 (but that would require adding two tiles). So that's not possible with one tile.\n\nAlternatively, if a and c are consecutive, and b is in between. Wait, no. For example, a=1, b=3, c=2. When sorted, a=1, b=2, c=3. Which is a sequence.\n\nSo, after sorting, the three numbers are a, b, c.\n\nSo, for the same suit:\n\nCheck if (b == a +1 and c == b +1) → already a sequence.\n\nElse, check if (b == a +1 and c == b +2) → then adding c-1 (which is b+1) would form a sequence of a, b, c-1 (but wait, current a, b, and c is a, a+1, a+3. Adding a+2 would allow a sequence of a, a+1, a+2. So yes, that's possible. So in this case, adding one tile.\n\nOr if (b == a +2 and c == b +1) → same as above. Wait, but after sorting, a <= b <= c, so if a and c are a, a+2, a+1 → no, because after sorting, it would be a, a+1, a+2. So that case would have been handled earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is:\n\nIf the three numbers are such that the maximum of the three is at most 9, and the minimum is at least 1, and there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two of them are present in the current tiles, and the third is missing. Then, adding one tile would complete the sequence.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAnother approach: for the three numbers, check if there's a way to form a sequence by adding one tile.\n\nFor example, for the three numbers, check if there exists a value x such that exactly two of the three numbers are in {x, x+1, x+2} and the third is not. Then, adding the missing one would form a sequence.\n\nBut how to find x.\n\nLet me think of the three numbers a, b, c (sorted). Let's consider possible x values.\n\nFor example, x could be a, then the sequence would be a, a+1, a+2. Check if the current tiles have two of these. For example, if a is x, and the current numbers are a, a+1, a+3. Then, the sequence x, x+1, x+2 requires adding x+2.\n\nSo, for the three numbers, check for possible x where x is a, or a-1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for the three numbers, check if there's a possible x such that two of the numbers are in {x, x+1, x+2}, and the third is not. Then, adding the missing one would form the sequence.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, for the three numbers, check if there's a gap of 1 between two numbers and the third is adjacent to one of them.\n\nLet me think for the sorted a, b, c:\n\nCase 1: a and b are consecutive (b = a +1). Then, check if c is either a + 2 (so adding a+2 would form a sequence of a, a+1, a+2?), no. Wait, the current tiles have a, a+1, and a+2. That's already a sequence. So if c is a+2, then it's already a sequence. So that's covered in step 1.\n\nIf c is a + 3. Then, adding a+2 would form a sequence of a, a+1, a+2. So that's possible with one tile.\n\nCase 2: a and b are not consecutive. Then, check if b and c are consecutive. For example, a is 1, b is 3, c is 4. Then, adding 2 would form 1, 2, 3 (but current tiles have 1, 3, 4. So adding 2 would allow a sequence of 1, 3, 4? No, that's not consecutive. Wait, no. The sequence would need three consecutive numbers. So in this case, adding 2 would allow 3,4, and 2? No. 2,3,4 is a sequence. So yes, adding 2 would allow that.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one tile.\n\nCase 3: a and c are consecutive. Then, the middle number is missing. For example, a=1, c=2, and b is something else. But since the numbers are sorted, a <= b <= c, so if a=1, c=2, then b can be 1 or 2. So for example, a=1, b=1, c=2. Then, adding 2 would form a triplet. But that's a different case. Or if a=1, b=2, c=2. Then, adding 1 would form a triplet. Or if a=1, b=1, c=2, adding 3 would allow a sequence of 1,2,3.\n\nSo, for this case, adding one tile.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the way to check for possible sequence with one tile is:\n\nIf the three numbers (after sorting) are such that the maximum is <=9, and the minimum is >=1, and either:\n\n- the three numbers are x, x, x+1 → adding one x+1 would form triplet, or adding x-1 would form a sequence (if x-1 is >=1).\n\nOr, the three numbers are x, x+1, x+2 → already a sequence.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: For the three tiles, check all possible combinations of adding one tile. For each possible tile, check if adding it creates a mentsu.\n\nBut since the possible tiles are infinite, but for the purpose of checking, we can generate all possible tiles that could help form a mentsu with the existing ones.\n\nBut since the current three tiles plus one tile (total four tiles), we need to check if any of the possible combinations of three tiles among them form a mentsu.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, adding a tile T. Then, check if among the four tiles (original three plus T), there exists a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut considering that the original three plus T could have multiple combinations. For example, in the original three tiles plus T, there are C(4,3) = 4 possible combinations. For each of these, check if any is a mentsu.\n\nIf any of them is a mentsu, then adding T is sufficient, so the answer is 1.\n\nBut how to generate all possible T that could be candidates?\n\nBut since the number of possible T is large, but the problem requires the minimal number of tiles to add, perhaps we can find all possible T that could form a mentsu when added to the current three tiles.\n\nBut how to generate those T?\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible scenarios where adding one tile would allow a triplet or sequence.\n\nFor triplet:\n\nIf there are two tiles of the same type. Adding another of that type.\n\nFor example, the current tiles have two of X. So adding X would form a triplet.\n\nFor sequence:\n\nWe need three consecutive numbers in same suit. So, for each possible sequence, check if adding one tile would complete it.\n\nBut how to find all possible sequences that can be completed by adding one tile.\n\nSo, for example, for the current three tiles, check for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in same suit, and see if two of the three numbers are present in the current tiles, and the third is missing. Then, adding that third would complete the sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the current tiles have 1m and 2m, then adding 3m would complete the sequence.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the current three tiles, check:\n\n1. Are there any possible triplet scenarios with one tile added?\n\n   For that, check if there's any tile that appears twice in the current three. If yes, then adding one more of that tile would form a triplet. So answer is 1.\n\n   Also, if there's a tile that appears once, but adding two more of that tile would form a triplet. But that would require adding two tiles. So in this case, it's not helpful for the one tile scenario.\n\n   So for the case of adding one tile to form a triplet, we need that there are two of the same tile in the current three.\n\n2. Are there any possible sequence scenarios with one tile added?\n\n   For that, for each possible suit in the current tiles, check if there are two numbers in that suit that can be part of a sequence with one tile added.\n\n   For example, if in the same suit, the current numbers are 1, 2, 4. Then, adding 3 would allow a sequence of 1,2,3. Or adding 5 would allow a sequence of 2,4,5? No, because 2,4,5 are not consecutive. So that's not a valid sequence.\n\n   So, for each suit present in the current three tiles, collect all the numbers in that suit. Then, check for possible sequences of three consecutive numbers where exactly two of the numbers are present in the current set.\n\n   For example, for a suit with numbers [1,2,4], check for sequences 1-2-3 (need 3), 2-3-4 (need 3), 3-4-5 (need 3, 5?), etc. Wait, but the current numbers are 1,2,4. So for the sequence 1-2-3, we need 3. For 2-3-4, we need 3. For 3-4-5, we need 3 and 5. So adding 3 would allow 1-2-3 or 2-3-4. So yes, adding one tile.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers present, and check for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers, and see if exactly two of them are present in the current numbers. If yes, then adding the third would form a sequence.\n\nThus, for each suit, we can check for that.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles, for each suit present, collect the numbers in that suit. Let's say the numbers are stored in a list. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3s, then for suit 'm', numbers are [1,2]; for suit 's', numbers are [3].\n\nThen, for each suit with at least two numbers, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two are present in the current numbers.\n\nFor example, for suit 'm' with numbers [1,2], the possible sequences are 1-2-3. We need to check if two of them are present. In this case, 1 and 2 are present. So adding 3 would complete the sequence.\n\nSo, for each suit, for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in that suit, check if the current numbers in the suit contain exactly two of them. If yes, then adding the third would form a sequence.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nFor each suit, collect the numbers in that suit. Let's call this list 'nums'.\n\nFor example, if the current three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3s, then for suit 'm', nums is [1,2]. For suit 's', nums is [3].\n\nThen, for each possible x in 1..7 (since x, x+1, x+2 must be <=9), check if x, x+1, x+2 is a possible sequence. For each such x, check if exactly two of the numbers in the sequence are present in nums.\n\nIf yes, then adding the third would allow a sequence.\n\nSo, for the example of nums = [1,2], x=1, the sequence is 1,2,3. The current nums contains 1 and 2. So adding 3 would complete it. So this is a candidate.\n\nThus, for each suit, we can generate all possible x in 1..7, and check for the presence of two numbers in the sequence.\n\nSo, if any of these conditions are met, then adding one tile is possible.\n\nSo, putting this together, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nWait, but why would it ever require adding two tiles?\n\nLet's think of some examples.\n\nExample: current tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. What's the minimal number of tiles to add?\n\nPossible options:\n\nTo form a triplet, need to add two more 1m, or two more 3m, or two more 5m. That would require adding two tiles.\n\nTo form a sequence, need to add 2m and 4m. So two tiles. So the minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: current tiles are 1m, 1p, 2s. Then, to form a triplet, need to add two of any of the existing tiles. For example, adding two 1m would make a triplet. So adding two tiles.\n\nAlternatively, forming a sequence would require adding tiles in the same suit. Since the three tiles are in different suits, it's impossible. So the minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: current tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. To form a triplet, need to add two of any of the existing. So adding two tiles. To form a sequence, need to add two tiles in the same suit. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo, in such cases, the answer is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal possible is 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, but is there any case where adding three tiles is needed? Let's think.\n\nNo, because the problem says that the player can draw any tiles. So, for example, if the three tiles are all different suits and numbers, then to form a triplet, she can add two more of any tile. So, adding two tiles. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo, the maximum answer is 2.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be:\n\nCheck for 0, then 1, then return 2 if none.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck if current tiles form a mentsu → return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu → return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. For example, '1s 2s 3s' is the first example.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of three strings, but according to the sample input, the input is given as a list of three strings, but in the sample input, the input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], and the output is ['0', '0', '1'].\n\nWait, the input is a single line with three strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, for example, the input is three strings separated by spaces. So, for example, the first example input is:\n\n'1s 2s 3s' — meaning the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s.\n\nBut the sample input shows the input as a list of three elements, but in reality, the input is a single line with three strings. For example, the first input line is \"1s 2s 3s\" (the three tiles are given as space-separated in a single line).\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ... \n\nSo, the input is three strings separated by spaces. For example, the input for the first example is \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nBut in the sample input provided in the problem, the input is written as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but that's probably a mistake. Because the actual input is a single line with three strings. For example, the first example's input is three tiles, and the output is 0.\n\nBut the sample input and output are presented as lists, but that's probably just for illustrative purposes. So the actual code should read a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, in Python, the code will read a line from stdin, split into three parts, and process each part as a tile.\n\nOnce parsed, for each of the three tiles, we can extract the number and suit.\n\nNow, for the current three tiles, we need to check:\n\nFirst, if they form a mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n\nTo check this:\n\nFor triplet: all three are same tile (same number and suit).\n\nFor sequence: all three are in same suit, and their numbers are consecutive when sorted.\n\nSo, code for checking:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # tiles is a list of three (num, suit) tuples\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # all same suit?\n\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]:\n\n        nums = sorted([tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]])\n\n        if nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 1:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the sorted numbers must be consecutive. So, for example, sorted numbers [1,2,3] → yes. [1,2,4] → no. So, the check is that the max is min +2, and the middle is min +1.\n\nSo, the code for checking sequence is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, if the current tiles form a mentsu, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nFirst, check for triplet possibilities. For that, check if any of the tiles occurs twice. For example, in the three tiles, if there are two same tiles. For example, tiles are [a, a, b]. Then, adding another a would form a triplet. So, the answer would be 1.\n\nSo, code for checking if there are two same tiles in the current three.\n\ncount = {}\n\nfor tile in tiles:\n\n    count[tile] = count.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\nif any(v >= 2 for v in count.values()):\n\n    # possible to form triplet by adding one more\n\n    return 1\n\nWait, but even if there's one tile that occurs once, and others are unique, but adding two of that tile would form a triplet. But that requires adding two tiles, not one. So, for the case of adding one tile, we need to have two same tiles already present.\n\nSo, if in the current three tiles, there are two same tiles, then adding one more would form a triplet.\n\nSo, in that case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo, for example, the current tiles are [a, a, b]. Then, adding a third a.\n\nBut also, there's the possibility of forming a sequence with one tile added.\n\nSo, in addition to checking for the triplet possibility, we need to check for the sequence possibility.\n\nSo, for the sequence possibility, we need to check for each suit present in the current tiles, whether there's a possible sequence that can be formed by adding one tile.\n\nSo, for each suit in the current tiles:\n\nCollect all the numbers in that suit.\n\nFor example, if the current tiles are [1m, 2m, 3s], then for suit 'm', the numbers are [1,2]; for 's', [3].\n\nThen, for each suit, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two of them are present in the numbers of that suit.\n\nSo, for the 'm' suit, numbers [1, 2], check for x in 1 to 7:\n\nsequence x, x+1, x+2.\n\nCheck if exactly two of them are in the numbers.\n\nIn this case, x=1: sequence 1,2,3. The numbers [1,2] have two elements. So adding 3 would form a sequence.\n\nSo, this is a possible case.\n\nThus, the code for checking this:\n\nFor each suit in the current tiles:\n\n    collect the numbers in that suit (e.g., [1, 2])\n\n    for x in 1 to 7:\n\n        seq = [x, x+1, x+2]\n\n        count_in_seq = 0\n\n        for num in seq:\n\n            if num in numbers:\n\n                count_in_seq += 1\n\n        if count_in_seq == 2:\n\n            return True (so adding one tile would form a sequence)\n\nIf",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Check for One Tile Addition**: If the current tiles do not form a valid mentsu, check if adding one tile can form a valid mentsu:\n   - **Triplet Check**: If any tile appears twice in the current hand, adding another of the same tile would form a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Check**: For each suit present in the current hand, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where exactly two of them are present in the current hand.
