He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, which might be R (Roman) or another base.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The first line has a and b. Then the second line is the number c in base a. The output is the converted number in base b, without leading zeros. If it's Roman, then output the Roman numeral.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. Since c can be up to 10^3 digits long, but a can be up to 25. So for example, if a is 2 and c is 1111001, which is 1111001 in base 2. But converting that to decimal would be 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 112 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 112+32=144+16=160+8=168+1=169? Wait, maybe I should write a function that takes the string and base a and converts it to an integer.\n\nBut wait, how to handle letters? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. But the problem says that when converting to base b, if b is not R, then for bases greater than 10, letters are used. However, the input c is given in base a, which may have letters. For example, in the sample input, there's 'A' in the input. So the input c can have letters for digits higher than 9.\n\nSo for the first step, converting c from base a to decimal: we need to process each character of the string, convert it to its value, then compute the decimal value.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo the function to convert a string in base a to decimal is needed. Let's think about how to implement that.\n\nFor each character in the string, we need to find its value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So the code can be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but the input c can have letters, but the problem says that when converting to base a, the input is valid. So the code can process each character correctly.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros. So for example, if a is 10, then c could be '00123', which is 123 in decimal.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b, unless b is R, in which case we need to convert to Roman numerals.\n\nNow, for the second part: converting decimal to base b, or to Roman.\n\nLet me think about the cases:\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then convert decimal to base b, using letters for digits >=10. Also, leading zeros must be omitted. For example, if the decimal is 0, but the problem says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input c could be zero? Wait, the problem says that if Roman is included, the number is not zero. Otherwise, the number can be zero? Let me check the problem statement.\n\nIn the input description: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15.\"\n\nSo, when converting to Roman, the number is not zero. For other cases, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can be either a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from base `a` to decimal, and then converting the decimal value to the target base `b` or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number `c` is given in base `a`. We need to convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its corresponding value, and accumulating the result by multiplying the current value by the base and adding the digit's value.\n\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base `b` is not Roman numerals, convert the decimal value to base `b`. For bases greater than 10, digits above 9 are represented using letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n   - If the target base `b` is Roman numerals, convert the decimal value to Roman numerals using a standard conversion method that handles the subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = \"\"\n    for (v, r) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += r\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        a_part, b_part = parts[0], parts[1]\n        c_str = ' '.join(parts[2:]) if len(parts) > 2 else ''\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n        c = c_str.strip()\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string `c`, converting it to its decimal value by iterating through each digit and accumulating the result.\n\n2. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal number to a specified base. It handles bases greater than 10 by using letters for digits above 9.\n\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, applying the subtractive principle where necessary.\n\n4. **Main Function**: The main function reads input lines, processes each line to extract the bases and the number, converts the number to decimal, and then converts it to the target base or Roman numerals as required, ensuring the output omits leading zeros.",
