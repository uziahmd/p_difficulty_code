Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, including those already present.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's denote the required sum as target = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimum number of cards needed to reach this target, using numbers between -x and x, inclusive?\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to achieve this target with the least number of cards. Each card can contribute a value between -x and x. So, for example, if the target is T, then each card can contribute up to x towards that target. So the minimal number of cards would be ceiling of |T| / x, but maybe there's some adjustment needed based on whether T is divisible by x or not.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose T is 3 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute at most 2. So to get 3, you need two cards: 2 + 1. But wait, 2+1 is 3, but that's two cards. Alternatively, maybe 1+1+1, which is three cards. So the minimal is two. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(3/2) = 2. Which works here.\n\nAnother example: T is 4 and x is 2. Then 4 / 2 is exactly 2 cards. So that's two cards of 2 each.\n\nBut what if T is 5 and x is 3? Then 5 /3 is 1.666..., so ceiling is 2. So two cards: 3 + 2 = 5. That's two cards. So yes, that seems to work.\n\nSo the general formula is: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ), but wait, perhaps not. Because if the target is exactly divisible by x, then it's |target| /x. Otherwise, it's floor(|target|/x) + 1. Which is the same as ceil(|target| /x).\n\nBut wait, let's think again. For example, if target is 0, then no cards are needed. So that's a special case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given cards. Let's call it sum_current.\n\n2. The target is -sum_current. Let's call it target.\n\n3. If target is 0, then answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach target, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nThe minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that k * x >= |target|. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the target. So the minimal k is ceil( |target| / x ). But wait, let's think:\n\nFor example, target is 5 and x is 3. |target| is 5. 5/3 is 1.666, so ceil is 2. So 2 cards. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: target is 4 and x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. But with two cards, you can do 3 + 1 = 4. So yes, two cards.\n\nBut what if target is 3 and x is 3? Then 3/3 is 1. So one card. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ). But wait, what if the target is negative? Well, since we take absolute value, it doesn't matter. Because the target can be achieved by adding cards with positive or negative values. For example, if target is -5, then you can add cards with sum -5. But the minimal number of cards is the same as for 5, since each card can contribute up to x in absolute value.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nif target is zero: 0\n\nelse: ceil( |target| / x )\n\nBut wait, let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So target is -2. So |target| is 2. x is 2. So 2/2 = 1. So answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target is 4. |target| is 4. x is 3. 4 /3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about if the target is 3 and x is 2. Then the minimal number is 2 (2+1). But according to the formula, 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target is 1, x is 1. Then 1/1 = 1. So one card. Correct.\n\nAnother case: target is 0, answer is 0.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCalculate the sum of the given cards. Compute target = -sum. If target is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |target| / x )\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nIn Python, for positive numbers, ceil(a / b) can be done as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nYes. For example, 5/3 is 1.666. (5 +3 -1) //3 = 7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo for |target| divided by x, the minimal number of cards is (|target| + x -1 ) // x.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x, then the list of numbers.\n\nsum_current = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = -sum_current.\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    minimal_cards = (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x\n\n    print( minimal_cards )\n\nWait, but let me check the sample input again.\n\nFirst sample: sum is 2. target is -2. abs(target) is 2. x is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target is 5, x is 3. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target is 3, x is 3. (3 +3-1)/3 =5//3=1. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if x is 0? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo this formula works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: sum_current is zero. Output is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: target is zero. Output is zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when target is exactly divisible by x. For example, target is 6, x is 3. So 6/3=2. So 2 cards.\n\nAnother case: target is 1, x is 1. So 1 card.\n\nWhat if target is 0? Then 0 cards.\n\nAnother case: sum_current is 0. So target is 0. So answer is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_current = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = -sum_current.\n\nif target is 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if x is larger than the target?\n\nLike target is 2, x is 5. Then (2 +5-1)/5 =6//5=1. Which is correct. Because you can add one card with 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input. The input is two lines. First line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of two examples. Wait, the user provided the input as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nBut the actual input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and x. The second line contains n integers.\n\nSo in code, we can read the first line as input().split(), then the second line as input().split().\n\nSo code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_current = sum(nums)\n\ntarget = -sum_current\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    minimal = (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x\n\n    print(minimal)\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2. nums are -1,1,2. sum is 2. target is -2. So abs(target) is 2. (2 + 2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3. nums are -2, -2. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nWhat about if the sum is zero? For example, input is 1 5 and the number is 0. Then sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 5. Then target is -5. So abs(target) is 5. (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. So 1 card. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 4. Then target is -5. abs(target)=5. (5+4-1)/4 =8/4=2. Which is correct (4+1=5, two cards).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by x. This is efficiently done using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_current = sum(nums)\ntarget = -sum_current\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    minimal = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n    print(minimal)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards to determine how much more is needed to reach zero.\n3. **Target Adjustment**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: If the target sum is zero, immediately return 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we determine the minimum number of cards required by effectively computing the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x, which ensures we use the fewest cards possible.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards, ensuring it handles all edge cases optimally.",
