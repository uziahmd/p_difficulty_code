He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The input gives me all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some unknown string s. But I don't know which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes. My job is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that matches this assignment.\n\nThe key here is that the correct assignment must be such that when we take all the P's as prefixes and S's as suffixes, there exists a string s of length n that has exactly those prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo, how do I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the original string s is of length n, each prefix of length k (1 ≤ k < n) must be the first k characters of s. Similarly, each suffix of length k must be the last k characters of s.\n\nNow, for the given input strings, there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. For example, if n is 5, there are 2 strings of length 1, 2 strings of length 2, etc., up to length 4.\n\nThe challenge is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix or a suffix, such that there's a consistent s.\n\nBut how can I find such an assignment?\n\nOne idea is that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their combination can form the original string. For example, if the original string is s, then the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must overlap in a way that they share the middle part.\n\nWait, but there are two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix. But how do I know which is which?\n\nAlternatively, the original string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Because for the longest prefix (length n-1), the original string s must be that prefix plus one character. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) is the original string minus the first character. So, if I can find which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix, then I can reconstruct s.\n\nWait, let's think: suppose the original string is s. Then the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must have a common part of length n-2. So, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must share the middle part. So, the longest prefix's first n-2 characters must match the longest suffix's last n-2 characters. Or maybe not? Let's see:\n\nFor example, if s is \"ababa\" (n=5). The longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4), the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). The first 3 characters of the prefix are \"aba\", the last 3 of the suffix are \"aba\". So they overlap.\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix (let's call it P) and the other is the suffix (call it S). Then, the original string would be P + [last character of S], because the suffix S is the last n-1 characters of s. So, the first character of S is the second character of s, and the last character of S is the nth character. So, the original string s would be P[0] followed by S[0], but wait no. Wait, P is the first n-1 characters of s. S is the last n-1 characters of s. Therefore, the first character of P is s[0], the last character of S is s[n-1]. Also, the second character of P is s[1], which is the same as the first character of S. So, P and S must overlap in the middle. Therefore, P[0...n-2] must equal S[1...n-2], because the first n-2 characters of P are s[0..n-3], and the last n-2 characters of S are s[1..n-2]. Therefore, P and S must overlap in that way. So, the two strings of length n-1 must be such that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, and they must satisfy that condition.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n1. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B.\n\n2. Check which of the possibilities (A as prefix and B as suffix, or vice versa) allows us to build a possible s.\n\nFor example, if A is the prefix (so s starts with A), and B is the suffix (so s ends with B), then the first character of A is s[0], the last character of B is s[n-1]. Also, the first n-2 characters of A (A[0..n-3]) must equal the last n-2 characters of B (B[1..n-2]). Because the first n-2 characters of A are s[0..n-3], and the last n-2 characters of B are s[1..n-2].\n\nIf that is true, then the original string s would be A + [last character of B], but wait:\n\nWait, if A is the prefix of length n-1, then the original string is A plus one more character. Let's say that character is x. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s, which is the string starting from position 1 of s. So, the suffix is s[1..n-1] = B. Therefore, s[1..n-1] = B. So, the original string is s = A[0] + B[0] + ... + B[n-2], but since A is of length n-1, then A is s[0..n-2], and B is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first character of A is s[0], the last character of B is s[n-1]. Also, the second character of A (A[1]) is s[1], which is the first character of B (B[0]). Similarly, the third character of A (A[2]) is s[2], which is the second character of B (B[1]), etc. So, A[0..n-2] must be equal to B[0..n-2], except that B starts at s[1], so A[0..n-3] must be equal to B[1..n-2]? Wait, let's think:\n\nA has length n-1. So, the original s is A concatenated with x, where x is the last character. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = B. So, s[1..n-1] is B. But s[1..n-1] is A[1] followed by A[2], ..., A[n-2], and then x. So, B must be equal to A[1:] + x. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1:] + x. But x is the last character of s, which is the last character of B. So, B's last character is x. Therefore, B = A[1:] + B[-1]. Which implies that B[0..n-2] = A[1..n-2]. Because B's first n-2 characters are A[1..n-2], and the last character is x. So, B[0..n-2] is A[1..n-2].\n\nTherefore, for the case where A is the prefix and B is the suffix, we can check whether B[0..n-2] equals A[1..n-2]. If that's true, then the original string would be A + B[-1], which is A concatenated with the last character of B. Similarly, if we check the other possibility (B as prefix and A as suffix), then we check if A[0..n-2] equals B[1..n-2]. If that holds, then the original string would be B + A[-1].\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, we can check both possibilities. Once we find which one is valid, then we can determine the original string s. Once s is determined, we can check for all the input strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s, and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For the length n-1, get the two strings. Let's call them candidates.\n\n3. Try each of the two possibilities (which one is prefix, which is suffix) and see if they can form a valid s.\n\n   For example, for the first candidate (say, A) being prefix and the second (B) being suffix:\n\n   Check if B[0..n-2] == A[1..n-2]. If yes, then the original string is A + B[-1].\n\n   Then, check if all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s.\n\n   Similarly for the other possibility (B as prefix, A as suffix).\n\n   Once we find a valid s (i.e., one that satisfies all the input strings being either prefixes or suffixes of it), then we can proceed.\n\nBut how do we know which of the two possibilities is correct? Because there may be multiple possibilities, but we need to choose one that works.\n\nOnce we have the correct s, we can then check each input string and assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do we find which of the two possibilities (A as prefix and B as suffix, or vice versa) is correct?\n\nWell, for each of the two possibilities, we can generate the candidate s, and then check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of that s. However, since the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of s, then for the correct s, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For each of the two possibilities (A as prefix and B as suffix, or B as prefix and A as suffix), generate the candidate s.\n\n- Then, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\n- If such a candidate s exists, then proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nBut how do I check that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nBecause the input strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s (excluding the full string). So, for the candidate s, the set of input strings must be exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1).\n\nSo, for the candidate s, we can generate all its prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1, and check if the input strings match exactly that set.\n\nBut since the input strings are given as a list, but the order is arbitrary, we need to compare the multiset of the input strings with the multiset of all prefixes and suffixes of the candidate s.\n\nFor example, for each candidate s, generate all prefixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all suffixes (same lengths), collect them into a list, and check if that list is a permutation of the input list.\n\nBut since the input list has exactly two strings for each length, and the candidate s will generate exactly two strings for each length (since for each length k, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix, but wait, no. For example, for length 1, there's one prefix (the first character) and one suffix (the last character). So for each length k, there are two strings (prefix and suffix). But for some cases, the prefix and suffix may be the same. For example, if s is \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So in that case, the input would have two \"a\" strings for length 1. So for the candidate s, the generated list of prefixes and suffixes would have exactly the same multiset as the input.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each candidate s (generated from the two possibilities of the n-1 length strings):\n\n   Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1).\n\n   Collect all of them into a list.\n\n   Sort this list, and compare with the sorted input list. If they match, then this candidate s is valid.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, then we can proceed to assign P and S for each input string.\n\nBut how do I generate the candidate s?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the two strings of length n-1, say A and B.\n\nCase 1: A is the prefix (so the first n-1 characters of s is A), and B is the suffix (so the last n-1 characters of s is B). Then, since the first n-1 characters are A, the last n-1 characters are B. Therefore, the first character of A is s[0], the last character of B is s[n-1]. Also, the second character of A is s[1], which is the first character of B. Similarly, the third character of A is s[2], which is the second character of B. So, for the entire length of n-2, the first n-2 characters of A (from index 0 to n-3) must match the first n-2 characters of B (from index 1 to n-2). So, A[0..n-3] must be equal to B[1..n-2]. Because B[0] is s[1], B[1] is s[2], etc. So, the first n-2 characters of B are s[1..n-2], and the first n-2 characters of A are s[0..n-3]. Therefore, B[0..n-3] must be equal to A[1..n-2]. So, B[0..n-3] == A[1..n-2]. Therefore, the condition for case 1 is that B[0..n-2 - 1] == A[1..n-2]. Wait, n-1 is the length of A and B. So, for example, if n is 5, then the length of A and B is 4. Then, the first n-2 is 3. So, B[0..n-3] is B[0..2], which is 3 characters. A[1..n-2] is A[1..3], which is also 3 characters. So, the condition is B[0..n-3] == A[1..n-2].\n\nIf that is true, then the original s would be A concatenated with B[-1], because s is A + [last character of B]. Because B is the last n-1 characters of s, which is s[1..n-1], so the first character of B is s[1], the second is s[2], etc., and the last character of B is s[n-1]. So, the original s is A[0] (s[0]) followed by B[0] (s[1]), B[1] (s[2]), ..., B[n-2] (s[n-1]). So, the original s is A concatenated with B's last character. But since A is length n-1, then the original s is A + B[-1], which is of length n.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: B is the prefix, A is the suffix. Then, the condition is that A[0..n-3] == B[1..n-2]. If that holds, then the original s is B + A[-1].\n\nOnce we generate the candidate s, we can check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input.\n\n2. Separate the input strings into groups by their lengths.\n\n3. For the length n-1, get the two strings, say, candidates = [s1, s2].\n\n4. Try both possibilities for the candidate s:\n\n   a. Assume s1 is the prefix and s2 is the suffix. Check if the condition s2[0..n-2-1] == s1[1..n-2]. If yes, then generate candidate s = s1 + s2[-1]. Then check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s.\n\n   b. Similarly for the other possibility: s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix. Check the condition and generate candidate s.\n\n5. Once a valid candidate s is found (either from case a or case b), then proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nNow, once we have the candidate s, how do we assign P or S for each input string?\n\nWe can loop through each input string and check if it is a prefix of s (then mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S). However, there's a catch: for some strings, they could be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the problem statement, the input has exactly two strings of each length, which implies that for each length, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. However, if they are the same string, then the input will have two copies of it. So, for example, if the input has two \"a\" strings of length 1, then both must be assigned as P and S (but since they are same, it's possible that one is P and the other is S).\n\nBut when generating the answer, for each input string, we need to assign it as P or S, such that all the P's are the prefixes of s, and all the S's are the suffixes of s. So, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. However, there might be cases where the same string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string \"a\" in the case of \"aaa\".\n\nBut how to assign which one is P and which is S? Well, since the problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable, as long as there exists at least one string s that is consistent with the assignment.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, assign P. If not, assign S. However, in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, we can assign either P or S. But we need to make sure that the total number of P's and S's is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2 strings). So, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If yes, assign P. Else assign S. However, if the same string is both a prefix and a suffix, then we need to make sure that exactly one of them is assigned as P and the other as S. But since the input has two copies of the same string, perhaps for each occurrence, we can assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, consider the input for the second example:\n\nInput:\n3\na\naa\naa\na\n\nThe correct s is \"aaa\". The prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". The input has two \"a\" (length 1) and two \"aa\" (length 2). So, for each occurrence of \"a\" (there are two), one is P and one is S. Similarly for \"aa\".\n\nBut when checking each input string, if we check if it's a prefix, then for the first \"a\" (input line 1), it's a prefix. For the second \"a\" (input line 4), it's also a prefix. But we need to assign one as P and one as S. How to handle this?\n\nAh, but the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So, for the two \"a\" strings, one can be P and the other S. However, if we just check for each string whether it is a prefix, and assign P, then we would assign both as P. But that's invalid, because the number of P's must be n-1 (since there are n-1 prefixes). Similarly for S's.\n\nSo, the problem is that for the same string appearing twice (as in the case of \"a\" in the example), we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how?\n\nSo, the approach of checking if the string is a prefix and assigning P may not work, because it would assign both as P, leading to more P's than allowed.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to assign P and S?\n\nWe need to select exactly one of the two occurrences of a string that is both a prefix and a suffix as P, and the other as S.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAlternative approach: For each input string, determine whether it is a prefix of s. Then, collect all the prefixes and suffixes. For each input string, if it is a prefix, then it must be assigned as P. But since there are exactly n-1 prefixes, and the same for suffixes, perhaps we can count how many times each string appears as a prefix and suffix.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then it must be assigned as P. Otherwise, it must be assigned as S. However, this approach may not work if the same string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case where the input has two copies of a string that is both a prefix and a suffix. Then, according to this approach, both would be marked as P (since they are prefixes), but we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nSo, how to handle that?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be the set of all prefixes and suffixes of some string. So, for the candidate s, the input must contain exactly the prefixes and suffixes. So, for each string in the input, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s. But for some strings, they could be both.\n\nBut in that case, for the input, there are two copies of the same string. For example, in the case of s being \"aaa\", the input for length 1 has two \"a\" strings. One is the prefix (length 1) and the other is the suffix (length 1). So, in the input, each of these two \"a\" strings must be assigned as P and S respectively.\n\nBut how do I know which one is which?\n\nThe problem allows any assignment as long as there exists a valid s. So, for the two \"a\" strings, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that in code?\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For the candidate s, collect all the prefixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) and suffixes (same). Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefix list. If it is, assign P. If not, assign S. However, if the input string is in both the prefix and suffix lists, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that?\n\nBut since the input has exactly two copies of each string (for each length), and the candidate s's prefixes and suffixes have exactly one of each length, then for each string in the input, it must be in the prefix list or the suffix list. However, for some strings, they can be in both.\n\nBut how can we count how many times a string appears as a prefix and suffix?\n\nFor example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So, the input has two copies of \"a\" (for length 1). The candidate s's prefixes include \"a\" (once) and the suffixes include \"a\" (once). So, for the two input \"a\" strings, one must be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, in code, for each input string, we can check whether it is a prefix. If it is, then we need to assign P, but only if there are still available P's left. Similarly for S.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, since the number of P's and S's must be exactly n-1 each, perhaps for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If yes, then assign P. But if the same string is both a prefix and suffix, then we need to assign one as P and one as S. However, the code may not know which one to assign.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, when we generate the candidate s, we can generate all the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, we can check whether it is in the prefixes. If it is, then we can assign P. However, since there are exactly n-1 prefixes, and the same for suffixes, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, create a set of prefixes (all prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1), and a set of suffixes (all suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1). Then, for each input string, if it is in the prefixes set, assign P, else assign S. However, this would not work in cases where a string is present in both sets. For example, in the case of \"a\" in the \"aaa\" example, both the prefix and suffix sets contain \"a\". So, the code would assign P to both, leading to more P's than allowed.\n\nSo, how to resolve this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate for the candidate s a list of all prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1), and a list of all suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefix list. If yes, then assign P, else assign S. However, since the input list contains exactly the same elements as the combined list of prefixes and suffixes, the code can process the input strings and for each one, determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut how to avoid overcounting?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes. So, for the candidate s, the input strings must be exactly the same as the prefixes and suffixes. So, for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then it must be assigned as P. Otherwise, it is a suffix and must be assigned as S. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it can be assigned as either. But the problem is that the code may have multiple instances of the same string, and how to assign P and S for them.\n\nFor example, consider the input strings for the second sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe candidate s is \"aaa\".\n\nThe prefixes of lengths 1,2 are \"a\", \"aa\".\n\nThe suffixes of lengths 1,2 are \"a\", \"aa\".\n\nSo, the input has two \"a\" and two \"aa\".\n\nNow, when processing the input strings, each \"a\" is a prefix and a suffix. So, for each occurrence of \"a\", it can be assigned as P or S. Similarly for \"aa\".\n\nBut the code needs to assign exactly one P and one S for each of the duplicates.\n\nBut how can we do that in code?\n\nPerhaps the way is to generate for each input string, whether it's a prefix. But since there are exactly n-1 prefixes, we can count how many times each string is a prefix. For example, for the \"a\" strings in the sample, each is a prefix. But there are two of them, but only one prefix of length 1. So, we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nBut how can the code know which one to assign?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the code can first generate all the prefixes and suffixes for the candidate s, and then for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes list. However, since the input list contains exactly the same elements as the prefixes and suffixes, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P, else S. However, in cases where the same string appears in both prefixes and suffixes, the code would assign P for all of them, which would lead to overcounting.\n\nBut since the input list contains exactly the same elements as the combined prefixes and suffixes, the code can proceed by checking if the input string is a prefix. But how to ensure that exactly n-1 are assigned as P and the rest as S?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate all prefixes and suffixes for the candidate s, and then for each input string, determine whether it's in the prefixes. However, since the input list is exactly the same as the union of prefixes and suffixes, and each string in the input is present once as a prefix or once as a suffix, except for those that are both.\n\nBut perhaps, the code can generate a list of all prefixes and a list of all suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes list. However, since there may be duplicates, the code can use a multiset approach.\n\nFor example, for the candidate s, create a list of all prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1). Similarly for suffixes. Then, for the input strings, for each string, check if it is in the prefixes list. But since the input strings are exactly the same as the union of prefixes and suffixes, the code can proceed by checking for each input string whether it is in the prefixes list. However, for strings that are both in prefixes and suffixes, the code can assign P or S depending on availability.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For the candidate s, collect all the prefixes and suffixes. For the prefixes, create a frequency map. Then, for each input string, if it's in the prefixes, assign P and decrement the frequency. Else, assign S. This way, the code ensures that the number of P's is exactly the number of prefixes (n-1).\n\nYes! That makes sense. For example, for the candidate s, create a list of all prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1). Then, create a multiset (like a Counter) of these prefixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is present in the Counter. If yes, assign P and decrease the count. If not, assign S.\n\nBut how to handle the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string \"a\" in the \"aaa\" case.\n\nIn this case, the Counter for prefixes will have \"a\" once (as the prefix of length 1), and \"aa\" once (prefix of length 2). The suffixes are \"a\" (suffix of length 1), and \"aa\" (suffix of length 2). So, the input strings are two \"a\"s and two \"aa\"s.\n\nWhen processing the first \"a\" in the input, the code checks if it is in the prefixes Counter (yes, count is 1). Assign P, and decrement the count to 0. The next \"a\" in the input is checked. Now, the prefixes Counter has 0 for \"a\", so it's not present. So, assign S.\n\nSimilarly for the \"aa\" strings. The first \"aa\" is in the prefixes Counter (count 1), assign P. The second \"aa\" is not in the prefixes Counter (count 0 now), assign S.\n\nThis way, the code ensures that exactly n-1 P's are assigned (since the prefixes Counter has exactly n-1 entries, and each time a P is assigned, the count is decremented).\n\nYes! That seems like a solid approach.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined:\n\n1. Generate all prefixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1). Let's call this list prefixes_list. For example, for s = \"ababa\", prefixes_list would be [\"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\"].\n\n2. Create a Counter (dictionary) for the prefixes_list. Let's call it prefix_counter. For example, if there are two \"a\" strings in the prefixes_list (which can't happen, since for each length, there is exactly one prefix), but in general, for the candidate s, the prefixes_list has exactly one entry per length, so the prefix_counter will have each prefix once.\n\nBut wait, the prefixes_list for s is exactly n-1 elements, each of different lengths. So, each string in prefixes_list is unique in terms of their length. However, two prefixes of different lengths can be the same string. For example, if s is \"aaaaa\", then the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", length 2 is \"aa\", etc. But if s is \"aabaa\", then the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\", and the prefix of length 3 is \"aab\", etc. So, the prefixes_list for s is unique in their lengths, but the actual strings may repeat. However, the input list has exactly two strings of each length, so for the candidate s, the prefixes_list contains exactly one string per length. So, the prefix_counter is a dictionary where each key is a string (prefix), and the value is the number of times it appears in prefixes_list. But since each length is unique, each prefix is unique in the list (because they have different lengths). Wait, no. For example, the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", and the prefix of length 2 could be \"aa\", but if the string is \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\", and the prefix of length 3 is \"aaa\". So, each prefix is unique in the prefixes_list because they have different lengths. So, the prefix_counter will have each prefix once, and the same for the suffixes.\n\nWait, but for example, if the string is \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", length 2 is \"aa\", length 3 is \"aaa\". So, the prefixes_list for n=4 would be \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\". All have different lengths, so they are distinct strings.\n\nThus, in the prefixes_list, all the strings are unique. So, the prefix_counter will have each string once. Therefore, when processing the input strings, for each string, if it is present in the prefix_counter, then assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut how to handle the case where a string is present in both prefixes and suffixes? For example, the string \"a\" is a prefix of length 1 and a suffix of length 1. However, in the prefixes_list, it is present once, and in the suffixes_list, once. So, in the input, there are two copies of \"a\" (for length 1). When processing the first \"a\" in the input, the code checks if it's in the prefix_counter (yes, so assign P, and remove it from the counter). The next \"a\" is not in the prefix_counter (since it was removed), so assign S.\n\nThis way, the code ensures that exactly n-1 P's are assigned (since the prefixes_list has exactly n-1 entries, and each time a P is assigned, the count is reduced by 1, until it's zero).\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined:\n\n   Generate the prefixes_list (all prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1).\n\n   Create a Counter (dictionary) for the prefixes_list. For example, using collections.Counter.\n\n   For each input string in the original input order:\n\n      if the string is in the prefix_counter and the count is > 0:\n\n          assign 'P', and decrement the count in the prefix_counter.\n\n      else:\n\n          assign 'S'.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next 2n-2 lines as the input_strings list.\n\nGroup the input_strings by their lengths. For example, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nCheck the two possibilities:\n\n   possibility 1: candidate1 is prefix, candidate2 is suffix.\n\n      check if candidate2[0 : len(candidate2)-1] == candidate1[1 : ] ?\n\n      Wait, len(candidate2) is n-1. So, len(candidate2)-1 is n-2. So, the first n-2 characters of candidate2 is candidate2[0 : n-2]. The candidate1[1:] is from index 1 to end, which is length (n-1) - 1 = n-2. So, comparing candidate2[0 : n-2] with candidate1[1 : ].\n\n      If yes, then generate s_candidate = candidate1 + candidate2[-1].\n\n      Then, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n      How to check that? Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, collect them into a list, and compare with the input_strings sorted. Or, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, perhaps we can skip that check. But no, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some string, but when",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` based on the given prefixes and suffixes and then assigning each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The longest prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`) are crucial. We check both possibilities of these strings being the prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidate String**: For each candidate configuration of the unknown string `s`, verify if all input strings are valid prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Assign P/S Labels**: Once a valid string `s` is identified, generate all its prefixes and suffixes. Use a counter to ensure each prefix is assigned as 'P' and each suffix as 'S' correctly, even if there are duplicates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    input_strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n    \n    # Group by length, but we'll process the two of length n-1 separately\n    len_to_strings = {}\n    for s in input_strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in len_to_strings:\n            len_to_strings[l] = []\n        len_to_strings[l].append(s)\n    \n    # Get the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    candidate1, candidate2 = candidates[0], candidates[1]\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the candidate s\n    possible_s = []\n    \n    # Case 1: candidate1 is prefix, candidate2 is suffix\n    if len(candidate1) == n-1 and len(candidate2) == n-1:\n        # Check if candidate2's first n-2 chars match candidate1's from index 1\n        if candidate2[:n-2] == candidate1[1:]:\n            s_candidate = candidate1 + candidate2[-1]\n            possible_s.append(s_candidate)\n        # Check if candidate1's first n-2 chars match candidate2's from index 1\n        if candidate1[:n-2] == candidate2[1:]:\n            s_candidate = candidate2 + candidate1[-1]\n            possible_s.append(s_candidate)\n    \n    # Now check which of the possible_s is valid\n    valid_s = None\n    for s_candidate in possible_s:\n        # Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate\n        prefixes = []\n        suffixes = []\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            prefixes.append(s_candidate[:l])\n            suffixes.append(s_candidate[-l:])\n        # Combine them into a list\n        generated = prefixes + suffixes\n        # Compare with input_strings as multisets\n        # Sort both lists and compare\n        if sorted(generated) == sorted(input_strings):\n            valid_s = s_candidate\n            break\n    \n    # Now assign P/S for each input string\n    if valid_s is None:\n        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n        print(''.join(['P']*(n-1) + ['S']*(n-1)))\n        return\n    \n    # Generate all prefixes of valid_s\n    prefixes_list = [valid_s[:i] for i in range(1, n)]\n    prefix_counter = Counter(prefixes_list)\n    \n    result = []\n    for s in input_strings:\n        if prefix_counter[s] > 0:\n            result.append('P')\n            prefix_counter[s] -= 1\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list. The strings are grouped by their lengths.\n2. **Candidate String Identification**: The two strings of length `n-1` are considered as potential prefixes and suffixes. Both possibilities are checked to form a valid string `s`.\n3. **Validation**: For each candidate string `s`, all prefixes and suffixes are generated. These are compared against the input strings to ensure they match.\n4. **Assignment of P/S**: Using a counter, each input string is checked against the prefixes of the valid string `s`. If it matches a prefix, it is labeled 'P'; otherwise, it is labeled 'S'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the unknown string `s` and assign each input string as a prefix or suffix efficiently.",
