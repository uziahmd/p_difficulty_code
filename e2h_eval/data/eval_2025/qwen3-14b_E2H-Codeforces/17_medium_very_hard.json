He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\".

The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, with exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. And if there are multiple possibilities, any correct one is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input is all the prefixes and suffixes, but mixed up, we need to find a way to assign them correctly.\n\nBut how can we determine which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nLet me think about the properties of prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be the original string s without its last character. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the original string without the first character.\n\nBut since we don't know which of the input strings are the ones of length n-1, perhaps we can find the correct candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, but for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix (the original s without last character), and the other must be the suffix (original s without first character). But these two may not be the same. So for example, if the original string is \"ababa\", then the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\".\n\nSo, for the maximum length (n-1), the two strings must be the prefix and suffix of the original string. Therefore, for the original string, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So these two strings must be present in the input. Therefore, if we can find which two strings of length n-1 are in the input, then they must be the prefix and suffix of the original string. However, how do we determine which is which?\n\nWait, but the original string s can be reconstructed by combining these two. For example, the original string would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character. But also, the suffix of length n-1 is the original string minus the first character. So the original string is the first string (prefix) plus the last character, which is the same as the last character of the suffix string.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nLet's suppose that for the maximum length (n-1), we have two strings, say A and B. Then, one of them is the prefix (let's say A) and the other is the suffix (B). Then the original string s must be A + c, where c is the last character of s. Also, B must be the suffix of s, which is s[1..n-1], so B is equal to s[1..n-1]. Therefore, s[1..n-1] is B. So the original string is A + c, and B is s[1..n-1], which is the original string without the first character. So the original string is A + c, and B is (A + c)[1..n-1] = A[1..n-2] + c. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1..n-2] + c. But since A is of length n-1, A[1..n-2] is of length n-2. So B is of length n-1, which is the same as the length of A. Therefore, B's length is n-1, and the length of A is n-1. So B must be the substring of A shifted by one, plus the last character. But how can we find that?\n\nAlternatively, since the original string s must be equal to the prefix of length n-1 (let's call it p) plus the last character, and also the suffix of length n-1 (call it s) is the original string minus the first character. Therefore, the original string is p + [last_char], and the suffix is [s] = p[1:] + [last_char]. Therefore, the suffix s must be equal to p[1:] + last_char. But since the suffix is of length n-1, and p is of length n-1, then p[1:] is length n-2, and adding the last character gives length n-1. So that's correct.\n\nBut how can we find which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix? Well, perhaps for the two candidates, we can check if one is a prefix of the other, or something like that. Or maybe we can try both possibilities and see which one leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut since n is small (up to 100), perhaps trying all possibilities is feasible.\n\nSo here's an idea: for the two strings of length n-1, we can assume one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Then, we can reconstruct the original string s. Once we have s, we can check whether all the other input strings are indeed prefixes or suffixes of s. If yes, then we can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to reconstruct s?\n\nIf we assume that a certain string A is the prefix of length n-1, then the original string s must be A + c, where c is the last character of s. However, the suffix of length n-1 (B) is s[1..n-1], which is A[1..n-2] + c. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1..n-2] + c. But B is known. Therefore, c can be determined as the last character of B. Because B is of length n-1, and A[1..n-2] is length n-2. So B is A[1..n-2] + c. Therefore, c is the last character of B. Therefore, the original string s is A concatenated with the last character of B.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that B is the suffix of length n-1, then the original string s is B's first character plus the prefix of length n-1 (but wait, no. Wait, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the original string s is s[0] + B. So the original string would be s[0] + B. But since the prefix of length n-1 is A, which is s[0..n-2], then A must be equal to s[0] + B[0..n-2-1] ?\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let's take an example. Suppose the original string is ababa (n=5). The prefix of length 4 is abab, and the suffix of length 4 is baba. So B is the suffix. Then, B is s[1..4] = 'baba'. The original string is s = s[0] + B. But s[0] is 'a', so s is 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa', which is correct. Also, the prefix of length 4 is 'abab', which is s[0..3]. So, in this case, the prefix A is 'abab', and the suffix B is 'baba'. So, B is the suffix. Then, the original string is s = (A[0]) + B. Because A is s[0..3], which is 'a' + 'bab' (the first four letters). So A[0] is 'a', and B is 'baba', so s is 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa'.\n\nSo in this case, the original string can be constructed by taking the first character of A (the prefix of length n-1) and appending B (the suffix of length n-1).\n\nAlternatively, if we take the other possibility, where B is the prefix of length n-1 and A is the suffix. Then, the original string would be B + (the last character of A). Let's see. Suppose B is the prefix of length n-1 (so B is 'baba'), and A is the suffix of length n-1 (so A is 'abab'). Then, the original string s would be B + last character of A. The last character of A is 'b', so s would be 'baba' + 'b' = 'babab'. Then, the suffix of length 4 would be 'abab', which is A. But the original string is 'babab', so the suffix of length 4 is 'abab', which is correct. But then the prefix of length 4 is 'baba', which is B. So this would be another possible original string. However, in the original problem statement, the first example says that the only possible string is 'ababa'. So why is this scenario not considered?\n\nAh, because in the first example, the input includes the strings of length 4 (n-1=4) which are 'abab' and 'baba'. But when we try to assume that B is the prefix (i.e., 'baba') and A is the suffix (i.e., 'abab'), then the original string would be 'babab', which has prefixes and suffixes as follows. Let's check if the input strings for the first example match this.\n\nOriginal string 'babab' (n=5). Its prefixes of lengths 1-4 are:\n\n1: 'b'\n\n2: 'ba'\n\n3: 'bab'\n\n4: 'baba'\n\nSuffixes:\n\n1: 'b'\n\n2: 'ab'\n\n3: 'bab'\n\n4: 'abab'\n\nSo the input in the first example includes:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nWait, the input for the first example is:\n\nn=5, then the next lines are:\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nSo the input strings are:\n\n[\"ba\", \"a\", \"abab\", \"a\", \"aba\", \"baba\", \"ab\", \"aba\"]\n\nWhich are 8 strings (since 2n-2=8 for n=5).\n\nIn the case where the original string is 'babab', the prefixes and suffixes would be:\n\nprefixes of lengths 1-4:\n\n\"b\", \"ba\", \"bab\", \"baba\"\n\nsuffixes of lengths 1-4:\n\n\"b\", \"ab\", \"bab\", \"abab\"\n\nSo the input strings must include all these. Let's check if the input includes these.\n\nThe input includes \"baba\" (which is the prefix of length 4), and \"abab\" (which is the suffix of length 4). Also, the input includes \"ba\", \"a\", \"ab\", etc. However, in the input, there are two \"a\" strings. So for the original string \"babab\", the prefixes and suffixes would be:\n\nprefixes:\n\nlength 1: 'b'\n\nlength 2: 'ba'\n\nlength 3: 'bab'\n\nlength 4: 'baba'\n\nsuffixes:\n\nlength 1: 'b'\n\nlength 2: 'ab'\n\nlength 3: 'bab'\n\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nSo the set of all prefixes and suffixes would be: {'b', 'ba', 'bab', 'baba', 'ab', 'abab', 'a', ...}? Wait, but the input includes \"a\" as a string. How does that fit?\n\nIn the original string \"babab\", the prefixes of length 1 is 'b', but the input includes \"a\" as a prefix or suffix. That suggests that this scenario is invalid. Therefore, the original string must be 'ababa' as stated in the example.\n\nAh, right! Because the input includes \"a\" as one of the strings. So in the original string 'ababa', the prefixes of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a' as well. So the input has two \"a\" strings, which matches the requirement.\n\nSo for the first example, the original string must be 'ababa', and the two strings of length 4 are 'abab' (prefix) and 'baba' (suffix). Therefore, the original string can be determined by taking the prefix of length 4 (abab) and adding the last character of the suffix of length 4 (baba) which is 'a', giving abab + a = ababa.\n\nSo this suggests that for the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, and the original string can be reconstructed as prefix + last character of suffix. Or, if the other way around, but that might not fit with the other input strings.\n\nTherefore, the approach could be:\n\n- Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n- For each possible assignment of one being prefix and the other being suffix, attempt to reconstruct the original string s, then check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce we find such a valid s, we can proceed to assign the labels.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. But since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how do we know which ones are which? Because the problem requires us to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string, but the input strings may have duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich corresponds to n=3. The original string is \"aaa\". The prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input strings are two \"a\"s and two \"aa\"s. So for each of the input strings, they are either a prefix or a suffix of the original string. So in this case, any assignment that has two P's and two S's is acceptable.\n\nSo once we have s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s. However, since the input strings may have duplicates, we need to make sure that for each input string, there's a way to assign it as a prefix or suffix. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid (as per the problem statement), once we have s, there must be a way to assign the labels.\n\nBut the problem is that for some input strings, they may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the original string 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. So in such cases, we can assign it as either P or S, as long as the total count of P and S is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible candidate for the original string s (generated by considering the two possible assignments of the two length n-1 strings as prefix and suffix), check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s. If such an s exists, then proceed to assign the labels.\n\nOnce we have s, we can generate the answer by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, since there may be multiple possibilities (like for the same string appearing multiple times), we need to assign them in a way that the counts of P and S are correct.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, how to decide which label to assign?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any valid assignment is acceptable. So for such cases, we can choose arbitrarily. However, during the process of generating the answer, we need to ensure that the number of P's and S's is exactly n-1 each.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, along with their order.\n\n2. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B.\n\n3. Try both possibilities:\n\n   a. Assume A is the prefix of length n-1, B is the suffix of length n-1. Then, the original string s is A + (last character of B). \n\n   b. Assume B is the prefix of length n-1, A is the suffix of length n-1. Then, the original string s is B + (last character of A).\n\n   For each of these possibilities, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If yes, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nOnce we find such a valid s, then we can proceed to generate the answer.\n\nNow, the question is: How to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix of s (s ends with the string). If all input strings satisfy this, then s is a valid candidate.\n\nOnce we have such an s, we can proceed to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string.\n\nBut how to assign them? For each input string, we need to decide whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, since there are duplicates, we need to make sure that the count of P and S is correct.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can collect all the prefixes and suffixes of s, and then for each input string, assign it as a prefix if possible, else as a suffix, making sure that the counts are correct.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, we can note whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. For example, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can assign it as a prefix (P), else as a suffix (S). However, there might be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string \"a\" in the case of \"aaa\".\n\nBut in such cases, we can choose to assign it as P or S. However, we need to make sure that the total number of P's and S's is n-1 each.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\nOnce s is determined, collect all the prefixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1). Each input string must be in the union of these two sets.\n\nThen, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or a suffix. However, since the input strings are exactly the union of all prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be in one of the two sets.\n\nBut for the assignment, we need to select for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix. However, the problem requires that exactly n-1 of them are prefixes and n-1 are suffixes.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then we can choose to assign it as either, but we need to make sure that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut perhaps the following approach works:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can assign it as a prefix (P), unless we have already assigned too many P's. Otherwise, assign it as a suffix (S). But how to track this?\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem requires that the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes, and each of them appears exactly twice for each length except the ones that are both prefix and suffix. Wait, no. The problem states that for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. But those two could be a prefix and a suffix, or both prefixes (if the same string is a prefix and suffix for that length). For example, in the case of the string \"aaa\" (n=3), for length 1, the prefix is \"a\" and the suffix is \"a\". So both are same, hence two copies of \"a\".\n\nBut in this case, when we generate the answer, for each input string, we need to assign it as either P or S. However, the total number of P's and S's must be n-1 each. For example, in the case of \"aaa\" and n=3, there are 2n-2=4 strings. The answer must have two P's and two S's. So for the two \"a\" strings, we can assign one as P and one as S. Similarly for the two \"aa\" strings.\n\nSo, perhaps for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can mark it as a possible P. But we need to count how many P's and S's we have.\n\nBut how to do this programmatically?\n\nMaybe the following approach:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then add it to a list of possible prefixes. Similarly, check if it is a suffix of s, and add to possible suffixes. However, some strings may be both.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to selecting exactly n-1 strings to be P's (prefixes) and the rest as S's (suffixes), such that each P is a prefix of s, and each S is a suffix of s.\n\nBut how to select this? Since the input contains exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes, and each of the input strings is either a prefix or a suffix, we can proceed as follows:\n\nWe can collect all the prefixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1). There are exactly n-1 of them. Similarly for suffixes. However, some strings may be both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nBut the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, which is the sum of the prefixes and suffixes. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it appears in both lists. So the input strings are exactly the union of the prefixes and suffixes, with duplicates allowed.\n\nBut the problem says that for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So, for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of length l, then it will appear twice in the input.\n\nSo, once s is determined, we can generate all the prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes (same). Then, for each input string, it must be in either the prefixes or suffixes (or both). Now, the problem is to assign each input string to be P or S, such that exactly n-1 are P's (each of which is a prefix of s) and exactly n-1 are S's (each of which is a suffix of s).\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOne way is to collect all the prefixes of s, and for each input string, if it is a prefix, then assign it as P, but ensuring that we don't assign more than n-1 P's. Similarly for S's. But since the input contains exactly the same number of prefixes and suffixes (but overlapping), perhaps we can do the following:\n\nFor each input string, if it is a prefix and not a suffix, assign it as P. If it is a suffix and not a prefix, assign it as S. For those that are both, we can assign them as P or S, but in a way that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of P's needed is n-1, and the total number of prefixes is n-1 (each length from 1 to n-1), but some of them may overlap with suffixes.\n\nSo, for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it can be counted as a prefix or a suffix. So, the problem becomes selecting exactly n-1 strings from the input that are prefixes (possibly including those that are also suffixes), and the rest as suffixes.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate for each input string whether it is a prefix, and then assign as many as possible as P's, and the rest as S's. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for the input strings, each one is in the set of prefixes or suffixes. Let's create a list of all input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix of s. Let's count how many of them are prefixes. Let's say that the number of prefixes in the input is m. But since the input contains exactly all the prefixes and suffixes, m could be larger than n-1 if there are overlaps.\n\nBut since the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, and the total number of prefixes is n-1, and the total number of suffixes is n-1, then the number of strings that are both prefixes and suffixes is (number of prefixes + number of suffixes - number of unique strings). But perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, we can decide to assign it as P if it is a prefix, and as S otherwise. However, this may not give exactly n-1 P's. For example, if there are some strings that are both prefixes and suffixes, then assigning them as P's may lead to more than n-1 P's.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be correct, there must be a way to assign the labels.\n\nBut how to find that way?\n\nAnother idea: for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then it must be assigned as P, and if it is a suffix, then it must be assigned as S. However, this is not correct, because some strings are both. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to collect all the prefixes of s, and for each input string, if it is a prefix, then we can assign it as P, but we need to make sure that exactly n-1 are chosen. However, since the input has exactly the same number of prefixes and suffixes (with overlaps), perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nCollect all the prefixes of s. These are exactly n-1 strings (one for each length from 1 to n-1). Each of these must be present in the input. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nBut the input may have duplicates. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the prefixes of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So the input has two \"a\" strings.\n\nSo, for the assignment, we need to select exactly one occurrence of each prefix (from the input) as P, and the other occurrences as S if they are also suffixes.\n\nBut how to track which input strings correspond to which?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps a better way is:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. Then, we can collect all the input strings that are prefixes of s. Since there are exactly n-1 such strings (because the input contains exactly all prefixes and suffixes, and each prefix is present once in the input?), no, that's not correct. Because for each length, there are two strings. For example, in the case of \"aaa\" and n=3, the prefixes of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So the input has two \"a\" strings. But the prefixes of s are \"a\", \"aa\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input has two \"a\" and two \"aa\", which are all the prefixes and suffixes. So the total number of prefixes (including duplicates) is 2n-2? No, the number of prefixes is n-1 (each length once). But the input has 2n-2 strings, which are the union of prefixes and suffixes. So for each prefix, there may be one or two entries in the input, depending on whether it's also a suffix.\n\nBut regardless, once s is determined, the correct assignment is that exactly n-1 of the input strings are prefixes of s (and the rest are suffixes). So the problem reduces to selecting exactly n-1 input strings that are prefixes of s, and the rest are suffixes.\n\nSo how to select them?\n\nWe can iterate through all the input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix of s. We need to select exactly n-1 of them. However, since there are exactly n-1 prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1), but possibly with duplicates, how can we select them?\n\nBut the input contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for the prefixes of s, there are exactly n-1 unique strings (but possibly with duplicates if some prefixes are also suffixes). However, the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, which includes all the prefixes and suffixes. So for example, if a prefix is also a suffix, then it's present twice in the input.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for the input strings, select exactly n-1 of them that are prefixes of s. The rest are suffixes.\n\nBut how to do this? Well, since the input contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes, and for each prefix, there is at least one occurrence in the input, perhaps we can greedily select the first occurrence as P, and the others as S.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps the following approach:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. Keep track of how many P's we have assigned. For each input string in order, if it's a prefix and we haven't assigned enough P's yet, assign it as P. Else, assign as S.\n\nBut this may not work for all cases. However, since the input contains exactly the required number of prefixes and suffixes, this approach should work.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, after determining s as 'ababa', the prefixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'ab'\n\nlength 3: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nThe input strings are:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nSo the prefixes of s are 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab'. The input has 'a' (twice), 'ab', 'aba' (twice), 'abab'.\n\nSo when processing each input string, we can assign as P if it is a prefix and we haven't reached the required count of n-1 (which is 4 for n=5).\n\nSo for the first input string 'ba', which is not a prefix of s, assign as S.\n\nSecond input string 'a' is a prefix. Assign as P (count 1).\n\nThird input string 'abab' is a prefix (count 2).\n\nFourth input string 'a' is a prefix. Assign as P (count 3).\n\nFifth input string 'aba' is a prefix. Assign as P (count 4). Now, we have reached the required 4 P's. The remaining strings are assigned as S.\n\nBut wait, what about the sixth input string 'baba'? It is a suffix. So assigned as S.\n\nSeventh input string 'ab' is a prefix. But since we've already assigned 4 P's, we can't assign it as P. So assign as S.\n\nEighth input string 'aba' is a prefix, but again, we can't assign as P. So assign as S.\n\nThis would result in the P's being the second, third, fourth, fifth input strings. Which would be positions 2, 3, 4, 5. But the sample output for the first case is 'SPPSPSPS' which has P's at positions 2,3,5,6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Wait the sample output is SPPSPSPS. Let's count the letters:\n\nS P P S P S P S → positions 0 to 7.\n\nSo for the first input string (index 0) is S, index 1 is P, index 2 is P, index 3 is S, index 4 is P, index 5 is S, index 6 is P, index 7 is S.\n\nSo the P's are indexes 1,2,4,6. Which are the second, third, fifth, seventh input strings.\n\nBut according to our approach, the fourth input string (index 3) is 'a' (which is a prefix) and we assigned it as P. But in this case, the approach would have assigned the first four prefixes as P's. So perhaps the approach needs to consider all possibilities, but the order in which the input strings are processed can affect the assignment.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps this approach would work as long as we select exactly n-1 prefixes.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nOnce s is determined, we can loop through all the input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix. We can keep track of how many P's we have assigned so far. For each string, if it is a prefix and the count is less than n-1, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut what if there are not enough prefixes in the input? Well, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be exactly n-1 prefixes in the input.\n\nBut how to verify that? Well, the input is generated from the prefixes and suffixes of some string. So when we generate s, the input must contain exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s. Therefore, the input strings must contain exactly n-1 prefixes (counting duplicates) and n-1 suffixes (counting duplicates). For example, in the case of the first sample input, the prefixes are 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab' (four of them). The input has two 'a's, one 'ab', two 'aba's, and one 'abab'. So the total number of prefixes in the input is 2+1+2+1=6? No, no. Wait, the prefixes of s are four distinct strings, but the input contains duplicates. For example, the prefixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'a' → appears twice in input.\n\nlength 2: 'ab' → appears once.\n\nlength 3: 'aba' → appears twice.\n\nlength 4: 'abab' → appears once.\n\nSo total of 2+1+2+1 = 6? No, but the input has 8 strings. The other 2 strings are the suffixes. So for the input, the number of prefixes (including duplicates) is 2+1+2+1 = 6, and the suffixes are 2 (for 'a' and 'ab' etc.)?\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. Therefore, once we have found a valid s, the input must contain exactly n-1 prefixes (counted with multiplicity) and n-1 suffixes (counted with multiplicity). Therefore, when we process the input strings, the number of strings that are prefixes of s is exactly n-1. Therefore, the approach of greedily assigning P's until we reach n-1 is valid.\n\nBut how to count the number of prefixes in the input? Well, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. The total count should be exactly n-1. Therefore, during the assignment process, we can safely assign as many P's as needed.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings. Store them in a list called inputs.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\nFor each candidate pair (A, B):\n\n   try to build s1 as A + B[-1]\n\n   check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s1.\n\n   if yes:\n\n      proceed to generate the answer.\n\n      for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s1. assign P or S as needed.\n\n      return the generated answer.\n\n   else:\n\n      try the other possibility, B as prefix and A as suffix, building s2 as B + A[-1]\n\n      check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s2.\n\n      if yes:\n\n         proceed similarly.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, generate the answer.\n\nBut how to find the two strings of length n-1?\n\nWe can loop through the inputs and collect all strings with length n-1. Since there are exactly two of them.\n\nOnce we have them, proceed with the two possibilities.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? For example, if both possibilities generate a valid s. Then, we can pick any of them, since the problem allows any valid answer.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have the two candidates, try the first possibility (A as prefix, B as suffix), generate s1, check validity. If valid, proceed. Else, try the other way.\n\nBut how to check validity? For each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo, for the generated s, for each input string in inputs, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s.\n\nIf all are, then proceed.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then generate the answer as per the method discussed earlier.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImplement functions to check if a string is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 lines into a list called inputs.\n\nCollect the two strings of length",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is mixed. Our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidates for Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest improper prefix and suffix of `s` are of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings in the input.\n2. **Reconstruct Possible Strings**: For each pair of these candidates, attempt to reconstruct the original string `s` by assuming one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n3. **Validate Reconstructed String**: Check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the reconstructed string `s`.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Once a valid string `s` is found, determine the labels ('P' or 'S') for each input string based on whether they are prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prefix(s, candidate):\n    return s.startswith(candidate)\n\ndef is_suffix(s, candidate):\n    return s.endswith(candidate)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    inputs = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in inputs:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the two candidates\n    for i in range(2):\n        A = candidates[0]\n        B = candidates[1]\n        if i == 1:\n            A, B = B, A\n        \n        # Try to build s as A + last character of B\n        s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n        valid = True\n        for candidate in inputs:\n            if not is_prefix(s_candidate, candidate) and not is_suffix(s_candidate, candidate):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now generate the answer\n            result = []\n            p_count = 0\n            for s_str in inputs:\n                if is_prefix(s_candidate, s_str) and p_count < n-1:\n                    result.append('P')\n                    p_count += 1\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n    \n    # If none of the above worked (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    print(''.join(['P']*(n-1) + ['S']*(n-1)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing the String**: For each pair of candidates, the original string `s` is reconstructed by appending the last character of the suffix candidate to the prefix candidate.\n4. **Validation**: Each input string is checked to ensure it is either a prefix or suffix of the reconstructed string `s`.\n5. **Label Assignment**: Once a valid string `s` is confirmed, each input string is labeled 'P' if it is a prefix (up to `n-1` times) and 'S' otherwise, ensuring the correct count of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks possible reconstructions and assigns labels based on the validated structure of the string `s`, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
