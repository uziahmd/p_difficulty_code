She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about Luba closing tabs as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nLet me understand the operations. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs). Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the current position. \n\nSo the challenge is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to get rid of all tabs outside [l, r]. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the initial state. The initial a is 1, and b is n. But once she starts closing tabs, a and b change. However, since the target is to have only [l, r], maybe we can think about what needs to be closed: tabs to the left of l, and tabs to the right of r. \n\nSo the problem reduces to closing the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). \n\nBut how does the cursor movement affect this? Because to close tabs on the left, she needs to be at a certain position. For example, to close all tabs to the left of some position, she must be at that position. \n\nLet me think about the steps required. Let's consider two scenarios: closing the left side and closing the right side. \n\nFor example, if the current position is pos. Suppose we need to close tabs to the left of l. So, the left part is [1, l-1]. To close them, she needs to be at position l, then close all to the left. Similarly, for the right part, she needs to be at position r, then close all to the right. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently. Like, if she can close both sides in one go. But probably not. Because closing left or right requires being at a certain position. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Determine whether the current position is already in the target range [l, r]. If it's not, then she needs to move to a position where she can close the left and/or right parts. \n\nWait, but the target is to have only [l, r]. So, the first thing is to close all tabs to the left of l and all tabs to the right of r. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Close the left part (tabs < l)\n- Close the right part (tabs > r)\n\nBut the order might matter. Let's think about each part. \n\nFor the left part: She needs to be at position l, then close all tabs to the left. So, how many steps does that take?\n\nSimilarly, for the right part: She needs to be at position r, then close all tabs to the right. \n\nBut the question is, how to get from the initial position to these positions, and how much time that takes. \n\nBut also, perhaps she can close one side first, which changes the a and b values, which affects movement. For example, after closing the left part, the a becomes l. Then moving to the right may be easier. \n\nWait, but the movement is constrained by the current a and b. So, for example, if she closes the left part first, then the a is l, and the b is n. Then, when moving to the right, she can move freely between l and n. \n\nBut maybe there's an optimal way to do this. Let's think about the two possibilities: close left first, then right; or close right first, then left. Or maybe even do some other steps. \n\nBut let's think of the minimal steps for each case. \n\nCase 1: Close left first, then right. \n\nTo close left, she needs to be at position l. So the steps to reach l from pos. Then, close left (takes 1 second). Then, she's at position l. Now, she needs to get to position r. How many steps? Well, from l to r, which is (r - l) steps. Then, close right (another 1 second). So total steps: (steps to reach l) + 1 + (steps from l to r) + 1. \n\nBut wait, maybe she can reach l and then close left, and then from l, move to r, then close right. \n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the target range? For example, if pos is between l and r, then maybe she can just close left and right as needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the steps required. \n\nLet me think of the steps as follows:\n\nThe minimal steps required would be the sum of the steps needed to reach the positions where the closing operations can be done, plus the closing steps. \n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: The problem can be broken down into two parts: closing the left side and closing the right side. However, the order in which these are done can affect the movement steps. \n\nLet me think of the possible scenarios. \n\nFirst, determine if the current position is already in [l, r]. \n\nIf not, then she needs to move to a position where she can perform the necessary closes. \n\nBut let's think of the two options: \n\nOption A: Close the left part first, then the right part. \n\nOption B: Close the right part first, then the left part. \n\nWe need to compute the minimal steps between these options. \n\nLet's think about option A. \n\nTo close the left part, she must be at l. So the steps to get from pos to l. But during this movement, the a and b are initially 1 and n. So, movement is allowed. \n\nOnce she is at l, she can close the left part (which takes 1 second). Now, the a becomes l, and the b remains n. Then, she needs to get to r. Since the current position is l, and the new a is l, and the new b is n. So movement from l to r takes (r - l) steps. Then, she can close the right part (taking 1 second). \n\nTotal steps: (steps to reach l) + 1 + (steps from l to r) + 1. \n\nBut steps to reach l is the absolute difference between pos and l, since she can move directly. \n\nWait, but movement is allowed step by step. So moving from pos to l takes |pos - l| steps. \n\nSimilarly, moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps. \n\nSo for option A, the total steps would be |pos - l| + 1 (close left) + (r - l) steps to reach r + 1 (close right). \n\nBut wait, after closing the left part, the a is l, and the b is n. So when moving to r, she can move freely between l and n. So yes, moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps. \n\nOption B: Close the right part first, then the left part. \n\nTo close the right part, she must be at r. Steps to reach r from pos is |pos - r|. Then, close right (1 sec). Now, the b is r, and the a is 1. Then, she needs to move to l. Which takes |r - l| steps. Then close left (1 sec). \n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1. \n\nBut wait, after closing the right part, the current position is at r. Then, moving to l would take (r - l) steps (since she can move left from r to l). \n\nSo for option B, total steps: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1. \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. What if she can close both sides in a way that doesn't require moving from l to r? For example, if the current position is already in the target range. \n\nWait, what if l = r? Then, she needs to close everything except that tab. But if she is already at that tab, then she can close left and right. \n\nBut let's think of the general case. \n\nBut there's another possibility: maybe she can close both left and right in one operation. But that's not possible unless she is at a position that allows that. For example, if she is at l, then closing left (which would close tabs before l) and then closing right (tabs after r). But that's not possible unless she is at r. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close left and right in a single move. No, because the closing operations are either left or right. So to close all tabs left of l, she has to be at l, and close left. To close all tabs right of r, she has to be at r, and close right. \n\nSo the two steps are necessary. \n\nNow, the minimal between option A and option B. \n\nBut what if the target is already in the current position? For example, if pos is between l and r. Then, she can close the left and right parts. \n\nWait, for example, if the current position is at l. Then, closing the left part (which is tabs before l) would take 1 second. Then, she can move to r, and close the right part. \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. \n\nBut let's think of the minimal steps. \n\nAnother scenario: suppose she can close both sides from the same position. For example, if she is at l, and r is equal to l. Then, no need to move. But that's a special case. \n\nBut in general, the steps required are: \n\nIf the current position is already in the target range, then she can choose to move to l (if not already there), close left, then move to r and close right. Or move to r first. \n\nBut what if she can close both sides from her current position? Like, if she is at l and r is l. \n\nBut in general, the problem is that she has to close the left part and the right part. So, the minimal steps would be the sum of steps to reach l (if needed) and steps to reach r (if needed), plus two closing operations. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize. For example, if she is already in the target range, then she can reach l and r with minimal steps. \n\nLet me think of the steps required when the current pos is in [l, r]. \n\nIn this case, she can move to l, close left (tabs before l). Then, move to r, close right (tabs after r). \n\nBut the steps to move from pos to l is |pos - l|. Then, steps from l to r is (r - l). \n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2. \n\nAlternatively, she can move to r first, then move to l. \n\nWhich would be |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2. \n\nBut which is better? Well, depends on pos. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do something smarter. For example, if she is already at l, then she can close left (1 sec), then move to r (r - l steps) and close right (another 1 sec). Total steps: (r - l) + 2. \n\nBut what if she is at r? Then, close right (1 sec) and move to l (r - l steps) and close left (another 1 sec). Same steps. \n\nBut if she is in the middle, like pos is between l and r. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is the minimal between the two options (closing left first or right first). \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if she can close both left and right in a way that requires less movement. \n\nBut I don't think so. Because to close left and right, she needs to be at l and r respectively. \n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the minimum between the two options (A and B) discussed earlier. \n\nBut what if the target is such that l = r? Then, she needs to close all tabs except that one. So, for example, if l = r = x, then she needs to close all tabs to the left of x and all to the right of x. \n\nBut how? Well, she can be at x, close left (which closes all tabs before x) and then close right (which closes all tabs after x). \n\nBut in that case, the steps would be: \n\nIf pos is already x, then steps: 1 (close left) + 1 (close right) = 2 seconds. \n\nBut how about movement? Because when you close left, you are still at x. Then, closing right is possible. \n\nSo, in that case, the steps would be 2 seconds. \n\nBut what if she can close both in one operation? No, because closing left closes all to the left, and closing right closes all to the right. So, she has to do two operations. \n\nSo, back to the general case. \n\nSo, the steps required would be:\n\nIf the target is [l, r], then:\n\n- She needs to close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). \n\nTo do this, she must be at l to close left, and at r to close right. \n\nSo, the steps required depend on how she gets from her current position to l and r, and the order of closing. \n\nBut what if she can do something like: move to l, close left, then move to r and close right. \n\nOr move to r, close right, then move to l and close left. \n\nWhich is better? \n\nSo, the steps for the first option (l then r):\n\nsteps_to_l = |pos - l|\n\nsteps_from_l_to_r = r - l \n\ntotal_steps = steps_to_l + 1 (close left) + steps_from_l_to_r + 1 (close right) \n\nSimilarly for the other option (r then l):\n\nsteps_to_r = |pos - r|\n\nsteps_from_r_to_l = r - l \n\ntotal_steps = steps_to_r + 1 + steps_from_r_to_l + 1 \n\nWait, steps_from_r_to_l is r - l? No, if she is at r and needs to get to l, that's (r - l) steps to the left. \n\nYes. So the steps_from_r_to_l is (r - l). \n\nSo, the total steps for the two options would be:\n\nOption 1: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 \n\nOption 2: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 \n\nSo the minimal between these two options. \n\nBut why? Because after closing left, she needs to move from l to r (r - l steps). After closing right, she needs to move from r to l (r - l steps). \n\nBut wait, in option 1, after closing left, the current position is l. Then, moving to r takes (r - l) steps. Then, closing right. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nSo the minimal steps between option 1 and option 2. \n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, if she can reach both l and r in a way that requires less steps. \n\nAlternatively, what if she is already in the target range? For example, if pos is between l and r. \n\nLet me take the example from the problem statement. \n\nFirst example input: 6 3 2 4. \n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. \n\nSo l=2, r=4. \n\nSo the steps for option 1: |3 - 2| = 1 step to reach l. Then steps from l to r is 4-2=2 steps. So total steps 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample output. \n\nYes, the sample output is 5. \n\nAnother sample input is 6 3 1 3. \n\nSo l=1, r=3. \n\nSo the target is [1,3]. \n\nSo the left part is nothing (since l=1). So she only needs to close the right part. \n\nBut how? \n\nShe needs to be at r=3, then close all to the right. \n\nCurrent pos is 3. So steps to reach r is 0. Then close right (1 second). So total steps 1. Which matches the sample. \n\nAnother sample is 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So all tabs are kept. So no steps needed. \n\nSo, the code needs to handle cases where l=1 and r=n. \n\nSo, how to model this? \n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nCheck if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nIf not, then she needs to move to l or r, etc. \n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Then, she doesn't need to close any tabs. So the answer is 0. \n\nSo first, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then answer is 0. \n\nOtherwise, we need to calculate the steps. \n\nBut wait, even if l is 1 and r is not n, then she needs to close the right part. \n\nSo, the first thing is to check if the target is the entire range. If so, then 0. \n\nElse, proceed. \n\nSo, the code can start by checking if l == 1 and r == n. Then return 0. \n\nElse, we need to calculate the steps. \n\nNow, the next thing is to check if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nIf it is, then she can move to l (if needed) and r (if needed). \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. \n\nBut let's think again. \n\nThe problem is to close all tabs outside [l, r]. \n\nSo, the left part is [1, l-1], the right part is [r+1, n]. \n\nSo, to close the left part, she needs to be at l, and close left. \n\nTo close the right part, she needs to be at r, and close right. \n\nBut what if l is 1? Then, there's no left part to close. So she doesn't need to do anything for the left part. \n\nSimilarly, if r is n, then no right part. \n\nSo, the steps required depend on whether l is 1 or not, and whether r is n or not. \n\nSo, the code needs to handle these cases. \n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- If l == 1 and r == n: return 0.\n\nElse:\n\n- Compute the steps required to close the left part (if needed) and the steps to close the right part (if needed). \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think. \n\nIf l > 1: she needs to close the left part. \n\nIf r < n: she needs to close the right part. \n\nSo, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and n is 6. Then, she needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6). \n\nSo, the steps for closing left and right. \n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps for that. \n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n. \n\nBut even if l>1, but r is n, then only the left part needs to be closed. \n\nSo, the code can be broken into:\n\ncases:\n\nCase 1: Need to close left and right. \n\nCase 2: Need to close only left. \n\nCase 3: Need to close only right. \n\nCase 4: Need to close neither (already handled by the initial check). \n\nSo, let's think about each case. \n\nCase 2: Only left. \n\nSo, l > 1, r = n. \n\nSo, she needs to close left part. \n\nHow? She needs to reach l, then close left. \n\nSo steps: |pos - l| + 1. \n\nBut wait, after closing left, she's done. \n\nCase 3: Only right. \n\nSimilarly, steps: |pos - r| + 1. \n\nCase 1: Need to close both left and right. \n\nThen, the steps are the minimum between the two options (option A and B) discussed earlier. \n\nBut what if she is already in the [l, r] range? \n\nIn that case, she can reach l and r with steps. \n\nBut what if she is already at l? Then, steps to reach l is zero. Then, steps to reach r is (r - l). \n\nSo, steps would be 0 + (r - l) + 2 (for the two closes). \n\nBut in that case, the total is (r - l) + 2. \n\nBut what if she is already at r? Then steps to reach r is zero, steps to reach l is (r - l). \n\nSame steps. \n\nBut what if she is in between l and r? \n\nFor example, pos is in the middle. \n\nSo, the code needs to compute the minimal steps between the two options (A and B). \n\nSo, putting it all together. \n\nSo, the algorithm steps:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l == 1 (so no left to close) or r == n (no right to close). \n\nIf only left to close (r == n):\n\nthen steps is steps to reach l (from pos) + 1 (close left). \n\nIf only right to close (l == 1):\n\nsteps is steps to reach r (from pos) + 1 (close right). \n\nElse (both left and right need to be closed):\n\ncompute option1: steps to reach l from pos + (r - l) steps to reach r from l + 2 (the two closes). \n\ncompute option2: steps to reach r from pos + (r - l) steps to reach l from r + 2. \n\ntake the minimum of option1 and option2. \n\nBut wait, in option1, after reaching l, moving to r takes (r - l) steps. \n\nIn option2, after reaching r, moving to l takes (r - l) steps. \n\nSo, the code for this case is min( (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2 ), (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 )) \n\nBut wait, the (r - l) is the same for both options. So the difference is between abs(pos - l) and abs(pos - r). \n\nSo, the minimal between (abs(pos - l) + ...) and (abs(pos - r) + ...). \n\nSo, the minimal is (min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )) + (r - l) + 2. \n\nBut this is only if both left and right need to be closed. \n\nBut wait, let's take the first sample input. \n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4. \n\nl=2, r=4. \n\nSo, both left and right need to be closed. \n\nabs(pos - l) is 1 (3-2=1). \n\nabs(pos - r) is 1 (4-3=1). \n\nso min(1, 1) is 1. \n\nplus (4-2) = 2. \n\nplus 2. \n\nTotal 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample. \n\nAnother example: if pos is 1, l=2, r=4. \n\nSo, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6). \n\nabs(pos - l) is 1. \n\nabs(pos - r) is 3. \n\nso min is 1. \n\nthen 4-2=2. \n\nso total steps 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\nWhich would be: move to l (2) in 1 step, close left (1 sec), move to r (4) in 2 steps, close right (1 sec). Total 1+1+2+1=5. \n\nYes. \n\nSo that seems correct. \n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if l == 1:\n\n        # only need to close right\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    elif r == n:\n\n        # only need to close left\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # need to close both\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range? \n\nLike, for example, in the second sample input: 6 3 1 3. \n\nHere, l=1, r=3. So, since l=1, the code checks if l == 1, then steps is abs(pos - r) + 1. \n\npos is 3, r is 3. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample. \n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. \n\nIn this case, l=1 and r=5, which is the entire range. So steps is 0. \n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=4. \n\nSo, l=1, r=4. Since l=1, code checks for that case. \n\nsteps is abs(pos - r) + 1. \n\npos is 2, r is 4. So steps is 2 steps (move to 4) + 1 (close right). So total 3 steps. \n\nBut what's the actual steps? \n\nShe needs to close tabs >4, which is tab 5. \n\nTo do that, she needs to be at r=4. \n\nShe is at 2. So moving to 4 takes 2 steps. Then close right (1 sec). \n\nTotal 3 steps. Correct. \n\nAnother example: pos is already at r. \n\nSo, for example, pos=4, l=1, r=4. Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, pos=3. \n\nSo, both left and right need to be closed. \n\noption1 is |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\noption2 is |3-4| + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So steps is 5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nWhat about when the pos is outside the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, n=6, pos=1, l=2, r=4. \n\nSo, l=2, r=4. Both need to be closed. \n\noption1: |1-2| + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\noption2: |1-4| + 2 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. So min is 5. \n\nSo steps would be 5. \n\nHow? \n\nMove from 1 to 2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1) (1 sec). Then move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), close right (tabs 5,6) (1 sec). Total 1+1+2+1 = 5. Correct. \n\nAnother case: pos is 6, l=2, r=4. \n\noption1: |6-2| =4, plus 2 steps (4-2) + 2 → 4+2+2=8. \n\noption2: |6-4|=2, plus 2 steps (4-2) + 2 → 2+2+2=6. So min is 6. \n\nWhich would be: move from 6 to 4 (2 steps), close right (tabs 5,6?), wait. Wait, when you are at r=4, closing right closes all tabs to the right of 4, i.e., 5 and 6. So that's correct. Then, move from 4 to 2 (2 steps), close left (tabs 1). So total steps: 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) → 6 steps. Correct. \n\nSo, this seems to work. \n\nNow, let's check the third sample input: 5 2 1 5. \n\nHere, l=1 and r=5, which is the entire range. So output is 0. \n\nAnother case: when pos is outside [l, r]. For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. \n\nSo, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). \n\nSo, steps would be: \n\noption1: |1-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. \n\noption2: |1-3| + 1 + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. So min is 4. \n\nWhich is: move to 2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1) (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 step), close right (tabs 4,5) (1 sec). Total steps 1+1+1+1=4. Correct. \n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases. \n\nBut wait, what about when l=3 and r=3. Then, need to close left (tabs 1-2) and right (tabs 4-n). \n\nSo, for example, n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=3. \n\nSo, steps would be:\n\noption1: |1-3| + (3-3) + 2 → 2 + 0 + 2 = 4. \n\noption2: |1-3| + 0 + 2 → same. \n\nSo steps is 4. \n\nWhich would be: move to 3 (2 steps), close left (tabs 1-2) (1 sec). Then move to 3 (already there) and close right (tabs 4-5) (1 sec). So total steps 2+1+0+1=4. Correct. \n\nAnother case: pos is already at l. \n\nn=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. \n\nsteps is min( |3-3| + 0 + 2, |3-3| + 0 + 2 ) → 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. \n\nWhich is correct: close left (tabs 1-2) and close right (tabs 4-5). \n\nSo, two steps. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases. \n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r. \n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if l == 1:\n\n        # only need to close right part\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    elif r == n:\n\n        # only need to close left part\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # need to close both\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but wait. What if l is not 1, but the left part is already closed? No. Because the code only checks if l is 1. \n\nWait, no. The code checks if l == 1. If not, then it's possible that l is not 1. So, the code assumes that the left part (tabs < l) must be closed. \n\nBut what if l is 2 and r is 4, and the current pos is 1. \n\nBut the code will handle it. \n\nBut what if the pos is already to the left of l? For example, pos is 1, l=2, r=4. \n\nIn that case, the code computes steps for closing both left and right. \n\nWhich would be:\n\noption1: |1 - 2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nBut what if the current pos is already to the left of l? \n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nBut wait, what if the current pos is to the left of l, and we need to close the left part. \n\nFor example, l=2, r=4. \n\nBut the current pos is 1. \n\nSo, to close the left part (tabs < l, which is tab 1). \n\nBut to close the left part, she needs to be at l (2). \n\nSo, the code correctly calculates steps to reach l (1 step from 1 to 2), then close left (tabs < 2, which is 1). \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code seems to handle that. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → output 5. \n\nWhich is handled as follows: l is not 1, r is not 6. \n\nSo, option1 is |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. \n\noption2 is |3-4| + 2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. min is 5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: 6 3 1 3. \n\nl is 1. So steps is |3-3| + 1 = 0 + 1 =1. Correct. \n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5 → output 0. \n\nSo, code works. \n\nBut wait, what if l=2 and r=3, and pos is 1. \n\nSo, code says: since l is not 1 and r is not 5 (assuming n=5). \n\nSo, need to close both. \n\noption1: |1-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 1 +1 +2=4. \n\noption2: |1-3| + 1 + 2 → 2 +1 +2=5. \n\nso steps is 4. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases. \n\nBut what about when the current pos is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. \n\nSo, steps is min( |3-2| + (4-2) + 2, |3-4| + (4-2) + 2) → min(1 + 2 + 2=5, 1 + 2 + 2=5) → 5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case: pos=2, l=2, r=4. \n\nSo, steps for option1: |2-2| + 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 + 2 =4. \n\nWhich is moving to l (already there), then move to r (2 steps), close right. \n\nSo steps: 0 (move) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move) + 1 (close right) → total 4. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code seems correct. \n\nNow, let's think about edge cases. \n\nEdge case 1: l = r = 1. \n\nn=1, pos=1, l=1, r=1. Output is 0. \n\nEdge case 2: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Output is 0. \n\nEdge case 3: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. \n\nSo, need to close right part (tabs >1). \n\nsteps is |1 - 1| + 1 = 0 + 1 =1. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother edge case: n=2, pos=1, l=2, r=2. \n\nSo, l is not 1, r is 2 (n=2). So, code checks if r == n → yes. \n\nSo steps is |1 - l| + 1 → |1-2| +1 → 1 +1=2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nBecause she needs to move from 1 to 2 (1 step), then close left (tabs <2, which is 1). So steps: 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=3, l=1, r=2. \n\nSo, need to close right part (tabs >2, which is 3). \n\nSo, code says l is 1, so steps is |3 - 2| + 1 = 1 +1=2. \n\nWhich is correct: move from 3 to 2 (1 step), close right (tabs 3). \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=3, l=2, r=2. \n\nSo, code checks",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right and closing all tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no actions are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Closing Only Left Segment**: If the right end of the segment is the last tab (r = n), only the left segment needs to be closed. Calculate the steps required to move to the left segment's start (l) and close it.\n3. **Closing Only Right Segment**: If the left end of the segment is the first tab (l = 1), only the right segment needs to be closed. Calculate the steps required to move to the right segment's end (r) and close it.\n4. **Closing Both Segments**: If both segments need to be closed, compute the minimum steps required by considering two strategies:\n   - Moving to the left segment's start (l), then moving to the right segment's end (r).\n   - Moving to the right segment's end (r), then moving to the left segment's start (l).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if l == 1:\n        # Only need to close right part\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    elif r == n:\n        # Only need to close left part\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    else:\n        # Need to close both\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Single Segment Closure**: If only one side needs closure, calculate the steps required to move to the respective segment's boundary and close it.\n- **Dual Segment Closure**: When both sides need closure, evaluate the minimum steps required by considering both possible orders of closure (left first or right first). This ensures optimal movement and closure operations, minimizing the total time spent.",
