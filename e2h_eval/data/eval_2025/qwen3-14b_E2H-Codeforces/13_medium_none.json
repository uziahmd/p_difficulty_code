For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes. So each note has a position in this list. For example, C is position 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is position 11. Then, the next note after H is C again (position 0).\n\nThe distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. So for example, between C and E: the positions are 0 and 4 (since C is 0, then C#, D, D#, E is 4). So the distance is 4 semitones. But if it's E to C, then since we need to go from lower to upper, but E is higher than C. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the upper. So if you have two notes, say X and Y, the distance is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? No, because if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y + 12 - X)? Because the distance is measured along the scale from lower to upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is (C's position + 12 - E's position) semitones? Let me think. Let's take the example given: the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. That's correct. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because from E to C, you can go up by 8 semitones (E to F is 1, F to F# 2, etc. up to C). Or maybe the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, but that would give negative numbers. Wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So for example, if X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is larger than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is smaller than X, then (Y - X) would be negative. But modulo 12 would give a positive value. Let's see: for example, X is E (4), Y is C (0). (Y - X) is -4. mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So when you have two notes, the distance is the number of semitones you need to go up from the lower note to reach the upper note. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. Because for example, if Y is lower than X, then (Y - X) is negative, but mod 12 gives the correct positive value. So for example, (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as from the lower to the upper. So the distance is always non-negative, and equals the minimal number of semitones to go up from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. So, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is larger than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12. But wait, (Y - X) mod 12 is the same as (Y - X + 12) % 12. So for example, when Y is less than X, (Y - X) is negative, but adding 12 and mod 12 gives the correct value. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % 12. But wait, no. Because if Y is higher than X, then (Y - X) is positive, and mod 12 is same as the value. But for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4. Which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lowest to the upper. So when you have two notes, the distance is the number of semitones between them when moving upward from the lower note. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which is exactly (Y - X) mod 12. So that's the formula.\n\nNow, the problem defines a major triad. A triad is a set of three notes. The triad is major if there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Then the distance between X and Z is 7 (since 4+3=7). Similarly, for minor, there's an ordering where X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n\nSo the approach is: given three notes, check all possible permutations of them. For each permutation, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have a distance of 3. If any permutation satisfies that, then it's a major chord. Similarly for minor. If neither, then it's strange.\n\nBut how do I generate all permutations of the three notes? Well, since the order matters for checking the distances. For example, for a major chord, the order X, Y, Z must have X to Y as 4, Y to Z as 3. So for three notes, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation, check if the first two steps meet the criteria.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think: for the three notes, the order could be any of the possible permutations. For each permutation, check if the first two steps meet the criteria.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert each note into its position in the list of notes. For example, create a dictionary mapping note names to their index.\n\n2. For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (there are 6 permutations of three elements).\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check:\n\n   a. For major: distance(X,Y) == 4 and distance(Y,Z) == 3.\n\n   b. For minor: distance(X,Y) == 3 and distance(Y,Z) ==4.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, 'strange'.\n\nSo the first thing is to create a mapping from note names to their positions.\n\nThe note order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the example, the third input is 'A B H', which is A, B, H. Let's check the order. Let me list the indexes:\n\nLet me create a list of the notes in order. Let me see:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nNotes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, but then H is the last note. Then, after H comes C again.\n\nSo the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but what about the note B? In some systems, B is followed by C. So in this list, B is at index 10, H is at index 11. Then, after H comes C again.\n\nSo the code will need to map each note to its index. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, etc., 'H' is 11.\n\nSo, the first step is to create a dictionary that maps note names to their index. Let's code that.\n\nOnce that's done, for each input note, we can get their indices.\n\nThen, for all permutations of the three notes, check for major and minor conditions.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So there's no case where a chord is both major and minor. So once any permutation meets the major condition, we can return 'major' immediately, and similarly for minor.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nRead three notes as input. Let's say they are stored as a list, e.g., notes = [note1, note2, note3]\n\nGenerate all permutations of these three notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor condition.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. Else, 'strange'.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations in Python. The itertools.permutations function can be used. For example, itertools.permutations(notes, 3) gives all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nBut since the input is three distinct notes (assuming that the input is three different notes?), but the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. However, the problem statement says that a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the input is exactly three notes. So the input may have duplicates? Well, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, but perhaps the code should handle cases where the three notes are not distinct. However, the problem says that the input is three notes. But according to the problem description, the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So perhaps the input can have duplicates, but according to the problem statement, the answer will be unambiguous. But for the code, perhaps the code can process any three notes, even if they are same. But in that case, for example, if all three are same, then the distances between them would be zero, so no way to satisfy major or minor.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So regardless of the input, the code can check.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead three notes from input. Split into a list.\n\nCreate a list of the three notes. Then generate all permutations of this list.\n\nFor each permutation, check for major and minor conditions.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two notes. Let's write a helper function.\n\nFor two notes, X and Y, get their indices, x and y. Then compute (y - x) mod 12. But wait, the distance is from X to Y. So for example, if X is C (0), Y is E (4), distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the helper function for distance between X and Y is (y - x) % 12.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to upper. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the helper function would be:\n\ndef distance(x, y):\n\n    return (y - x) % 12\n\nBut wait, let's test with examples.\n\nFor X = C (0), Y = E (4): (4-0) mod 12 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor X = E (4), Y = C (0): (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: X = H (11), Y = C (0). (0 -11) mod 12 is 1. Because 0-11 = -11, mod 12 is 1. Which is correct: H to C is 1 semitone.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the helper function is correct.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the three notes, let's take X, Y, Z. Check for major: distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. For minor: distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check those two conditions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, for the input notes, say, input_notes = list of three strings.\n\nThen, for each perm in permutations(input_notes):\n\n    x = perm[0]\n\n    y = perm[1]\n\n    z = perm[2]\n\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        return 'major'\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        return 'minor'\n\nSo, once any permutation satisfies either condition, we can return the corresponding result.\n\nBut since there are multiple permutations, we need to check all permutations and see if any of them meets the condition.\n\nSo, in code, we can loop through all permutations, and check for major or minor. Once a major is found, return 'major', same for minor. Otherwise, after checking all permutations, return 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nRead the input line as a list of three notes.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   compute d1 (distance between first and second note)\n\n   compute d2 (distance between second and third note)\n\n   if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n\n   if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, the code needs to check all permutations. For example, in the first sample input, 'C E G' → permutations include (C, E, G), which gives d1 = 4, d2 = 3 → major. So returns 'major'.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' → in one of the permutations, like B, C#, F → d1 between B and C# is (C# is index 1, B is index 10. So (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. So d1 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): (5-1) =4 → d2 is 4. So that's minor. So returns 'minor'.\n\nThird example: 'A B H'. Let's see. Let's check all permutations.\n\nNotes are A, B, H.\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nA B H:\n\nd1 between A (index 9) and B (10) → 10-9=1 → mod 12 is 1. Not 3 or 4. Then d2 between B and H (index 11) → 11-10=1. So no.\n\nA H B:\n\nd1 between A (9) and H (11): 11-9=2. d2 between H (11) and B (10): (10 - 11) mod 12 = 11. So no.\n\nB A H:\n\nd1 between B (10) and A (9): (9-10) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nB H A: d1 between B and H is 11-10 =1. Then between H (11) and A (9): (9-11) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nH A B: d1 between H (11) and A (9): (9 -11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nH B A: d1 between H (11) and B (10): (10 -11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nThen, read the input. The input is a single line with three notes. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] but that's probably a list of test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut the actual input for the program is a single line of three notes. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is \"the only line contains 3 space-separated notes\". So the sample input shows that the input is three notes, but the sample input is given as a list of three examples. But perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases. However, in the problem statement, the user is to write a Python script that reads from stdin. So for example, the sample input is:\n\nFor example, the input could be:\n\nC E G\n\nWhich outputs 'major'.\n\nBut in the sample provided, the input is given as a list of three examples, but that's perhaps the sample input and output. For example, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nOutput:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because the actual input is a single line with three notes. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So the code should read one line, split into three notes.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the input is something like:\n\nC E G\n\nand the output is major.\n\nBut in the sample given, the input is given as a list of three examples. That's probably a formatting error, but the actual code needs to read a single line with three notes.\n\nSo the code should read the input line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\nThen, input_notes is a list of three strings.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of input_notes.\n\nFor each permutation in permutations(input_notes):\n\n   x, y, z = permutation\n\n   x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n   y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n   z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print(\"major\")\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print(\"minor\")\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print \"strange\".\n\nBut wait, the code needs to check all permutations, and if any of them satisfies major or minor, then output accordingly. So the code can check each permutation in order, and as soon as one is found, output and exit.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? For example, in the first sample input, the first permutation (C, E, G) would be checked, and since d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, it would print 'major' and exit.\n\nBut the code needs to check all permutations, but for the first occurrence of a major or minor, it can exit early.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function can be done via return in a function, but since it's a script, perhaps using sys.exit() or breaking after finding.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nOnce any permutation meets the condition, print the result and exit.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n    input_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\n    for perm in permutations(input_notes):\n\n        x, y, z = perm\n\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n\n            print(\"major\")\n\n            return\n\n        elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n            print(\"minor\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third example is 'A B H' which outputs 'strange'.\n\nTesting that code for that case.\n\nLet me see.\n\ninput_notes is ['A', 'B', 'H']\n\npermutations would generate all 6 possibilities.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nTake (A, B, H):\n\nx = A (index 9), y = B (10), z = H (11).\n\nd1 = (10-9) mod 12 = 1. d2 = (11 - 10) mod 12 = 1 → no.\n\nNext permutation (A, H, B):\n\nx = A (9), y = H (11). d1 is (11-9) mod 12 = 2. d2 is (B's index (10) - H's index (11)) mod 12 → (10-11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nNext (B, A, H):\n\nx is B (10), y is A (9). d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nNext (B, H, A):\n\nd1 between B (10) and H (11) is 1. d2 between H (11) and A (9) is (9-11) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nNext (H, A, B):\n\nx is H (11), y is A (9). d1 is (9-11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nNext (H, B, A):\n\nx is H (11), y is B (10). d1 is (10 -11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo all permutations are checked, and none meet the conditions. So code prints 'strange'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# B F' → input_notes is ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nCheck permutations. One of the permutations is B, C#, F.\n\nx is B (10), y is C# (1). d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then y is C#, z is F (5). d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 = 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G' → permutation (C, E, G) → d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → major.\n\nSo code returns 'major'.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if the same note appears multiple times? For example, input is ['C', 'C', 'C'].\n\nThen, all permutations would have d1 and d2 as 0. So no match. Output 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: input is ['C', 'E', 'G'] → major.\n\nAnother case: input is ['C', 'E', 'G#'] → check permutations. For example, C, E, G# → d1 between C and E is 4. d2 between E (4) and G# (8). (8-4) mod 12 is 4. So d1=4 and d2=4 → not major. So no. Other permutations?\n\nE, C, G# → d1 between E and C is (C's index (0) - E's index (4)) mod 12 → (0-4) mod 12 = 8. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nWhat about another permutation: E, G#, C? Let's see:\n\nd1 between E (4) and G# (8): 8-4=4. d2 between G# (8) and C (0): (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. No.\n\nSo this chord would be strange.\n\nAnother example: input is ['C', 'E', 'B'].\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nC, E, B → d1 is 4. d2 between E (4) and B (10) → (10-4) mod 12 is 6. No.\n\nC, B, E → d1 between C (0) and B (10): (10 -0) mod 12 =10. No.\n\nE, C, B → d1 is (C - E) → (0-4) mod 12 = 8. No.\n\nE, B, C → d1 between E (4) and B (10) is 6. d2 between B and C is (0 -10) mod 12 = 2. No.\n\nB, C, E → d1 between B (10) and C (0): (0-10) mod 12 = 2. No.\n\nB, E, C → d1 between B (10) and E (4): (4-10) mod 12 = ( -6 ) mod 12 = 6. No.\n\nSo output strange.\n\nAnother test case: minor triad.\n\nLet's take input ['B', 'C#', 'F'].\n\nPermutation B, C#, F → d1 is (C# - B) → 1 -10 = -9 mod 12 is 3. Then d2 is F (5) - C# (1) =4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns minor.\n\nAnother example: input ['C#', 'B', 'F'] → same as above.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, with necessary imports.\n\nThe code uses itertools.permutations, so need to import that.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    input_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    for perm in permutations(input_notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → output 'major'.\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → output 'minor'.\n\nSample Input: 'A B H' → output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['C', 'E', 'G'] → major.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['B', 'C#', 'F'] → minor.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['C', 'E', 'G#'] → strange.\n\nNow, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic sequence of 12 musical notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes to check each possible ordering.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Triad Classification**: Check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note, match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation meets these criteria, classify the triad accordingly. If none do, classify it as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    input_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    for perm in permutations(input_notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its position in this list.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into three notes.\n3. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n5. **Classification Check**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor triads. If a valid triad is found, the result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
