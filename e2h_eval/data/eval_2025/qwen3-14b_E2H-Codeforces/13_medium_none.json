For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, but then after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic. So each note has a position in this list, and the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones when moving from the lower to the higher note. For example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check that. Let's see the order:\n\nC is index 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. So from C to E is 4 semitones (since each step is one semitone). So yes. Then between E and C, since it's the other way around, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. Wait, but how do you determine which is lower? Because the notes are cyclic. So for example, if you have two notes, X and Y, the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but only if Y is higher than X? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale. So for example, between C and E is 4 semitones. But between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because if you go from E to C, you can go up by 8 semitones (since there are 12 total, so 12 - (4) = 8? Wait, no. Let me think. If you have two notes, the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones you need to move upwards from X to reach Y. So if X is C (position 0), Y is E (position 4), then the distance is 4. But if X is E (position 4), Y is C (position 0), then moving upwards from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12? No, because if Y is before X, then (Y_pos - X_pos) would be negative. Wait, but the distance is always calculated as the minimal number of steps when moving upwards. Wait no, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the upper. So if you have two notes, the distance is the number of semitones between them when you go from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because C is higher than E. Wait, but how do you determine which is lower? Because the notes are cyclic. So perhaps the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X, otherwise (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when you go from X to Y in the upward direction. So for example, if X is C (0), Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then the distance is 8 (because you have to go up 8 steps to get from E to C). So the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y_pos >= X_pos, else (Y_pos + 12 - X_pos). Which can also be written as (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12? Wait, no. Because (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12 would give the difference in the upward direction. For example, if Y is C (0) and X is E (4), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is the correct distance. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the formula is (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y_pos >= X_pos else (Y_pos + 12 - X_pos). Which is equivalent to (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12, but only if we take the positive value. Wait, but (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12 gives a value between 0 and 11. For example, if X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, if X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8 semitones. So the formula (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct distance. So that's how I can calculate the distance between two notes.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its position in the list. Let's create a dictionary for that. The notes are ordered as follows:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, wait, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as written. So the index for each note is:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F# 6, G 7, G# 8, A 9, B 10, H 11.\n\nSo for example, H is at index 11. Then after H comes C again.\n\nSo, for each note, I can find its position in this list. So the first thing is to create a mapping from note names to their indices. So for example, note_map['C'] = 0, note_map['C#'] = 1, etc.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. Wait, but what if the mod gives a negative number? Well, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. For example, (0 - 4) % 12 is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo, given three notes, say A, B, C, I need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nFor a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. For minor, the same but with 3 and 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. However, since the order of checking can be optimized, perhaps we can generate all permutations of the three notes and check for each permutation if it meets the criteria.\n\nBut for three elements, there are 6 permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3 (for major), or first to second is 3, second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. For example, for a major chord, the total distance between X and Z would be 4 + 3 = 7. But since the notes are cyclic, perhaps there are other possibilities. However, the problem defines that for a major triad, the distance between X and Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So the order matters here. So for any permutation of the three notes, we need to check if any of the possible orderings satisfies the condition.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (all possible orderings of the three notes).\n\n- For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   - Check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If yes, then it's a major chord.\n\n   - Check if the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. If yes, then it's a minor chord.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies the major condition, then output \"major\". Similarly for minor. If none, output \"strange\".\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both major and minor are possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n\n2. For each of the three notes, get their positions in the note_order list.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n4. For each permutation, check for major and minor conditions.\n\n5. If any permutation meets major, return 'major'; if any meets minor, return 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for the three notes, permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. So for example, the input could be 'C E G' which is split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo, first, I need to parse the input. The input is a single line with three notes, separated by spaces. So the code will read the input line, split into three elements.\n\nNow, for the note_order list. Let's create a list that contains the notes in the correct order. Then create a dictionary mapping each note to its index.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes, that's the order. So the note_order list is as above.\n\nSo, the note_map can be built as {note: index for index, note in enumerate(note_order)}.\n\nOnce we have that, for each note in the input, we can get their positions.\n\nSo, for example, for the input 'C E G', the positions are 0, 4, 7.\n\nNow, for each permutation of these three positions, check the distances.\n\nLet me take the example given. The first example is 'C E G'. The permutations would include (C, E, G). Let's check:\n\ndistance from C to E is (4 - 0) = 4. Then E to G is (7 - 4) = 3. So yes, this permutation satisfies the major condition. So the answer is 'major'.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' — the input is C#, B, F. Let's see. The note_order for C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5. Now, the permutation B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\ndistance from B (10) to C# (1): (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then from C# (1) to F (5): (5 - 1) = 4. So that's 4 semitones. So this permutation satisfies the minor condition. Hence, the answer is minor.\n\nSo the code needs to generate all permutations of the three notes, check for each permutation if it meets the major or minor condition.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead input line. Split into three notes.\n\nThen, for each note, get their positions.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three positions.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   d1 = distance between x and y (i.e., (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12)\n\n   d2 = distance between y and z ( (z_pos - y_pos) mod 12 )\n\n   if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 → major.\n\n   elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So once any permutation meets the major condition, we can return 'major' immediately. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can loop through all permutations, and check for major or minor. Once any of them is found, return the answer.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement note_order and note_map.\n\nRead the input line, split into three notes.\n\nFor each note, get their index via note_map.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nLoop through each permutation:\n\n   x, y, z = permutation.\n\n   compute d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   compute d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\n   if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nOnce any of the permutations is found, return the answer.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, I can use itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for the three elements, permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, for example, for the three notes, the permutations are all possible orderings.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImport sys and itertools.permutations.\n\nThen:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nThen, read the input line. For example, the input could be like 'C E G' → split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, get the three positions:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\npositions = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nThen generate all permutations of positions.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print(\"major\")\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print(\"minor\")\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So, there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets major, we can return 'major', and similarly for minor.\n\nBut in code, for each permutation, check if it meets major or minor. Once any of them is found, return the answer.\n\nSo in code:\n\nOnce the three notes are processed, loop through all permutations. For each permutation, check if it meets the major condition. If yes, output 'major' and exit. Else, check if it meets the minor condition. If yes, output 'minor' and exit. After checking all permutations, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each permutation, we check for major first. If any permutation meets the major condition, then return 'major'. Otherwise, check for minor.\n\nBut what if a permutation meets both conditions? Well, according to the problem statement, there are no such cases. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nBut in practice, for a given permutation, it can't meet both conditions. Because for the same permutation, d1 and d2 are fixed. So, for example, if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, then it's major. Else, if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, then minor. Otherwise, nothing.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nFirst case: C E G.\n\npositions are 0, 4, 7.\n\npermutations include (0,4,7). d1 = 4-0=4 mod 12 → 4. d2 = 7-4=3 → 3. So major.\n\nSo output is major.\n\nSecond case: C# B F → notes are C#, B, F.\n\npositions are 1, 10, 5.\n\nOne of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's see:\n\nd1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. d2 is (5 - 1) mod 12 → 4. So 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nThird case: A B H. positions are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's take some permutations.\n\nFor example, (9, 10, 11):\n\nd1 is 10-9=1 → 1. d2 is 11-10=1 → 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (9, 11, 10): d1 is (11-9) = 2. d2 is (10-11) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 → 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 9, 11): d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. d2 is (11 -9) = 2. No.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 11, 9): d1 is 11-10=1, d2 is 9-11 mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11, 9, 10): d1 is (9 -11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. d2 is 10-9=1. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11, 10, 9): d1 is 10-11 mod 12 → 11. d2 is 9-10 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut the input is a single line, which is three space-separated notes. So the code reads the input line, splits into three notes.\n\nWait, the sample input given in the problem is:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Because the actual input is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example input is 'C E G', the second is 'C# B F', etc. So the code should read one line, split into three notes.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three examples. So the user's code is supposed to process one input line. For example, the first example input is 'C E G' → output 'major'.\n\nSo the code should read the input line, split into three notes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\npositions = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best way. But for code submission, perhaps using sys.exit() is better. However, in code submission, when you print the answer and exit, it's acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use return, but in a script, the code can just print and break.\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as a script. So for example, in the code, after finding the answer, print and exit.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use sys.exit() or break after finding the answer.\n\nBut the code above uses exit(), which in Python is in the sys module. So perhaps, in the code, after printing, we can call sys.exit().\n\nWait, in Python, the exit() function is from sys. So the code should import sys, and then call sys.exit().\n\nBut the code above uses exit(), which may not be available. So better to use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\npositions = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note appears multiple times? For example, if the input is three same notes. But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but it's possible that they are same. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, for example, if all three notes are same, then the distances between them would be zero. So no major or minor.\n\nBut the code would generate permutations, but in that case, all d1 and d2 would be zero. So the code would print 'strange'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a valid chord. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# B F' → the code would process the three notes as C#, B, F. Their positions are 1, 10, 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. One of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Then:\n\nd1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. d2 = (5 - 1) mod 12 → 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: 'A B H' → positions are 9, 10, 11. All permutations checked. None meet the criteria, so output 'strange'.\n\nAnother example: what about a minor chord. Let's say 'B C# F' → the code would check permutations. Let's see:\n\nB is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. One permutation is (10, 1, 5). d1 is (1-10) mod 12 → 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 → 4. So minor.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about a major chord that requires wrapping around? For example, let's say the notes are E, G, B. Wait, E is 4, G is 7, B is 10. Let's check the permutation E, G, B. d1 is 7-4=3. d2 is 10-7=3. Not major. But another permutation?\n\nWait, what about the notes C, E, G. Which is major. But what about a case where the order is different. For example, E, G, C. Let's check:\n\nE is 4, G is 7, C is 0.\n\nd1 is 7-4=3. d2 is (0 -7) mod 12 → 5. So no. But another permutation: G, C, E. Let's see:\n\nG is 7, C is 0, E is 4. d1 = (0 -7) mod 12 = 5. Not 4. So no. But the correct permutation is C, E, G. Which is found in the permutations.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother example: H, C, E. H is 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nCheck permutation (11, 0, 4). d1 is (0 - 11) mod 12 → ( -11 ) mod 12 → 1. Not 4. But another permutation: H, E, C. Let's see:\n\nH is 11, E is 4, C is 0. d1 is 4 - 11 mod 12 → ( -7 ) mod 12 → 5. Not 4. Hmm. What about permutation (C, E, H)? C is 0, E is 4, H is 11. d1 is 4, d2 is 11 -4 =7. Which is 7 mod 12. Which is not 3. So that's not a major. So this is not a major chord. So the code would not detect it as major. But what if the chord is C, E, H? Let's see. The correct major requires that between X and Y is 4, Y and Z is 3. So for example, if X is C, Y is E (distance 4), then Z must be 3 semitones above Y. So E is 4. 4 + 3 = 7 → G. So Z is G. So the code would only detect major when the third note is G.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code-wise, the only thing to make sure is that the note_map is correctly built. Let me check the note_order list again.\n\nThe note_order is as per the problem statement: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are:\n\nC: 0\n\nC#: 1\n\nD: 2\n\nD#: 3\n\nE: 4\n\nF:5\n\nF#:6\n\nG:7\n\nG#:8\n\nA:9\n\nB:10\n\nH:11\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: notes that are adjacent. For example, C, C#, D. Let's see. For permutations:\n\nC, C#, D. d1 is 1, d2 is 1. Not major or minor.\n\nAnother case: C, D#, G. Let's see. C is 0, D# is 3, G is 7. Permutation C, D#, G. d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So that's minor. So the code would output minor.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the given notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor chord based on specific semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: First, we map each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic sequence of musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Since the order of notes in a chord can vary, we generate all permutations of the three given notes.\n3. **Checking Distances**: For each permutation, we check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor chord:\n   - A major chord requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor chord requires a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor chord, we print the corresponding result. If none do, we print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.read().split()\npositions = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_map` converts each note to its corresponding index for easy distance calculation.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual notes, which are then converted to their respective positions using `note_map`.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are checked. For each permutation, the semitone distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Distance Validation**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor chords. If a valid chord type is found, the result is printed immediately and the program exits. If no valid chord is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the given notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
