Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible permutations of assignments and see if any of them satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to a base) must not intersect. So for a given permutation (matching), we need to check all pairs of line segments and ensure none cross each other.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that the number of spaceships and bases are equal. If they are not equal, then immediately output No. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", which implies that R must equal B. So first check if R != B, then output No.\n\nBut looking at the input examples, in the first case R and B are both 3. In the second example, R is 2 and B is 1. So the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching. So yes, first step is to check if R == B. If not, output No.\n\nSo the first thing in code is to check if R and B are equal. If not, return No.\n\nAssuming R == B, then proceed.\n\nNow, the main problem is to find a perfect matching (bijection between spaceships and bases) such that no two line segments cross.\n\nHow to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nWell, there's a computational geometry method for checking if two line segments intersect. But since all points are in general position (no three colinear), perhaps that simplifies things. Also, since the problem says that no three points are on the same line, so any two line segments can't have overlapping parts except at endpoints.\n\nBut for our problem, we need to check whether two line segments cross each other. So, two line segments AB and CD intersect if they cross each other, not just touch at endpoints. However, since the problem says that the paths (lines) should not intersect. So even if two lines share an endpoint (like if a spaceship is connected to two different bases, but that's not possible in a perfect matching), but in the case of two different pairs, their lines can't cross.\n\nWait, in the perfect matching, each spaceship is connected to exactly one base. So for two different pairs (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), their connecting lines must not intersect.\n\nSo for a given permutation (matching), we need to check all pairs of line segments and make sure none of them cross.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of the bases for the spaceships). Since R and B are up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3.6 million for R=10. But wait, for R=10, 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments. How many pairs? For each permutation, there are R line segments. The number of pairs is (R choose 2) = 45 when R=10. For each pair, check if they intersect.\n\nSo total operations would be 3.6 million * 45 * cost of checking intersection. For each check, the cost depends on the method. But for small numbers, this is feasible.\n\nSo the approach is feasible for R and B up to 10.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\n1. Read input: first line R and B. Then read R points for spaceships, then B points for bases.\n\n2. Check if R != B: if so, output No.\n\n3. Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship). For each permutation, check if all line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] do not cross each other.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies the condition, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nThe standard approach is to use the orientation method. Let me recall:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\na) The orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and the orientation of C, D, A is different from the orientation of C, D, B. (This is the case where the segments cross each other.)\n\nOR\n\nb) One of the segments' endpoints lies on the other segment. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this case cannot happen. Because if AB and CD have an endpoint lying on the other segment, then that would imply three points are colinear. For example, if C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear. But the problem states that no three points are colinear. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, in our case, two line segments either cross each other (and thus their orientations are different as per a), or they don't. So for our problem, the check can be done by checking whether the two line segments cross each other.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect is to compute the orientations of (A,B,C), (A,B,D), (C,D,A), (C,D,B). If the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and the orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different, then they intersect.\n\nBut how to compute orientation?\n\nThe orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. The cross product is (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x). The sign of this value tells us the orientation:\n\n- Positive: counterclockwise (left turn)\n- Negative: clockwise (right turn)\n- Zero: colinear\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we can ignore zero cases.\n\nSo, for two segments AB and CD, we can compute the orientation of (A,B,C), (A,B,D), (C,D,A), (C,D,B). If (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) have opposite signs, and (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) have opposite signs, then the segments cross.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # returns True if AB and CD intersect\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n        val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1]-p[1]) - (q[1]-p[1])*(r[0]-p[0])\n        if val == 0:\n            return 0  # colinear\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # 1 for clockwise, 2 for counterclockwise\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    # Special cases (but according to the problem statement, these are not possible)\n    # But since the problem says no three points are colinear, the only way for o1 == o2 is if both are 0, but that's not allowed. Wait, no. For example, if C is colinear with AB, but since the problem says no three points are colinear, that's not possible. So in our problem, the orientations can't be zero. Therefore, o1 and o2 can't be zero. So the only possible cases are when o1 != o2 (so one is 1 and the other 2) and same for o3 and o4.\n\n    # So the above condition is sufficient.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what about when one segment's endpoint is on the other segment? For example, AB and CD where C is on AB. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen. Because if C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear. Which is forbidden. So in our case, the code above is sufficient.\n\nSo, the function segments_intersect returns True if the two segments cross each other.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments. For example, for a permutation that assigns spaceship i to base perm[i], then for all i < j, check if the segment between spaceship i and base perm[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base perm[j]. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo the code would generate all permutations of the bases (assuming that the bases are ordered in some way, like list of base points). For each permutation, check all pairs of segments.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, since the bases are given as a list, say bases = [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ] and the spaceships are rebels = [ (x1, y1), ... ].\n\nThen, for each permutation of the bases (each possible way to assign each spaceship to a unique base), we can check if all pairs of segments in that permutation are non-intersecting.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used to generate all possible permutations of the bases. For example, for the bases list, permutations(bases, len(bases)) gives all possible orderings. However, since the bases are unique (as per the input constraints), each permutation is a unique assignment.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the bases are given as B points, and the spaceships as R points. So when R = B, the code would generate all permutations of the B bases, and for each permutation, assign the i-th spaceship to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nSo, for each permutation in permutations(bases):\n\n   for each pair (i, j) where i < j:\n\n       check if the segment between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with segment between rebels[j] and perm[j]\n\n   if any of these pairs intersect, reject this permutation.\n\nIf all pairs are okay, then return 'Yes'.\n\nNow, the problem is that for permutations, when R is 10, it's 10! = 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 orientation checks. But for small R and B (up to 10), this is manageable.\n\nBut how efficient is this in Python? Let's think: 3.6 million * 45 = 162 million operations. Each operation is a few steps. For Python, perhaps it's acceptable, but maybe tight. However, since the constraints are small (up to 10), and given that the code is for a programming competition problem, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about possible optimizations. For example, if during checking pairs, we find an intersection early, we can break and proceed to the next permutation. So in practice, for some permutations, the check might exit early.\n\nBut regardless, the code will work for the given constraints.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print No.\n\nElse:\n\n   Read R points for rebels.\n\n   Read B points for bases.\n\n   Generate all permutations of the bases.\n\n   For each permutation:\n\n      check all pairs of line segments in the permutation.\n\n      if no intersections, return Yes.\n\n   If none found, return No.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut how to represent the points? As tuples of integers.\n\nNow, code for reading input.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings, for example, in the first example:\n\nInput is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Or is the input provided as a single string? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. However, the example shows that the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps that's for the test cases. So for the actual code, the input is read via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as two examples. But for the code, the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains R and B. Then R lines for the rebels, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3. Then 3 rebel points, then 3 base points.\n\nSo the code should read R and B, then read R lines of coordinates for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    R, B = map(int, input().split())\n\n    rebels = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\n\n    bases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    # Now generate permutations of bases.\n\n    # For each permutation, check if all segments are non-intersecting.\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        # For this permutation, check all pairs of segments.\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # get the two segments: rebels[i] to perm[i], rebels[j] to perm[j]\n\n                A = rebels[i]\n\n                B = perm[i]\n\n                C = rebels[j]\n\n                D = perm[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut then, the code needs the segments_intersect function.\n\nImplementing that function.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be defined inside the code.\n\nBut also, note that in the code, for each pair of segments (i,j) in the permutation, we check if they intersect. So the function segments_intersect is called with A, B, C, D as the four points.\n\nNow, implementing the segments_intersect function as discussed.\n\nBut let me code that.\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # A and B are endpoints of segment 1, C and D endpoints of segment 2.\n\n    # returns True if they intersect.\n\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n\n        # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise, 0 if colinear.\n\n        val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n\n        if val == 0:\n\n            return 0\n\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: but according to problem statement, no three points are colinear, so the following cases can't happen?\n\n    # However, perhaps the code should also check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment. But according to problem statement, that's not possible.\n\n    # Because if C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed.\n\n    # So in our problem, the only possible case is the general case.\n\n    # So return False otherwise.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one segment is entirely contained within another? But given the problem's constraints, that's not possible. Because for example, if AB is a segment and CD is a segment that lies on AB. Then, points C and D are colinear with AB. But since the problem says no three points are colinear, this can't happen. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, suppose that two segments share an endpoint. Like, A is connected to C. Then, the segment AC and another segment CD. But in that case, the code would check if AB (which is AC) and CD intersect. But the code would check if the segments AC and CD intersect. Well, since the segments share point C, which is an endpoint. But according to the problem statement, the paths (straight lines) must not intersect. However, the problem says that the paths must not intersect. So if two segments share an endpoint, then their paths intersect at that point. But according to the problem statement, this is not allowed?\n\nWait, the problem says that any two paths (straight lines) from a base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect. So if two paths share an endpoint (say, a spaceship is connected to two bases, but that's not possible in a perfect matching. Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So in the perfect matching, each segment is between a spaceship and a base, and each spaceship is in exactly one segment. So two segments can't share a spaceship or a base. So for two segments in the matching, they can't share an endpoint. Because each spaceship is connected to exactly one base, and each base is connected to exactly one spaceship. So the segments are between distinct pairs of points. Therefore, two segments in the matching cannot share any endpoints. Thus, the code's current check is sufficient. Because the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, not if they share endpoints.\n\nThus, the code for segments_intersect is correct.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is the same order. So assign rebel 0 to base (-2,1), rebel 1 to (0,3), rebel 2 to (2,2).\n\nCheck if any two segments cross.\n\nSegments:\n\n(0,0) to (-2,1)\n\n(2,0) to (0,3)\n\n(3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck between first and second: Do these lines cross?\n\nLet me calculate.\n\nFirst segment: from (0,0) to (-2,1). The line equation can be calculated, but perhaps using the orientation method is easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this case, the segments do not cross. Similarly for others.\n\nBut according to the sample, the answer is Yes. So the code should find that this permutation is valid.\n\nAnother sample input is the second case:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when R=B=2, and there are two possible permutations. Let's imagine a case where two permutations are possible. For example, two rebels and two bases. Suppose the rebels are at (0,0) and (0,1), and bases are at (1,0) and (1,1). Then, if we connect (0,0) to (1,0) and (0,1) to (1,1), the segments are vertical lines, which don't cross. But if we connect (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,1) to (1,0), then the two segments cross. So the code would check all permutations. The first permutation (connecting in order) would pass, so output is Yes.\n\nSo the code would generate permutations of the bases. For example, for bases [(1,0), (1,1)], the permutations are [(1,0), (1,1)] and [(1,1), (1,0)]. The first permutation would have segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1), which don't cross. So the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother case: if the two segments cross. For example, rebels at (0,0) and (2,2), and bases at (0,2) and (2,0). Then the permutation that connects (0,0) to (0,2) and (2,2) to (2,0) would have two vertical lines (no cross). But the permutation that connects (0,0) to (2,0) and (2,2) to (0,2) would have two lines that cross. So the code would check all permutations. The first permutation is valid, so the answer is Yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\n- R=B=1. Then there is only one possible assignment. The line segment is a single line, no other segments, so output Yes.\n\n- R=B=2. Two permutations. Need to check if any of them is valid.\n\nAnother edge case: when two segments are adjacent but not crossing. For example, rebels at (0,0), (1,0), and bases at (0,1), (1,1). Connecting each to their respective base. The segments are vertical lines, no crossing.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code will generate all permutations, check for each.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code may have a problem with permutations when there are duplicate points. But the problem says that no two points coincide. So the bases and rebels are all unique.\n\nAnother possible issue: the permutations function in itertools.permutations returns tuples of the elements. But since the bases are stored as tuples, the permutations would be generated correctly.\n\nBut in Python, tuples are hashable and can be permuted.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in the code, the bases are read as a list of tuples. So permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings of the bases.\n\nBut what about when the same base is present multiple times? Well, the problem says that no two points coincide, so all bases are unique. So permutations will generate all possible unique orderings.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in the code, for the first sample input, the code would generate permutations of the bases. For example, in the first sample, the bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nSo the code would check all permutations, including the one that connects each rebel to the base in order. Then, for each pair of segments, check if they cross. For the first sample, the code would find that this permutation is valid and return Yes.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nBut in Python, for permutations, when the list is passed, each element is considered as a separate item. So for the bases list, each element is a tuple, and permutations will generate all possible orderings.\n\nAnother possible problem is that the code could take too long for R=10. But for 10, 10! is 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 orientation checks. But for Python, perhaps it's manageable. However, for the worst case, it's possible that the code may take some time. However, given the constraints of R and B up to 10, it's acceptable.\n\nAnother optimization: since the order of checking pairs can be optimized. For example, once any pair is found to intersect, break early and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nIn the code, for each permutation, the code loops over i from 0 to R-1, and j from i+1 to R-1. For each pair (i,j), check if segments intersect. If any of them does, then the permutation is invalid. So in the code, once a pair is found, it breaks out of the loops and proceeds to the next permutation.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, the for loops are written as:\n\nfor perm in permutations(...):\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(R):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n            check if segments intersect. If yes, set valid to False, break.\n\n        if not valid: break\n\n    if valid: return yes.\n\nBut in Python, breaking out of nested loops can be a bit tricky. However, the code uses flags and breaks.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut in the code, the function segments_intersect is called for each pair of segments.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut also, note that in the code, the permutations are generated for the bases list. So for example, if the bases are in a list, then permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings. However, for R=10, this is 10! permutations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise, 0 if colinear\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    rebels = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(R)]\n    bases = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Check if segment rebels[i] -> perm[i] and rebels[j] -> perm[j] intersect\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B_point = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D_point = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B_point, C, D_point):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the function segments_intersect is called with A, B_point, C, D_point. So the first segment is between A and B_point, and the second between C and D_point.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code will generate permutations of the bases. For the first permutation, which is the same as the order in which the bases are read, the code checks for each pair of segments. For example, between (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3), etc. Assuming that none of the pairs intersect, the code returns Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nHere R=2 and B=1, so output is No.\n\nBut what about when R=B=2, and the two possible permutations are both invalid? For example, if the rebels are at (0,0) and (2,2), and the bases are at (0,2) and (2,0). Then the two permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,2), (2,0)] → segments (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0): vertical lines, no intersection.\n\nSo the code would find this permutation and return Yes.\n\nAnother case: if the two permutations are both invalid. But that's impossible. Because for two points, there are two permutations, and at least one of them must be valid? No. Suppose the rebels are at (0,0) and (1,1), and the bases are at (0,1) and (1,0). Then the two permutations are:\n\nPermutation 1: assign (0,0) to (0,1), (1,1) to (1,0). The segments are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0): vertical lines, no intersection. So valid.\n\nPermutation 2: assign (0,0) to (1,0), (1,1) to (0,1). Segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These two lines cross each other. So the code would find permutation 1 valid and return Yes.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is Yes.\n\nBut if the rebels and bases are arranged such that both permutations have crossing segments? How?\n\nFor example, suppose rebels are at (0,0) and (2,2), and bases are at (1, 1) and (3, 3). Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. But here, all points are colinear. So this case is not allowed.\n\nAnother example: rebels at (0,0), (3,3). Bases at (1, 2), (2, 1). So the two permutations:\n\nPerm1: assign (0,0) to (1,2), (3,3) to (2,1). Check if the segments (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1) cross.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nSegment 1: from (0,0) to (1,2). The line equation is y=2x.\n\nSegment 2: from (3,3) to (2,1). The line equation is y = 2x -3.\n\nThese two lines intersect at x= (some value). But since the segments are between (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1), the lines cross at (1.5, 3), which is outside of both segments. So the segments do not cross.\n\nWait, but how to check with the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code would return that they do not cross.\n\nBut in this case, the code would find that the segments do not cross, so the permutation is valid.\n\nSo the code would return Yes.\n\nThus, in all cases, the code seems to work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is parsed as R=3, B=3. Rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nThe code will generate permutations of the bases. One of the permutations is the original order. For that permutation, the segments are:\n\nRebel 0 (0,0) to base (-2,1).\n\nRebel 1 (2,0) to base (0,3).\n\nRebel 2 (3,1) to base (2,2).\n\nCheck all pairs.\n\nBetween rebel 0 and 1: segments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do these cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nFor segment AB (A=(0,0), B=(-2,1)), and segment CD (C=(2,0), D=(0,3)).\n\nCheck orientation of A, B, C: points (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0).\n\nCompute val = (-2 - 0)*(0 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, the orientation function is:\n\nval = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\nSo for p = A (0,0), q = B (-2, 1), r = C (2, 0):\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2.\n\nWhich is negative. So orientation is 2 (since val < 0).\n\nThen, orientation of A, B, D (D is (0,3)):\n\np=A (0,0), q=B (-2, 1), r=D (0,3).\n\nval = (-2-0) * (3 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (0 - 0) = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6. Negative. So orientation is 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same (both 2). So the general case is not satisfied. So segments do not cross.\n\nThen check for the other segment CD (C=(2,0), D=(0,3)) and segment AB (A=(0,0), B=(-2,1)).\n\nOrientation of C, D, A: points C (2,0), D (0,3), A (0,0).\n\nval = (0-2)*(0-0) - (3-0)*(0-2) → (-2)*0 - 3*(-2) = 6 → positive. So orientation is 1.\n\nOrientation of C, D, B: points C (2,0), D (0,3), B (-2, 1).\n\nval = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-2) → (-2)*1 - 3*(-4) → -2 +12 = 10 → positive. So orientation is 1. So o3 and o4 are same. Thus, the general case is not met. So segments do not cross.\n\nThus, this pair does not cross.\n\nSimilarly, other pairs can be checked.\n\nSo the code would find that this permutation is valid, and output Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nR=2, B=1. So output is No.\n\nThus, the code works for samples.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where R=B=1. Output Yes.\n\nAnother case where R=B=2, and the two permutations are both invalid. Is that possible?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So for two rebels and two bases, can it be that both permutations have crossing segments?\n\nLet me think. Suppose rebels are at (0,0) and (3,3). Bases are at (1, 2) and (2, 1). Then:\n\nPermutation 1: connect (0,0) to (1,2), (3,3) to (2,1).\n\nCheck if these two segments cross.\n\nSegment 1: from (0,0) to (1,2).\n\nSegment 2: from (3,3) to (2,1).\n\nDo they cross?\n\nUsing the code's function:\n\norientation(A,B,C) where A=(0,0), B=(1,2), C=(3,3).\n\nval = (1-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(3-0) → 1*3 - 2*3 = 3 -6 = -3 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(A,B,D) where D=(2,1):\n\nval = (1-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 1*1 - 2*2 = 1-4 = -3 → orientation 2. So o1 = o2 → no.\n\nThen, check the other orientation.\n\norientation(C,D,A) where C=(3,3), D=(2,1), A=(0,0):\n\nval = (2-3)*(0-3) - (1-3)*(0-3) → (-1)*(-3) - (-2)*(-3) = 3 - 6 = -3 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(C,D,B) where B=(1,2):\n\nval = (2-3)*(2-3) - (1-3)*(1-3) → (-1)*(-1) - (-2)*(-2) = 1 - 4 = -3 → orientation 2. Again, same. So no intersection.\n\nThus, the segments do not cross. So this permutation is valid. So the code would return Yes.\n\nThus, it's impossible to have both permutations invalid. Because for two points, there are two permutations. At least one of them must not have crossing segments.\n\nWait, but what if the two segments are crossing in both permutations? How?\n\nFor example, rebels are at (0,0) and (2,2). Bases are at (0,2) and (2,0). Then:\n\nPermutation 1: (0,0) to (0,2),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa, and no two connecting paths intersect. The solution involves checking all possible perfect matchings between spaceships and bases and verifying if any of these matchings meet the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R and B are not equal, immediately output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For the given number of spaceships and bases, generate all permutations of the bases to consider all possible assignments.\n3. **Check Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of connecting paths (segments) between spaceships and their assigned bases intersect. This is done using computational geometry to determine if two line segments intersect.\n4. **Orientation Check**: Use the cross product to determine the orientation of points, which helps in checking if two line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    rebels = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(R)]\n    bases = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B_point = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D_point = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B_point, C, D_point):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into lists of coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated.\n3. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, the code checks every pair of line segments (paths from spaceships to bases) to see if they intersect using the orientation method. This method uses the cross product to determine the relative orientation of points and checks if segments cross each other.\n4. **Output Result**: If any valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, \"Yes\" is printed. If no valid permutation is found after checking all possibilities, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints, leveraging permutations and geometric properties to determine valid configurations.",
