A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per person such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nWe have n friends. They have k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices is c * d.\n\nThey have p grams of salt.\n\nFor each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. Wait, per toast per friend? Or per toast in total?\n\nWait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend requires these. So for one toast, all n friends are making a toast. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl per toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend needs one slice per toast), and n * np grams of salt (since each friend needs np grams per toast).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose there are t toasts. For each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl for that toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices (each friend has one slice per toast). And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources needed for t toasts is:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl\n\nLime slices: t * n \n\nSalt: t * n * np \n\nBut we have limited resources. So the maximum t is determined by how much each resource allows.\n\nSo for drink, the maximum t possible is (k*l) // (n * nl). Because total drink is k*l. Divided by the per toast total drink requirement.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total available is c*d. So max t is (c*d) // (n).\n\nFor salt: p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three must be satisfied.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 20ml.\n\nEach toast requires per friend 3ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note. Then lime slices: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast requires 3 slices (n=3). 80 /3 is 26.666... floor 26. But the example says that the min is 6, which comes from 20 /3 (drink) =6.666... floor 6. Oh wait, wait the example says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says: the drink is 20ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3ml. So for one toast, total is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Wait why is that? Oh wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the per toast per friend is nl milliliters. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl, so total for all friends is n * nl. But the note says that in the first example, 20 /3 =6. So 20 is total drink. 3 is nl. So 20 /3 is 6.666, which would be 6. So that suggests that the total drink required per toast is nl per friend, but perhaps the total per toast is nl multiplied by the number of friends? Or maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So per friend, they need t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut in the note, they say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 divided by 3, which would be if per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be for one friend. But there are 3 friends. So maybe I have the problem statement wrong.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these. So if there are t toasts, then each friend will have t toasts. So per friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut in the note, the example says that the drink is 20 ml, which is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that for each toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be for one friend. But that would be if each toast is per friend. But the problem says that all friends make the same number of toasts. So if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for each toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. \n\nBut in the note, the example says that the drink is 20ml. For t toasts, total drink needed is t * n * nl. Let's plug in the numbers from the first example:\n\nn=3, nl=3. So per toast, total drink is 3*3=9. So for t toasts, 9t. The total drink is 20. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222. So maximum t is 2. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. That suggests that the per toast is 3 ml total, not multiplied by n. So this indicates that my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait what's the note saying? The note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nAh! So the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But then, they divide by 3 friends to get 2. So that suggests that the initial calculation is for the total number of toasts across all friends. But that's conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\nAh! So each friend makes t toasts. So per friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. Similarly, for lime slices: each friend needs one slice per toast, so total slices needed is n * t. For salt: each friend needs t * np grams, so total is n * t * np.\n\nBut in the note, the drink is 20ml. For the first example, the note says that 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that the total drink is 20, and per toast (per friend?), it's 3 ml. So for t toasts per friend, total drink is n * t * nl. So in the first example, n=3, t=2. Then total drink is 3 * 2 * 3 = 18 ml. Which is within 20. But according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. Then total drink is 3 * 6 *3 = 54, which is more than 20. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. So 20 /3 is 6.666, but they take the floor. So that suggests that the total drink is divided by nl, and that gives the maximum number of toasts per friend. But why?\n\nAh, maybe the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts across all friends. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the note is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made (i.e., the sum over all friends), but then dividing by the number of friends to get per person.\n\nBut that seems confusing. Let me re-express the note's explanation.\n\nIn the note, they have 20ml of drink. They say that it's enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Then they take the minimum between that, the lime (80 toasts) and salt (100 toasts). Then divide by 3 friends to get 2. So that suggests that the initial numbers (6, 80, 100) are the total number of toasts that can be made across all friends. Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the total number of toasts is t * n, where t is the number per friend. So the total toasts is t * n. So for the drink, the maximum total toasts is (k*l) / (nl) ?\n\nBecause for each toast (total across all friends), the drink required is nl per toast. Wait, that would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend. But if each friend makes t toasts, then the total toasts across all friends is t * n. And for each toast (each individual toast made by a friend), the drink required is nl. So total drink is (t * n) * nl. So solving for t: t = (k*l) / (n * nl). But the note says that the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if t * n * nl = k*l. So t = (k*l) / (n * nl). But in the note, the calculation is 20 /3 =6. Which would be (k*l) / nl = 20 /3 =6.666. Which would be the case if the total toasts (across all friends) is t_total = (k*l)/nl. Then, since each friend makes t_total / n toasts. So that would be the case if the per toast (per friend) is nl. So for example, if the total number of toasts across all friends is T, then each friend makes T / n toasts. So the constraints are:\n\nT must be such that:\n\n- T * nl <= k*l (drink)\n\n- T <= c*d (lime slices, since each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices needed is T * 1 (per toast per friend?), or maybe T is the total number of toasts across all friends. Let me think.\n\nWait, if each toast is made by each friend, then for each toast, each friend makes one. So for example, if there are 3 friends and they make 2 toasts each, then the total number of toasts is 3 * 2 = 6. Each toast per friend requires a slice of lime. So for each toast per friend, one slice. So total slices needed is T (total toasts across all friends) * 1. So for T toasts across all friends, you need T slices. So the lime slices available is c*d. So T must be <= c*d.\n\nSimilarly, for salt: each toast per friend requires np grams. So total salt needed is T * np. So T must be <= p / np.\n\nSo in this scenario, the maximum T is min( (k*l)//nl , c*d, p//np ). Then, the number of toasts per friend is T // n. Because T is the total number of toasts across all friends. Since each friend must make the same number, T must be divisible by n? Or no. Because if T is not divisible by n, then each friend can make T//n toasts, and there's some leftover.\n\nBut the problem says that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So T must be exactly equal to t * n, where t is the number per friend. So the maximum possible t is floor( min( (k*l)/nl, c*d, p / np ) / n )\n\nWait, but in the note's example, the drink allows for T = 20 /3 =6.666, which is floor to 6. Then the lime allows for T = 80, and salt allows for T = 100. So the minimum is 6. Then T is 6. Then the number of toasts per friend is 6 / 3 = 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate T_drink = (k * l) // nl → because T can't exceed this, since T * nl <= k*l.\n\nT_lime = c * d → because T can't exceed this.\n\nT_salt = p // np → because T * np <= p.\n\nThen, T_max = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt).\n\nThen, the answer is T_max // n.\n\nBecause T_max is the maximum total toasts across all friends. Since each friend must make the same number, the number per friend is T_max // n.\n\nBut wait, why not T_max divided by n, using integer division?\n\nYes. Because T_max is the maximum total toasts possible. But since each friend must have the same number, the maximum possible t is floor(T_max /n).\n\nSo for example, if T_max is 6 and n is 3, then 6 /3 = 2. If T_max is 7 and n is 3, then 7//3 = 2. So each friend can make 2 toasts, with T=6.\n\nSo the answer is min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n.\n\nBut let's check the first example.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nk*l = 4*5=20. nl=3. T_drink = 20//3=6.\n\nT_lime = c*d =10*8=80.\n\nT_salt = p//np = 100//1=100.\n\nmin(6, 80, 100) is 6. 6//3 = 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000. nl=4. T_drink = 1000//4=250.\n\nc=1, d=19 → T_lime=1*19=19.\n\np=90, np=3 → T_salt=90//3=30.\n\nmin(250,19,30) is 19. 19//5=3.8 → floor is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10.\n\nk*l = 1000 *1000 = 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50. T_drink = 1e6 //50 = 20000.\n\nT_lime: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575.\n\nT_salt: p=1, np=1 → 1//1=1.\n\nmin(20000, 575, 1) is 1. 1//10 = 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute T_drink = (k * l) // nl\n\nT_lime = c * d\n\nT_salt = p // np\n\nT_max = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\nresult = T_max // n\n\nSo the code needs to read the input values, compute these steps, and output the result.\n\nNow, handling the input: the input is a list of lines. Wait, looking at the example input, the first line is given as a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is the first line containing the numbers. Wait, the problem says that the input is the first line containing the numbers. But the example shows that the input is given as a list of multiple lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example input is given as:\n\nInput\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nOutput\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. But the actual problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo for each test case, the input is a single line. But the example shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of input.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is given as a list of strings. But that's probably a formatting error. For example, the first sample input is a single line, which is the numbers 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So the code should read a single line, split into the 8 numbers.\n\nSo the code should read a single line from stdin, split into the 8 integers.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nCompute T_drink = (k * l) // nl\n\nT_lime = c * d\n\nT_salt = p // np\n\nT_max = min of those three.\n\nresult = T_max // n\n\nPrint result.\n\nBut let's make sure that all divisions are integer divisions.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\n\nt_lime = c * d\n\nt_salt = p // np\n\nt_max = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nans = t_max // n\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20. nl=3 → 20//3=6. t_lime=10*8=80. t_salt=100//1=100. min is 6. 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=1000. nl=4 → 1000//4=250. t_lime=1*19=19. t_salt=90//3=30. min is 19. 19//5=3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink=1,000,000. nl=50 → 1e6//50 = 20000. t_lime=25*23=575. t_salt=1//1=1. min is 1. 1//10=0. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where T_max is exactly divisible by n. For example, n=2, T_max=4 → 4//2=2.\n\nAnother case: T_max is zero? Well, since all input numbers are at least 1, but for example, if p is less than np, then t_salt is zero. Then the answer is zero.\n\nLike, if p=1, np=2. Then t_salt is 0. So min could be zero. Then ans is 0//n=0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when T_drink is zero. For example, if k*l is 3, nl=4. Then t_drink is 0. So the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Calculate the total available resources and how much is needed per toast.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Toasts**: For each resource (drink, lime slices, salt), compute the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the total available quantity and the requirement per toast.\n3. **Determine Limiting Factor**: The actual number of toasts is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum of the maximum possible toasts from each resource.\n4. **Distribute Equally Among Friends**: Since all friends must make the same number of toasts, divide the limiting number of toasts by the number of friends using integer division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\nt_lime = c * d\nt_salt = p // np\nt_max = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\nprint(t_max // n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: Compute the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n3. **Maximum Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the milliliters needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total slices available (limes multiplied by slices per lime).\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the grams needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Determine Limiting Resource**: The minimum value among the maximum toasts calculated for each resource determines the limiting factor.\n5. **Equal Distribution**: The limiting number of toasts is divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts, using integer division to handle any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering each resource's constraints and ensuring equal distribution among all friends.",
