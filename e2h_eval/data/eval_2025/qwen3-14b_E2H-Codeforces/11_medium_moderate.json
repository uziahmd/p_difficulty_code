A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nThe input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k * l ml. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml in total, because each of the n friends needs nl ml. Wait, no. Wait, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has their own portion.\n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. And since there are c limes, each cut into d slices, total slices is c*d. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. Because each toast uses n slices.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. Because each friend needs np grams. So total salt needed per toast is n * np. The total available is p grams. So the number of toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the total possible toasts is the minimum of the three values: drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts.\n\nWait, but how do I compute drink_toasts? The total drink available is k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So drink_toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nYes. Then, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Divided by n=3, gives 80//3=26. But wait, the sample says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, lime_toasts is (c*d) // n. Which would be (10*8)/3 = 80/3 = 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement. For each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, n slices. So for the first example, 3 friends. So per toast, 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 *8 = 80. So the number of toasts possible is 80 /3 = 26.666..., which is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". But how? Because per toast, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, n slices. So the total number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. So in the first example, 80//3 is 26. But according to the note, it's 80. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, total slices needed is t * n. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the note, the sample says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that (c*d) is 80, and that per toast, 1 slice is needed. But that's not the case. So why is the note saying that?\n\nWait looking at the first sample input:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3, c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10*8=80. The note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the logic, that would be possible if each toast required 1 slice. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So why is the note saying that?\n\nAh! Oh no! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, n*t slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut according to the note, in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) = 80, and if each toast requires 1 slice. So that suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? According to the note, the limes are 10*8=80 slices. So if each toast requires one slice, then 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So why is the note considering that each toast requires 1 slice?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe I misread the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, n slices. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if each toast requires 1 slice. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong? No, that's impossible. So where is the error?\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation. The note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So for the first sample, n=3 friends. So per toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices can make 80 /3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So this suggests that the problem statement's description is different than what I thought.\n\nWait perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note is considering that per toast, each friend needs a slice. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. But in the note's explanation, the limes are sufficient for 80 toasts. Which would require that 80 * 3 = 240 slices. But the total slices is 80. So that's not possible. So there's a contradiction here. So why is the note saying that?\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But then they take the min of 6, 80, 100, and divide by 3. Which would be 6/3=2. Which is the correct answer. But why is the limes considered as 80 toasts?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is not considering that each toast requires n slices, but that each toast requires one slice per friend. So the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. But in the note, the limes are considered as 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) divided by 1. So why?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So per toast, n slices. Therefore, the total number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) = 80. So if that's the case, then the note is considering that per toast, 1 slice is needed. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo what's the correct way here?\n\nLet me recheck the sample input and output.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSample output is 2.\n\nIn the note, the explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts, limes 80, salt 100. Then min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 (number of friends?), giving 2. So why is the drink allowing 6 toasts?\n\nDrink: total is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per friend = 9 ml per toast. 20 /9 is 2.222, floor to 2. But according to the note, it's 20 /3 = 6. So that suggests that the note is calculating the total toasts as (total drink) / (nl per toast). But that would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but per toast, the total is nl * n ?\n\nWait, the note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nBut that would imply that each toast requires 3 ml. Which would be nl per toast. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl. So for the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222. So why does the note say 20/3=6?\n\nThis suggests that the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total is nl ml. Which would be incorrect. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So that implies that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is 20 / (3) = 6. So that suggests that the per toast drink is nl, not n * nl. Which would be the case if each toast requires nl ml in total. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nThis is very confusing. So perhaps I have misread the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total amount of drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is 20ml, which is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 3 ml per toast. Which would be nl per toast. So that suggests that the per toast drink is nl, not n * nl. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut then, why is the note's calculation correct? Let me think. The sample output is 2. According to the note's calculation, min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 (number of friends?), resulting in 2. So that implies that the total number of toasts possible is 6, but each friend can make 2 toasts. Which would mean that the total number of toasts is 2 per friend, so total toasts is 3 * 2 = 6. Which makes sense. So the total toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total amount of drink is t * n * nl. So the drink is sufficient if t * n * nl <= total_drink.\n\nSo the maximum t is floor(total_drink / (n * nl)).\n\nIn the first sample, total_drink is 20. n * nl is 3 *3=9. 20//9 = 2. So t is 2. Which matches the sample output. But according to the note, the drink allows 6 toasts. So how is that possible?\n\nAh! Oh! The note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but that's the total number of toasts across all friends. But the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So if there are 3 friends, and each makes 2 toasts, then total toasts is 3 * 2 = 6. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is the total toasts. So the calculation for the drink is (total_drink) // (nl) ?\n\nWait, that would be 20 /3 = 6.666, floor to 6. Which is the note's calculation. But why?\n\nBecause if the total number of toasts across all friends is t_total, then each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for t_total toasts, the total drink is t_total * n * nl. Because each toast for each friend requires nl ml. So for example, if each friend makes t toasts, then total toasts is n * t. So the total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as t_total * nl, where t_total is n * t.\n\nSo the maximum t_total is floor( total_drink / nl ). Then, the maximum t per friend is t_total / n. Which would be floor( (total_drink / nl ) /n ), but since t_total must be divisible by n?\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think with the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink is 20ml. nl is 3ml per friend per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs 3ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9ml. For two toasts, 3*3*2=18ml. For three toasts, 27ml, which is more than 20. So maximum t is 2. Which is what the sample says. But according to the note's calculation, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which seems to be the total toasts across all friends. So 6 toasts total. Which would be 6 * 3ml = 18ml. Which is within the 20ml. So the note's explanation is that the drink allows for 6 toasts (total), which is 6 toasts across all friends. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. So that's the correct answer.\n\nSo the way to compute the maximum possible t (per friend) is:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum possible total toasts (t_total), then divide by n, taking the floor. Because each friend makes t toasts, and t_total = n * t.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each resource, compute the maximum t_total possible, then the minimum of those t_total values, then divide by n, taking the floor.\n\nSo for drink:\n\nt_total_drink = total_drink // (nl) \n\nWait, no. Because for t_total toasts (total), each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, the total drink is nl * n. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for t_total toasts, the total drink needed is t_total * n * nl. \n\nSo the maximum t_total_drink is floor( total_drink / (n * nl) )\n\nBut in the sample, that would be 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 /9 = 2.222, floor to 2. Which is the correct value. Then, the t_total is 2, which is the total number of toasts across all friends. But since each friend makes the same number, t_total must be divisible by n. Or not? Because if t_total is 2, and n is 3, then each friend can make 0.666 toasts, which is not possible. So the actual maximum t is floor( t_total / n ), where t_total is the maximum possible for that resource.\n\nWait no. Because the t_total must be equal to n * t, where t is the number of toasts per friend. So t_total is a multiple of n. So the way to compute the maximum t is to compute for each resource the maximum possible t_total, which is the maximum number of toasts that can be made in total (across all friends), and then take the minimum of those t_total, and then divide by n to get the per-friend toasts.\n\nBut how do we compute the t_total for each resource?\n\nFor drink:\n\nt_total_drink = total_drink // (nl * n)\n\nBecause each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\nFor limes:\n\nEach toast requires n slices (since each of the n friends needs one slice). So total number of toasts possible is (c * d) // n. Which is t_total_lime.\n\nFor salt:\n\nEach toast requires n * np grams. So t_total_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the minimum of t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt is the maximum possible t_total. Then, the per-friend toasts is t_total // n ?\n\nWait no. Because t_total is already the total number of toasts across all friends. If each friend makes the same number, then t_total must be divisible by n. But in reality, the t_total is the maximum possible such that it's possible to split into n equal parts. So for example, if t_total is 6, and n is 3, then each friend can make 2 toasts. But if t_total is 7, then you can't split into 3 equal parts. So the actual maximum is floor(t_total / n). Wait no. Because the t_total is computed as the maximum possible for each resource, but when you take the minimum of them, you have to ensure that the minimum is divisible by n?\n\nNo. Because for example, if the minimum of the three t_total is 6, which is divisible by n=3, then each friend can make 2 toasts. But if the minimum is 7, and n=3, then the maximum per friend is 2 (since 3*2=6 ≤7). So the per-friend toasts is floor(min_total / n).\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nCalculate for each resource the maximum possible total toasts (t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt). Then take the minimum of these three values. Then, the answer is the floor of that minimum divided by n.\n\nWait no. Because the min_total is the maximum possible total toasts that can be made, given all resources. So if that min_total is 6, and n=3, then each friend can make 6 /3 = 2 toasts. If the min_total is 7, then 7//3=2, which is the answer.\n\nSo the correct formula is:\n\nanswer = min(t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt) // n\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\nt_total_drink is 20/(3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n\nt_total_lime is (10*8) //3 = 80//3 = 26\n\nt_total_salt is 100/(3*1) = 100//3 = 33\n\nmin is 2. 2//3 = 0? But the sample output is 2. Oh no, that's conflicting.\n\nWait that can't be right. This suggests that my entire approach is wrong.\n\nWait this is a critical point. Let me re-calculate the first sample with this approach.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20 ml.\n\nt_total_drink = 20 // (n * nl) = 20 // (3 *3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\nt_total_lime = (c*d) // n = (10*8) //3 = 80//3 = 26.\n\nt_total_salt = p // (n * np) = 100 // (3 *1) = 33.\n\nminimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Then answer is 2//3 = 0. But sample output is 2. So this approach is wrong.\n\nBut the sample output is 2. So clearly, this approach is incorrect. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Oh no! I think I mixed up the definitions of t_total. Because the t_total is the total number of toasts across all friends. But the way I calculated t_total_drink was wrong.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nEach toast requires for each friend: nl ml of drink. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So for t toasts per friend, total toasts across all friends is n * t. So total drink needed is (n * t) * (n * nl) ?\n\nWait no. Wait, for each toast that a friend makes, they need nl ml. So if each friend makes t toasts, then each friend needs t * nl ml. For all friends, the total is n * t * nl ml. Which must be <= total_drink.\n\nSo the maximum t is floor( total_drink / (n * nl) )\n\nIn the first sample, total_drink is 20. n * nl is 3 *3 =9. 20//9=2. So t=2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo why is the note's explanation saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts? Because in that explanation, the 6 is the total number of toasts across all friends (3 friends * 2 toasts each = 6). So the note's explanation is using t_total = 6, which is n * t. So the way to compute t_total for drink is (total_drink) // (nl) ?\n\nWait, no. Because for t_total toasts across all friends, each toast requires nl * n ml. Because for each toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, n * nl ml. For t_total toasts, it's t_total * n * nl ml. So the maximum t_total is floor( total_drink / (n * nl) )\n\nWhich in the first sample is 20 / (3*3) = 2. So t_total is 2. Which would be the total number of toasts across all friends. But that would imply that each friend makes 2 /3 toasts, which is not possible. So clearly, this approach is not correct.\n\nBut the sample says that the answer is 2. So the correct way to compute t is floor( total_drink / (n * nl) ). Which in the first sample is 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo why is the note's explanation saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts? It seems like a mistake in the note. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, why 20 /3? That would be if each toast requires 3 ml. Which is nl. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires nl per friend. So for one toast, n * nl ml. So in this case, 3 *3=9 ml per toast. 20 /9 = 2.222.\n\nBut the note says 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 3 ml per toast. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml in total, not per friend. Which would be a mistake in the note. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml in total. Which would be a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the correct answer is 2. Which is achieved by computing t = floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ), floor( (c*d)/n ), floor( p/(n*np) ), then taking the minimum of those three values.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20/(3*3) = 2.222 → 2\n\nlime_toasts = (10*8)/3 = 26.666 → 26\n\nsalt_toasts = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → 33\n\nminimum is 2 → answer is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample. So the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum number of toasts that can be made, assuming that each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Then take the minimum of those three values. Which is the number of toasts per friend.\n\nSo the earlier confusion with the note was due to a mistake in the note's explanation. The note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, but that's incorrect. The correct number is 2, and the note's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the note is referring to the total number of toasts across all friends, but that's not clear.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum number of toasts per friend, and take the minimum.\n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\nCompute for drink: total_drink = k * l → drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nCompute for lime: total_slices = c * d → lime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nCompute for salt: salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nAnswer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20/(3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n\nlime_toasts = 80//3 = 26\n\nsalt_toasts = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → 33\n\nmin(2, 26, 33) → 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample in the input is:\n\nSample input 2: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nLet's parse this as n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\ntotal_drink = 100*10 = 1000. drink_toasts = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20 = 50.\n\ntotal_slices = 1*19 =19. lime_toasts = 19 //5 = 3 (since 19//5 is 3.8 → 3).\n\nsalt_toasts = 90/(5*3) = 90/15 =6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3 → output is 3, which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000.\n\ndrink_toasts = 1e6 / (10 * 50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nlime: c=25, d=23 → total slices 25*23=575. lime_toasts = 575//10 = 57.\n\nsalt_toasts: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10 = 0.\n\nso min(2000,57,0) is 0 → output 0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nRead the input numbers as n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to read input from stdin. The input is given as multiple lines? Or a single line?\n\nThe problem says: the first and only line contains the integers. So the input is one line per test case? Or the input is multiple lines?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows three examples, but the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the user is supposed to read one line of input, but the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual program is supposed to read one line of input. Or is it that the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are provided, but the code should read from stdin one line per test case?\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the code should read one line of input. So the sample input shows three test cases, but each is a separate input. So perhaps the user is supposed to run the code once per input line. But in programming competition settings, sometimes multiple test cases are provided. However, the problem says that the input is one line.\n\nSo the code should read one line from stdin, split into the 8 integers, and output the result.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input line, the code reads '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' and outputs 2.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the variables.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this code with the first sample input:\n\nFor input 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1:\n\ndrink_toasts = 4*5=20, divided by (3*3)=9 → 2.\n\nlime_toasts: 10*8=80 //3 =26.\n\nsalt_toasts: 100/(3*1) =33.333 → 33. min is 2 → correct.\n\nSample 2: input 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → drink_toasts is 100*10=1000 divided by (5*4)=20 → 50. lime_toasts is 1*19=19//5=3. salt_toasts is 90/(5*3)=6 → min is 3.\n\nSample 3: input 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → drink_toasts is 1000*1000 / (10*50) = 1000000 / 500 = 2000. lime_toasts: 25*23=575//10=57. salt_toasts is 1/(10*1) =0 → min 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if any of the denominators is zero? But the problem says that all inputs are at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when n * nl exceeds total_drink, then drink_toasts is zero. Similarly for others.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts that can be made considering all resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Determine Toasts from Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available drink, considering each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend.\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n4. **Determine Toasts from Limes**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices, considering each toast requires a slice per friend.\n5. **Determine Toasts from Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available salt, considering each toast requires a specific amount of salt per friend.\n6. **Find Minimum Possible Toasts**: The answer is the minimum value obtained from the three resource constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_slices = c * d\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`).\n2. **Drink Constraints**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters). The number of toasts possible from the drink is the total drink divided by this requirement.\n3. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is the product of the number of limes (`c`) and slices per lime (`d`). Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend), so the number of toasts possible from limes is the total slices divided by `n`.\n4. **Salt Constraints**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams). The number of toasts possible from the salt is the total salt divided by this requirement.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum value among the toasts possible from each resource, ensuring all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraint.",
