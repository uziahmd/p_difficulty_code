In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is a tile. The output is the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each given set of three tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding, there's a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu when adding tiles?\n\nLet me think about the possibilities. Since the initial hand is three tiles, and after adding some tiles, we need to have at least one mentsu. The problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\n2. If not, check what's the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu by adding tiles.\n\nNow, how to check if the current three tiles form a mentsu?\n\nFor a triplet: all three must be same tile. Like 9m, 9m, 9m. So check if all three are same.\n\nFor a sequence: they must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. Like 1s, 2s, 3s. So check if all three are same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo for the initial three tiles, check these two conditions. If either is true, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible cases.\n\nThe minimal number can be 1 or 2 or maybe even higher? Let's think.\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are 1p, 2p, 4p. Then adding 3p would make a sequence (1,2,3,4?), no, wait. Wait, the three tiles plus one added would be four tiles. But the mentsu requires exactly three tiles. Wait, no. Wait, when you add tiles, the total tiles in hand is 3 + added. But to form a mentsu, you need a subset of three tiles that form a mentsu. So, for example, if you have three tiles and add one, making four tiles, then you can choose any three of them to form a mentsu.\n\nSo, for example, in the third sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p. The current three tiles don't form a mentsu. But adding 1p gives four tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p, 1p. Now, among those, there's a sequence 1p, 2p, 3p. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add such that in the new collection of 3 + added tiles, there exists a subset of three tiles that forms a mentsu.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that either:\n\n- There's a triplet (three same tiles) in the collection.\n\nOR\n\n- There's a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo, how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios. For the original three tiles, maybe they can be extended to form a triplet or sequence with adding some tiles.\n\nLet's first think about the case where we can form a triplet. For example, suppose the original three tiles have two of the same. Then adding one more would make a triplet. So for example, if the original is [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding another 1m would make a triplet. So in that case, the answer is 1. But if the original is [1m, 1m, 1m], then answer is 0.\n\nAlternatively, if the original three have one of a certain tile, then adding two more would make a triplet. But that would require 2 added tiles. However, maybe there's a better way via sequences.\n\nSo, the idea is to check for all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible way to form a triplet or sequence, compute how many tiles are needed, and take the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nBut how to generate all possible possibilities?\n\nLet's break it into two parts: checking for possible triplets and checking for possible sequences.\n\nFor the triplet case:\n\nWe need to have three same tiles. Let's count how many copies of each tile are present in the original three. For example, suppose the original tiles are [a, b, c]. For each tile type, say x, how many times does it appear? Let's say for tile x, count is c_x. Then, to form a triplet of x, we need 3 copies. So the number of tiles to add is 3 - c_x. However, since the original three may have multiple tiles, but for example, if the original has two copies of x, then adding one would make three. So for each tile type in the original, we can compute how many are needed to reach three. But also, maybe other tile types could be considered. For example, if the original has no copies of x, but we can add three of them. So for example, if the original is [1m, 2p, 3s], then to form a triplet of 1m, we need to add two more 1m tiles. So that would be 2 added tiles. But perhaps there's a better option via sequences.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimal (3 - count) for all possible tile types, considering that the original tiles may contribute to counts. But also, considering that even if there are no existing copies of a tile, you can add three of them. For example, if the original has none of x, then you need to add three.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles needed is min(3 - count for each tile type in the original, plus possibly other tile types not present).\n\nWait, but for any tile type, even if it's not present in the original, we can add three of them. So, for example, the original has no 5s. Then to form a triplet of 5s, we need to add three tiles. So the minimal for triplet is min( (3 - count) for all possible tile types). But how do I compute that?\n\nBut the original has three tiles. For example, if the original is [a, b, c], then for each tile type, count is how many times it appears in the original. So, for example, if the original has two of a certain tile, then 3 - count is 1. If the original has one of a tile, then 3 - count is 2. If the original has none, then 3 - count is 3. So for the triplet case, the minimal possible is the minimum between all existing tile counts (for their 3 - count) and the possible new tile types (which would require adding 3).\n\nBut for example, if the original has a tile x with count 1, then adding two more x's would make a triplet. So for that tile, the required is 2. But for another tile y not in the original, adding three would be required. So the minimal is the minimum between all possible (3 - count_x) for existing x, and 3 for any new tile.\n\nBut since the existing x's could have counts up to 3. For example, if the original already has three of a tile, then 3 - count is zero. So the minimal is zero.\n\nBut for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add is min( (3 - count_x) for all x in existing tiles, and 3 for any new tile). However, since the existing tiles may have counts less than three, the minimal would be the minimum between the existing ones and 3. But for example, if there's a tile x in the original with count 2, then 3 - count is 1. Which is better than adding 3 for a new tile.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimum of (3 - count_x) for all x in the original, and also 3 (if there's no existing x with count >= 1). Wait, but if there's a tile x in the original with count 1, then 3 - count_x is 2, which is better than 3 (adding a new tile). So the minimal is the minimum between all (3 - count_x) for existing tiles and 3. But since the existing tiles may have counts that are 0, but that's not possible. Because the original has three tiles, so for each tile in the original, count_x is at least 1 (if it's part of the original). Wait, no. For example, the original has three different tiles. So for each tile, count_x is 1. So for example, if the original is [1m, 2p, 3s], then for each tile type, count_x is 1. So the minimal (3 - count_x) is 2. But for a new tile type, say 4m, you need 3 tiles. So the minimal for triplet is 2. So the minimal for triplet is 2.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add is min( (3 - count_x) for all x in the original, 3). But since the original has three tiles, which may be all different, then the minimal (3 - count_x) would be 2. So the triplet case can be considered as the minimal of all possible (3 - count_x) for existing tile types, and 3 for a new tile type. However, the minimal is the minimum between those.\n\nWait, but for existing tile types, the count_x can be 1, 2, or 3. For example, if the original has three same tiles, then count_x is 3, so 3 - count_x is 0. So the minimal is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add is min( (3 - count_x) for x in all tile types present in original, and 3). But since 3 is larger than (3 - count_x) for existing tiles with count_x=1 or 2, the minimal is the minimal between all (3 - count_x) for existing tile types. Unless there are no existing tile types, but that can't happen because original has three tiles.\n\nWait, but the existing tile types are the ones that are in the original. For example, if original has three different tiles, then for each of them, count is 1. So the minimal is 2. But if you choose to create a triplet of a new tile, you need to add 3. So the minimal between 2 and 3 is 2. So the triplet case can be handled by considering the existing tile types.\n\nSo, for triplet, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimal (3 - count_x) for all x in the original.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a tile type not in the original that can be used? For example, original is [1m, 1m, 2m]. So for existing tile types, 1m has count 2, 2m has count 1. So 3 - count_x for 1m is 1. So adding one tile of 1m would make a triplet. But if you choose to create a triplet of 3m, you need to add 3. So the minimal is 1. So considering existing tile types is sufficient.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles is the minimal (3 - count_x) for all x in the original's tile types.\n\nBut what if the original has two different tile types. For example, original is [1m, 1m, 2p]. Then, for the existing tile types, 1m has count 2 (so 1 needed), 2p has count 1 (needs 2). So the minimal is 1. So adding one 1m. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the triplet case can be handled by checking for each tile type in the original, how much is needed to reach three, and take the minimal of those.\n\nNow, for the sequence case.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, 1m, 2m, 3m. Or 5p,6p,7p. So, given the original three tiles, how can we find the minimal number of tiles to add to get a sequence?\n\nThis seems more complex.\n\nLet me think about the original three tiles. For example, the original tiles may have some that are in the same suit and can be part of a sequence. Or maybe not.\n\nSo, for the sequence case, we need to consider all possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think of the original three tiles. Suppose they are in the same suit. Let's say they are in the same suit. Then, we can check if they can form a sequence with some additions.\n\nFor example, original tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then, adding 3s would make a sequence. So the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. Then, adding 2s and 4s would make a sequence of 1-2-3 or 3-4-5, but that requires two tiles. Alternatively, maybe adding 2s and 4s. But that's two tiles. Or perhaps adding three tiles to make a sequence like 3-4-5, but that's already there? No, the original is 1,3,5. So to get a sequence, need to add 2 and 4. So two tiles.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer tiles. For example, if the original tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s gives a sequence of 1-2-3. So one tile.\n\nSo, how to model this for the general case.\n\nFirst, the idea is to look for possible sequences that can be formed by the original tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\nFor each possible suit (m, p, s), collect all the numbers present in the original tiles for that suit. Then, check if there's a way to form a sequence by adding tiles.\n\nFor example, let's take all the numbers in the original tiles for a particular suit. Let's say for suit 's', the original has numbers 1, 2, 4. Then, the possible sequences that can be formed are:\n\n- 1,2,3 (need to add 3)\n- 2,3,4 (need to add 3)\n- 1,2,4: not a sequence. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: original numbers for suit 's' are 1,3,5. Then, possible sequences would be:\n\n- 1,2,3 (add 2)\n- 2,3,4 (add 2 and 4)\n- 3,4,5 (add 4)\n- 1,3,5: not a sequence. So the minimal is 1 (either add 2 or add 4).\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nBut how do I find all possible sequences that can be formed, considering the original tiles and adding some tiles?\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. Then, already a sequence. So 0 tiles needed.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can check whether the existing numbers in that suit can be extended to a sequence with adding some tiles.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers present in the original tiles. Then, for each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers, check how many of them are already present, and how many need to be added.\n\nBut how to find all possible sequences that can be formed?\n\nFor example, for a suit, the numbers present are [1, 2, 4]. Then, possible sequences are [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5], etc. But for each of these sequences, we need to check how many tiles are missing.\n\nBut since the original tiles may have multiple numbers, but not all of them.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers in the suit (say, from 1-2-3, up to 7-8-9), we can check how many numbers are already present in the original tiles for that suit. Then, the number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count of existing numbers in that sequence.\n\nBut since the original may have multiple numbers in the same suit, but not all three of the sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the original has numbers 1, 2, and 4 in suit s. Then, for the sequence 1-2-3, existing numbers are 1 and 2, so need to add 1 tile (3). For the sequence 2-3-4, existing numbers are 2 and 4, so need to add 1 tile (3). For the sequence 3-4-5, existing numbers are 4, need to add 2 (3 and 5). So the minimal for this suit is 1.\n\nSo, for each suit, the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence is the minimal over all possible sequences (of three consecutive numbers) of (3 - count of existing numbers in that sequence).\n\nBut how do I generate all possible sequences for each suit?\n\nWell, for each suit, the possible sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9. So 7 possible sequences per suit.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers present in the original tiles. Then, for each of the 7 possible sequences, compute how many numbers are present in the original for that suit. Then, the number of tiles needed is 3 - that count. The minimal of all these is the minimal for that suit.\n\nThen, for all suits, take the minimal value across all suits. That would be the minimal number of tiles needed for the sequence case.\n\nSo, for example, if the original tiles are in two suits, then check for each suit's possible sequences and take the minimal.\n\nOnce we have the minimal for triplet and the minimal for sequence, the overall minimal is the minimum between these two.\n\nSo, the overall approach would be:\n\nCheck if the original three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate the minimal number of tiles needed for triplet case (triplet_min) and for the sequence case (sequence_min). Then, the answer is the minimum between triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the original tiles can be combined with added tiles to form a sequence that uses some of the original tiles and some added ones?\n\nYes, that's exactly what the sequence_min calculation does.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor the given three tiles:\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_min as the minimal (3 - count_x) for all tile types in the original.\n\nCompute sequence_min as the minimal over all suits and all possible sequences in that suit of (3 - count_in_sequence).\n\nThe answer is the minimum between triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nBut wait, what if the original has multiple suits. For example, the original has tiles in two different suits. Then, for the sequence case, we need to check for each suit separately, and take the minimal.\n\nSo, for example, if the original has tiles in m and p suits, then for each suit (m and p), we check for possible sequences, and take the minimal between them.\n\nSo, for the sequence_min, the code would be:\n\nInitialize sequence_min to a large number.\n\nFor each suit in {'m', 'p', 's'}:\n\n   collect all numbers in the original tiles of that suit.\n\n   for each possible sequence (like 1-2-3, etc.):\n\n      count how many numbers in the original are in that sequence.\n\n      required_tiles = 3 - count.\n\n      if required_tiles < sequence_min:\n\n          sequence_min = required_tiles\n\nSo, the minimal sequence_min is the minimal required tiles for any possible sequence in any suit.\n\nSo, combining the triplet_min and sequence_min, the answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility: maybe the original has two tiles in the same suit, and adding one tile to form a triplet, but also adding one tile to form a sequence. So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut the code would capture that.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given in the problem statement.\n\nThird example input: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nOriginal tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. Are they a triplet? No. Are they a sequence? They are in different suits (3p, 2p, 9m). So no. So proceed.\n\nTriplet_min: for each tile type in original:\n\ntile types are 3p (count 1), 9m (count 1), 2p (count 1). So for each, 3 - count is 2. So triplet_min is 2.\n\nSequence_min:\n\nCheck for each suit.\n\nFor suit 'p': the numbers are 3 and 2. So possible sequences:\n\n1-2-3: existing numbers 2 and 3. So count is 2. required tiles: 1 (add 1p).\n\n2-3-4: existing 2 and 3. required 1 (add 4p).\n\n3-4-5: existing 3. required 2.\n\netc. So the minimal for suit p is 1.\n\nFor suit 'm': only 9. Possible sequences:\n\n7-8-9: existing 9. required 2 (add 7 and 8).\n\netc. So the minimal for suit m is 2.\n\nFor suit 's': no numbers. So any sequence requires 3 tiles added. So minimal is 3.\n\nThus, sequence_min is 1. So the answer is min(2, 1) = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that works.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '2s', '3s'] → already a sequence. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '1s', '2s']. Check if it's a mentsu? No. Triplet_min: for tile 1s (count 2 → 1 needed), 2s (count 1 → 2 needed). So triplet_min is 1. For sequence: suit s has 1,1,2. Possible sequences:\n\n1-2-3: existing 1 and 2. Need to add 1 tile (3). So required 1. So sequence_min is 1. So answer is min(1,1) → 1. But wait, can you form a sequence with existing tiles? The existing tiles are 1s, 1s, 2s. So you can't form a sequence of three consecutive numbers. Because you need three distinct numbers. So the sequence would need to be 1,2,3. But you have two 1s and one 2. So you need to add 3. So the sequence requires 1 tile. So the answer is 1. But the triplet requires adding 1 tile (another 1s). So the answer is 1. So the code would return 1.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '2s', '4s']. So sequence_min for suit s is 1 (add 3s). Triplet_min is 3 - count for each tile. Each tile is present once. So triplet_min is 2. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. For example, the input is given as a list of three strings, but according to the sample input, the input is given as something like ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], but in the actual code, the input is read as three strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nWait, the input is three strings. So for example, the input line is something like \"1s 2s 3s\" but that's three tiles. Wait, no. Wait, the input is three strings. So for example, the input is three separate strings, like \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because the actual input is a single line with three strings. For example, in the sample input, the first case is three tiles: 1s, 2s, 3s. So the input line would be \"1s 2s 3s\". But the problem says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the input is three strings separated by spaces, but the problem's sample input is written as a list for clarity.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo the input is three strings on one line, separated by spaces. For example, the first sample input is \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nSo the code should read a line, split into three strings.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read the input as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nWhich would give a list of three elements.\n\nOnce we have the three tiles, we can process them.\n\nNow, first step: check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nCheck if they form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nFor triplet:\n\nall three tiles are same. So tile1 == tile2 == tile3.\n\nFor sequence:\n\nthey are all same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, for tiles [a, b, c], check:\n\nsuit_a == suit_b == suit_c, and sorted numbers are x, x+1, x+2.\n\nSo, for the three tiles:\n\nnumbers = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\nsuits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\nif all(s == suits[0] for s in suits):\n\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n    if sorted_numbers[1] == sorted_numbers[0] + 1 and sorted_numbers[2] == sorted_numbers[0] + 2:\n\n        return True (it's a sequence)\n\nSo, if either condition is met, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, compute triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nFirst, for triplet_min:\n\nWe need to count for each tile type in the original, how many times it occurs.\n\nWe can use a dictionary to count the frequency.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ncounts = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    counts[t] += 1\n\nThen, for each key in counts, compute 3 - counts[key], and find the minimum.\n\nBut since the original has three tiles, the counts for each tile can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut for example, if there are two same tiles and one different, then counts will have two entries: one with count 2 and another with count 1.\n\nSo, triplet_min = min(3 - count for count in counts.values())\n\nBut wait, if there are three different tiles, counts.values() would be [1,1,1], so triplet_min is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, triplet_min is min(3 - count for count in counts.values()).\n\nBut what if the original has three same tiles? Then, counts.values() would have [3], so triplet_min is 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, for the sequence_min.\n\nWe need to process each suit, collect the numbers present in that suit.\n\nFor example, for each suit in m, p, s:\n\ncollect the numbers in the original tiles that belong to that suit.\n\nSo:\n\nsuit_numbers = defaultdict(set)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    suit = t[1]\n\n    num = int(t[0])\n\n    suit_numbers[suit].add(num)\n\nThen, for each suit in suit_numbers:\n\n   numbers_in_suit = sorted(suit_numbers[suit])\n\n   for each possible sequence in the suit (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.)\n\n      check how many numbers in numbers_in_suit are in the sequence.\n\nSo, for example, for numbers_in_suit = [1,2,4], the possible sequences are:\n\n1-2-3 → numbers_in_suit has 1 and 2 → count is 2 → required is 1.\n\n2-3-4 → numbers_in_suit has 2 and 4 → count is 2 → required is 1.\n\netc.\n\nSo, for each suit, we need to generate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9), and for each sequence, compute how many of the numbers are present in the suit's numbers.\n\nThen, the minimal required is 3 - count.\n\nSo, for each suit, generate all possible sequences and compute the minimal required.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nsequence_min = infinity\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    numbers_in_suit = suit_numbers.get(suit, set())\n\n    # generate all possible sequences for this suit\n\n    for start in range(1, 8):  # 1-7, since 7+2=9\n\n        seq = [start, start+1, start+2]\n\n        # count how many numbers in numbers_in_suit are in seq\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for num in seq:\n\n            if num in numbers_in_suit:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < sequence_min:\n\n            sequence_min = required\n\nSo, after checking all suits and all sequences, sequence_min holds the minimal required tiles for a sequence.\n\nOnce we have triplet_min and sequence_min, the answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no numbers in a suit? For example, if the suit is 'm' and none of the original tiles are in 'm'. Then, numbers_in_suit is empty. For each sequence in that suit, count is 0. required is 3. Which is handled correctly.\n\nSo, the code for sequence_min would include all possible sequences.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, the code needs to check if the original tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute triplet_min and sequence_min, and return the minimum between them.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute triplet_min and sequence_min as discussed.\n\noutput min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nNow, code for checking if the original is a mentsu.\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    numbers = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    return numbers[1] == numbers[0] + 1 and numbers[2] == numbers[0] + 2\n\nSo, if this returns True, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nif is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # compute triplet_min and sequence_min\n\n    # triplet_min\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for t in tiles:\n\n        counts[t] += 1\n\n    triplet_min = min(3 - cnt for cnt in counts.values())\n\n    # sequence_min\n\n    suit_numbers = defaultdict(set)\n\n    for t in tiles:\n\n        suit = t[1]\n\n        num = int(t[0])\n\n        suit_numbers[suit].add(num)\n\n    sequence_min = float('inf')\n\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        nums = suit_numbers[suit]\n\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n\n            seq = [start, start+1, start+2]\n\n            count = 0\n\n            for num in seq:\n\n                if num in nums:\n\n                    count +=1\n\n            required = 3 - count\n\n            if required < sequence_min:\n\n                sequence_min = required\n\n    answer = min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n\n    print(answer)\n\nWait, but in the case where the triplet_min is 2 and the sequence_min is 1, the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's test the third example:\n\nSample input: '3p 9m 2p'\n\ntiles = ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nis_mentsu:\n\nCheck triplet: 3p, 9m, 2p are all different → no.\n\nCheck sequence: suits are p, m, p. So len(set(suits)) is 2 → no. So returns false.\n\nProceed.\n\ncounts:\n\n3p: 1, 9m: 1, 2p: 1 → triplet_min is min(2, 2, 2) → 2.\n\nsequence_min:\n\nsuit_numbers:\n\nfor 'p': {3, 2}\n\nfor 'm': {9}\n\nfor 's': empty.\n\nProcessing suit 'p':\n\nfor start from 1 to 7:\n\nstart=1 → seq [1,2,3]. nums has 2 and 3 → count is 2 → required 1.\n\nstart=2 → seq [2,3,4]. nums has 2 and 3 → count 2 → required 1.\n\nstart=3 → [3,4,5] → nums has 3 → count 1 → required 2.\n\netc. So the minimal for suit p is 1.\n\nsuit 'm' has numbers {9}:\n\nfor start=7 → seq [7,8,9]. count is 1 → required 2.\n\nstart=8 → seq [8,9,10] → 9 is present → count 1 → required 2.\n\netc. So for suit m, the minimal required is 2.\n\nsuit 's' has no numbers. All sequences require 3.\n\nSo sequence_min is 1.\n\nanswer is min(2, 1) → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['1s', '1s', '2s'].\n\nis_mentsu: triplet? No. Sequence? Suits are same. numbers sorted are [1,1,2]. sorted is [1,1,2]. So the numbers are not consecutive. So returns false.\n\ntriplet_min: counts are 1s: 2, 2s: 1. triplet_min is min(3-2=1, 3-1=2) → 1.\n\nsequence_min:\n\nfor suit s:\n\nnumbers are {1,2}.\n\nfor start=1 → seq [1,2,3]. count is 2 → required 1.\n\nso sequence_min is 1. answer is min(1, 1) → 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input ['1m', '1m', '1m'] → is_mentsu returns True → answer 0.\n\nAnother test case: input ['1m', '1m', '2m'] → is_mentsu? triplet? no. sequence? numbers sorted [1,1,2]. not consecutive. So no. triplet_min is 3 - 2 (for 1m) → 1. sequence_min: for suit m, numbers are {1,2}. For start=1, seq 1,2,3 → count is 2 → required 1. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nBut what if the user adds 2m? Then the tiles would be [1m, 1m, 2m, 2m]. Then, there's a triplet of 1m (needs 3, but only two). Or, adding one tile of 2m would make triplet of 2m? No, original is 1m, 1m, 2m. Adding one 2m would make two 2m's. No. So triplet_min is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, think about edge cases.\n\nCase where the original has two tiles of same suit and one of another. For example, ['1m', '1m', '2p'].\n\nCheck if it's a mentsu: no.\n\ntrip",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand.
