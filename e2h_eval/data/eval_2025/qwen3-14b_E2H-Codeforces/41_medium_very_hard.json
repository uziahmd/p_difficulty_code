There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.

The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all restrictions.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But with n=50 and h=50, trying all possibilities would be 50^50 possibilities, which is way too big. That's impossible.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's think about constraints. Each restriction imposes that the maximum in a certain interval is <= x_i. So for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height of the houses in that interval can't exceed x_i.\n\nThe challenge is to assign heights to each house such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible value for each house? Well, each house's height can be up to h, but also subject to all the restrictions that apply to it.\n\nBut how to model the constraints? For example, if a house is part of multiple ranges, the maximum allowed height for that house is the minimum of all the x_i's from the restrictions that cover it, but maybe not exactly. Because a restriction applies to a range. For instance, a restriction on [1,3] with x=2 means that the maximum in that range is 2. So each house in that range can be up to 2, but maybe even lower if there are other constraints.\n\nWait, but the maximum in the range must be <= x_i. So for each restriction, the maximum of the houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So for each such interval, the maximum of the houses in that interval can't exceed x_i. So for each interval, the maximum of the houses in that interval is constrained.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like a constraint satisfaction problem. And since n is small (up to 50), perhaps we can find for each position the maximum possible height it can have, given all the constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints are overlapping. For example, if there's a restriction that says the max in [1,2] is 3, and another that says the max in [2,3] is 2. Then the house at position 2 can be at most 2, because the second restriction requires that the max in [2,3] is 2. So even though the first restriction allows up to 3 in [1,2], the house at 2 can't be higher than 2. So the maximum for house 2 is min of all the restrictions that include it in their ranges, but perhaps not exactly. Because a restriction may not directly apply to a particular house, but affect it via the maximum in a range.\n\nAlternatively, for each house, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of h and all the x_i's from restrictions that cover that house in their ranges. Wait, no. Because a restriction on [l_i, r_i] with x_i says that the maximum of the entire interval is <=x_i. So, for example, if a house is in that interval, then its height can be up to x_i, but if there's another restriction that allows a higher value for that house, but the maximum in some other interval may require that it's lower. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the way to model it is that for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i across all restrictions that cover that house in their interval. But that's not correct. Because suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,2] with x=3. Then the house 2 can be up to 3, but the restriction on [1,3] says that the maximum in that interval can't exceed 2. So house 2 can't be higher than 2. Because the maximum in [1,3] would be 2. So even though there's a restriction that allows house 2 to be up to 3, the other restriction limits it.\n\nSo, the maximum height for a house is not just determined by the restrictions that directly apply to it, but also those that apply to ranges that include it. Therefore, the problem is not as simple as taking the min of all x_i's that cover that house.\n\nSo how to model this? It's a problem of finding for each house, the maximum possible height such that for every restriction, the maximum in the interval [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with constraints. However, solving this directly might be challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: since n is small (up to 50), and h is up to 50, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming or some kind of backtracking with pruning. However, even with n=50 and h=50, trying all possibilities is impossible. But maybe we can find for each position the maximum possible height it can take, considering all constraints.\n\nAnother idea: For each restriction, the maximum in the interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. This implies that for each house in that interval, the height can't be more than x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. Therefore, for each restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i], all houses in that interval must have height <= x_i. Wait, is this correct?\n\nNo. Because the maximum of the interval must be <= x_i. Which means that all houses in the interval must be <= x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the maximum is higher than x_i, violating the restriction. So yes! Therefore, each restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i] implies that for every position j in l_i to r_i, the height of j must be <= x_i. Because otherwise, the maximum in that interval would be higher than x_i.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight. Because if a restriction says that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i, then each individual house in that interval must be <= x_i. Because if even one house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the maximum is higher than x_i, which violates the restriction. Therefore, each restriction implies that for all positions in [l_i, r_i], their heights must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, but this is not correct. Suppose that there is a restriction that the maximum of [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. Then, the maximum of the interval is <= x_i. Therefore, all houses in the interval must be <= x_i. So, the restriction is equivalent to saying that for each position j in [l_i, r_i], height[j] <= x_i. Because if even one of them is higher, the maximum would be higher than x_i. Therefore, each restriction can be converted into a set of constraints on individual houses.\n\nWait, this seems to be the case. So, for example, if there is a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then each of the houses 1, 2, 3 must be <= 2. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding for each house, the maximum possible height it can have, which is the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions that cover that house. Because each restriction that includes the house in its interval imposes that the house's height is <= x_i. Therefore, the maximum possible height for a house is min(h, min of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval).\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the problem becomes trivial. Because for each house, we can compute the maximum possible height allowed by all restrictions, and then set each house to that maximum. Then, the total profit would be the sum of squares of those values.\n\nBut why does the example work? Let's check the first example:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nEach house is covered by a restriction. House 1 is in the first restriction, so max height is 1. House 2 is in the second restriction, which allows 3. House 3 is in third restriction, allows 2. So the maximum heights are 1,3,2. Sum of squares is 1+9+4=14, which matches the example. So that works.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n4 10 2\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nSo for house 1, there are no restrictions, so max height is h=10. House 2 is in restriction 1 (x=8). House 3 is in both restrictions (restriction 1 x=8 and restriction 2 x=7). So the min of 8 and 7 is 7. House 4 is in restriction 2, x=7. So the max heights are 10, 8, 7, 7. Sum of squares is 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262, which matches the example.\n\nSo that seems to work. But why is that the case? Because each restriction is equivalent to imposing that all houses in [l_i, r_i] are <= x_i. Therefore, for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval. Then, setting each house to that maximum would satisfy all restrictions.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple restrictions that apply to different ranges. For example, suppose there are two restrictions: one on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [2,3] with x=2. Then, house 2 is in both ranges. So the maximum allowed for house 2 is min(3, 2) = 2. But for house 1, only the first restriction applies, so it's allowed to be up to 3. House 3 is allowed up to 2. So the maximum for each house is 3, 2, 2. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 3 (house 1) and 2 (house 2). So the maximum is 3, which is larger than x_i of 3? Wait, the first restriction says that the maximum in [1,2] must be <=3. Which is exactly the case. So the maximum is 3, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2. Then, each house in 1-3 must be <=2. So the maximum in that interval is 2, which satisfies the restriction. So this approach works.\n\nBut what if there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] is 2, and another restriction that says the maximum in [1,2] is 3. Then, the first restriction requires that all houses 1-3 are <=2. The second restriction requires that houses 1-2 are <=3. But since the first restriction already requires that houses 1-2 are <=2, which is stricter than 3. So the second restriction is redundant. So the maximum for each house is determined by the first restriction.\n\nTherefore, the approach of taking for each house the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval is correct.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that for each house?\n\nFor each house j (from 1 to n), collect all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Then, the maximum allowed height for j is min( h, min( x_i for all such restrictions ) )\n\nIf there are no restrictions that include j, then the maximum allowed is h.\n\nOnce we have that, then the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum allowed value. Because the sum of squares is maximized when each house is as high as possible.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the sum of squares is maximized when each individual term is as large as possible. Since each house can be set to the maximum allowed, which is the minimum of all constraints that apply to it, then that's the optimal.\n\nSo this approach would work. But why didn't the problem mention that the restrictions are equivalent to per-house constraints? Because maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose there are two restrictions. One says that the maximum in [1, 2] is 3. Another says that the maximum in [2, 3] is 4. So for house 2, the x_i's are 3 and 4. So the min is 3, so house 2 can be up to 3. But then, in the interval [2,3], the maximum is 3 (house 2) and whatever house 3 is. But the restriction says that the maximum must be <=4. Which is true. So that's okay. But what if house 3 is allowed to be up to 4, but the restriction on [2,3] is satisfied because the maximum is 3 (house 2) and 4 (house 3)? Wait, no. Because the restriction says that the maximum in [2,3] must be <=4. Which is satisfied. So in this case, house 3 can be set to 4. So according to our approach, for house 3, the restrictions that include it are the second restriction (x=4). So the maximum allowed is 4. So house 3 is set to 4. Then the maximum in [2,3] is 4, which is allowed. So that's correct.\n\nSo our approach works here.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's a restriction that the maximum in [1,3] is 2. Then, each house can be up to 2. But suppose there is another restriction that the maximum in [1,1] is 3. Then, for house 1, the min of 2 and 3 is 2. So house 1 can be up to 2, which satisfies both restrictions. The maximum in [1,1] is 2 <=3, which is allowed. The maximum in [1,3] is 2 <=2, which is allowed. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct. Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each house j, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their interval. Then, the maximum allowed height for j is min( h, that minimal x_i ). If there are no restrictions that include j, then it's h. Then, the maximum profit is the sum of squares of these values.\n\nWait, but this seems too easy. Why is the problem considered hard then? Let me check the note in the problem statement again.\n\nIn the second example, the first restriction is on [2,3] with x=8, the second on [3,4] with x=7. So house 3 is in both. So the minimal x_i for house 3 is 7. So house 3 is 7, house 4 is 7. House 2 is 8. House 1 is 10. Which gives the sum as 10² + 8² +7² +7² = 262. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where the restrictions are not per-house, but the maximum in a range is constrained. For example, suppose there are two restrictions: one on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [1,2] with x=2. Then, the maximum allowed for each house is 2. So the maximum in the range is 2, which satisfies both restrictions. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if there's a restriction on [1,2] with x=3, and another restriction on [1,2] with x=4. Then, the minimal x_i is 3, so the maximum allowed is 3. Which satisfies both restrictions.\n\nSo the approach of taking the minimal x_i for each house across all restrictions that include it in their interval is correct.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to for each house, find the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover it, then take min(h, that value), and sum the squares.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each house j (from 1 to n), find all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval.\n\n2. For each such j, compute the minimum x_i among those restrictions. If there are no such restrictions, then the maximum height is h.\n\n3. The maximum allowed height for j is min( h, min_x ), where min_x is the minimum of the x_i's from the restrictions that cover j.\n\nThen sum the squares of these values.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. For each of the m restrictions, we can iterate through all positions in l_i to r_i and record the x_i as a possible constraint for that position. For each position, we track the minimum x_i across all such constraints.\n\nSo for example, for each position j, we can initialize a variable max_allowed as h. Then, for each restriction, if j is between l_i and r_i, then we check if x_i is less than the current max_allowed for j. If so, we update it.\n\nYes. So the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize an array allowed_heights of size n, with each element initialized to h.\n\nThen, for each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i):\n\n   for j in l_i to r_i:\n\n       if allowed_heights[j-1] > x_i:\n\n           allowed_heights[j-1] = x_i\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, the allowed_heights array contains for each position the minimal x_i from the restrictions that cover it. Then, the maximum profit is the sum of squares of allowed_heights.\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because for each restriction, we are enforcing that all positions in [l_i, r_i] have their allowed_heights as at most x_i. So the allowed_heights for each position is the minimum between the original h and all x_i's of the restrictions that cover it.\n\nYes. So this approach would work.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for position 1, allowed_heights[0] = min(3, 1) = 1.\n\n2 2 3 → allowed_heights[1] is min(3,3) → 3.\n\n3 3 2 → allowed_heights[2] is min(3,2) → 2.\n\nSum of squares is 1² +3² +2² = 14. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → positions 2 and 3. allowed_heights[1] is 8, allowed_heights[2] is 8.\n\nThen, restriction 3-4 7 → positions 3 and 4. allowed_heights[2] is min(8,7) →7. allowed_heights[3] is 7.\n\nSo allowed_heights is [10, 8,7,7]. Sum is 10² + 8² +7² +7² = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a restriction is redundant? For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions: [1,2,3], [1,2,4]. Then, for each position, allowed_heights is 3. So sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nWhich is correct because the first restriction requires the max in [1,2] to be <=3, which is satisfied.\n\nAnother case: if there is a restriction that covers a range, but another restriction that covers a subset. For example, n=3, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,3], x=2. Restriction 2: [2,2], x=3. Then, for position 2, the allowed is min(2,3) → 2. So the allowed_heights for all positions is 2, 2, 2. Which satisfies both restrictions.\n\nYes. The first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is 2. The second restriction requires that the max in [2,2] is 3. But since the allowed height for position 2 is 2, which is <=3, the second restriction is satisfied.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize allowed_heights as [h] * n.\n\nFor each of m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n   for j in range(l-1, r):  # because l and r are 1-based, and j is 0-based.\n\n       if allowed_heights[j] > x:\n\n           allowed_heights[j] = x\n\nThen, compute the sum of squares of allowed_heights.\n\nWait, but why do we process all the restrictions? Because each restriction may impose a new constraint on some positions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems straightforward. Let's see if there's any edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: no restrictions. Then allowed_heights is all h. Sum is n * h².\n\nEdge case 2: a restriction that covers all positions. For example, n=5, h=10, m=1, restriction [1,5, 5]. Then allowed_heights is [5,5,5,5,5]. Sum is 5*25=125.\n\nAnother edge case: overlapping restrictions. For example, two restrictions on the same range with different x. For example, [1,2,3], [1,2,4]. The allowed_heights would be 3 for each position.\n\nAnother case: multiple restrictions on different ranges. For example, n=3, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,1], x=2. Restriction 2: [2,3], x=3. Then allowed_heights are 2,3,3. Sum is 4 +9 +9 =22.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach seems correct. Then why is the problem considered hard? Oh, maybe I'm missing some constraints. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that each restriction says that the tallest house from l_i to r_i must be at most x_i. But according to the approach, we are ensuring that each house in that range is at most x_i. Which makes the maximum in the range to be at most x_i. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nallowed_heights starts as [3,3,3].\n\nAfter first restriction (1-1, x=1): allowed_heights[0] becomes 1.\n\nAfter second (2-2, x=3): allowed_heights[1] is 3.\n\nAfter third (3-3, x=2): allowed_heights[2] becomes 2. So sum is 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nallowed_heights starts as [10,10,10,10].\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3. So positions 1 and 2 (0-based) in allowed_heights. So allowed_heights[1] becomes 8, allowed_heights[2] becomes 8.\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4. Positions 2 and 3 (0-based). allowed_heights[2] is min(8,7) →7. allowed_heights[3] becomes 7. So the array is [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100+64+49+49= 262. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the examples.\n\nSo the code is simple. Now, let's code it.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead the input. The input is given as a list of strings, but in the problem's sample, the input is given as multiple lines. However, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in reality, when the code runs, it should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut that's probably the input for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the desired outputs. But the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or perhaps the example is showing two separate test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem's input description says that the first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So each test case is one input. However, the example shows two inputs, but perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, the sample output shows two outputs. But the problem's input description says that the code should read from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired output. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input format is unclear. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem's input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is one test case. Then the second input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich is another test case. So the code should process multiple test cases. But how many?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as per the problem's input description. But in the sample input, the user provided two test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention multiple test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample shows two outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLooking back at the problem's input and output description:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line with n, h, m, then m lines. The output is a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two separate test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each with their own input. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But looking at the sample input and output, the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nWait, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but the problem's actual input is probably multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input format is unclear. But the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m, etc.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains three integers. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each given as per the input format. However, the problem's original input may have multiple test cases. But how can we know? Let's look at the problem's sample input and output again.\n\nIn the problem's sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases. The output is two lines. So the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's input and output description, the sample input is given as a list of strings, which may be indicating that the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may be a single test case. However, the problem's sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output has two answers. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how? Because in the original problem statement, the input may be a single test case. However, the sample shows two. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given in the input. But how to determine how many test cases there are?\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is the first test case's input, then the second line is the second test case's input. But how to read that in Python?\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, when the code runs, the input comes from stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the user is providing two test cases as separate inputs, but the actual problem expects a single test case. However, the problem's original input description doesn't mention multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps this is a mistake in the problem's sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the actual problem expects the code to process one test case. However, the sample output shows two outputs. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired output. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each given in the input.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the first line. However, in this problem's input description, there's no mention of that.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first test case has 3+3 lines (the first line is n, h, m, then m lines). The second test case has 4+2 lines. So the code should read until EOF. So perhaps the code should process all test cases present in the input.\n\nBut how to parse that? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them as per test cases. Each test case starts with a line with n, h, m, followed by m lines of restrictions.\n\nSo the code would read all input lines, split them into test cases. For example, for each test case, read the first line as n, h, m, then read the next m lines as restrictions. Then repeat until all input is processed.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? Let's think.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then process them as a list.\n\nSo, for example, the code would:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, process each test case. Let's have a pointer i starting at 0. While i < len(lines):\n\n   Read line i as n, h, m.\n\n   Then read next m lines as the restrictions.\n\n   Process this test case.\n\n   i += m + 1.\n\nBut how to handle this correctly? Let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample input lines are:\n\nLine 0: '3 3 3'\n\nLine 1: '1 1 1'\n\nLine 2: '2 2 3'\n\nLine 3: '3 3 2'\n\nLine 4: '4 10 2'\n\nLine 5: '2 3 8'\n\nLine 6: '3 4 7'\n\nSo for the first test case, i starts at 0. Read n=3, h=3, m=3. Then read lines 1, 2, 3. Then i becomes 0 + 3 + 1 = 4. Then process the next test case: line 4 is '4 10 2', then read lines 5 and 6. Then i becomes 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which is beyond the length of lines (7 lines, indexes 0-6). So that's correct.\n\nSo the code can process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input may have only one test case. However, the sample shows two. Therefore, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each test case as per the above.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nInitialize allowed_heights as [h] * n.\n\nThen, for each of m restrictions:\n\n   read l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\n   for j in range(l_i-1, r_i):\n\n       allowed_heights[j] = min(allowed_heights[j], x_i)\n\nThen, compute the sum of squares.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n, h, m\n\n        if not lines[idx].strip():\n\n            idx += 1\n\n            continue\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        allowed = [h] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n            idx += 1\n\n            # Iterate from l-1 to r-1 inclusive\n\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n                if allowed[j] > x:\n\n                    allowed[j] = x\n\n        total = sum(a*a for a in allowed)\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if the input has multiple test cases, and each test case is processed as described.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nallowed is [3,3,3]\n\nProcessing the three restrictions:\n\nFirst restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1. So j runs from 0 to 0 (inclusive). allowed[0] becomes 1.\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2. j is 1. allowed[1] is 3, which is min(3,3) → stays 3.\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3. j is 2. allowed[2] is 3 → min(3,2) → 2.\n\nsum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 14. Printed.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nallowed is [10, 10, 10, 10]\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3 → j runs from 1 to 2 (inclusive). So for j=1 and 2, set to min(10, 8) → 8. allowed becomes [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4 → j runs from 2 to 3. For j=2: min(8,7) →7. j=3: min(10,7) →7. allowed becomes [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Printed.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case where there are no restrictions. For example, n=2, h=5, m=0. Then allowed is [5,5]. sum is 50.\n\nAnother case where a restriction is [1, n], x=0. Then all allowed_heights are 0. sum is 0.\n\nAnother case where a restriction is [1,1], x=0, and another [2,2], x=0. Then allowed is [0,0], sum is 0.\n\nAnother case where a restriction is [1,2], x=3, and another [2,3], x=4. allowed for position 1 is 3, position 2 is min(3,4)=3, position 3 is 4. So sum is 3² +3² +4² = 9+9+16=34.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, this code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house's height contributes to the profit as the square of its height, and we must ensure that the tallest house in any restricted range does not exceed the specified maximum height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given range must not exceed a certain height. This implies that every house within that range must be at most the specified height.\n2. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the maximum allowed height for each house to the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate through the affected range of houses and update their maximum allowed height to be the minimum of their current value and the restriction's specified height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Skip empty lines if any\n        while idx < len(lines) and not lines[idx].strip():\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n            break\n        # Read n, h, m\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        allowed = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            if idx >= len(lines):\n                break\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n            idx += 1\n            # Apply the restriction to the range [l, r]\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if allowed[j] > x:\n                    allowed[j] = x\n        total = sum(a * a for a in allowed)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize an array `allowed` where each element starts with the maximum height `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the allowed heights for the affected range of houses to ensure they do not exceed the specified maximum height.\n4. **Profit Calculation**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the allowed heights for each house.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by setting each house's height to the highest possible value allowed by the constraints. The complexity is efficient given the constraints (n, h, m ≤ 50), making it feasible to process each restriction directly.",
