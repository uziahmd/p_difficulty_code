Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum sum.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to decide, at each step, whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit. But since both players are trying to maximize their own totals, but the problem says that the total sum (S1 + S2) is what needs to be maximized. Wait, but since each digit taken is added to either S1 or S2, the total sum is the sum of all digits in A multiplied by 10^something? Or wait, no. Wait, the numbers S1 and S2 are formed by appending digits. For example, if Homer takes digits 1 and 2, his number is 12. Similarly for Marge. So the total prize is the value of S1 plus the value of S2. So, the problem is to choose the order of taking digits such that when you add the two numbers, it's as large as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because each digit taken contributes to the value of the number based on its position. For example, the first digit taken by Homer is the most significant digit of his number. So, the order in which they take digits affects the total sum.\n\nBut since the sum is S1 + S2, which depends on the digits' positions in their respective numbers, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track the state of how many digits each player has taken so far, and the current position in the string A.\n\nLet me think. Let's say that at any step, there are k digits left. But the state is determined by how many moves Homer and Marge have made. Since each has to make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of moves Homer has made, and m is the number of moves Marge has made. Since each move increases either h or m by 1, and the total steps is 2n, then h + m = current step count. So, for example, when the game starts, h=0, m=0. After one move, either h=1, m=0 (if Homer took it) or h=0, m=1 (if Marge took it). The maximum possible h and m is n each.\n\nAt each state (h, m), we can choose to take the next digit for Homer or Marge, provided that h < n or m < n respectively. Then, the problem is to choose the path that maximizes the total sum.\n\nBut how do we compute the value of choosing a particular move? Let's think about the contribution of the current digit. Suppose the current digit is d. If Homer takes it, then it will be added to his number as the next digit. Since Homer's number is built by appending digits, the position of this digit in his number depends on how many digits he has already taken. For example, if Homer has taken h digits before, then this new digit is the (h+1)-th digit, which contributes d * 10^{n - (h+1)} } to his number. Similarly for Marge.\n\nWait, but the total sum S1 + S2 would be the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values. For example, for Homer's digits: the first digit he takes is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. Similarly for Marge. So, when we take a digit, the contribution to the total sum depends on which player takes it and how many digits that player has already taken.\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the next digit is the current first digit of A. Let's say that the current position in the string is determined by the number of digits taken so far. Since initially, the string is length 2n, and each step removes one digit. So, after (h + m) steps, the next digit is at position (h + m) of the original string. Wait, no. Because each step removes the leftmost digit. So, the initial string is A. After taking the first digit, the remaining string is A[1:]. Then the next digit is the new leftmost. So, the current digit is A's (h + m)-th index (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, the initial string has 2n digits. So, for example, if h + m steps have been taken, then the next digit is the (h + m)th character in the original string. Because the first step takes the 0th index, then the next step takes the 1st index, etc. So, the current digit is A[ h + m ].\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the next digit is A[ h + m ].\n\nNow, when we choose to take this digit for Homer (if h < n), then the contribution to the total sum is d * 10^{ (n - (h + 1)) }, because Homer's number has h digits before this step, and this new digit is the (h+1)th digit. Since the total number of digits in Homer's number is n, the place value is 10^{n - (h+1)} }.\n\nSimilarly, if Marge takes the digit, the contribution is d * 10^{ (n - (m + 1)) }.\n\nBut wait, the total sum S1 + S2 is the sum of all digits in Homer's number multiplied by their respective place values, plus the same for Marge's. So, each time a digit is added to either S1 or S2, the contribution is determined by the position in that player's number.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled with dynamic programming, where the state is (h, m), and the value is the maximum total sum achievable from that state onwards.\n\nThe recurrence relation would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (current_digit_contribution_for_Homer + dp[h+1][m]), (current_digit_contribution_for_Marge + dp[h][m+1]) )\n\nBut since the current digit is fixed (A[ h + m ]), we can compute the contribution for each choice.\n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n. Then, there are no more digits to take, so the sum is 0.\n\nBut wait, since h + m = steps taken so far. The total steps is 2n, so when h + m = 2n, then h must be n and m must be n. So, the base case is when h + m = 2n, which is when h = n and m = n.\n\nSo, the DP approach would be to compute for each (h, m) the maximum sum possible from that state.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the number of states is (n+1) * (n+1). For n=18, that's 19*19 = 361 states. Which is manageable.\n\nBut for each state, we need to calculate the contribution of the current digit, which is A[ h + m ].\n\nWait, but how do we compute the contribution? Let's think. Let's say that in state (h, m), the current digit is A[ h + m ].\n\nIf Homer takes it, then his number will have h + 1 digits. The contribution of this digit to the total sum is digit * 10^{ (n - (h + 1)) }.\n\nSimilarly, for Marge taking it, it's digit * 10^{ (n - (m + 1)) }.\n\nSo, for each state, we can calculate these two possibilities and choose the one that gives the maximum total sum.\n\nSo, the DP function can be memoized, and we can use recursion with memoization.\n\nBut since n is small (up to 18), even a recursive approach with memoization should be acceptable.\n\nOnce we compute the DP table, we can also track the path that leads to the maximum sum. For that, during the DP computation, we can record for each state whether the optimal choice was to take Homer or Marge.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the digits of A as a list, for easy access.\n\n- Implement a memoization-based DP function that for each (h, m) returns the maximum sum possible, and also the choice (H or M) that leads to that maximum.\n\n- Once the DP is filled, we can backtrack from (0, 0) to build the sequence of choices.\n\nBut how to compute the 10^{...} terms efficiently?\n\nWell, for each possible h and m, we can precompute the exponents. For example, for Homer's contribution when taking the current digit, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)), which is (n - h - 1). Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut since n is up to 18, the maximum exponent is 18 - 0 - 1 = 17, so 10^17. But for numbers up to 18 digits, the exponents can be precomputed as powers of 10, but since the digits are up to 9, the actual values can be very large. However, since Python handles big integers well, we don't have to worry about overflow.\n\nBut for the DP, the memoization needs to compute the maximum sum, which could be up to 2 * 9 * (10^18) (since each digit is 9, and each can be in a position of up to 10^18). But in Python, that's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, parse the input: read n and A. Then, convert A into a list of integers, say digits = [int(c) for c in A].\n\nThen, create a memoization table for DP. But since Python doesn't have a built-in memoization for functions with mutable parameters, we can use lru_cache with memoization, but since n is small, even a 2D array can be used.\n\nBut for memoization, perhaps using memoization via a dictionary or memo table.\n\nAlternatively, since the parameters h and m are small (each up to 18), we can use memoization via a 2D array.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using memoization with recursion is easier.\n\nBut for Python, using lru_cache with memoization is straightforward. However, since the digits are needed for the current step, which depends on h and m, the function would need to know the digits. So, perhaps the DP function is written as follows:\n\nDefine a function max_sum(h, m) that returns the maximum total sum achievable from state (h, m).\n\nThe function would check if h + m exceeds 2n (but since h and m can't exceed n, the maximum h + m is 2n when h = n and m = n). So, the base case is when h == n and m == n: return 0.\n\nElse, the current digit is digits[ h + m ].\n\nIf Homer can take the next move (h < n), then we can take the digit for Homer. The contribution is digit * 10^(n - (h + 1)) plus the result of max_sum(h+1, m).\n\nSimilarly for Marge: if m < n, the contribution is digit * 10^(n - (m + 1)) plus max_sum(h, m+1).\n\nWe need to choose the option (H or M) which gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut for memoization, we can cache the results for each (h, m) pair.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, we can then backtrack through the choices to find the sequence of H and M.\n\nBut how to backtrack? We can have another memoization table that records, for each (h, m), whether the optimal choice was to take H or M.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP calculation, we can track the choice.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = list of integers of A.\n\nprecompute pow10: for exponents from 0 to n.\n\nWait, for each possible h and m, when Homer takes a digit, the exponent is (n - h - 1). For example, when h is 0, the first digit taken by Homer is the first digit of his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1}.\n\nSo, for each h and m, the exponents can be calculated on the fly.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps precompute a power of 10 for each possible position.\n\nBut for n up to 18, it's manageable.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplement a memoization-based DP.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using lru_cache with parameters h and m.\n\nBut since the digits are fixed, the function can access them as a global variable.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h == n and m == n:\n        return 0\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    # possible choices\n    options = []\n    if h < n:\n        # Homer takes the digit\n        exponent = n - (h + 1)\n        contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n        next_val = dp(h+1, m)\n        options.append(contribution + next_val)\n    if m < n:\n        # Marge takes the digit\n        exponent = n - (m + 1)\n        contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n        next_val = dp(h, m+1)\n        options.append(contribution + next_val)\n    return max(options)\n\nBut wait, this code would compute the maximum sum. However, for backtracking, we need to know which choice was taken. So, perhaps we need another function that tracks the path.\n\nAlternatively, once the DP table is filled, we can reconstruct the path by checking, for each (h, m), whether choosing H or M gives the maximum value.\n\nBut for that, during the DP process, we can also track the choice. However, with the current code, the DP function only returns the maximum value, not the choice.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to separate the DP into two parts: first, compute the maximum sum for each (h, m), and then reconstruct the path by checking for each (h, m) which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute the DP table, storing the maximum sum for each (h, m). Then, during backtracking, starting from (0, 0), we check if choosing H gives the maximum sum, or M.\n\nBut how to compute the DP table? Well, the above code uses memoization, but perhaps it's better to compute it with memoization and then backtrack.\n\nBut for the code, let's proceed.\n\nOnce the DP function is computed, the backtracking can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize h = 0, m = 0.\n\nresult = []\n\nwhile h + m < 2n:\n\n    current_pos = h + m\n\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        # check which option (H or M) gives higher value\n\n        val_h = current_digit * 10 ** (n - (h+1)) + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        val_m = current_digit * 10 ** (n - (m+1)) + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n\n            result.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        # only H can take\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # only M can take\n\n        result.append('M')\n\n        m += 1\n\nBut how to compute val_h and val_m? Because in the DP function, the value is stored. However, the code above would recompute the values, but since the DP is memoized, it's okay.\n\nBut wait, the DP function returns the maximum value. So, for the current state (h, m), the maximum value is max( val_h, val_m ). But how can we check which of the two options gives that maximum?\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can store not just the maximum value, but also the choice made. But that would require a separate memoization table for choices.\n\nAlternatively, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can compute both possibilities and compare which one is equal to the DP value.\n\nBut for that, the DP function must return the maximum value for (h, m).\n\nSo, for example, for the current (h, m), the value is dp(h, m). To find out which choice leads to that value, we can compute the value for both options (if possible) and see which one equals the dp value.\n\nBut for cases where both options are possible, and the maximum is achieved by both (i.e., equal values), then we can choose either, as per the problem statement (output any of them).\n\nSo, the backtracking code would look like this:\n\npath = []\n\nh, m = 0, 0\n\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n\n    current_pos = h + m\n\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n\n    # Check possible options\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        # Compute value if H is chosen\n\n        val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n        val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n\n            path.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            path.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        path.append('H')\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        path.append('M')\n\n        m += 1\n\nBut this requires that the dp function is already computed. However, the problem is that during the backtracking, we are recomputing val_h and val_m, which are the same as the dp function's calculation. But since the dp function is memoized, this should not be a problem.\n\nBut wait, the dp function returns the maximum of those two values. So, for example, val_h and val_m are the possible options, and dp(h, m) is the maximum between them. So, during backtracking, when we compute val_h and val_m, and compare them to the dp value, we can see which one was chosen.\n\nBut in the code above, we are not comparing to dp(h, m), but instead, directly comparing val_h and val_m. But since dp(h, m) is the maximum of these two, then the code is correct.\n\nBut in reality, the code is correct because the val_h and val_m are the same as the ones used in the dp function. Therefore, the code would select the correct choice.\n\nBut how to handle the case where both options are equal? Well, the code would choose H first, as per the '>=', which is acceptable as the problem allows any of the possible solutions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code would:\n\n- Read n and A.\n\n- Preprocess digits.\n\n- Compute the dp function using memoization.\n\n- Backtrack to find the path.\n\nBut in Python, the lru_cache may not be able to handle the parameters if the digits are not fixed. Wait, no, the digits are fixed once the input is read, so the dp function is correct.\n\nWait, but the dp function is called with h and m, and the digits are global. So, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM\n\nLet's see:\n\nn = 2, A = 1234.\n\ndigits = [1,2,3,4]\n\nLet's compute the DP for (0, 0).\n\nAt each step, the code would choose the best option.\n\nLet's try to compute manually.\n\nFor (0, 0):\n\ncurrent_pos is 0, current_digit is 1.\n\nOptions:\n\nHomer takes it: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then, next state is (1, 0).\n\nMarge takes it: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = 10. Next state (0, 1).\n\nSo, the value for (0,0) is max( value of (1,0) + 10, value of (0,1) + 10 )\n\nBut need to compute recursively.\n\nThis seems tedious, but the code should handle it.\n\nIn the sample output, the maximum sum is achieved by HHMM.\n\nLet's compute the sum:\n\nHomer takes 1, then 2. His number is 12.\n\nMarge takes 3, then 4. Her number is 34.\n\nTotal sum is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\nAnother possible option is HMHM:\n\nH takes 1, then M takes 2, then H takes 3, then M takes 4.\n\nHomer's number is 13, Marge's is 24. Sum 37. Which is worse than 46.\n\nAnother option is HHHM? No, because n=2, each must take exactly 2 steps.\n\nSo the code should select the best path.\n\nNow, the code would generate the correct path.\n\nBut how about the code's DP function?\n\nNow, the problem is that for the code, the DP function is memoized, and the backtracking is done correctly.\n\nNow, the code for Python would be:\n\nBut in Python, the code would have to read the input, and then implement the DP with memoization. However, for the DP function, the digits are accessed as a global variable. But in practice, the code would have to pass them as parameters, but since the function is inside the same scope, perhaps it's okay.\n\nBut for the code, let's write it.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line is n, the second line is A. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nBut in the example given in the problem, the input is given as ['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911'], but that's probably a mistake. The actual input is two lines: first line is n, second line is A.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the above logic.\n\nBut in Python, for the DP function, using lru_cache with h and m as parameters.\n\nBut the digits are part of the global variables. So, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            exponent = n - (h + 1)\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n            next_val = dp(h + 1, m)\n            options.append(contribution + next_val)\n        if m < n:\n            exponent = n - (m + 1)\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n            next_val = dp(h, m + 1)\n            options.append(contribution + next_val)\n        return max(options)\n    \n    # Now backtrack to find the path\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    path = []\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            # compute both options\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if val_h >= val_m:\n                path.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                path.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            path.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(path))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, when h < n and m < n, the code checks both options. But in the DP function, the code returns the maximum of the options. So, the val_h and val_m here are the same as the ones used in the DP function. So, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nLet's see what the code does.\n\nBut let's think about the backtracking step.\n\nAt (0, 0), current digit is 1.\n\nval_h = 1 * 10^(2-0-1) + dp(1, 0) = 1*10^1 + dp(1,0) = 10 + ?\n\nWhat is dp(1,0)?\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 0):\n\nh=1, m=0. current_pos is 1+0=1. current_digit is 2.\n\nh < n (1 < 2) and m < n (0 < 2).\n\nSo options:\n\nHomer takes it: exponent is 2 - (1+1) = 0. contribution is 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then dp(2, 0).\n\ndp(2, 0): h=2, m=0. current_pos = 2 + 0 = 2. current_digit is 3.\n\nh is 2 == n (2), so can't take. m is 0 < 2.\n\nso, m takes. exponent is 2 - (0 + 1) = 1. contribution is 3 * 10^1 = 30. next is dp(2, 1).\n\ndp(2, 1): h=2, m=1. current_pos = 3. current_digit 4.\n\nh is 2, m is 1. m can take. exponent is 2 - (1 + 1) = 0. contribution 4 * 1 = 4. next is dp(2,2) which is 0. So total is 4. So dp(2,1) is 4.\n\nSo dp(2, 0) is 30 + 4 = 34. So dp(1, 0) is 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nval_h for (0,0) is 10 + 36 = 46.\n\nval_m is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 - 1) + dp(0, 1) = 10 + ... ?\n\nLet's compute dp(0, 1):\n\nh=0, m=1. current_pos = 0+1=1. current_digit is 2.\n\nh < 2, m < 2.\n\nHomer takes: exponent is 2 - 0 - 1 = 1. contribution 2 * 10^1 = 20. next is dp(1, 1).\n\ndp(1, 1): current_pos = 2. current_digit 3.\n\nh and m are 1 each. So can take either.\n\nHomer takes: exponent 2 - 1 -1 = 0. contribution 3 * 1 = 3. next is dp(2, 1) which is 4. total 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nMarge takes: exponent 2 - 1 -1 = 0. contribution 3 * 1 = 3. next is dp(1, 2). dp(1, 2) is current_pos 3 (h + m = 3). h=1 < 2, m=2 == n. So only Homer can take. current_digit is 4. contribution 4 * 10^(2 - 1 - 1) = 4 * 10^0 = 4. next is dp(2, 2) which is 0. So total 4. So dp(1,2) is 4. So val_m for dp(1,1) is 3 + 4 = 7. So dp(1,1) returns 7.\n\nSo, for dp(1,1) is 7.\n\nSo, back to dp(0,1) when Homer takes: 20 + 7 = 27.\n\nIf Marge takes: contribution is 2 * 10^(2 - 1 -1) = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then dp(0, 2). dp(0,2) has h=0, m=2. current_pos is 2. current_digit 3. Only Homer can take. So contribution is 3 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp(1, 2). Which is 4. So total 30 + 4 = 34. So val_m is 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nSo dp(0,1) is max(27, 36) = 36.\n\nSo val_m for (0,0) is 10 + 36 = 46. So val_h and val_m are both 46. So the code will choose H, leading to path 'H'.\n\nSo the first choice is H, then h becomes 1, m 0.\n\nNow, the next step is (1, 0). Let's see what happens.\n\ncurrent_pos = 1, current_digit is 2.\n\nh=1, m=0. Both can take.\n\nval_h: 2 * 10^(2-1-1) = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then dp(2, 0) which we earlier calculated as 34. So total 2+34=36.\n\nval_m: 2 * 10^(2-0-1) = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then dp(1, 1) which is 7. Total 20+7=27. So val_h is larger. So choose H again. Path is 'HH'.\n\nNow, h=2, m=0. current_pos is 2+0=2. current_digit 3. Now, h is 2 (equal to n), so only M can take.\n\nSo append 'M', m becomes 1. Now, h=2, m=1. current_pos is 3. current_digit is 4. Again, only M can take. Append 'M', m becomes 2. Now, done. Path is 'HHMM' as expected.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to work for this case.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n2\n\n9911\n\nSample output is HMHM.\n\nLet's think. The digits are [9,9,1,1]. Let's see.\n\nThe optimal path is HMHM. Let's see the sum:\n\nH takes 9, M takes 9, H takes 1, M takes 1. S1 is 91, S2 is 91. Sum is 182.\n\nAlternative paths:\n\nIf HHMM: H takes 9, H takes 9, M takes 1, M takes 1. S1 is 99, S2 is 11. Sum 110. Worse.\n\nAnother option is HMHM: sum is 91 + 91 = 182.\n\nSo the code should generate that.\n\nBut how does the code choose between options?\n\nAt (0,0):\n\ncurrent digit is 9. val_h is 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 9*10^1 = 90 + dp(1,0). val_m is 9*10^1 + dp(0,1).\n\nSo which is better?\n\nWe need to compute dp(1,0) and dp(0,1).\n\nBut perhaps in this case, choosing M first gives a better overall sum.\n\nBut the code would choose the best option.\n\nBut regardless, the code should find the correct path.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that for n=18, the exponents can be up to 10^17, but in Python, that's manageable.\n\nBut what about the time complexity?\n\nThe DP has O(n^2) states, each with O(1) computation. Then, the backtracking is O(n) steps. So overall, the code is efficient enough.\n\nBut in the DP function, for each state, the code computes 10^exponent. For exponents up to 18, this is manageable, but for each state, it's recomputed. However, since the exponents are fixed, perhaps precomputing a power of 10 array would be better.\n\nBut in Python, exponentiation is fast, and for n up to 18, it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps precomputing a power of 10 array would be better. For example, precompute pow10[i] = 10^i for i from 0 to n.\n\nBut in the code, the exponents are n - h -1 and n - m -1. For example, when h is 0, the exponent is n-1. So for h ranging from 0 to n-1, exponents range from n-1 down to 0.\n\nSo, for each possible exponent, we can precompute 10^exponent once.\n\nSo, in the code, we can precompute a list pow10 where pow10[k] = 10^k. For k from 0 to n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, this is trivial.\n\nSo modifying the code to precompute pow10:\n\npow10 = [1] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in 1 to n:\n\npow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nBut in Python, perhaps:\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n+1)]\n\nBut in the code, during the DP function, when we need to compute 10^exponent, we can use pow10[exponent].\n\nBut for the code, perhaps this would speed up the calculation.\n\nBut for now, the code works as written. However, for exponents up to 18, 10^18 is manageable.\n\nBut in the code, the line 10 ** exponent is called multiple times, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to note is that when h + m reaches 2n, the loop stops.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, A=00. Output is HM or MH. Both sum to 0+0 = 0. The code can output either.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, A=10. Which is better: H takes 1, M takes 0. Sum is 10 + 0 = 10. Or M takes 1, H takes 0. Sum is 0 + 10 = 10. Either way, same sum. So the code can output either HM or MH.\n\nThe code would choose based on which option is first in the comparison. For example, in the first step, val_h and val_m are equal, so the code chooses H.\n\nSo, for input 1 and 10, the output would be HM.\n\nAnother edge case: when the digits are all 9. The code will choose whichever path gives the maximum sum, but since all digits are 9, the sum is fixed, and the code can return any sequence.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the digits are taken in a way that the exponents are calculated correctly. For example, for Homer's first move, the exponent is n - 1, then for the second move, it's n - 2, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total prize money they receive is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a given number alternately, with each player making exactly n moves. The challenge is to find the sequence of moves that results in the highest possible sum of their respective numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to explore all possible sequences of moves and determine the maximum total prize. The state of our DP function is defined by the number of moves each player has made so far.\n2. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of subproblems using Python's `lru_cache`.\n3. **Backtracking**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state to reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves based on the maximum values computed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            exponent = n - (h + 1)\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n            next_val = dp(h + 1, m)\n            options.append(contribution + next_val)\n        if m < n:\n            exponent = n - (m + 1)\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n            next_val = dp(h, m + 1)\n            options.append(contribution + next_val)\n        return max(options)\n    \n    # Now backtrack to find the path\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    path = []\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            # compute both options\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if val_h >= val_m:\n                path.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                path.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            path.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(path))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` and a string `A` which is converted into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined recursively with memoization. It calculates the maximum total prize starting from the state where Homer has made `h` moves and Marge has made `m` moves.\n3. **Recursive Calculation**: For each state `(h, m)`, the function evaluates the contribution of taking the current digit by either Homer or Marge, recursively calculating the optimal result for subsequent states.\n4. **Backtracking**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state `(0, 0)` to determine the sequence of moves that leads to the maximum total prize. This is done by comparing the potential contributions of each move at each step and choosing the optimal one.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible move sequences while leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations, resulting in an optimal solution.",
