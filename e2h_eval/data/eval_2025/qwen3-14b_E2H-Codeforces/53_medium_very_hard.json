    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm, how do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once?\n\nThe brute force way would be to check every possible substring of the string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where there are at least two occurrences. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10^4. For each substring, checking if it appears again could take O(n) time. So overall, it's O(n^3), which for n=100 would be 1e6 operations. That's manageable, right? Because 1 million operations are acceptable for Python in programming contests.\n\nSo maybe the brute force approach is feasible here. Let's think about how to implement it.\n\nThe plan:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string, for all possible lengths from 1 to len(s).\n2. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times in the string.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length where this condition is true.\n\nBut generating all substrings and checking their occurrences might be computationally feasible for n=100.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s)-1), and for each possible length l (from 1 to len(s)-i), we can generate the substring s[i:i+l]. Then, for each such substring, check if there's another occurrence in the string.\n\nBut even better: for each possible length l (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there exists a substring of length l that occurs at least twice. Once we find the maximum such l, we can return it.\n\nThis way, we can optimize by checking from largest possible l downwards, and return as soon as we find a valid l.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   Check all possible substrings of length l. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times in the string.\n\n   If any such substring exists, return l as the answer.\n\nIf no such substring exists for any l, return 0.\n\nThis approach would be efficient because once we find the maximum l, we can stop.\n\nNow, how to check for each l?\n\nFor each l, iterate through all possible starting indices i, such that i + l <= len(s). For each i, take the substring s[i:i+l], and check if there's another occurrence of this substring in the string. But how to check that efficiently?\n\nWell, for each substring of length l, we can collect all the starting indices where it occurs. Then, if the count is >=2, we can note that l is a candidate.\n\nBut for each l, we can generate all substrings of length l, and track their occurrences. For example, using a dictionary where the key is the substring, and the value is the list of starting indices. Then, for any substring with at least two entries in the list, we can return l as the maximum.\n\nBut for the problem, we don't need the exact count, just whether there's at least two occurrences.\n\nSo for each l, starting from the largest possible:\n\n   Create a dictionary to store substrings of length l and their counts.\n\n   Iterate through all possible starting indices i (from 0 to len(s)-l).\n\n      Take the substring s[i:i+l].\n\n      If this substring has been seen before (i.e., in the dictionary), then we can note that there's at least two occurrences. So return l as the answer.\n\n      Else, add it to the dictionary with count 1.\n\nWait, but this approach would miss cases where the same substring occurs more than once but not in the same iteration. For example, if the first occurrence is added to the dictionary, and then later another occurrence is found. So, for each substring of length l, we need to check if it's already present in the dictionary. If yes, then return l as the answer.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, when processing a substring, if we have already seen it before, then we can immediately return l as the maximum length.\n\nSo for each l, we can process all substrings of that length, and for each, check if it's already in a set. If yes, then return l. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nWait, but for the same substring appearing multiple times, even if the first occurrence is added to the set, the second occurrence would trigger the check. So for example, for a substring that appears three times, the first time it's added to the set, and the second time, when we check, we find it's already in the set, so we return l.\n\nYes, this would work. So for each l, we can create a set, and for each substring of length l, check if it's already in the set. If yes, then return l. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nThis approach would work for overlapping occurrences. For example, in 'ababa', for l=3, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bab'\n\ni=2: 'aba'\n\nWhen processing i=0, the substring is added to the set. Then, when processing i=2, the substring 'aba' is already in the set, so return l=3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return l\n\n        else:\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would only check for two occurrences. Because, for example, if a substring occurs three times, the first time it's added to the set, then the second time, it's found in the set and returns. So the code would return l as the answer. Which is correct, since the problem requires at least two occurrences.\n\nSo this approach works. But how about when the same substring occurs more than once, but not overlapping? Like 'aaaaa' for l=2. The substrings are 'aa' (positions 0,1,2,3). So when processing i=0, substr is 'aa' added. Then i=1, substr is 'aa' again, which is in the set, so returns l=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the same substring occurs exactly once? Then, the code would not trigger, and proceed to check lower l's.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nThen, for l from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr in the set: return l\n\n      else add to set.\n\nIf after checking all l's, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, the code for the sample input:\n\nSample 1: input is 'abcd'. len is 4.\n\nCheck l=4: substr is 'abcd' once. No duplicates. So proceed.\n\nl=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. Both unique. No.\n\nl=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. No.\n\nl=1: substrings 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique. So return 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' len is 5.\n\nCheck l=5: substr is 'ababa' once. No.\n\nl=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. Both unique.\n\nl=3: substrings:\n\ni=0: aba\n\ni=1: bab\n\ni=2: aba\n\nAt i=2, substr is 'aba' which was added at i=0. So returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nThird sample: 'zzz' len 3.\n\nCheck l=3: substr 'zzz' once. No.\n\nl=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). When i=1, substr is 'zz' which is in the set (added at i=0). So returns 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where the entire string is same letters, like 'aaaaa' (length 5). The maximum l is 4, since substrings of length 4 occur twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So for l=4, the code would return 4.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' (length 2). l=2: substr is 'aa' once. Then check l=1. For l=1, substrings 'a' and 'a'. At i=1, substr is 'a' which is in the set (added at i=0). So returns 1. But the maximum possible is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). Let's see. The maximum substring that occurs twice is 'aa' (length 2) or 'aabbaa' (but that's only once). Wait, but let's see:\n\nFor l=3:\n\nsubstrings:\n\ni=0: 'aab'\n\ni=1: 'abb'\n\ni=2: 'bba'\n\ni=3: 'baa'\n\nNo duplicates.\n\nFor l=2:\n\nsubstrings:\n\ni=0: 'aa' (occurs again at i=4)\n\nso during l=2, when i=0, add 'aa' to set. Then i=4, substr is 'aa' again. So returns 2. But there's also 'bb' which occurs once. But the code returns 2.\n\nBut in the string 'aabbaa', the maximum is 2. However, there's also the substring 'a' which occurs 4 times. But the code returns 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab' (length 6). The maximum is 4? Let's see.\n\nFor l=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba', 'abab'. So when i=0, substr is 'abab' added. Then i=2, substr is 'abab' again. So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe input is a string. The code needs to read the input, process it, and output the maximum length.\n\nBut the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a list? Wait, the example input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the problem says that the input is a string. Wait, no, the problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. But the sample input shows a list. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustrative purposes. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as a string. The sample input shows:\n\nInput: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut that's probably an example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a string. So perhaps the sample input is actually multiple test cases, but the actual code needs to process one string per input.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\nSo the code should read one string from stdin. However, the sample input shows that perhaps the input is a list of strings, but that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Or perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one string.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nSo perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a string. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty...\n\nSo the input is one string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. That must be a mistake in the problem description. Perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the purpose of showing multiple test cases, but in reality, the code should read a single string.\n\nBut the user's note says that the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a string. So perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nBut this is confusing. However, looking at the problem's note that says \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, and output the answer for the given input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list. But that's probably a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read one string per test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the purpose of the example, but the actual code is supposed to read a single string. For example, in the sample input, the input is a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three numbers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut this contradicts the problem statement. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read a list of strings, process each one, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to read the input? Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty...\n\nSo the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. That's conflicting. But perhaps the sample input is written as a list to represent multiple test cases. For example, the problem may be expecting that the code processes multiple test cases, but the original problem statement says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem is written with some errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code is supposed to read a list of strings. However, the original problem's input is a single string.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me look again at the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the input is a single string. So the sample input must be a mistake. But the sample input shows a list of three strings. But the sample output is a list of three numbers. Therefore, the problem is likely expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each given as a string in a list. However, the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the purpose of the example, but in reality, the code should read a single string. For example, the sample input may be:\n\nFor example, if the input is 'abcd', the output is 0. If the input is 'ababa', output is 3, etc.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the sample input given?\n\nPerhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, and the code is supposed to process them. So the code should read a list of strings from input, process each, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given as a list, perhaps the code should read a line from stdin, parse it as a list of strings, and process each.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, it's more common that each test case is on a separate line. However, the problem's sample input shows that the input is a list of strings, perhaps in the form of a Python list.\n\nBut in practice, the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as a single line, which is a Python list of strings. For example, the first line is something like [\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"], and the code should process each string in that list and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut that's a bit unusual. However, given the sample input and output, that's the only way to make sense of it. So perhaps the code should read the input as a list of strings, and output the list of answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So this is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual code is supposed to process a single string. For example, the sample input is 'ababa', and the output is 3. But then the sample input and output are given as lists, which is confusing.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, the original problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, and write to stdout. The sample input shows that for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is presented as a multi-test case problem. Let me think again.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as a string. So the code should read a list of strings from input, process each, and output their answers, each on a separate line.\n\nBut how to read that? For example, if the input is given as a single line containing a Python list, like [\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"], then the code can parse that as a list of strings.\n\nBut in programming competitions, the input is usually given as lines. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, then each line is a test case.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the answers for each in order.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is confusing. However, given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, perhaps the actual problem is that the code should read multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the answers for each.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the code may read the input as a list of strings, perhaps via input().split() or similar.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. However, the sample input shows a list. This is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the code should read multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nIn that case, the code can read the input as a list of strings, for example, by reading the input line as a Python list.\n\nBut in practice, the input will be given as a single line, which is a list of strings. For example, the user may enter something like:\n\n[\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"]\n\nThen the code can parse this as a list of strings.\n\nBut in Python, to read that, we can use input().strip() and then evaluate it as a list. However, this is dangerous, but for the purpose of the problem, perhaps acceptable.\n\nBut in a programming contest, this is unlikely. More likely, the input is given as multiple lines, with each line being a test case.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo this implies that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a contradiction. However, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, and the problem statement is incorrect.\n\nAssuming that the code must process multiple test cases, each being a string, and output their answers, let's proceed.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. So perhaps the code should read a single line, which is a list of strings, and process them.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Python, the code would read the input line as a list, like:\n\nimport sys\n\ns_list = eval(sys.stdin.read())\n\nThen, for each string in s_list, compute the answer and print.\n\nBut this is risky, but for the purpose of the problem, perhaps acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the code should process one string, and the sample input is for multiple test cases.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, for example, the input is a list of strings, and the output is a list of numbers.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is said to be a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as lists, I think the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read a list of strings from the input, and output the corresponding answers for each.\n\nSo, for example, for the input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the code would output 0, 3, 2, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem's output says ['0', '3', '2'], which suggests that the output is a list of strings. However, in programming contests, the output is usually printed as individual lines.\n\nBut perhaps the code should output the numbers separated by spaces, or each on its own line.\n\nBut the sample output shows the answers as a list, but in practice, the code must output each answer on a separate line.\n\nBut given that the problem statement says \"output one number — length...\", it implies that for each test case, the code outputs one number. So if there are multiple test cases, each is processed separately.\n\nBut the problem statement's sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases.\n\nBut since the problem says that the input is a single string, I'm confused. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code needs to process multiple test cases, each given as a string in a list.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as a list, but in practice, the code may read from stdin a line that is a Python list. So the code can do something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ninput_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\ntest_cases = eval(input_str)\n\nfor s in test_cases:\n\n    # process s and compute answer\n\n    print(answer)\n\nBut this is unsafe, but for the purpose of passing the sample input, it's acceptable.\n\nHowever, in practice, the input may be given as multiple lines. For example, each test case is on a separate line.\n\nBut given the sample input, it's hard to say. However, the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustration, and the code should read a single string.\n\nBut then the sample input would be 'abcd', and the output is '0'.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list. This is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, and the code should process each one. For example, the code reads a list of strings, and for each, computes the answer.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that reads a single string, and returns the answer for it. Because the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nBut then, the sample input shows a list of strings, which is conflicting. However, the sample output shows a list of numbers, which would correspond to multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is a list of strings, and the code should process each string in the list and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut how to read that? Well, assuming that the input is given as a single line, which is a list of strings, like [\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"], then the code can read that line, parse it as a list, and process each element.\n\nBut in practice, for programming contests, this is not a standard input format. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, parse it as a list of strings.\n\nFor each string in the list:\n\n   compute the maximum length of substring that occurs at least twice.\n\nPrint the results, each on a new line.\n\nBut the problem says that the output is one number. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, and the code should process them all.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So this is very conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustration, but the actual code should read a single string, and the sample input is for three separate test cases. For example, the first test case is 'abcd', output is 0; second is 'ababa', output is 3; third is 'zzz', output is 2.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps it's a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given this confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the code that reads a single string, and returns the answer for it, and see if that passes the sample input.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for the input 'ababa', the output is 3. Which the code would handle.\n\nSo, assuming that the code should read a single string, and output the answer for it.\n\nThen, for the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to read each string in the sample input list as a separate test case. But how?\n\nWell, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for clarity, but in reality, the code should read one string per line.\n\nBut without further information, it's hard to tell. However, given that the problem says that the input is a string, I'll proceed with the code that reads a single string, and returns the answer for it.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nProcess it as described earlier.\n\nNow, coding that.\n\nThe code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 'ababa':\n\nn=5.\n\nl starts from 5 down to 1.\n\nFor l=5: substr is 'ababa' once. No.\n\nl=4: substrings 'abab', 'baba' → no.\n\nl=3: substrings:\n\ni=0: 'aba' added.\n\ni=1: 'bab' added.\n\ni=2: 'aba' is in seen → return 3. Correct.\n\nSample input 'zzz':\n\nn=3.\n\nl=3: substr 'zzz' once.\n\nl=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), then i=1: 'zz' → found in seen → return 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 'abcd' → returns 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple substrings of the same length?\n\nFor example, 'aaaaa' (length 5). For l=4, substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So when i=1, substr is already in seen → returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). The maximum is 2 (for 'aa').\n\nBut for l=3, the substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa' → no duplicates. So code proceeds to l=2. For l=2:\n\ni=0: 'aa' added.\n\ni=1: 'ab' added.\n\ni=2: 'bb' added.\n\ni=3: 'ba' added.\n\ni=4: 'aa' → found in seen → returns 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears more than twice? Like 'aaaaa' → l=4 is returned.\n\nBut the code returns the maximum possible l.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears in non-overlapping positions?\n\nLike 'ababab' → for l=4, substrings are 'abab', 'baba', 'abab'. So when i=0, 'abab' is added. Then i=2, 'abab' is found again. So returns 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code is written for a single string input. But according to the problem statement's sample input, perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the code should handle a single string.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut the original sample input shows that the code should output a list of answers. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut given the problem statement, I think the correct approach is to assume that the input is a single string, and the sample input is written as a list for illustration.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for the input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo if the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, then the code should read all test cases from input, process them, and output their answers.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, if the input is given as a list of strings on a single line, then the code can read it as a list.\n\nBut in practice, in programming contests, inputs are given as multiple lines. So perhaps the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's sample input is given as a list of strings. So perhaps the code should read a list of strings from input, process each, and output the answers.\n\nBut how to read that? For example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\n    test_cases = input_str.split('[')[1].split(']')[0].split(',') if '[' in input_str else []\n\n    test_cases = [s.strip().strip(\"'\") for s in test_cases]\n\n    for s in test_cases:\n\n        # process and print\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, if the input is given as a single line with the strings separated by spaces, but the sample input shows a list, it's unclear.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects that the code reads a single string and outputs the answer for it. Thus, the code is as follows.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the user may have made a mistake in the problem description.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll proceed with the code that reads a single string and outputs the answer for it. The code is as written before.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input.\n\nBut the sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which is a list. However, if the code reads a single string, then it would fail. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, if the input is given as a list of strings, like:\n\n[\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"]\n\nThen, the code can read this as a list and process each string.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\n    # parse the input as a list of strings\n\n    test_cases = eval(input_str)\n\n    for s in test_cases:\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(l)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut this code uses eval, which is unsafe. However, for the purpose of passing the sample input, it's acceptable.\n\nBut in programming contests, this is not a safe approach. However, given the problem's sample input, this is the way to go.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect, and the code should read a single string.\n\nBut the sample input and output suggest that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut since the user provided the sample input as a list of strings and the output as a list of numbers, I think the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nSo the code would read the input as a list of strings, process each, and print the answers, each on a new line.\n\nBut the problem says that the output is one number. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, and the problem statement has an error.\n\nThus, the code would be as follows.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nSo, assuming that the input is a list of strings, like [\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"], then the code would read it, process each string, and output the answers.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\n    # parse the input as a list of strings\n\n    test_cases = eval(input_str)\n\n    for s in test_cases:\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    max_len = l\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if max_len > 0:\n\n                break\n\n        print(max_len)\n\nBut this code would output for each test case the max_len.\n\nFor the sample input, this code would output 0, 3, 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nBut this code uses eval, which is unsafe. However, for the purpose of passing the sample input, it's acceptable.\n\nBut in a real programming contest, the input would be given differently. For example, each test case is on a separate line. In that case, the code would read each line as a string.\n\nBut since the problem's sample input shows a list of strings, I'll proceed with this code.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nThus, the final code is as above.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should be ready to run and not include any additional explanations or comments. So the code should be written accordingly.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So perhaps the code should read a single string, and output the answer for it. Hence, the code is:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut this would handle a single test case. For the sample input, if the input is 'ababa', it would output 3.\n\nBut the sample input is a list, which is not compatible with this code.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a string. So I think this is the correct code.\n\nBut why does the sample input show a list? Perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct code for the problem as described in the problem statement (single string input) is the code that reads a single string and processes it.\n\nHence, the code is as follows.\n",
