The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched, which is the number of times they lose a round.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The sequences A and B are cyclic. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k], where m and k are the lengths of their sequences. Then, for each round, determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible because it would take O(n) time, which is not feasible for n=2e9. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: The sequences A and B repeat every m and k rounds respectively. So the combination of their moves would repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same pair of moves will be used again.\n\nSo the idea is to find the LCM of m and k, let's call it T. Then, the total number of rounds n can be divided into two parts: full cycles of T rounds, and a remainder of R rounds (R < T).\n\nFor each full cycle, we can compute how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then process the remaining R rounds.\n\nSo first, compute T = LCM(m, k). Let's find how many full cycles there are: total_cycles = n // T. And the remainder is rem = n % T.\n\nSo for each full cycle, we can compute the number of losses for each player, say, lossA_per_cycle and lossB_per_cycle. Then total for full cycles is total_cycles * lossA_per_cycle and similarly for B.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, we simulate them normally.\n\nBut how do we compute lossA_per_cycle and lossB_per_cycle?\n\nWell, for each of the T rounds in the cycle, we can compute the moves for A and B, check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut T can be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. Since m and k are up to 1000 each, their LCM can be up to 1e6. So for each T, we can simulate all T rounds once, and calculate the number of losses per cycle. Then multiply by total_cycles.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n2. For each of the T rounds, compute the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count the number of losses for each player in this T-length cycle.\n3. Multiply those counts by the number of full cycles (total_cycles = n // T)\n4. Then, simulate the remaining rem = n % T rounds, adding to the counts.\n\nThis approach would be O(T) time, which is acceptable since T is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first compute GCD.\n\nNow, how to compute GCD? Well, Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay. Also, need to handle zero? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nOnce I have T, then proceed.\n\nNow, for each round in the T rounds, compute the move of A and B. How?\n\nFor the i-th round in the cycle (i from 0 to T-1):\n\nA's move is A[i % m], and B's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each i in 0..T-1, compute the moves, compare them, and determine who wins.\n\nSo for each such pair, we can check:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a pinch (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 0, and Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots count (the first output) is incremented by 0, and Polycarpus's count (second output) is incremented by 1. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nthe loser gets pinched. So for each round, if there's a winner, the loser is the one who gets a red spot. So for example, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a red spot. So Nikephoros's count (number of red spots) is the number of times he lost. So, for each round, if Nikephoros loses, then his count increases by 1. If Polycarpus loses, then his count increases by 1.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to check whether Nikephoros loses, and add to his count, and whether Polycarpus loses, add to his count.\n\nSo, for a given a and b:\n\nif a and b are same: no change.\n\nelse:\n\ndetermine who wins. If Nikephoros's move beats B's move, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's count (the first number) remains same, and Polycarpus's count increases by 1. Else, if B's move beats A's move, then Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nSo, how to determine who wins? Let's think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo, for a and b:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b is P) or (a is P and b is R): then a wins (Nikephoros wins), so B loses.\n\nElse, B wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), we can check these conditions.\n\nSo, for each of the T rounds, we can compute the moves and check for the outcome.\n\nOnce we have the counts for the full cycles, and then for the remaining rounds, we can sum them all.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B as a string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute the number of full cycles: total_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nCompute per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss.\n\nThen, for the full_cycles, multiply by per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss.\n\nThen, compute for the rem rounds, the number of a_loss and b_loss in the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nAdd those to the totals.\n\nNow, how to compute per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss?\n\nWe can loop for i in 0 to T-1:\n\nfor each i, get a_move = A[i % m], b_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen check if a_move beats b_move, etc.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\ncompute the outcome.\n\nNow, for T up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute LCM.\n\nBut in Python, we can compute GCD with math.gcd, and then LCM is (m * k) // gcd(m, k). But need to make sure that m and k are not zero, but the problem says m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nOnce that's done, proceed.\n\nNow, for the simulation of the T rounds, let's precompute for each i in 0..T-1, the a and b moves.\n\nBut for each i, the a move is A[i % m], and the b move is B[i % k].\n\nOnce that's done, for each pair, compute whether a wins, b wins, or draw.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThen, for the per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss:\n\nper_cycle_a = 0\n\nper_cycle_b = 0\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    # determine who wins\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So add 1 to Polycarpus's count (b_loss)\n\n        per_cycle_b += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses. So add 1 to a_loss.\n\n        per_cycle_a += 1\n\nOnce that's done, then total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a + ... the remaining part.\n\nNow, for the remaining rem rounds, we need to simulate the first rem rounds of the cycle (i from 0 to rem-1), and compute how many a and b losses.\n\nSo, for the rem rounds:\n\nrem_a = 0\n\nrem_b = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        rem_b += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        rem_a += 1\n\nThen, total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a + rem_a\n\ntotal_b = total_cycles * per_cycle_b + rem_b\n\nThen, print total_a and total_b.\n\nWait, but what if n is less than T? Like, when n is small. For example, if n is 5 and T is 10. Then total_cycles is 0, rem is 5. So the code would simulate the first 5 rounds. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\", m = 3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k =4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo T = 12.\n\nn=7, total_cycles = 7//12 = 0, rem =7.\n\nSo simulate 7 rounds.\n\nLet me check the sample explanation.\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros's move is P, B's is S. S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo, in round 2, A's move is P (paper), B's is S (scissors). Scissors beat paper. So B wins. So Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, the first round is R vs R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses?), but the sample says that in the second round, Nikephoros loses. Wait in the sample explanation, the first sample's rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros's move is P, B's is S. S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros loses. So his count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first sample's output is 3 and 2. Let me check the example.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P). So Nikephoros's count is 1.\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Nikephoros's move is S, B's is P. S beats P. So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's count remains 1, Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros's move is R, B's is P. P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. His count becomes 2.\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Nikephoros's move is P, B's is R. P beats R. So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1 (now 2).\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros's move is R, B's is P. P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. His count becomes 3.\n\nSo total for Nikephoros is 3, Polycarpus is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo in the code, for the first 7 rounds, the code would compute:\n\nper_cycle_a and per_cycle_b for T=12 rounds. But since total_cycles is 0, the code would compute the rem=7 rounds.\n\nSo the code for rem=7 would process i from 0 to 6 (since rem is 7).\n\nLet me check for each i in 0..6:\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R → same, no loss.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P → Nikephoros loses. So rem_a +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\nA[2%3] = A[2] = S\n\nB[2%4] = B[2] = P → S vs P. S beats P → Nikephoros wins. So rem_b +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\nA[3%3=0] → R\n\nB[3%4=3 → B[3] = P. R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses → rem_a +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\nA[4%3=1 → P\n\nB[4%4=0 → B[0] = R. P vs R → P beats R. Nikephoros wins → rem_b +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\nA[5%3=2 → S\n\nB[5%4=1 → B[1] = S. S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6:\n\nA[6%3=0 → R\n\nB[6%4=2 → B[2] = P. R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → rem_a +=1.\n\nSo rem_a is 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → total 3. rem_b is 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → total 2. Which matches the sample. So the code would output 3 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1) = 8. n=5.\n\ntotal_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, rem=5.\n\nFor each of the 5 rounds:\n\neach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. So all draws. So rem_a and rem_b are 0. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if n is exactly T?\n\nThen total_cycles = 1, rem=0. So the code would compute per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b, and multiply by 1, and add 0.\n\nAnother case: when m=1, k=1. Then T=1. For each round, the same moves. So for n rounds, if a and b are same, no loss. Else, for each round, decide.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nNow, in code, the problem is that for n up to 2e9, but T is up to 1e6, so the code is acceptable.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input. But the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string.\n\nThird line contains sequence B as a string.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, the user provided the example input as a list with two elements? Probably that's a formatting error. But in reality, the input is:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nSo in the sample input, the first input is 7, then RPS, then RSPP.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the input is given as a list of two elements. That's probably a mistake. But for the code, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code would read n as input(). Then read A as input().strip(), then read B as input().strip().\n\nBut the code needs to read from standard input, so the code will be:\n\nimport sys, math\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the input may have leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is given correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b\n\n    per_cycle_a = 0\n\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine winner\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses. So per_cycle_b +=1\n\n            per_cycle_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses. per_cycle_a +=1\n\n            per_cycle_a +=1\n\n    total_cycles = n // T\n\n    rem = n % T\n\n    # compute the total_a and total_b\n\n    total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a\n\n    total_b = total_cycles * per_cycle_b\n\n    # process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            total_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a +=1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, the code for the rem rounds is similar to the code for the per_cycle. Maybe we can extract that into a helper function, but for code brevity, perhaps not necessary.\n\nBut for code correctness, this is okay.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (len 3), B=RSPP (len 4). T=12. So per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b is computed for 12 rounds. Then total_cycles is 0, rem=7. So the code processes the rem rounds.\n\nWhich works as before.\n\nAnother test case: when n is T. For example, n=12. Then total_cycles is 1, rem=0. So the code adds per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b.\n\nNow, what about when T is 0? No, since m and k are >=1, so T is at least 1.\n\nNow, what about when m=1, k=1. For example, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then T=1. For each round, the code checks that R vs S. So Nikephoros wins. So per_cycle_b is 1. For n=2e9, total_cycles = 2e9, total_a is 0, total_b is 2e9.\n\nBut the code would compute that correctly.\n\nNow, code is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where T is larger than n? For example, n=5, T=10. Then total_cycles is 0, rem=5. So code processes rem rounds.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, in Python, for very large T (up to 1e6), the for loops for T and rem are acceptable.\n\nBut for T=1e6, the code would loop 1e6 times. Which is acceptable for Python, as 1e6 operations are manageable in a second.\n\nSo the code is efficient.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player (Nikephoros and Polycarpus) loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds, n, is very large (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. This means their move sequences repeat after certain intervals. The combined cycle length for both sequences is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives the length of the combined cycle after which both sequences realign to their starting positions.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For one full cycle of the combined length, determine how many times each player loses. This avoids redundant calculations for repeated cycles.\n4. **Handle Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full cycles within the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_a = 0\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n        else:\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a\n    total_b = total_cycles * per_cycle_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the cycle length after which both sequences repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: By simulating one full cycle of the combined length, we determine the number of losses for each player within one cycle.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The number of full cycles is calculated, and the results from these cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed separately to get the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to 2·10^9 rounds by leveraging cycle detection and mathematical properties, making the solution both optimal and scalable.",
