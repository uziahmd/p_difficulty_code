The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then there's the sequence A for Nikephoros and B for Polycarpus. Each of these sequences is a string of characters R, P, S. For each round, they pick the next element in their sequence cyclically. So for round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus with B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe problem is to compute, after n rounds, how many times each lost. Because each round, if there's a winner, the loser gets a spot. If it's a draw, nothing happens.\n\nSo for each round, we need to compare the two moves and determine who wins. Then increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is a huge number. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but m and k are up to 1000. So maybe there's a way to find the pattern over the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, the sequences of both players will repeat. So the pattern of wins and losses would repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L. Let's say that L is the number of rounds after which the entire pattern repeats.\n\n2. For each of the L rounds, compute the number of times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose. Let's call these per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L. The remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\n4. The total losses would be total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + losses_in_rem_rounds (similar for Polycarpus).\n\nBut how to compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly?\n\nWe can simulate for L rounds, which is up to 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is manageable. Because even if m and k are 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6. So for each of the L rounds, we can compute the moves of each player, compare them, and count the losses.\n\nBut wait, what if m and k are not coprime? For example, m=2, k=2. Then LCM is 2. So the pattern repeats every 2 rounds. So for each of the first L rounds, we can compute the outcome once, then multiply by the number of cycles.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute L = LCM(m, k). Let me think about how to compute LCM. Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD first.\n\n- For each of the L rounds, compute the moves of A and B. Then determine who wins, and count the number of losses for each.\n\nOnce I have that, the total is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\n\nremaining_rounds = n % L\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik + count_losses_in_remaining_rounds\n\nSame for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the per_cycle counts?\n\nSo, for each round in 0 to L-1:\n\na_move = A[round % m]\n\nb_move = B[round % k]\n\nThen determine who wins.\n\nSo for each of the L rounds, we can compute the outcome once, and sum up the counts.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each of the L rounds, the outcome, and then sum for the full cycles and the remainder.\n\nBut what if n is smaller than L? Then, we just need to compute the first n rounds.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly by simulating L rounds.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + count_rem_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly + count_rem_poly\n\nSo the question is, how to compute count_rem_nik and count_rem_poly. Which is the same as simulating the first rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the per_cycle counts and the rem counts?\n\nSo, for the simulation part, perhaps we can precompute for each possible round in 0 to L-1, the outcome, and store the counts for the entire cycle. Then, for the rem rounds, we can take the first rem rounds and sum their counts.\n\nSo, for example, during the simulation of the L rounds, we can accumulate the counts for each round. Then, for the full cycles, multiply by the total per cycle. For the remainder, take the first 'rem' rounds and add their counts.\n\nBut how to compute the per_cycle counts?\n\nLet me think. Let's create a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the outcome of a round (nik_loss, poly_loss). For each round in 0 to L-1, we compute the move for A and B, then determine if Nik loses, or Poly loses, or neither.\n\nFor example, for each round, we can check:\n\nif A's move beats B's move: then Poly loses (so Nik gains a spot). So Nik's loss count is 0, Poly's is 1.\n\nIf B's move beats A's move: Nik loses (so Nik's count increases by 1, Poly's 0).\n\nElse: no loss.\n\nSo for each round, we can calculate how much each loses.\n\nSo for the entire L rounds, we can calculate the total per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nOnce that's done, the rest is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each round in 0 to L-1, what the moves are, and determine the outcome.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute for each of the L rounds, the moves and outcomes.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nImplementing GCD:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\nThen LCM(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle when a or b is zero? But since m and k are >=1, as per input constraints.\n\nOnce LCM is computed, then proceed.\n\nNow, for each of the L rounds, simulate the moves.\n\nBut for each round i (from 0 to L-1):\n\na_index = i % m\n\nb_index = i % k\n\na_move = A[a_index]\n\nb_move = B[b_index]\n\nThen determine the outcome.\n\nHow to determine the outcome?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes two moves and returns who wins.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Nikephoros (a) is the winner, so Polycarpus (b) gets a spot.\n\n        # So Nik's loss is 0, Poly's loss is 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, so Nikephoros loses. So Nik's loss is 1, Poly's is 0.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if there's a winner, the loser is the one who gets a spot. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for the function above, when a beats b, then b is the loser. So for Nikephoros's loss count, it's 0 (since he didn't lose). But for Polycarpus's loss count, it's 1. So the function returns (0, 1) in that case.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each round, the helper function returns (nik_loss, poly_loss). So for each round, we can add these to the totals.\n\nSo, for the L rounds, we can compute the total per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nOnce that's done, the total number of cycles is total_cycles = n // L.\n\nThen, the remaining rounds is rem = n % L.\n\nSo, for the rem rounds, we need to simulate the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and sum their (nik_loss, poly_loss).\n\nBut how to do that? Well, during the initial simulation of the L rounds, we can store an array of cumulative counts. Or, during the simulation, we can collect for each round (i) the nik and poly loss counts. Then, for the rem rounds, we can take the first rem rounds and sum them.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial simulation, we can compute the total for the entire L rounds, and also for each possible prefix. But that's more memory. However, for the rem rounds, we can just loop through the first rem rounds again and sum.\n\nBut for rem up to 1e6, that's acceptable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nSimulate all L rounds, and for each round, store the (nik_loss, poly_loss) as a list of tuples. Then, for the full cycles, multiply by the total per cycle. For the remaining rounds, take the first rem rounds and sum their values.\n\nBut for large L (up to 1e6), storing a list of tuples is manageable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nCompute L.\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly by looping over L rounds.\n\nAlso, create a list called round_losses, where each element is (nik, poly) for that round.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, sum the first rem elements of round_losses.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps during the initial simulation, we can accumulate the per_cycle counts and also store the per-round counts.\n\nSo code:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nL = lcm(m, k)\n\nper_cycle_nik = 0\n\nper_cycle_poly = 0\n\nround_losses = []\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik_loss, poly_loss = get_result(a, b)\n\n    per_cycle_nik += nik_loss\n\n    per_cycle_poly += poly_loss\n\n    round_losses.append( (nik_loss, poly_loss) )\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    total_nik += round_losses[i][0]\n\n    total_poly += round_losses[i][1]\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nBut what if n is less than L? Then total_cycles is 0, and rem is n. So the loop for rem rounds will process all of them.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute LCM correctly.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, LCM can be up to 1e6. So for L=1e6, the loop is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for L=12 rounds, we need to simulate each round.\n\nBut the sample input has n=7, which is less than 12. So total_cycles is 0, rem=7. So we process the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet me check the example.\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw → (0,0)\n\nRound 1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo S (scissors) beats P (paper). So if A plays P (paper) and B plays S (scissors), then B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So the result is (1, 0).\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw), then P vs S (second round?), but perhaps the rounds are 0-based or 1-based? Let me check the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw). Then the second round is P vs S. So the sample input's first example's rounds are 7 rounds. So for the first 7 rounds, the code would simulate each.\n\nBut according to the code, for each i in 0 to 6 (since rem=7), the rounds are 0 to 6.\n\nLet me check for each of the 7 rounds:\n\nLet me re-calculate the rounds.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4).\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3] is P, B[1%4] is S. P vs S: S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So (1,0).\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the second round (assuming rounds are 1-based?), the second round is P vs S. Nikephoros loses. So that's the first round (i=1) in the code's 0-based index. So the sample's first round is i=0, then i=1 is the second round.\n\nSo in the sample explanation, the first sample's rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses.\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Polycarpus loses.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros loses.\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Polycarpus loses.\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros loses.\n\nSo the total for Nikephoros is 3 losses (rounds 2,4,7). For Polycarpus, 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nBut according to the code, for i from 0 to 6 (7 rounds), let's compute each round:\n\ni=0: A[0] = R, B[0] = R → draw → (0,0).\n\ni=1: A[1] = P, B[1] = S → S beats P. Nikephoros loses → (1,0).\n\ni=2: A[2] = S, B[2] = P → S beats P? No. Wait, S (scissors) beats P (paper). So A's move is S, B's is P. So A wins. So B loses. So (0,1).\n\ni=3: A[0] (since 3%3=0) → R, B[3%4=3] → P. R vs P: P beats R. So B wins. Nikephoros loses → (1,0).\n\ni=4: A[1] (4%3=1) → P, B[4%4=0] → R. P vs R: P beats R. So A wins. B loses. (0,1).\n\ni=5: A[2] (5%3=2) → S, B[5%4=1] → S. Draw. (0,0).\n\ni=6: A[0] (6%3=0) → R, B[6%4=2] → P. R vs P: B wins. Nikephoros loses → (1,0).\n\nSo for the 7 rounds, the sum of nik losses is:\n\ni=1: 1\n\ni=3: 1\n\ni=6: 1 → total 3.\n\nPoly's losses are:\n\ni=2: 1\n\ni=4: 1 → total 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code would compute that correctly.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput: 5, A is RRRRRR (length 6?), B is R. So the sample output is 0 0. Because all rounds are draws.\n\nSo for each round, A and B choose R. So no one loses.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nNow, for the code, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 2e9, but the LCM is up to 1e6, this is feasible.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the next two lines as A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k).\n\nSimulate for L rounds, compute per_cycle_nik, per_cycle_poly, and the list of per-round losses.\n\nThen compute total_cycles = n // L, rem = n % L.\n\nThen compute the total for the full cycles and the rem rounds.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, for very big numbers, but since L is up to 1e6, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the GCD and LCM.\n\nBut first, read the input. Wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string.\n\nThird line contains sequence B as a string.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. The actual input is:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nSo the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 7, then RPS, then RSPP.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper function for getting the result.\n\nBut in code, perhaps better to use a lookup table.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    # check if a beats b\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Nikephoros (a) is winner. So Polycarpus (b) gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss is 0, Poly's is 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, so Nikephoros (a) loses. So Nikephoros's loss is 1, Poly's is 0.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing GCD and LCM.\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, for m and k, compute LCM(m, k).\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen simulate for L rounds.\n\nBut for L up to 1e6, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ncompute the result.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for i in range(L):\n\nSo, code:\n\nThen, after computing the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly, and the round_losses list.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThen compute total_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\nThen for the rem rounds, loop through the first rem entries in round_losses and add to the totals.\n\nNow, code.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBut in code, the round_losses can be a list of tuples, but perhaps we can precompute the cumulative sums for the L rounds. However, for the rem rounds, it's easier to loop through the first rem rounds and sum.\n\nBut for rem up to 1e6, that's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m, k.\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nSimulate for L rounds.\n\nThen compute total_cycles and rem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for very large L (like 1e6), it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let's test the code for the first sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7\n\nA=RPS (m=3)\n\nB=RSPP (k=4)\n\nL = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nsimulate for 12 rounds.\n\nBut for the code, the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly would be the sum of all 12 rounds. But for n=7, which is less than 12, total_cycles is 0, rem is 7. So the code adds the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich gives the correct answer.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 12, then rem is 0, and the code would take total_cycles=1, and add per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut code needs to be written in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n    L = lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n\n    round_losses = []\n\n    for i in range(L):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            nik_loss = 0\n\n            poly_loss = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n                nik_loss = 0\n\n                poly_loss = 1\n\n            else:\n\n                nik_loss = 1\n\n                poly_loss = 0\n\n        per_cycle_nik += nik_loss\n\n        per_cycle_poly += poly_loss\n\n        round_losses.append( (nik_loss, poly_loss) )\n\n    total_cycles = n // L\n\n    rem = n % L\n\n    total_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\n    total_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        total_nik += round_losses[i][0]\n\n        total_poly += round_losses[i][1]\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, the code for the helper function is inside the main function. But that's okay.\n\nBut in Python, the code may have some issues with reading input. For example, sometimes after reading n, the next lines may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nBut the code uses strip() for A and B, which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSample Output: 3 2\n\nWhich the code would compute correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich is the second example in the problem statement. The output is 0 0.\n\nBecause for all rounds, both play R. So no losses.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, for each round, the a_move and b_move are R, so no loss. So per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are 0. So total is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nNow, what about when L is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the helper function for checking the result is implemented inline, which is okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in the code, the functions gcd and lcm are defined inside the main function. But that's okay.\n\nNow, code is written.\n\nBut in Python, for very large L (like 1e6), the for loop for L rounds may take some time, but for 1e6 iterations, it's acceptable.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result even for a very large number of rounds, up to 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Strategy**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. Nikephoros uses sequence A and Polycarpus uses sequence B.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the sequence of moves for both players will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds and then use this to determine the results for any number of rounds.\n3. **Simulation for One Cycle**: Simulate all rounds within one LCM cycle to determine the number of losses for each player during this cycle.\n4. **Scaling Up**: Use the results from one cycle to compute the total losses for the entire number of rounds by considering how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n    \n    L = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n    round_losses = []\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            nik_loss = 0\n            poly_loss = 0\n        else:\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n               (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n               (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                nik_loss = 0\n                poly_loss = 1\n            else:\n                nik_loss = 1\n                poly_loss = 0\n        \n        per_cycle_nik += nik_loss\n        per_cycle_poly += poly_loss\n        round_losses.append((nik_loss, poly_loss))\n    \n    total_cycles = n // L\n    rem = n % L\n    \n    total_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n    total_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        total_nik += round_losses[i][0]\n        total_poly += round_losses[i][1]\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the cycle length after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Cycle**: For each round within the LCM cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the result of each round is recorded. The total number of losses for each player during this cycle is computed.\n4. **Scaling Results**: Using the results from one cycle, the total number of losses for the entire number of rounds is calculated by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds separately. This ensures efficient computation even for very large numbers of rounds.",
