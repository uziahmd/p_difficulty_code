There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a perfect binary tree. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. The rule probably affects how the matches are arranged to maximize the winner's games.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, maybe player 1 plays against player 2. Then, the winner (player 1) plays against player 3. But according to the rule, when player 1 plays against player 3, player 1 has already played 1 game, and player 3 has played 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal knockout, 4 players would have 3 rounds (log2(4)=2 games for the winner?), no. Wait, 4 players: first round has two matches (two games), then the winners play each other. So the winner plays two games. Oh right, so the output is 2. But what if the tournament was arranged differently? Like, maybe the winner plays three games? But that's impossible because there are only 4 players. Let me think: the total number of games in a knockout tournament is always n-1. For n=4, there are 3 games. But the winner can't play more than 2 games. Because each game eliminates one player. So for the winner to play 3 games, there must be 3 other players, but in that case, the winner would have to play against each of them once. But that's not possible in a knockout structure. Because after each game, the loser is eliminated. So the winner can't play against all others. So for n=4, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem is to find, given n, the maximum number of games the winner can play, under the given constraints.\n\nNow, how do we model this?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How to find f(n)?\n\nThe idea is that to maximize the number of games the winner plays, the tournament must be arranged such that the winner plays as many matches as possible, each time facing opponents that have played as many games as possible (so that the difference is at most 1).\n\nLet me think about the structure. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time he plays, he must face an opponent who has played either k-1, k-2, etc. games. But how does that affect the number of players required?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where each node represents a player, and each match is a node's parent. The winner's path from the root to the leaf would be the number of games he plays. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Let's denote this as m(k). Then, for a given n, the maximum k is the largest integer such that m(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo how to find m(k)?\n\nFor the winner to play k games, he must have played against k opponents. Each of those opponents must have been eliminated in their respective matches. But each of those opponents must have played a certain number of games before facing the winner.\n\nLet me think recursively. For the winner to play his first game, he needs one opponent. For the second game, he needs to face someone who has played either 0 or 1 game. But that someone must have won their previous matches. So perhaps the structure is similar to a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think about the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Let's call this number f(k). \n\nTo play k games, the winner must have played against k opponents. Let's think about the structure of the tournament. For the first game, the winner plays against one player. For the second game, he must play against someone who has played either 0 or 1 games. But that someone must have come through their own matches. \n\nLet me think of this as a recursive problem. For the winner to play k games, the first game is against someone. That someone must have played 0 games (since the winner has played 0 before the first game). Then, for the second game, the winner has played 1 game. The next opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. But to get to that point, that opponent must have won their previous matches. \n\nSuppose that for the winner to play k games, the number of players required is f(k). Then, for the winner's k-th game, he must have faced an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. Let's think that the opponent in the k-th game has played k-1 games. Then, the total number of players required would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because the winner's path requires that he has played k-1 games before the k-th game, and the opponent's path requires that he has played k-1 games. But wait, that's not quite right. \n\nAlternatively, let's think that for the winner to have k games, the first game is against a player. Then, in order to get to the second game, the winner must have another opponent who has played one game. Let's imagine that the winner's first game is against a player A. Then, in the second game, he must face a player B who has played 0 or 1 games. Suppose that B has played 1 game. Then, B must have had a previous match. So the total players needed for the winner to have 2 games is 1 (player A) + 2 (players needed for B's path) = 3? Wait, for B to have played 1 game, that's 2 players. So total is 1+2=3. Which matches the example where n=3 gives 2 games. So for k=2, the minimal players is 3. \n\nSimilarly, for k=3, the minimal players would be f(3) = f(2) + f(1). Because the winner's third game must be against someone who has played 2 games (since the winner has played 2 games before that). So that opponent must have a path of 2 games, which requires f(2) players. And the winner's previous path requires f(2) players? Or maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nThe winner has to play k games. To reach the k-th game, he must have played k-1 games. So in the k-th game, he faces an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. To maximize the number of games, the opponent would have played k-1 games. But how does that affect the total players?\n\nLet me think recursively. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the winner to play the k-th game, he must have a path of k-1 games, and the opponent must have a path of k-1 games. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is like a Fibonacci tree. For example:\n\n- For k=1, the minimal players is 2 (the winner and one opponent). So f(1) = 2.\n- For k=2, the winner must have two games. The first game is against one player. The second game is against someone who has played one game. So that someone must have had a match before. So that requires two players (the opponent and his first opponent). So total players is 2 + 1 = 3? Or 2 + 1? Wait, the winner's first game is against one player (player A). Then, the opponent for the second game (player B) must have played one game. So for player B to have played one game, he must have had one match. So that requires two players (player B and his opponent). But since the winner is playing against player B in the second game, the total number of players is 2 (from player B's path) + 1 (player A) = 3. So f(2) = 3.\n\nThen, for k=3, the winner's third game must be against someone who has played 2 games. That someone's path requires f(2) players (which is 3). But the winner's path up to the third game requires that he has played two games. So how many players does that take? Well, the winner's first two games require that he has played against two opponents. But in order to get to the third game, he must have had two previous games. So the total players would be the players required for the winner's path (f(2)) plus the players required for the opponent's path (f(2))? But that would be 3+3=6? But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal players needed for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because:\n\n- For the winner to play k games, he must have played in the k-th game against an opponent who has played k-1 games. That opponent's path requires f(k-1) players. But the winner's path up to the (k-1)th game requires f(k-1) players? No, maybe not. Wait, the winner's path up to the (k-1)th game is part of the same structure. So maybe the total players is f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n\nLet me check for k=3. If f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 =5. So for n=5, the maximum games is 3. Let's see if that makes sense. \n\nImagine the winner plays 3 games. Let's see:\n\nFirst game: beats player A (1 game).\n\nSecond game: beats player B, who has played 1 game. So B's path requires two players (B and someone else). So that's 2 players. So up to this point, the winner has played two games, and the total players used is 1 (A) + 2 (B's path) = 3. But then for the third game, the winner must face someone who has played 2 games. Let's say that opponent is C. How did C get to 2 games? He must have played two games. So that requires that C's path is f(2) =3 players. But then the total players is 3 (from the previous steps) plus 3 (for C's path)? But that would be 6. But according to the formula, f(3) is 5. Hmm, something's wrong here. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's compute for f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3, f(3)=3+2=5, f(4)=5+3=8, etc. So for n=5, the answer is 3. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLet's imagine the winner plays 3 games. Let's arrange the tournament as follows:\n\nGame 1: Winner vs A → Winner wins.\n\nGame 2: Winner vs B → Winner wins.\n\nGame 3: Winner vs C → Winner wins.\n\nBut how can C have played 2 games before this? Let's think of the structure.\n\nFor the third game, the opponent (C) must have played 2 games. So C must have two previous wins. So for example, C plays against D and E. Let's say C beats D, then beats E. Then, the winner plays against C. So the total players are:\n\nWinner, A, B, C, D, E. Wait that's 6 players. But according to the formula f(3) =5. So where's the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is such that the opponent for the third game is someone who has played 1 game. But then the difference between the winner's games (2) and opponent's (1) is 1, which is allowed. So perhaps the formula isn't f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Maybe I need to rethink this.\n\nLet me think again. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the structure of the tournament. For each game the winner plays, the opponent must have played either the same number of games as the winner or one less. \n\nTo maximize the number of games, the winner should face opponents that have played as many games as possible. So for each step, the winner's next opponent must have played one less game than the winner. \n\nLet's model this as a Fibonacci-like sequence. Let's think of the minimal number of players needed to allow the winner to play k games. Let's call this number m(k). \n\nFor the first game (k=1), the winner plays against one player. So m(1) = 2.\n\nFor the second game (k=2), the winner must have played one game. The opponent for the second game must have played either 0 or 1 games. To maximize, the opponent should have played 1 game. So how many players does that take? The opponent must have played one game, which requires two players (opponent and their first opponent). So the total number of players is 2 (from the first game) + 1 (the new opponent's first opponent) ? Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe winner's first game is against player A. Then, the second game is against player B, who has played one game. Player B must have beaten someone else, say player C. So the total players are A, B, C. The winner plays against A and then against B. So m(2) = 3.\n\nFor the third game (k=3), the winner must face someone who has played 2 games (since the winner has played 2 games so far). How many players does that take? The opponent must have played two games. Let's say that opponent is D. To have played two games, D must have beaten two players. So for D to reach the third game, there must be a structure where D has two wins. Let's imagine that D's path is: D beats E, then D beats F. So that requires three players (E, F, D). But then, the winner's path up to two games has already used 3 players (A, B, C). So adding D, E, F would make 3+3 = 6 players. However, perhaps there's a way to reuse some players?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of players for k games is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). For example, m(3) = m(2)+m(1) = 3+2=5. How can that be achieved?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where m(3)=5. The winner plays three games. Let's see:\n\nFirst game: winner vs A (winner wins).\n\nSecond game: winner vs B (who has played one game). B's path requires two players (B and C). So now, the winner has played two games. Now, for the third game, the winner needs to face someone who has played two games. Let's say that person is B (but B has played one game). No. Or maybe another player.\n\nWait, perhaps the winner's second game is against someone who has played one game. Then, for the third game, the winner must face someone who has played one or two games. Let's say that the winner's third game is against someone who has played two games. How to get that?\n\nLet me think of the following structure:\n\nThe winner's first game is against player A. Then, the second game is against player B, who has played one game. Then, the third game is against player C, who has played two games.\n\nHow can C have played two games? C must have beaten two players. But how can that be done without adding too many players?\n\nLet me think of the players:\n\nPlayer C must have played two games. So, for example, C played against D and then against E. But then, that's three players (C, D, E). However, in this case, the winner's path is:\n\nGame 1: winner vs A (A is eliminated).\n\nGame 2: winner vs B (B is eliminated).\n\nGame 3: winner vs C (C is eliminated).\n\nBut for C to have played two games, he must have played against D and then against E. But that would require that C and D played first, then C and E. But how does that fit into the tournament structure?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tournament is structured in a way that allows for overlapping paths. Let's think recursively. The minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). Because:\n\n- To reach the k-th game, the winner must have played k-1 games. So the path up to that point requires m(k-1) players.\n\n- The opponent in the k-th game must have played k-1 games. But how? That would require m(k-1) players. But that would make the total m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-1) = 2*m(k-1), which doesn't match the previous examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the opponent in the k-th game has played k-1 games, which requires m(k-1) players, but the winner's path up to the k-th game requires m(k-1) players. However, the winner and the opponent's paths may share some players. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). Let's see:\n\nm(1) = 2\n\nm(2) = 3\n\nm(3) = m(2) + m(1) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nm(4) = m(3) + m(2) = 5 +3=8.\n\nm(5)= 8+5=13.\n\nThis looks like the Fibonacci numbers starting from 2,3,...\n\nSo for example, if n is 5, the maximum number of games is 3. Because m(3) is 5. If n is 5, then the answer is 3.\n\nLet's check if that makes sense. How can the winner play 3 games with 5 players?\n\nLet me imagine the tournament structure:\n\nPlayers: W (winner), A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst game: W vs A → W wins.\n\nSecond game: W vs B → W wins.\n\nThird game: W vs C → W wins.\n\nBut for C to have played two games before facing W, he must have played two games. Let's see:\n\nC's path could be: first, C plays against D, and wins. Then, C plays against B, and wins. But wait, B was previously defeated by W. But if B is allowed to play again, that's not possible in a knockout tournament. Because once you lose, you are eliminated.\n\nAh, right. So the players can't be reused once they lose. So the opponent in the third game must be someone who hasn't been eliminated yet. So the opponent in the third game must have a path of two wins. How can that happen?\n\nLet me think of the structure as follows:\n\nFirst, there are two initial matches:\n\nMatch 1: A vs B → A wins.\n\nMatch 2: C vs D → C wins.\n\nThen, the next match is A vs C → A wins.\n\nThen, the final match is A vs W. Wait, but how does W fit into this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tournament is arranged in a way that the winner's path is:\n\nGame 1: W vs A → W wins.\n\nGame 2: W vs B → W wins.\n\nGame 3: W vs C → W wins.\n\nBut for C to have played two games before this, he must have played two matches. But how?\n\nLet me think that C's path is:\n\nGame 1: C vs D → C wins.\n\nGame 2: C vs E → C wins.\n\nBut then, for the third game, W plays against C. So the players involved are W, A, B, C, D, E. That's six players. But according to m(3)=5, it should be possible with 5 players. So where is the error in my thinking?\n\nMaybe the opponent in the third game has played one game, not two. Let's think again. The winner has played two games before the third. So the opponent can have played one game. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So for the third game, the opponent has played one game. How can that be arranged?\n\nLet me try:\n\nPlayers: W, A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst game: W vs A → W wins.\n\nSecond game: W vs B → W wins.\n\nThird game: W vs C → W wins.\n\nBut for C to have played one game, he must have played one match. So C's path is:\n\nHe must have played one game, which he won. So perhaps C played against D. So in the tournament, there's another match between C and D. But then, the tournament structure would have:\n\nFirst round:\n\nMatch 1: W vs A → W.\n\nMatch 2: C vs D → C.\n\nThen, second round:\n\nMatch 3: W vs B → W.\n\nMatch 4: W vs C → W.\n\nBut how does B get into the second round? B must have won his previous match. So perhaps, in the first round, there's also a match between B and someone else. But there are only five players. Let me think:\n\nPlayers are W, A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst round:\n\nMatch 1: W vs A → W.\n\nMatch 2: B vs C → B wins.\n\nMatch 3: D vs ... but there's no one else. Wait, n=5. So first round would have two matches (since 5 is odd?), but I think the tournament is structured in a way that allows for byes. But this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial structure isn't a full binary tree. But the problem allows any arrangement of the tournament as long as the rules are followed.\n\nIn this case, the third game is between W and C. For that to happen, C must have played one game. So in the first round, C played against D and won. Then, in the second round, W plays against B (who has played one game), and then in the third round, W plays against C (who has played one game). So that's allowed. But how many players are there? W, A, B, C, D. That's 5 players. So yes, for n=5, the answer is 3. So m(3) is 5. Which aligns with the earlier formula.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. So for the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2), with m(1) = 2, m(2)=3.\n\nThis is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's note that m(k) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number if we consider the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. Let's check:\n\nFor example, m(1)=2 = F(3) + something? Let me compute:\n\nLet's define the Fibonacci sequence as F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, etc.\n\nThen m(1) = 2 = F(3) + 1? Not sure. Alternatively, m(k) = F(k+2). Let's see:\n\nk=1: m(1)=2 = F(3) = 2 → yes.\n\nk=2: m(2)=3 = F(4) =3 → yes.\n\nk=3: m(3)=5 = F(5)=5 → yes.\n\nk=4: m(4)=8 = F(6)=8 → yes.\n\nYes! So m(k) is equal to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. So the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nTherefore, given n, we need to find the maximum k such that m(k) ≤ n. That is, find the largest k where F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18, then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list of Fibonacci numbers to find the maximum k.\n\nBut let's think about the Fibonacci numbers. Let's generate them up to the point where F(x) exceeds 1e18.\n\nLet me compute the Fibonacci numbers:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) =13\n\nF(8)=21\n\nF(9)=34\n\nF(10)=55\n\n...\n\nLet me see how many terms are needed for F(x) to reach 1e18.\n\nEach term grows exponentially. For example, F(80) is around 2.34e16, F(85) is around 2.1e17, F(90) is 2.88e18. So F(90) is about 2.88e18, which is larger than 1e18. So the list of Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18 would have around 90 terms.\n\nSo we can precompute all the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18, then for a given n, find the largest k such that F(k+2) <=n. The answer would be k.\n\nWait, for example, for n=2, F(3)=2. So k=1. Which matches the sample input.\n\nFor n=3, F(4)=3. So k=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=4, the largest F(k+2) <=4 is F(4)=3 (k=2) and F(5)=5 is larger than 4. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=10, the Fibonacci numbers are:\n\nF(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So the largest is F(6)=8. So k is 6-2=4? Wait, no. Wait, m(k) = F(k+2). So for k=4, m(k) = F(6) = 8. Since 8<=10, then the maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample where for n=10, the output is 4. Yes! So the sample input for 10 gives output 4, which matches.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum value of k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the largest k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the maximum possible value (up to 1e18). Then, for each input n, find the largest index in the list where the value is <=n. Then subtract 2 from the index to get k.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let's create a list of Fibonacci numbers where the i-th element is F(i). For example, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nThen, for a given n, we want to find the maximum x such that F(x) <=n. Then, the answer is x-2. Because m(k) = F(k+2). So F(x) = F(k+2) → x =k+2 → k =x-2.\n\nSo for example, for n=3, the largest x is 4 (F(4)=3), so k=4-2=2, which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nGenerate all F(i) up to 1e18. Then for a given n, find the maximum x where F(x) <=n. Then the answer is x-2.\n\nBut what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=4. The largest F(x) <=4 is F(5)=5? No. Wait F(5)=5 is larger than 4. So the largest is F(4)=3. So x=4, answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the Fibonacci numbers until they exceed 1e18. Then for input n, find the largest x where F(x) <=n. The answer is x-2.\n\nBut how to handle cases where n is less than F(3)=2? Well, the input n starts from 2. For n=2, F(3)=2, so x=3, answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum x such that F(x) <=n.\n\n- The answer is x-2.\n\nBut how to find x?\n\nWe can generate the list of Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18, then perform a binary search on the list.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nFirst, generate the list:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nthen while the next number is <= 1e18:\n\nnext_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\nappend to fib.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for input n, find the largest x where fib[x] <=n. But since the list is 0-based or 1-based?\n\nLet me think. Let's generate the list as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 1]  # F(1) =1, F(2)=1\n\nthen for i >=3, F(i) = F(i-1)+F(i-2)\n\nSo the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ... ]\n\nSo for example, the index in the list is i-1 for F(i). For example, fib[0] is F(1), fib[1] is F(2), fib[2] is F(3), etc.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the largest i such that F(i) <=n. Once found, the answer is i-2.\n\nBut how to find i?\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the list. For example, for n=10, the list up to F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So the largest F(i) <=10 is 8 (i=6). So answer is 6-2=4, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n is 1, but according to input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nGenerate the list of F(i) as described.\n\nFind the maximum x where F(x) <=n.\n\nThen answer is x-2.\n\nBut how to generate the list?\n\nLet me code this in Python.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 1e18, but the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, the list will be small. Let's compute it.\n\nLet me compute the list:\n\nStart with F(1) =1, F(2)=1.\n\nF(3) =2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nF(8)=21\n\nF(9)=34\n\nF(10)=55\n\nF(11)=89\n\nF(12)=144\n\nF(13)=233\n\nF(14)=377\n\nF(15)=610\n\nF(16)=987\n\nF(17)=1597\n\nF(18)=2584\n\nF(19)=4181\n\nF(20)=6765\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the value exceeds 1e18.\n\nNow, in Python, we can generate this list.\n\nOnce generated, for a given n, perform a binary search on the list.\n\nBut for binary search, the list must be sorted, which it is.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # generate fib list\n\n    fib = [1, 1]  # F(1) and F(2)\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_f = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n        if next_f > 1e18:\n\n            break\n\n        fib.append(next_f)\n\n    # Now find the largest x such that fib[x] <=n.\n\n    # Note: the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ... F(m)]\n\n    # So for each index i in the list, the value is F(i+1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nInitially, fib = [1, 1], which is F(1) and F(2). Then, the next element is F(3) = 2, added as fib[2]. Then F(4)=3 added as fib[3], etc.\n\nSo the list index is i, and the value is F(i+1). Wait no. For example, the index 0 is F(1), index 1 is F(2), index 2 is F(3), index 3 is F(4), etc. So for the list, the value at index i is F(i+1). So to find the maximum x where F(x) <=n, we need to find the largest i such that F(i) <=n, and then x =i.\n\nBut how to find that in the list.\n\nLet me think of the list as being F(1), F(2), ..., F(k). So the list is [F(1), F(2), ..., F(k)].\n\nSo for example, if the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8,...], then the index is 0-based.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the maximum x where F(x) <=n. So x can be 1,2,3,..., len(fib).\n\nSo for example, for n=3, the maximum x is 4 (since F(4)=3). But the list has F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc. So in the list, the index for F(4) is 3.\n\nSo the code can perform a binary search on the list, looking for the largest value <=n. Once found, the x is the index+1 (since the list's index is i, and the value is F(i+1)).\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe list is built as follows:\n\nInitially, fib = [1, 1]. These are F(1) and F(2). Then, for each next element, we add F(3), F(4), etc.\n\nSo the list's elements are F(1), F(2), F(3), ..., F(m), where m is the last index.\n\nSo for the list, the index is i (starting from 0), and the value is F(i+1).\n\nSo for example, if the list is [1,1,2,3,5], then the elements are:\n\ni=0 → F(1)=1\n\ni=1 → F(2)=1\n\ni=2 → F(3)=2\n\ni=3 → F(4)=3\n\ni=4 → F(5)=5.\n\nSo to find the maximum x where F(x) <=n, we need to find the largest i such that F(i) <=n, and then x=i.\n\nBut how to find that i in the list.\n\nThe list contains F(1), F(2), ..., F(m). So the maximum possible x is m.\n\nSo during binary search, we can search for the largest value in the list that is <=n. Once found, the x is the corresponding i+1? Or not?\n\nWait, for example, if the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ... F(m)], and the value at index i is F(i+1). So for example, if we find that the value at index i is <=n, then F(i+1) <=n. So the x is i+1.\n\nBut we need to find the maximum x where F(x) <=n. So the maximum x is the maximum i such that F(i) <=n.\n\nSo the binary search is over the list, and for each element in the list, which is F(i+1) (where i is the index), we compare with n.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = len(fib)-1\n\nresult =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires a structure where opponents have played a number of games that differs by at most one from the winner's current count.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games corresponds to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players `n`.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (10^18) and use binary search to quickly find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 1e18\n    fib = [1, 1]  # F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1\n    while True:\n        next_f = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_f > 10**18:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_f)\n    \n    # Now find the largest x such that F(x) <= n\n    left = 0\n    right = len(fib) - 1\n    best = 0\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if fib[mid] <= n:\n            best = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    # The answer is (best + 1) - 2 = best -1\n    # Because fib[best] is F(best + 1), so x = best + 1\n    # Then answer is x - 2 = best + 1 - 2 = best -1\n    print(best - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Generation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 1, 1, and continue until the next number exceeds 10^18. This list helps us quickly reference Fibonacci numbers for any input size.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci list, we efficiently determine the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This index helps us compute the maximum number of games the winner can play by adjusting for the offset in the Fibonacci sequence indices.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by adjusting the index found using binary search to account for the offset in the Fibonacci sequence, providing the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle very large values of `n` efficiently, leveraging the exponential growth of Fibonacci numbers to limit the number of computations needed.",
