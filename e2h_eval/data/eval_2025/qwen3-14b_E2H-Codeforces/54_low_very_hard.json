Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me recall some geometry here. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides at a vertex. However, the problem here is about selecting three vertices where one is the vertex of the angle, and the other two are on the sides. So maybe I need to think about the central angles or something else.\n\nWait, the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon depends on how many steps apart they are. For example, in a square (n=4), if you take vertices 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take 1, 2, 4, the angle at 2 would be different. Wait, no, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. All the vertices lie on a circle. Then, the central angles between adjacent vertices are 360/n degrees. Now, when we pick three points v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex of the angle, the angle at v2 depends on the arc lengths between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, perhaps the angle can be determined based on the number of edges between the vertices. Let me think: suppose that between v2 and v1 there are k edges (so the arc length is k * (360/n) degrees), and between v2 and v3 there are m edges. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arcs.\n\nWait, but for the angle formed at v2 with v1 and v3 on the sides, the angle is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. However, since the polygon is regular, perhaps the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3.\n\nWait, here's a way to think about it. For a regular polygon, if you pick three vertices such that there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v2 and v3 (but in the other direction?), then the angle at v2 can be calculated using the formula. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the regular polygon is cyclic. The angle at v2 depends on the arcs that are subtended by the chords v1v2 and v2v3. Wait, but the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. Hmm, perhaps I need to find the measure of the angle formed by two chords meeting at v2.\n\nLet me think of a regular polygon with n vertices. Let's fix v2 as a vertex. Then, the angle formed at v2 by v1 and v3 depends on how far apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is adjacent to v2 on the other side, then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. Which is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But if v1 is two steps away from v2 and v3 is also two steps away, then the angle would be different.\n\nWait, maybe there's a general formula. Suppose that between v1 and v2 there are k edges along the perimeter, and between v2 and v3 there are m edges. But since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs that are opposite to the angle. Let me think in terms of the circle.\n\nIn a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle formed by two chords at a point is equal to half the measure of the arc between the two points. Wait, but that's when the angle is formed by two chords that subtend an arc. For example, if I have points A, B, C on a circle, then the angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, no, the angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that is opposite to B. So, if the arc from A to C (passing through the side opposite to B) is x degrees, then angle ABC is x/2.\n\nSo, in the regular polygon case, let's imagine that v1 and v3 are two points such that when you look from v2, the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is some value. Then,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360}{n} $ degrees. The angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the arcs subtended by those vertices.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a given vertex `v2`, the angle formed by vertices `v1` and `v3` can be derived based on the number of steps between these vertices. If there are `k` steps between `v1` and `v2` and `m` steps between `v2` and `v3`, the angle at `v2` can be calculated using the formula derived from the inscribed angle theorem.\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: We need to find the optimal number of steps `k` such that the angle formed is closest to the given angle `a`. This involves iterating through possible values of `k` and calculating the corresponding angles to find the minimum difference from `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # The internal angle of the polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n\n    # But for our problem, we need to consider angles formed by selecting vertices.\n    # Let's think about the angle at v2 when v1 and v3 are k steps away from v2 in each direction.\n    # The angle at v2 would be (k * 180) / n\n    # Wait, no.

Here, between 1 and 3 (passing through 2) there are 2 edges. So k = 2.\n    # The formula would be ( (k - 1) * 180 ) / n = (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. That's not matching. So that formula is incorrect.\n\n    # Another approach: For any three vertices v1, v2, v3 in a regular n-gon, with v2 as the vertex of the angle, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of edges between v1 and v2 (let's say k edges) and between v2 and v3 (let's say m edges). However, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle is determined by the arc opposite to v2. \n\n    # Let me find the correct formula:\n    # The central angle between v1 and v2 is (k * 360) / n degrees. Similarly for v2 and v3. But the angle at v2 is related to the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are t edges. Then, the arc is t * (360/n) degrees, and the angle at v2 is half of that arc. So angle = (t * 180) / n degrees.\n\n    # But how to determine t? Since the polygon is convex, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2 is (n - (k + m + 1)) edges, where k is the number of edges from v1 to v2 and m from v2 to v3. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\n    # Let's refer to standard solutions for similar problems. For example, in a regular n-gon, the angle at vertex v2 formed by v1 and v3, where v1 is i steps away from v2 clockwise and v3 is j steps away from v2 counter-clockwise, then the angle is (i + j) * 180 / n degrees. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the maximum number of steps between v1 and v3 without crossing over is (n - 1) steps. However, to avoid overlapping, the total steps i + j must be less than n-1.\n\n    # Wait, here's a better way to think: For any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 in the polygon, with v2 as the vertex of the angle, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let's say there are k vertices between v1 and v3 along this arc. Then the arc length is (k+1) * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of this arc, so angle = (k+1) * 180 / n degrees.\n\n    # However, since v1 and v3 can be anywhere, but we want to find the best possible angle, we can iterate over possible k values. The key insight is that the angle formed at v2 can be written as ( (k) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't include v2. But this might vary depending on the configuration.\n\n    # Let's consider that for a regular polygon, the angle formed at vertex v2 by vertices v1 and v3 can be calculated as follows: Let's assume that between v1 and v3, there are k vertices (excluding v1 and v3). Then the arc length is (k+2) * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that, so (k+2) * 180 / n degrees. But this seems to be getting too convoluted.\n\n    # After some research and thinking, I found that the angle at v2 is ( (n - 2k - 2) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for a regular polygon, the angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 with v2 as the vertex of the angle is given by ( (n - 2) * 180 / n ) - ( (k * 180) / n ), where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\n    # This is getting too stuck. Let's look for patterns in examples:\n\n    # Example 1: n=3 (triangle), a=15. The only possible angle is 60 degrees (internal angle). So output is any triplet.\n\n    # Example 2: n=4 (square), a=67. Possible angles are 45 and 90. 45 is closer to 67, so output is 2 1 3 (angle at 1 is 45 degrees).\n\n    # How is that angle calculated? In a square, if you take vertices 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 2, 1, 3, the angle at 1 is formed by vertices 2 and 3. How is that angle calculated?\n\n    # In this case, the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't pass through 1 is 1 step (from 2 to 3). The arc length is 90 degrees. The angle at 1 is half of that arc (since it's an inscribed angle), which is 45 degrees. That matches the example.\n\n    # So the formula is: angle = (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2. The arc_length is (number_of_steps_between_v1_and_v3) * (360/n).\n\n    # Therefore, for any three vertices v1, v2, v3 with v2 as the vertex of the angle, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 has s steps, where s ranges from 1 to n-2. The angle at v2 is (s * 360 / n) / 2 = (s * 180) / n degrees.\n\n    # Now, the problem reduces to finding the value of s such that (s * 180) / n is as close as possible to a. Once s is determined, we can select any triplet of vertices that satisfies this condition.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n    # 1. For all possible s in [1, n-2], compute the angle (s * 180)/n.\n    # 2. Find the s that minimizes the absolute difference with a.\n    # 3. Once s is found, choose any triplet of vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 has s steps.\n\n    # For example, for s steps, we can choose v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex 2 + s + 1 (mod n?), but need to ensure they are distinct.\n\n    # Let's proceed to implement this.\n\n    # Compute the optimal s\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_s = 1\n    for s in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (s * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_s = s\n        elif diff == best_diff:\n            # Choose the smallest s or any, but since the problem allows any, we can keep the first one\n            pass\n\n    # Now, find a triplet of vertices that corresponds to this s\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + s + 1 (but need to make sure that the arc between v1 and v3 is s steps)\n    # Wait, for example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is 2 (adjacent to v2), and v3 should be s+1 steps away from v1 in the other direction. Or maybe v3 is s steps away from v2 in the other direction?\n\n    # Let's think: if v2 is fixed as vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 has s steps. For example, if s=1, then v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other but not passing through v2. So for n=4, if v2 is 1, then v1 could be 2 and v3 could be 3. The arc between 2 and 3 that does not pass through 1 is 1 step (directly between them), so s=1. The angle at 1 would be 1*180/4 = 45 degrees.\n\n    # So for general s, we can choose v1 as 2, v2 as 1, and v3 as 2 + s. But need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is s steps. Let's check:\n\n    # For v1 = 2, v3 = 2 + s. The arc from 2 to v3 passing through 3, 4,... up to v3 would be s steps. But since v2 is 1, the arc that does not pass through v2 is indeed s steps. So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+s.\n\n    # But what if 2+s exceeds n? For example, if n=4, s=2, 2+s=4. That's okay. The arc between 2 and 4 is two steps (2->3->4), which is s=2 steps. The angle would be 2*180/4 = 90 degrees.\n\n    # Thus, the triplet can be chosen as v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + s. But need to ensure that 2 + s <= n. However, since s ranges up to n-2, 2 + s can be up to n-2 + 2 = n, which is valid.\n\n    # However, when s = n-2, 2 + s = n. So v3 is n, which is valid.\n\n    # So the triplet is 2, 1, 2 + s. But we need to ensure that the vertices are distinct and within the range.\n\n    # Let's test with the example given:\n\n    # Example 2: n=4, a=67. The best_s is 1 (angle 45), which is closer to 67 than 90 (s=2 gives 90).\n\n    # So the triplet would be 2, 1, 2+1=3. Which is 2 1 3, which matches the sample output.\n\n    # Another example: n=4, a=68. The best_s would be 2 (angle 90), which is closer to 68 than 45. The triplet would be 2, 1, 2+2=4. So 2 1 4, which is one of the correct outputs in the note.\n\n    # So this approach works.\n\n    # Now, handle the case where multiple s have the same minimal difference. For example, if a is exactly halfway between two angles. The problem says to choose any.\n\n    # Now, implement this logic.\n\n    # Edge cases:\n    # - n=3, a=60: best_s is 1 (1*180/3 = 60), triplet is 2 1 3.\n    # - n=3, a=15: best_s is 1 (same as above), output any triplet.\n\n    # Now, code:\n\n    # Compute best_s\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_s = 1\n    for s in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (s * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_s = s\n        elif diff == best_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller s?

Let's say there are k vertices between v1 and v3 along this arc. Then the arc length is (k+1) * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of this arc, so angle = (k+1) * 180 / n degrees.\n\n    # However, since v1 and v3 can be anywhere, but we want to find the best possible angle, we can iterate over possible k values. The key insight is that the angle formed at v2 can be written as ( (k) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't include v2. But this might vary depending on the configuration.\n\n    # Let's consider that for a regular polygon, the angle formed at vertex v2 by vertices v1 and v3 can be calculated as follows: Let's assume that between v1 and v3, there are k vertices (excluding v1 and v3). Then the arc length is (k+2) * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that, so (k+2) * 180 / n degrees. But this seems to be getting too convoluted.\n\n    # After some research and thinking, I found that the angle at v2 is ( (n - 2k - 2) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for a regular polygon, the angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 with v2 as the vertex of the angle is given by ( (n - 2) * 180 / n ) - ( (k * 180) / n ), where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\n    # This is getting too stuck. Let's look for patterns in examples:\n\n    # Example 1: n=3 (triangle), a=15. The only possible angle is 60 degrees (internal angle). So output is any triplet.\n\n    # Example 2: n=4 (square), a=67. Possible angles are 45 and 90. 45 is closer to 67, so output is 2 1 3 (angle at 1 is 45 degrees).\n\n    # How is that angle calculated? In a square, if you take vertices 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 2, 1, 3, the angle at 1 is formed by vertices 2 and 3. How is that angle calculated?\n\n    # In this case, the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't pass through 1 is 1 step (from 2 to 3). The arc length is 90 degrees. The angle at 1 is half of that arc (since it's an inscribed angle), which is 45 degrees. That matches the example.\n\n    # So the formula is: angle = (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2. The arc_length is (number_of_steps_between_v1_and_v3) * (360/n).\n\n    # Therefore, for any three vertices v1, v2, v3 with v2 as the vertex of the angle, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 has s steps, where s ranges from 1 to n-2. The angle at v2 is (s * 360 / n) / 2 = (s * 180) / n degrees.\n\n    # Now, the problem reduces to finding the value of s such that (s * 180) / n is as close as possible to a. Once s is determined, we can select any triplet of vertices that satisfies this condition.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n    # 1. For all possible s in [1, n-2], compute the angle (s * 180)/n.\n    # 2. Find the s that minimizes the absolute difference with a.\n    # 3. Once s is found, choose any triplet of vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 has s steps.\n\n    # For example, for s steps, we can choose v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex 2 + s + 1 (mod n?), but need to ensure they are distinct.\n\n    # Let's proceed to implement this.\n\n    # Compute the optimal s\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_s = 1\n    for s in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (s * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_s = s\n        elif diff == best_diff:\n            # Choose the smallest s or any, but since the problem allows any, we can keep the first one\n            pass\n\n    # Now, find a triplet of vertices that corresponds to this s\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + s + 1 (but need to make sure that the arc between v1 and v3 is s steps)\n    # Wait, for example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is 2 (adjacent to v2), and v3 should be s+1 steps away from v1 in the other direction. Or maybe v3 is s steps away from v2 in the other direction?\n\n    # Let's think: if v2 is fixed as vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 has s steps. For example, if s=1, then v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other but not passing through v2. So for n=4, if v2 is 1, then v1 could be 2 and v3 could be 3. The arc between 2 and 3 that does not pass through 1 is 1 step (directly between them), so s=1. The angle at 1 would be 1*180/4 = 45 degrees.\n\n    # So for general s, we can choose v1 as 2, v2 as 1, and v3 as 2 + s. But need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is s steps. Let's check:\n\n    # For v1 = 2, v3 = 2 + s. The arc from 2 to v3 passing through 3, 4,... up to v3 would be s steps. But since v2 is 1, the arc that does not pass through v2 is indeed s steps. So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+s.\n\n    # But what if 2+s exceeds n? For example, if n=4, s=2, 2+s=4. That's okay. The arc between 2 and 4 is two steps (2->3->4), which is s=2 steps. The angle would be 2*180/4 = 90 degrees.\n\n    # Thus, the triplet can be chosen as v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + s. But need to ensure that 2 + s <= n. However, since s ranges up to n-2, 2 + s can be up to n-2 + 2 = n, which is valid.\n\n    # However, when s = n-2, 2 + s = n. So v3 is n, which is valid.\n\n    # So the triplet is 2, 1, 2 + s. But we need to ensure that the vertices are distinct and within the range.\n\n    # Let's test with the example given:\n\n    # Example 2: n=4, a=67. The best_s is 1 (angle 45), which is closer to 67 than 90 (s=2 gives 90).\n\n    # So the triplet would be 2, 1, 2+1=3. Which is 2 1 3, which matches the sample output.\n\n    # Another example: n=4, a=68. The best_s would be 2 (angle 90), which is closer to 68 than 45. The triplet would be 2, 1, 2+2=4. So 2 1 4, which is one of the correct outputs in the note.\n\n    # So this approach works.\n\n    # Now, handle the case where multiple s have the same minimal difference. For example, if a is exactly halfway between two angles. The problem says to choose any.\n\n    # Now, implement this logic.\n\n    # Edge cases:\n    # - n=3, a=60: best_s is 1 (1*180/3 = 60), triplet is 2 1 3.\n    # - n=3, a=15: best_s is 1 (same as above), output any triplet.\n\n    # Now, code:\n\n    # Compute best_s\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_s = 1\n    for s in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (s * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_s = s\n        elif diff == best_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller s? Or any. The problem allows any.\n            pass\n\n    # Now, generate the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = v1 + best_s\n\n    # Check if v3 exceeds n? No, because best_s is at most n-2. So v1 + best_s = 2 + (n-2) = n.\n\n    # But wait, in the case where n=3, best_s is 1, v3 is 3. Which is correct.\n\n    # So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_s.\n\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
