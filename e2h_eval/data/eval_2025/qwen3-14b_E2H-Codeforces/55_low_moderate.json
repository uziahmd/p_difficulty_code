    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm. So what's the strategy here?\n\nFirst, I should think about what these swaps allow. Since 0s can be swapped with 1s, and 1s can be swapped with 2s, but not 0s with 2s directly. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like if there's a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, can they be swapped? Let me think. Suppose I have 012. Then I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 102, then swap the 1 and 2 to get 120. But that's not getting the 0 and 2 next to each other. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move 0s and 2s past 1s but not each other. Wait, but the problem says that you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. However, if there are 1s in between, maybe you can move them around?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's say I have a 0 and a 2, with some 1s in between. For example, 0 1 1 2. Can I move the 0 to the right past the 1s, and then the 2 to the left past the 1s? Well, the 0 can be moved to the right through the 1s (since 0 and 1 can be swapped). Similarly, the 2 can be moved to the left through the 1s (since 1 and 2 can be swapped). So in this case, the 0 can be moved to the right until it's next to the 2, but then can't swap with it. So the 0 and 2 would end up next to each other but not swapped. So their order remains as 0 before 2. So, perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because any 0 can only move through 1s, and any 2 can only move through 1s. So if a 0 is before a 2, then even after moving them through 1s, the 0 will still be before the 2. Because they can't cross each other. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, that's an important insight. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. The 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. Because 1s can be swapped with both 0s and 2s. So for example, if there's a 0, then some 1s, then a 2, we can arrange the 1s to be anywhere between the 0 and the 2. But the 0 and 2 can't cross each other.\n\nSo the problem reduces to arranging the 1s in such a way that they are placed optimally between the 0s and 2s, while keeping the 0s and 2s in their original relative order.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- First, collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this the \"fixed\" part.\n\n- Then, the 1s can be inserted into the gaps between these fixed elements, possibly also at the beginning and end. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the original string is 0 1 2. Then the fixed elements are 0 and 2, and the 1 can be placed between them. But since 1 can be moved past 0 and 2, but the 0 and 2 can't move. So the minimal lex string would be 0 1 2, but maybe if there are multiple 1s, they can be arranged in order.\n\nBut how do we arrange the 1s optimally?\n\nThe minimal lex string would want as many 0s as possible as early as possible, then 1s, then 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So perhaps the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s, but also grouped together where possible.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's split the original string into groups of 0s, 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Key Insight**: The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string cannot be changed. This is because '0' and '2' can only be moved through '1's, but not past each other.\n2. **Handling '1's**: Since '1's can be freely moved past '0's and '2's, they can be rearranged to optimal positions between the fixed '0's and '2's.\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string while maintaining their relative order.\n   - Collect all '1's from the input string.\n   - Insert the collected '1's into the gaps between the '0's and '2's in such a way that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    zeros_and_twos = []\n    ones = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0' or char == '2':\n            zeros_and_twos.append(char)\n        else:\n            ones.append(char)\n    \n    result = []\n    ones_ptr = 0\n    for i in range(len(zeros_and_twos)):\n        # Add as many '1's as possible before the current character\n        # but only if it's better to place them here\n        # We should add all '1's before the first '0', then between 0 and 2, etc.\n        # Wait, no, the '1's can be placed in any gaps between the fixed elements\n        # But to make it lex smallest, we should place as many '1's as possible before the 2s\n        # Because '1's are smaller than '2's, so putting them before 2s is better.\n        # However, between 0 and 2, the '1's can be placed between them.\n        # So, we can insert all the '1's at the beginning, but we need to split them between the zeros and twos.\n        \n        # Let's think: the minimal string will have all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s.\n        # But the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.

No, wait 0 is less than 1. So inserting 1s before 0s would make the string larger. So that's not good.\n        # Oh right! So the 1s should be placed after the 0s and before the 2s. Because 0 < 1 < 2.\n        # So, the optimal way is to have all the 0s first, then all the 1s, then all the 2s. However, the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.\n        # Therefore, if the zeros_and_twos list is [0, 2, 0, 2], we need to keep that order. So the 1s can be inserted between the 0 and 2, and between the 2 and 0, etc.\n        # But to make the lex smallest, we should insert the 1s between the 0 and 2, and after the last 2.\n        # For example, the string [0, 2, 0, 2] can have 1s inserted between the 0 and 2, and between the 2 and 0, and after the last 2. But to make it lex smallest, we want to put as many 1s as possible before the 2s.\n        # So, the idea is to split the zeros_and_twos into runs of 0s and 2s, and insert the 1s in between.\n        # Let's think of the zeros_and_twos as a sequence of blocks. For example, if the sequence is [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2], then the blocks are 0s, 2s, 0, 2. Between these blocks, we can insert 1s.\n        # To get the lex smallest string, we should insert the 1s between the 0s and 2s, and after the last block. But not before the first 0s.\n        # Because inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0.\n        # So the correct approach is:\n        # - Insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s, and after the last 2.\n        # - Not before the first 0.\n        \n        # So, the steps are:\n        # 1. Split the zeros_and_twos into groups of consecutive 0s and 2s. For example, [0,0,2,2,0,2] becomes [[0,0], [2,2], [0], [2]].\n        # 2. Insert the 1s between the groups, but only between a group of 0s and a group of 2s. Because inserting between two 0s or two 2s is not helpful.\n        # 3. Insert the 1s in the earliest possible position between such groups.\n        # But this seems complicated. Let's think of a simpler way.\n        \n        # Here's a better approach:\n        # We can iterate through the zeros_and_twos list and whenever we encounter a transition from 0 to 2, insert all the 1s there.\n        # Otherwise, insert the 1s after the last element.\n        \n        # So, for example:\n        # zeros_and_twos = ['0', '0', '2', '2', '0', '2']\n        # We have transitions from 0 to 2 at index 1 (between 0 and 2), and from 2 to 0 at index 3, and from 0 to 2 at index 4.\n        # We want to insert the 1s between the 0s and 2s. So, between the first 0s and the 2s, and between the 2s and 0s (but that would be between 2 and 0, which is not helpful), and between the 0 and 2 again.\n        # Wait, but inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is better than between 2 and 0, since 0 < 1 < 2.\n        # So, the first 0 to 2 transition is the best place to insert the 1s.\n        # Once we've inserted all 1s there, the rest can be placed after the last element.\n        \n        # So, the algorithm is:\n        # - Find the first occurrence of '2' in zeros_and_twos. Insert all 1s before that '2'.\n        # - Then, append the remaining elements.\n        # - If there are no '2's, then append all 1s after the zeros_and_twos.\n        # - If there are no '0's, then prepend the 1s before the first '2'.\n        \n        # Let's implement this logic.\n        \n        # Find the first index where the character is '2'\n        first_two_index = -1\n        for idx, c in enumerate(zeros_and_twos):\n            if c == '2':\n                first_two_index = idx\n                break\n        \n        # Now, if there is a '2', we can insert all 1s before that '2'\n        if first_two_index != -1:\n            # Insert the 1s before the first '2'\n            result.extend(ones)\n            # Now, add the elements up to the first '2'\n            result.extend(zeros_and_twos[:first_two_index])\n            # Then, add the '2' and the rest of the elements\n            result.append('2')\n            result.extend(zeros_and_twos[first_two_index+1:])\n        else:\n            # No '2's, so all are '0's.

Because the first_two_index may not be the only '2' and the rest of the elements may have more '2's. Also, inserting all 1s before the first '2' may not account for the fact that there might be more '0's after the first '2'.\n        # For example, if zeros_and_twos is ['0', '2', '0', '2'], then inserting all 1s before the first '2' would give us 1s followed by '0', then '2', '0', '2'. But this is not optimal, since the 1s should be between the '0' and '2' and between the '0' and '2' again.\n        # So the previous approach is flawed.\n        \n        # Another approach: we can treat the entire zeros_and_twos as a list, and insert the 1s in between the elements where possible.\n        # To achieve the lex smallest string, we can insert all 1s in the earliest possible gap between the elements of zeros_and_twos.\n        # The earliest possible gap is between the first 0 and the first 2, if such a gap exists.\n        # But how to find that?\n        \n        # Here's the correct approach:\n        # 1. The 1s can be placed in any of the gaps between the elements of zeros_and_twos, including before the first element and after the last element.\n        # 2. To minimize the lexicographical order, we want to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible gaps.\n        # 3. The earliest gaps are those before the first 0 (which is bad because it would be before 0s, which are smaller than 1), so we should avoid that.\n        # 4. The best place to put the 1s is between the 0s and 2s. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, insert the 1s there.\n        # 5.

The minimal string would be formed by:\n        # All the 0s in their original order, followed by all the 1s, followed by all the 2s in their original order.\n        # However, the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.

No, wait 0 is less than 1. So inserting 1s before 0s would make the string larger. So that's not good.\n        # Oh right! So the 1s should be placed after the 0s and before the 2s. Because 0 < 1 < 2.\n        # So, the optimal way is to have all the 0s first, then all the 1s, then all the 2s. However, the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.\n        # Therefore, if the zeros_and_twos list is [0, 2, 0, 2], we need to keep that order. So the 1s can be inserted between the 0 and 2, and between the 2 and 0, etc.\n        # But to make the lex smallest, we should insert the 1s between the 0 and 2, and after the last 2.\n        # For example, the string [0, 2, 0, 2] can have 1s inserted between the 0 and 2, and between the 2 and 0, and after the last 2. But to make it lex smallest, we want to put as many 1s as possible before the 2s.\n        # So, the idea is to split the zeros_and_twos into runs of 0s and 2s, and insert the 1s in between.\n        # Let's think of the zeros_and_twos as a sequence of blocks. For example, if the sequence is [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2], then the blocks are 0s, 2s, 0, 2. Between these blocks, we can insert 1s.\n        # To get the lex smallest string, we should insert the 1s between the 0s and 2s, and after the last block. But not before the first 0s.\n        # Because inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0.\n        # So the correct approach is:\n        # - Insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s, and after the last 2.\n        # - Not before the first 0.\n        \n        # So, the steps are:\n        # 1. Split the zeros_and_twos into groups of consecutive 0s and 2s. For example, [0,0,2,2,0,2] becomes [[0,0], [2,2], [0], [2]].\n        # 2. Insert the 1s between the groups, but only between a group of 0s and a group of 2s. Because inserting between two 0s or two 2s is not helpful.\n        # 3. Insert the 1s in the earliest possible position between such groups.\n        # But this seems complicated. Let's think of a simpler way.\n        \n        # Here's a better approach:\n        # We can iterate through the zeros_and_twos list and whenever we encounter a transition from 0 to 2, insert all the 1s there.\n        # Otherwise, insert the 1s after the last element.\n        \n        # So, for example:\n        # zeros_and_twos = ['0', '0', '2', '2', '0', '2']\n        # We have transitions from 0 to 2 at index 1 (between 0 and 2), and from 2 to 0 at index 3, and from 0 to 2 at index 4.\n        # We want to insert the 1s between the 0s and 2s. So, between the first 0s and the 2s, and between the 2s and 0s (but that would be between 2 and 0, which is not helpful), and between the 0 and 2 again.\n        # Wait, but inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is better than between 2 and 0, since 0 < 1 < 2.\n        # So, the first 0 to 2 transition is the best place to insert the 1s.\n        # Once we've inserted all 1s there, the rest can be placed after the last element.\n        \n        # So, the algorithm is:\n        # - Find the first occurrence of '2' in zeros_and_twos. Insert all 1s before that '2'.\n        # - Then, append the remaining elements.\n        # - If there are no '2's, then append all 1s after the zeros_and_twos.\n        # - If there are no '0's, then prepend the 1s before the first '2'.\n        \n        # Let's implement this logic.\n        \n        # Find the first index where the character is '2'\n        first_two_index = -1\n        for idx, c in enumerate(zeros_and_twos):\n            if c == '2':\n                first_two_index = idx\n                break\n        \n        # Now, if there is a '2', we can insert all 1s before that '2'\n        if first_two_index != -1:\n            # Insert the 1s before the first '2'\n            result.extend(ones)\n            # Now, add the elements up to the first '2'\n            result.extend(zeros_and_twos[:first_two_index])\n            # Then, add the '2' and the rest of the elements\n            result.append('2')\n            result.extend(zeros_and_twos[first_two_index+1:])\n        else:\n            # No '2's, so all are '0's. Append the 1s after.\n            result.extend(zeros_and_twos)\n            result.extend(ones)\n        \n        # Wait, this is not correct. Because the first_two_index may not be the only '2' and the rest of the elements may have more '2's. Also, inserting all 1s before the first '2' may not account for the fact that there might be more '0's after the first '2'.\n        # For example, if zeros_and_twos is ['0', '2', '0', '2'], then inserting all 1s before the first '2' would give us 1s followed by '0', then '2', '0', '2'. But this is not optimal, since the 1s should be between the '0' and '2' and between the '0' and '2' again.\n        # So the previous approach is flawed.\n        \n        # Another approach: we can treat the entire zeros_and_twos as a list, and insert the 1s in between the elements where possible.\n        # To achieve the lex smallest string, we can insert all 1s in the earliest possible gap between the elements of zeros_and_twos.\n        # The earliest possible gap is between the first 0 and the first 2, if such a gap exists.\n        # But how to find that?\n        \n        # Here's the correct approach:\n        # 1. The 1s can be placed in any of the gaps between the elements of zeros_and_twos, including before the first element and after the last element.\n        # 2. To minimize the lexicographical order, we want to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible gaps.\n        # 3. The earliest gaps are those before the first 0 (which is bad because it would be before 0s, which are smaller than 1), so we should avoid that.\n        # 4. The best place to put the 1s is between the 0s and 2s. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, insert the 1s there.\n        # 5. If there are multiple such places, we should insert all the 1s in the earliest such place.\n        \n        # So, we can iterate through the zeros_and_twos list and look for the first occurrence where a 0 is immediately followed by a 2. Insert all the 1s there.\n        # If there are no such occurrences, then insert the 1s after the last element.\n        \n        # So, let's implement this:\n        # Find the first occurrence where a 0 is followed by a 2.\n        insert_pos = -1\n        for i in range(len(zeros_and_twos) - 1):\n            if zeros_and_twos[i] == '0' and zeros_and_twos[i+1] == '2':\n                insert_pos = i + 1  # insert after the 0, before the 2\n                break\n        \n        # If such a position is found, insert all 1s there\n        if insert_pos != -1:\n            # Split the zeros_and_twos into two parts: before insert_pos and after\n            part1 = zeros_and_twos[:insert_pos]\n            part2 = zeros_and_twos[insert_pos:]\n            # Insert the 1s between part1 and part2\n            result = part1 + ones + part2\n        else:\n            # No 0 followed by 2.
