Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nCompatibility rules: two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A '?' can match any color, including another '?'. So for example, 'a' and '?' are compatible, '?' and '?' are compatible, etc.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to pair the boots optimally. Let's think of possible strategies.\n\nAn initial idea is to first pair the specific colors that match exactly. Then handle the question marks. But since '?' can be flexible, perhaps there's a way to use them optimally.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Pair as many exact matches as possible between left and right boots. For example, if a left boot is 'a', and a right boot is 'a', pair them.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently? Because there could be multiple 'a's on both sides. We need to count how many of each color there are on left and right, and pair them up. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), take min(count_l[c], count_r[c]) and add to the total. But then, the question marks can be used for the remaining ones.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to first pair the specific colors, then use the question marks to cover the remaining.\n\nBut here's a problem: suppose there are some colors that have more on one side than the other. For example, left has 3 'a's, right has 2 'a's. Then we can pair 2 of them, leaving one left 'a' and no right 'a's. Then, the left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', or a right 'a' (but there are none). So maybe the process is:\n\n- First, pair all exact matches between left and right (excluding '?').\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which may include '?'), pair them using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to right nodes that are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching. However, with n up to 150,000, that's impossible with standard algorithms like Hungarian, which are O(n^3) or worse. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nSo the key is to find a way to greedily pair the boots in a way that maximizes the count.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not ?), we can pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already used?\n\nBut maybe we can first count the frequencies of each color in left and right (excluding ?). For each color c, the number of pairs is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. But this would be the case if we pair them all. However, this approach might not be optimal because maybe some colors can be paired with ?s in a better way.\n\nWait, but perhaps not. Because once you pair exact matches, the remaining can be handled by the ?s. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have a left 'a' and a right '?'. That can be paired. But if instead, I pair the left 'a' with a right 'a', that's better. So the initial approach of pairing exact matches first is correct.\n\nSo the first step is to pair as many exact matches as possible.\n\nOnce that's done, we have some left and right boots that are unpaired. These may be:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (but their corresponding right boots were already used up).\n\n- Right boots with specific colors (same as above).\n\n- Left and/or right boots with '?'.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining boots using the '?'s. How?\n\nLet me think: the '?' can be used to pair with any other boot. So, for example, if there's a left '?', it can be paired with any right boot (specific or ?), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nLet me think of the remaining left and right boots. Let's say after the first step, we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: some number of left boots (could be specific or ?), and similarly for right_remaining.\n\nWe need to pair them. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nFor the left boots with specific colors, we can pair them with right '?'s. Similarly, for the right boots with specific colors, pair them with left '?'s. Then, the remaining '?'s can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nLet's say:\n\nAfter step 1, we have:\n\nleft_special: the count of left boots with specific colors (non-?) that are not yet paired.\n\nSimilarly, right_special: same for right.\n\nleft_q: count of left '?' not yet paired.\n\nright_q: count of right '?' not yet paired.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to track the actual positions. But for the purpose of counting, maybe we can proceed as follows.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nPair as many as possible between left_special and right_q. For example, each left_special (say color 'c') can be paired with a right_q. Similarly, each right_special can be paired with a left_q. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nAfter step 1, the number of left_special is the sum of (left_count[c] - matched) for each color c. Similarly for right_special. But perhaps it's easier to track the counts.\n\nBut perhaps I should model this as follows:\n\nLet me first collect all the left and right boots that are not yet paired.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter step 1, we have:\n\n- For left boots, some are already paired. The unpaired ones can be:\n\n   - Left boots with specific colors (non-?), but their corresponding right boots were not available.\n\n   - Left boots with '?'.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nSo, the idea is to pair the left_special with right_q, and right_special with left_q as much as possible.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose after step 1:\n\nleft_special has 3 'a's (unpaired), right_q has 2 '?', and left_q has 4 '?', right_special has 5 'b's.\n\nThen, we can pair the 3 'a's with 3 of the right_q's. Then, the right_special's 'b's can be paired with left_q's. Let's say there are 5 right_special 'b's, so we can pair 4 of them with left_q's (since left_q has 4). Then, the remaining right_special 'b's (1) can't be paired. Then, the remaining left_q (0) and right_q (2-3= -1? Wait, no. Original right_q was 2. We used 3? No, that's not possible. Oh, sorry, the left_special has 3 'a's. The right_q has 2 '?'. So we can only pair 2 of the left_special 'a's with right_q's. Then, the remaining left_special 'a's (1) can't be paired with anything else except maybe another '?', but that's already considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the order matters. So perhaps the optimal way is:\n\nPair left_special with right_q as much as possible.\n\nThen pair right_special with left_q as much as possible.\n\nThen pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet's say after step 1:\n\nleft_special = Ls (number of left boots with specific colors not yet paired)\n\nright_special = Rs (number of right boots with specific colors not yet paired)\n\nleft_q = Lq (number of left '?' not yet paired)\n\nright_q = Rq (number of right '?' not yet paired)\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs from these would be:\n\nWe can pair Ls with Rq. The number is min(Ls, Rq). Let's say we pair x = min(Ls, Rq). Then, subtract x from Ls and Rq.\n\nThen, pair Rs with Lq. The number is min(Rs, Lq). Let y = min(Rs, Lq). Subtract y from Rs and Lq.\n\nThen, the remaining Lq and Rq can be paired. The number is min(Lq, Rq). So total added is x + y + min(Lq, Rq).\n\nBut is this the optimal way? Or is there a better way?\n\nFor example, what if we first pair some of the left_q with right_special, and then pair the rest?\n\nBut the order here is important. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose Ls = 2, Rs = 2, Lq = 2, Rq = 2.\n\nIf we pair Ls with Rq: 2 pairs (so Rq becomes 0, Ls becomes 0). Then pair Rs with Lq: min(2, 2) = 2 pairs. Then, Lq and Rq are 0 and 0. Total 2+2 =4.\n\nAlternatively, if we first pair Rs with Lq: 2 pairs. Then Ls with Rq: 2 pairs. Same result.\n\nAnother example: Ls = 1, Rs = 1, Lq = 1, Rq = 1.\n\nIf we pair Ls with Rq (1 pair), then Rs with Lq (1 pair), then nothing left. Total 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we pair Ls with Rs (but they are not compatible unless same color. Wait, no. Wait, Ls is specific color, Rs is specific color. They are only compatible if they are same. But in this scenario, after step 1, the Ls and Rs are the ones that couldn't be paired in step 1. Which implies that their colors are different. Because in step 1, we paired all exact matches. So, for example, if Ls is color 'a' and Rs is color 'b', then they can't be paired. So in this case, the Ls and Rs can't be paired. Hence, the initial approach is correct.\n\nThus, the order of pairing Ls with Rq and then Rs with Lq is correct.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n1. Pair all exact matches between left and right (non-?).\n\n2. For the remaining boots, pair as follows:\n\n   a. Pair left_special (specific) with right_q (?).\n\n   b. Pair right_special (specific) with left_q (?).\n\n   c. Pair remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this efficiently, given that n can be up to 150,000.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used?\n\nAh, right. The problem requires not only the count but also the actual indices of the pairs.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFirst, process the exact matches. For each color c (not '?'), collect the indices of left and right boots. Then, pair them as much as possible. For example, for each color c, take the first min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used?\n\nWe can have two arrays, used_left and used_right, which are booleans indicating whether a boot is already used.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, this is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i].\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i].\n\n   pair as many as possible between them. For example, take the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs, mark them as used, and add to the result.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can collect all the left indices and right indices, and then pair them in any order. For example, for color c, iterate through the left and right lists and pair them one by one.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right boots are those that are not used, and have either '?' or colors that couldn't be matched.\n\nThen, process the remaining boots:\n\nCollect all left boots that are not used and have color '?', and all right boots that are not used and have color '?'.\n\nBut also, collect the left boots that are not used and have specific colors (non-?), and the same for right.\n\nSo, for the second part:\n\nWe need to:\n\n- Pair left_special (specific) with right_q.\n\n- Pair right_special (specific) with left_q.\n\n- Pair left_q with right_q.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the left_special (specific) and right_q:\n\nWe can iterate through all left boots that are not used and have specific colors. For each such left boot, try to find a right boot that is not used and is a '?'. Once found, pair them, mark as used.\n\nSimilarly for right_special and left_q.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, we need O(n) algorithms.\n\nAn alternative approach is to collect all the left_special (specific) and right_q in separate lists, then pair them as much as possible.\n\nFor example:\n\nCollect all left_special (specific) in a list left_special_list.\n\nCollect all right_q in a list right_q_list.\n\nThe number of pairs here is min(len(left_special_list), len(right_q_list)).\n\nSo for each i in 0 to min(...)-1:\n\npair left_special_list[i] with right_q_list[i].\n\nSimilarly for the other steps.\n\nSame for the right_special and left_q.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q, pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nSo, during the first step, after pairing exact matches, we can collect all the left and right boots that are not used.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nresult_pairs = []\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   collect right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   for j in range(min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))):\n\n       pair left_indices[j] and right_indices[j]\n\n       mark used_left[left_indices[j]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_indices[j]] = True\n\n       add to result_pairs\n\nOnce that's done, collect all the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, collect:\n\nleft_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, for step 2a: pair left_special with right_q.\n\nTake min(len(left_special), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nFor example, pair the first x elements of left_special with first x elements of right_q.\n\nSimilarly, step 2b: pair right_special with left_q.\n\nTake min(len(right_special), len(left_q)) pairs.\n\nThen, step 2c: pair left_q and right_q. Take min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)) pairs.\n\nBut how to track the remaining after each step?\n\nLet me think:\n\nAfter step 2a, the left_special and right_q lists are modified. So:\n\nWe can take the first min(len(left_special), len(right_q)) elements of left_special and right_q, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for step 2b.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q are those that were not used in 2a and 2b.\n\nFor example, after step 2a, the left_special list has len(left_special) - x elements, and right_q has len(right_q) - x elements.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can process them as follows:\n\nx = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in 0 to x-1:\n\n   pair left_special[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for step 2b:\n\ny = min(len(right_special), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in 0 to y-1:\n\n   pair right_special[i] with left_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q, pair them as min(len(left_q) - y, len(right_q) - x).\n\nWait, but after step 2a and 2b, the left_q and right_q lists have been modified. So perhaps the code needs to collect the lists again, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, during step 2a and 2b, we can process the lists and remove the used elements.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps it's easier to collect the lists and process them in order.\n\nBut how to collect the lists again after step 2a and 2b? That would require re-checking the used arrays, which would be O(n) time. But with n up to 1.5e5, that's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps during the processing, we can just process the lists as they are, and mark the elements as used.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the left_special and right_q lists are lists of indices that are not used yet. So, when we pair them, we can mark them as used.\n\nSo for example:\n\nleft_special is a list of indices (all not used) with specific colors.\n\nright_q is a list of indices (all not used) with '?'.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to x-1:\n\n   pair left_special[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark used_left[left_special[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\n   add to result_pairs.\n\nSimilarly for step 2b.\n\nThen, after that, the left_q and right_q lists (from before step 2a and 2b) have some elements that are not used yet. But how to get the remaining ones?\n\nWell, after step 2a and 2b, the left_q and right_q lists may have elements that are still not used. But perhaps the code can collect the remaining left_q and right_q again.\n\nBut that would be O(n) time again. However, given that this is O(n) and n is 1.5e5, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial collection of left_special, left_q, right_special, right_q, we can collect them as lists, and then process them as follows:\n\nFor step 2a:\n\nTake the first x elements of left_special and first x elements of right_q.\n\nThen, for step 2b, take the first y elements of right_special and first y elements of left_q.\n\nThen, for step 2c, take the remaining elements of left_q and right_q (after step 2a and 2b) and pair them.\n\nBut how to track the remaining elements?\n\nWait, perhaps the code can proceed as:\n\nAfter collecting left_special, left_q, right_special, right_q:\n\nx = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(x):\n\n   pair left_special[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nThen, after that, the left_special list has (len(left_special) - x) elements that are not used. But since we have already marked them as used, they are not in the original lists anymore. Wait, no. The left_special list is a list of indices that were not used before step 2a. After pairing x elements, the remaining elements in left_special are not used, but they are not part of the pairing.\n\nWait, no. The left_special list is a list of indices that are not used. When we pair the first x elements, those indices are now marked as used. The rest of the elements in left_special are still not used. However, in the code, after pairing, they are still in the list. So, for example, if left_special has 5 elements, and x is 3, then after pairing 3 elements, the remaining 2 elements are still in the list. But they are not used, so they can be considered for other pairings.\n\nBut for the next steps, perhaps we need to collect the remaining left_special (if any) and right_special (if any) again. However, since in step 2a and 2b, we have already processed the left_special and right_q, and right_special and left_q, perhaps the remaining left_special and right_special are not going to be used again. Because after step 2a, left_special is processed with right_q. After step 2b, right_special is processed with left_q. The remaining left_special and right_special are not processed further, because they can't be paired with anything else. Because their colors are specific, but the other side's q's have already been used up.\n\nSo, after step 2a and 2b, the only remaining unpaired boots are:\n\nleft_q_remaining: those left '?' that were not used in step 2a or 2b.\n\nright_q_remaining: those right '?' that were not used in step 2a or 2b.\n\nSo, for step 2c, pair them as much as possible.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCollect left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining as the lists of indices that are not used and have '?'.\n\nBut how to collect them again?\n\nWell, after step 2a and 2b, we can collect them again by iterating through all the indices, checking if they are not used and have '?'.\n\nBut that would take O(n) time. However, since this is done once, it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps during the initial collection, we can split the left_q into two parts: those used in step 2a and those not. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, after step 2a and 2b, collect the left_q and right_q again, but only those that are not used.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nAfter step 1 (exact matches), collect left_special, left_q, right_special, right_q.\n\nThen, process step 2a:\n\nx = min(len(left_special), len(right_q)).\n\nfor i in range(x):\n\n   pair left_special[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark used_left[left_special[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nAdd these pairs to the result.\n\nThen, process step 2b:\n\ny = min(len(right_special), len(left_q)).\n\nfor i in range(y):\n\n   pair right_special[i] with left_q[i]\n\n   mark used_right[right_special[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\nAdd these pairs to the result.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, pair them as much as possible:\n\nz = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\n\nfor i in range(z):\n\n   pair left_q_remaining[i] with right_q_remaining[i]\n\n   mark used_left[left_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\nAdd these to the result.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nBut the problem is that collecting left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining after steps 2a and 2b would take O(n) time. However, given that n is up to 1.5e5, and we have three such steps (step 2a, 2b, 2c), it's acceptable.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nYes, in code, we can do that.\n\nNow, the question is: how to collect the left_special, left_q, right_special, right_q after step 1.\n\nIn code, after step 1 (pairing exact matches), we can collect:\n\nleft_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nBut this is O(n) time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nresult_pairs = list()\n\n# Step 1: pair exact matches\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    for i in range(min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))):\n\n        a = left_indices[i]\n\n        b = right_indices[i]\n\n        result_pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        used_left[a] = True\n\n        used_right[b] = True\n\n# Now collect the remaining\n\nleft_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\n# Step 2a: pair left_special with right_q\n\nx = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(x):\n\n    a = left_special[i]\n\n    b = right_q[i]\n\n    result_pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n    used_left[a] = True\n\n    used_right[b] = True\n\n# Step 2b: pair right_special with left_q\n\ny = min(len(right_special), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in range(y):\n\n    a = left_q[i]\n\n    b = right_special[i]\n\n    result_pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n    used_left[a] = True\n\n    used_right[b] = True\n\n# Now collect remaining left_q and right_q\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\n# Step 2c: pair them\n\nz = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\n\nfor i in range(z):\n\n    a = left_q_remaining[i]\n\n    b = right_q_remaining[i]\n\n    result_pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n    used_left[a] = True\n\n    used_right[b] = True\n\nFinally, output the length of result_pairs, followed by the pairs.\n\nWait, but in step 2a, we are pairing left_special (specific) with right_q (which are '?'). So for each such pair, the left is specific, and the right is '?', which is compatible.\n\nSimilarly for step 2b.\n\nIn step 2c, pairing left '?' with right '?', which is compatible.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nBut let me test this approach with some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input from the problem.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', ...]\n\nBut the sample outputs are given. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nSample Output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut I'm not going to check the entire example now. Let's think of a small test case.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=1\n\nl = 'a'\n\nr = 'a'\n\nThen, step 1 will pair them. So output is 1 pair (1 1).\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1\n\nl = 'a'\n\nr = '?'\n\nStep 1: no exact matches (since r is '?'). So left_special is [0], right_q is [0]. Step 2a: pair them. So output is 1 pair (1 1).\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2\n\nl = ['a', '?']\n\nr = ['?', 'a']\n\nStep 1: for 'a', left has index 0, right has index 1. So pair them. So after step 1, used_left[0] = True, used_right[1] = True. Remaining left is index 1 (which is '?'), and right is index 0 (which is '?'). Then step 2a: left_special is empty, right_q is [0]. step 2a does nothing. step 2b: right_special is empty. step 2c: pair left_q_remaining (index 1) and right_q_remaining (index 0). So total pairs: 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2\n\nl = ['a', 'b']\n\nr = ['?', '?']\n\nStep 1: no exact matches. left_special is [0, 1], right_q is [0, 1]. step 2a: pair left_special with right_q. x = min(2, 2) = 2. So pair 0 with 0, 1 with 1. So total 2 pairs.\n\nAnother case: n=2\n\nl = ['a', 'a']\n\nr = ['?', 'b']\n\nStep 1: for 'a', left has 2, right has 0 (since r[0] is '?', r[1] is 'b'). So step 1 pairs 0. Then, left_special is [0, 1] (since they are not used yet?), no. Wait, no. In step 1, for each color c in a-z, collect left and right indices. For 'a', left_indices is [0, 1], right_indices is [i for r[i] == 'a' and not used]. Since r is ['?', 'b'], there are no right indices for 'a', so step 1 pairs 0. So after step 1, used_left is [False, False] (since no pairs were made?), no. Wait, no. Wait, step 1 is for all colors c. For example, for c='a', left_indices is [0, 1], right_indices is empty. So no pairs. For other colors, same. So step 1 produces no pairs. Then, left_special is [0, 1] (both 'a's), left_q is empty. right_special is [1] (r[1] is 'b'), right_q is [0] (r[0] is '?').\n\nStep 2a: pair left_special (size 2) with right_q (size 1). x=1. So pair left_special[0] (0) with right_q[0] (0). Mark them as used. Then, left_special has 1 element left (1). right_q is empty.\n\nStep 2b: right_special is [1], left_q is empty. So y=0. No pairs.\n\nThen, collect left_q_remaining (empty) and right_q_remaining (empty). So no more pairs. Total pairs is 1.\n\nWhich is correct. The best possible is 1 pair (either left 0 with right 0, or left 1 with right 0).\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nAnother case: n=2\n\nl = ['?', '?'], r = ['?', '?'].\n\nStep 1: no pairs. Then step 2a: left_special is empty. step 2b: right_special is empty. step 2c: pair all. So 2 pairs.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), the code must be efficient. However, the code as outlined may be O(n * 26) for step 1. Because for each of the 26 letters, we collect the left and right indices. However, for n=1.5e5, 26*O(n) is acceptable.\n\nBut in practice, for each of the 26 letters, we loop through the entire string. So for step 1, it's O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is about 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, in Python, creating lists for each character may be time-consuming. So perhaps we can optimize this.\n\nAlternative approach for step 1:\n\nInstead of looping over all 26 letters and for each, collect the left and right indices, we can pre-process for each left and right boot, and for each color, collect the indices.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is manageable.\n\nBut for code, the code would be:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    for i in range(min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))):\n\n        pair them.\n\nBut for each c, this is O(n) time. So 26*O(n) time.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for each c, building the list may be slow. So perhaps we can optimize by pre-grouping the indices for each color.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCreate for left and right, dictionaries mapping from color to list of indices.\n\nBut for the initial step, perhaps not needed. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for the initial step, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nresult = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c:\n\n            left_list.append(i)\n\n    right_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] == c:\n\n            right_list.append(i)\n\n    # Now pair as much as possible\n\n    m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        a = left_list[i]\n\n        b = right_list[i]\n\n        result.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        used_left[a] = True\n\n        used_right[b] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, loops are slower than in C++. So for n=1.5e5, perhaps this is too slow. Let me think.\n\nAlternative approach: for each color, collect all the indices once, and then during step 1, process them.\n\nBut even that would be O(n) per color.\n\nAlternatively, for each color, collect all left and right indices, and then process them.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be optimized by pre-processing for each color.\n\nBut perhaps the code is manageable.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then collect the left_special, left_q, etc.\n\nNow, for the code, after step 1, collect:\n\nleft_special = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_special and right_q.\n\nBut again, O(n) time.\n\nThen, step 2a:\n\nx = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in 0..x-1:\n\n   pair left_special[i] with right_q[i]\n\nSimilarly for step 2b.\n\nThen collect the remaining left_q and right_q, and pair them.\n\nBut again, O(n) time.\n\nNow, considering that for n=1.5e5, this is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, list comprehensions are fast, so perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut the problem is that for large n, the code may be too slow. For example, for n=1.5e5, the code would have O(26n) steps for step 1, which is 3.9e6 steps. But for Python, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in code, for step 1, perhaps we can optimize by using precomputed lists for each color.\n\nBut for the sake of time, proceed with the code as described.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read l and r.\n\nThen, used_left and used_right as lists of booleans.\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z', collect left and right indices.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows something like:\n\nInput:\n\n['1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The solution involves three main steps: pairing exact color matches first, then using indefinite colors to pair with specific colors, and finally pairing remaining indefinite colors.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Exact Color Matches**: First, we pair left boots with specific colors that match the corresponding right boots with the same specific colors.\n2. **Indefinite Color Pairing**: After handling exact matches, we use the remaining indefinite ('?') boots to pair with specific color boots that couldn't find a match.
