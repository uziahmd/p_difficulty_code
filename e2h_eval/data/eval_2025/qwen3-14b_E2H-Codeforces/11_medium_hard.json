A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nThe input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nThen, the maximum number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast takes n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nFor the lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So toasts from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nFor the salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np grams. So toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So for one toast, all 3 friends need 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, wait. Wait, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says: \"Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, why divided by 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml per friend. For one toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, they are dividing 20 by 3, which is 6. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the per toast calculation wrong. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. So in the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. The total drink is 20 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, they say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\". Wait, why 6? Because 20 / 3 is 6. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering per toast per friend. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided that they all drink the same amount. So each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, each requiring nl per toast.\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each needing one slice.\n\nSalt: each toast per friend requires np grams. So total salt needed is n * t * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nn * t * nl <= total_drink (k*l)\n\nn * t <= total_slices (c*d)\n\nn * t * np <= total_salt (p)\n\nSo solving for t in each case:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt <= (c*d)/n \n\nt <= p/(n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values, and since t must be an integer, we take the floor of each of these values and then take the minimum.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the drink calculation is (k*l) / (n * nl) = (4*5)/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would be 2 when floored. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that perhaps I have the formula wrong.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20ml. They say that it's enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. How does that fit?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem is that the sample explanation is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made, not per friend. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\".\n\nSo the 6 comes from 20 / 3 = 6. So that suggests that the total toasts possible is 6, then divided by 3 friends, giving 2 per friend. So that implies that the total toasts is t_total, and then each friend makes t_total / n toasts. But that seems conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these things. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml of drink, etc.\n\nSo total drink required is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is 20ml. Let's compute for t=2. Then total drink needed is 3 * 2 * 3 = 18 ml, which is within 20. For t=2, that's okay. If they tried t=3, then 3*3*3=27 >20. So maximum t is 2. Which is what the sample output says.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 6 total toasts. But how does that relate to per friend?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong? No, that's unlikely. Let me recheck.\n\nThe sample explanation says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the drink allowing for 6 toasts? Because 20 / 3 = 6. So that suggests that the total number of toasts is 6, and then divided by 3 friends, giving 2 per friend. But why is the total toasts calculated as 20 / 3?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So the total number of toasts possible is (total_drink) / (n * nl). Which for the first sample is 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which is 2. But according to the sample explanation, it's 20 / 3 = 6. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for a single toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is 20ml. They say that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needed 1 ml. But the sample input has nl=3. So that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the input. Let me check the first input again.\n\nFirst input line is: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the sample explanation says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. For each toast, the friends need 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222. So the maximum number of toasts possible is 2. Then the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (since n=3 friends, each toast requires one slice per friend). So 80 / 3 = 26.666. Salt is 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333. So the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which would be the answer. Which matches the sample output of 2. But according to the sample explanation, they say that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which is not matching. So why is there this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is not explaining the correct calculation. Let me check the sample explanation again.\n\nThe sample explanation says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, why divide by 3? Because maybe they are thinking that each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend has 3 ml. So for one toast, the total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. But the sample explanation is dividing 20 by 3, implying that each toast requires 3 ml total. Which would be the case if per toast, all friends together need 3 ml. Which would be impossible. So this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. But that's unlikely. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl, the total lime slices is n, and the total salt is n * np.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml. They say that it's enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be possible only if each toast requires 3 ml of drink in total. Which would be the case if nl is 1 ml per toast per friend. But in the input, nl is 3. So why is the sample explanation using 3 as the denominator?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me check the sample input again. The first input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the sample explanation says that the drink is 20ml, which is 4*5. Then they say it's enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. But according to the calculation, each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml (since n=3, nl=3). So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts. But sample explanation says 6. Which is 20/3=6. So this suggests that the sample explanation is calculating per toast per friend. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is talking about the total number of toasts that can be made, but the answer is the number of toasts per friend. So for example, if the total number of toasts is 6, then each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. Which would be the sample output.\n\nBut how is the total number of toasts calculated?\n\nIf the total number of toasts is t_total, then each friend makes t_total / n toasts. But that would require that t_total is divisible by n. But the problem says that all friends must make the same amount. So the total number of toasts is t_total = t * n, where t is the number of toasts per friend. So for example, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total is t * n.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nDrink: total_drink >= t * n * nl.\n\nLime: total_slices >= t * n.\n\nSalt: total_salt >= t * n * np.\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt <= total_drink / (n * nl)\n\nt <= total_slices / n\n\nt <= total_salt / (n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values, floored.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, they have:\n\ntotal_drink = 20.\n\ntotal_drink / (n * nl) = 20/(3 * 3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.222 → floor is 2.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink allows for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be t_total = 6. Then, t = 6 / n = 6 / 3 = 2. Which is the correct answer. So the sample explanation is calculating t_total as the minimum of (total_drink / nl, total_slices / 1, total_salt / np), then dividing by n.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. Let me re-express the constraints.\n\nIf t_total is the total number of toasts across all friends, then:\n\nEach toast requires nl ml per friend. So for t_total toasts, each friend makes t_total / n toasts. So per friend, they have t_total / n toasts. So total drink needed is n * (t_total / n) * nl = t_total * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t_total toasts, each friend has t_total / n toasts, requiring t_total / n slices. So total slices needed is n * (t_total / n) = t_total.\n\nSimilarly for salt: total salt needed is n * (t_total / n) * np = t_total * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt_total * nl ≤ total_drink → t_total ≤ total_drink / nl\n\nt_total ≤ total_slices → since total_slices is c*d.\n\nt_total * np ≤ total_salt → t_total ≤ total_salt / np.\n\nSo the maximum t_total is the minimum of (total_drink / nl, total_slices, total_salt / np). Then, the answer is t_total // n, since each friend can make t_total / n toasts. But since t_total must be such that t_total is divisible by n? Or not?\n\nNo, because t_total can be any value such that the constraints are satisfied. But since t_total must be an integer (as you can't have a fraction of a toast), and then the answer is the floor of t_total / n.\n\nWait, but this approach would give different results than the previous one. Let's see for the first sample.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20.\n\ntotal_slices = 10 *8 =80.\n\ntotal_salt =100.\n\nnl=3, np=1.\n\nSo:\n\nt_total can be at most:\n\nmin(20 / 3, 80, 100 / 1) → min(6.666..., 80, 100) → 6.666...\n\nSo t_total is 6. Then the answer is 6 / 3 = 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAh! So the correct way to model the problem is to calculate the maximum possible t_total (total toasts across all friends) as the minimum of (total_drink // nl, total_slices, total_salt // np), then divide that by n (integer division) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nWait, but why is that? Because t_total can be up to the minimum of (total_drink / nl, total_slices, total_salt / np). Because:\n\nt_total * nl ≤ total_drink → t_total ≤ total_drink / nl.\n\nt_total ≤ total_slices.\n\nt_total * np ≤ total_salt → t_total ≤ total_salt / np.\n\nSo the maximum t_total is the minimum of those three values. However, since t_total must be an integer, we take the floor of each of those three values and then take the minimum.\n\nWait, but in this case, for the first sample, total_drink / nl is 20 / 3 = 6.666..., which would be floored to 6. total_slices is 80, which is 80. total_salt / np is 100 / 1 = 100. So the minimum is 6. So t_total is 6, then divided by n (3) gives 2, which is the correct answer.\n\nBut earlier approach was to compute for t (per friend) as min( (total_drink / (n * nl)), (total_slices / n ), (total_salt / (n * np )) ), which for the first sample would be min(20/(3*3)=2.222, 80/3=26.666, 100/(3*1)=33.333) → min is 2.222 → floor to 2, which is the same answer.\n\nSo both approaches give the same result. So which is the correct way to model it?\n\nLet me check with another example.\n\nSuppose n=2, total_drink is 5, nl=2. So per the first approach, t_total = min(5/2=2.5, ... others ...) → 2. Then per friend is 2 / 2 = 1.\n\nIn the second approach, t per friend is min( (5) / (2*2) ) = 5/(4) = 1.25 → floor 1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: n=2, total_drink=7, nl=3. So total_drink / nl is 7/3=2.333, which would give t_total=2, per friend is 1. In the other approach: (7) / (2 * 3) = 7/6 = 1.166 → floor 1. Same result.\n\nSo both approaches are equivalent. Because:\n\nt_total = min( total_drink // nl, total_slices, total_salt // np )\n\nthen per friend is t_total // n.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nper_friend = min( (total_drink // nl) // n, (total_slices) // n, (total_salt // np) // n )\n\nBut since (total_drink // nl) // n is equal to floor( (total_drink / nl) / n ), which is the same as floor( total_drink/(nl *n) ), which is the same as the first approach.\n\nSo in code, both approaches are equivalent.\n\nBut why does the sample explanation use the first approach?\n\nBecause in the sample explanation, they computed the total toasts as min(20/3, 80, 100) = 6. Then divided by 3 friends to get 2.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_slices = c * d.\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\nThen:\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntoast_lime = total_slices \n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // np\n\nt_total = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nanswer = t_total // n\n\nBut wait, in the first sample:\n\ntoast_drink = 20//3 = 6.\n\ntoast_lime = 80.\n\ntoast_salt = 100//1=100.\n\nt_total = 6.\n\nanswer = 6//3 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's take the second input in the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100 *10=1000.\n\nnl=4.\n\nso toast_drink = 1000 //4 = 250.\n\ntotal_slices is c*d = 1 *19 =19.\n\ntoast_lime is 19.\n\ntotal_salt is 90, np=3 → 90//3=30.\n\nt_total = min(250, 19, 30) → 19. answer is 19//5 = 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1e6.\n\nnl=50 → toast_drink = 1e6 //50 = 20000.\n\ntotal_slices = 25 *23 = 575 → toast_lime = 575.\n\ntotal_salt = 1 // 1 =1.\n\nt_total = min(20000, 575, 1) → 1. answer is 1//10=0. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, this approach works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_slices = c * d.\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\nCompute:\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntoast_lime = total_slices \n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // np\n\nt_total = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nanswer = t_total // n\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nSo the code should read the input numbers, compute these values, then output the answer.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nFor example, the first input line is split into ['3', '4', '5', '10', '8', '100', '3', '1'].\n\nSo the variables are:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntoast_lime = total_slices \n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // np\n\nt_total = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nanswer = t_total // n\n\nprint(answer)\n\nWait, but what if the division is not integer? Like, for example, if total_drink is 20, nl is 3. Then 20//3 is 6, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code would handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the first sample:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → n=3.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20 → 20//3=6.\n\ntotal_slices = 10*8=80 → 80.\n\ntotal_salt = 100//1=100.\n\nt_total = min(6, 80, 100) → 6.\n\nanswer 6//3=2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → n=5.\n\ntotal_drink = 100 *10 =1000. nl=4 → 1000//4=250.\n\ntotal_slices = 1 *19 =19.\n\ntotal_salt = 90 //3 =30.\n\nt_total = min(250,19,30) → 19. 19//5=3 → correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → n=10.\n\ntotal_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. nl=50 → 1e6//50 = 20000.\n\ntotal_slices =25 *23=575.\n\ntotal_salt =1//1=1.\n\nt_total = min(20000, 575, 1) → 1. 1//10=0 → correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where one of the resources is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, all numbers are positive integers. So no need to handle zero.\n\nAnother case: when t_total is exactly divisible by n. For example, n=2, t_total=4 → answer is 2.\n\nAnother case: t_total is 5, n=2 → 5//2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into variables, compute the values as above, and print the answer.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. The input is a single line.\n\nSo:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntoast_lime = total_slices \n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // np\n\nt_total = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nanswer = t_total // n\n\nprint(answer)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nFor the first sample input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nAs discussed, output is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\noutput is 3.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'] → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Calculate the total available resources:\n   - Total drink available is the product of the number of bottles and the volume per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices available is the product of the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - Total salt available is given directly.\n\n2. **Determine Toast Limits**:\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the drink, considering the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the lime slices, considering each toast needs a slice per friend.\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the salt, considering the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts possible is determined by the minimum of the three calculated values from the resources.\n\n4. **Compute Toasts Per Friend**: Divide the total possible toasts by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // nl\ntoast_lime = total_slices\ntoast_salt = total_salt // np\n\nt_total = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\nanswer = t_total // n\nprint(answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total drink volume is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle. Similarly, the total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n- **Toast Limits**: For each resource, we compute how many total toasts can be made. This involves dividing the total available resource by the amount required per toast for all friends.\n- **Limiting Factor**: The minimum value among the three computed toast limits determines the maximum total number of toasts that can be made without exceeding any resource.\n- **Toasts Per Friend**: Finally, the total number of toasts is divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts, using integer division to handle any remainder correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by focusing on the limiting resource and ensuring equitable distribution among all friends.",
