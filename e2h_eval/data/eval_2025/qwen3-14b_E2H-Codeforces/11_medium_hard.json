A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources they have.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Or wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for all friends, total drink needed is n * t * nl. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each requiring nl ml. Similarly, total lime slices needed is n * t (each toast per friend needs a slice). And total salt needed is n * t * np.\n\nBut the resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts t that can be made is the minimum of:\n\n- (total drink) / (n * nl) → floor division?\n\n- (total lime slices) / (n) → since each toast requires n slices (because each of the n friends needs one slice per toast)\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses one slice. So for t toasts, each friend uses t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. So the total available slices is c*d. So the maximum t allowed by lime slices is (c*d) // (n) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me compute for t: the total slices required is n * t. Because each toast requires n slices (each of the n friends has one slice per toast). So for example, if there are 3 friends and 2 toasts, each friend has 2 toasts, so total slices needed is 3 * 2 = 6. So the maximum t for the lime slices is (c*d) divided by n, floor division. Because if c*d is 80, and n is 3, then 80//3 is 26, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, in the first example, the input was 3 friends, c=10 limes, d=8 slices per lime. So total slices is 10*8=80. Then for t toasts, total slices needed is 3*t. So maximum t is 80//3 = 26. But in the first sample, the answer was 2. Oh, because the other constraints were lower.\n\nWait in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So for t toasts, total drink is 3 * 3 * t = 9t. Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So for the first sample:\n\nTotal drink available is 4*5 = 20. So maximum t is 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222..., which floor to 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: total available is 10*8=80. For t toasts, required is 3*t. So 80 / 3 = 26.666... so floor to 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how? Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20 ml of drink, which is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why 6? Because 3 friends, each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says 20 /3 = 6. Oh wait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nthe drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why? Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nAh, maybe I got the per toast requirements wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So for the first sample, the drink is 4*5=20. The total required for t toasts is t * 3 * 3 = 9t. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222. So 2.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait that suggests that the total drink is divided by nl per toast. But that would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but perhaps the note is considering per friend?\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why 20 / 3? That would be if each toast requires 3 ml per friend. But for 3 friends, that would be 3 * 3 = 9 ml per toast. So 20 / 9 = 2.222. So the note seems to be saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nAh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the per toast requirement is that each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the total for each toast is nl ml per friend. So for one toast, each friend has one toast. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. But the note says that 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that each toast requires 3 ml of drink in total. Which would be if per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but per toast, the total is nl ml. Which would be impossible unless n=1.\n\nWait this is conflicting. Let me read the note again.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? Because 20 / 3 = 6. So that suggests that for each toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But the problem says that each friend needs nl=3 ml per toast. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for three friends, each toast would require 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How does that make sense?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the total number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they have t toasts, each needing nl ml. So per friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. So the total drink available is k*l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, k*l is 4*5=20. n * nl is 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 is 2. So that's 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the denominator is 3, not 9. So why is that?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the note again. The note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. But how?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But the note says that the total drink is 20, which is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So that implies that each toast requires 3 ml of drink in total, not per friend. Which would be the case if nl is per toast, not per friend. But the problem statement says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So that's per friend per toast.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How can the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement. Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend has one toast, which requires nl ml. So for one toast, each friend has one toast, so the total drink per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the first sample, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that the total drink is divided by nl. So that would be (k*l) / nl. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, which is 6. But that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. But for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. So for the total drink, k*l >= n * t * nl. So t <= (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nBut according to the note, they have 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be (k*l) / nl = 20 /3 = 6.666. So that would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl, not by (n * nl). Which would imply that the problem statement is different than what I thought. \n\nSo what's the correct way to model this? Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\nSo each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nYes. So the note's explanation must have a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the note.\n\nWait in the note, the sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3 friends. Each toast requires per friend 3 ml of drink. So for t toasts, each friend has t toasts, so total drink per friend is 3t ml. Total for all friends is 3 * 3t = 9t. The total drink available is 4*5=20. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222 → 2. Which is the correct answer. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. That seems wrong. Unless the note is explaining something else. Wait the note says:\n\n\"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, so the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but then divides by 3 to get 2. Which would be the correct answer. So why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? Because 20 /3 is 6.666. So that suggests that the drink is being divided by 3 (nl) to get the number of toasts. But why?\n\nAh! Maybe the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, the total drink is nl ml. Which would be the case if there's only one friend. But with n friends, the total drink per toast is n * nl. But the note seems to think that the drink is sufficient for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be the case if each toast requires 3 ml of drink in total. Which would be the case if each toast is for one friend. But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's recheck the problem statement once again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be (k*l) / nl = 20 /3 =6.666. Which would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl, which would be the total number of toasts per friend. But that would be if the total drink is n * t * nl = k*l → t = (k*l) / (n * nl). So in the first sample, that would be 20/(3*3)= 20/9 = 2.222. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which is 20/3=6.666. So the note is treating the total drink as being divided by nl, not by n * nl. Which would imply that the problem statement is different than I thought. \n\nWhat's the correct approach here? Let me look at the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → Output is 2.\n\nAccording to the note, the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts. Then, the limes for 80 toasts, salt for 100. Then min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. Which is the answer.\n\nSo according to the note, the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts. How is that calculated?\n\nThe note says that 20 /3 =6. Which would be (k*l)/nl. So in that case, the number of toasts is (k*l) / nl. But why?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts across all friends. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is n * t. But that's not the case. Because each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t per friend, but the total number of toasts across all friends is n * t. But that's not the case. For example, if there are 3 friends, each making 2 toasts, that's 2 toasts per friend, not 3*2 =6 toasts. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the note is considering that each toast is for all friends. Like, one toast is made by all friends together. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. Each friend makes t toasts. Each toast requires for that friend: nl ml, a slice, and np grams. So for each friend, t toasts require:\n\nDrink: t * nl ml.\n\nLime slices: t slices.\n\nSalt: t * np grams.\n\nSo for all friends, the total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nTotal lime slices: n * t.\n\nTotal salt: n * t * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ total_drink (k*l)\n\nn * t ≤ total_lime_slices (c*d)\n\nn * t * np ≤ total_salt (p)\n\nSo t must be the minimum of:\n\n(total_drink) // (n * nl), \n\n(total_lime_slices) // (n), \n\n(total_salt) // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. \n\nn * nl = 3 *3=9. So 20//9 = 2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10*8=80. n is 3. 80//3 = 26.\n\ntotal_salt = 100. n * np = 3 *1=3. 100//3=33.\n\nSo min(2,26,33) is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the note's explanation is wrong? Or perhaps the note is considering something else.\n\nBut according to the note, they have 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be if the drink constraint was (k*l) / nl = 20/3 =6.666. Which would be the case if the drink is divided by nl, not by n*nl. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is considering that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires for all friends. For example, each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, total drink is nl * n. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut in the first sample, 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222. So the maximum t is 2. Which is correct. So the note's explanation must be wrong? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the note.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the total number of toasts per friend. For example, if each friend can make 6 toasts, but since there are 3 friends, the total toasts is 6*3 = 18. But that doesn't fit into the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So where is the error here?\n\nLet me look back at the note's explanation:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total number of toasts is t, and each toast is per friend. So for example, if each friend can make t toasts, then the total drink needed is t * nl per friend. So for all friends, it's n * t * nl. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl to get the number of toasts per friend. Which would be t = (k*l) / (n * nl) ?\n\nNo. Wait, if t is the number of toasts per friend, then total drink is n * t * nl. So solving for t: t = (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, that's 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 ≈2.222 → 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if t = (k*l) / nl. Which would be 20/3 =6.666. Which would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl, and that gives the total number of toasts across all friends. But that would be incorrect.\n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that the 6 is the total number of toasts across all friends. So dividing by 3 gives the per-friend number. \n\nSo that would mean that the drink calculation is (k*l) / nl = total toasts across all friends. Then, divide by n to get per-friend toasts.\n\nBut that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but for each toast, only one friend is making it. Which is not the case.\n\nBut according to this approach, for the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = (k*l) / nl = 20/3 =6.666 → 6.\n\ntotal_lime_toasts = c*d / 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend, but for one toast per friend, total slices is n * t. So for total toasts across all friends, t_total, we need slices = t_total * 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend?), no, this is getting very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is considering that for each toast, all friends take part. So for one toast, each friend takes one toast, and thus the total drink required is nl per friend. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So the total number of toasts possible is (k*l) / (n * nl). Which would be 20/(3*3) = 2.222, which is 2. So the note's explanation is wrong. But why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the note's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the note's wording. For example, perhaps the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts per friend, but that would be 6 toasts per friend. But that would require 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 ml of drink, which is more than 20. So that's not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think that the correct way to proceed is to follow the logic that the maximum number of toasts per friend is the minimum of:\n\n- (total_drink) // (n * nl)\n\n- (total_lime_slices) // (n)\n\n- (total_salt) // (n * np)\n\nBecause that's the logical way to model it. And that would give the correct answer for the first sample.\n\nIn the first sample, that gives min(2, 26, 33) = 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the note's explanation is probably incorrect, or perhaps the note is using a different way of thinking. For example, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, which may be the total number of toasts across all friends. Then, dividing by 3 gives 2 per friend.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nIf the total number of toasts across all friends is T, then each friend makes T/n toasts. But that would require that T is divisible by n. But the problem says that all friends must make the same number of toasts, so T must be a multiple of n. \n\nBut according to the model above, the maximum T is the minimum between:\n\ntotal_drink / (nl) → since T * nl = total_drink → T = total_drink / nl ?\n\nNo, because T is the total number of toasts across all friends. Each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for T toasts, each friend makes T /n toasts. So total drink is (T /n ) * nl * n = T * nl. So yes, T = total_drink / nl. \n\nBut also, the total number of lime slices required is T * 1 (each toast requires one slice per friend, but for T toasts across all friends, each toast is for one friend. So for T toasts, each toast requires one slice. So total slices is T. \n\nWait, this is a different approach. So in this scenario, each toast is made by one friend. So for example, if there are 3 friends, and T toasts in total, then each friend makes T /3 toasts. \n\nBut how does that fit with the problem statement?\n\nThe problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So each friend makes the same number of toasts, say t. So total toasts is n * t. \n\nSo in this scenario:\n\nTotal drink required is n * t * nl.\n\nTotal lime slices required is n * t (each toast requires one slice per friend, so for n*t toasts, each toast requires one slice → n*t slices? Or for each toast, one slice per friend? Or per toast, one slice per friend. So for one toast, each friend has one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts per friend, total is n * t * n slices? No, that can't be right.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to model it again.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for each toast that a friend makes, they need a slice. So if each friend makes t toasts, then each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. \n\nSo the total number of slices available is c*d. So n*t ≤ c*d → t ≤ (c*d)/n.\n\nSimilarly, for the drink: each friend makes t toasts, each requiring nl ml. So per friend, t * nl ml. Total is n * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nFor salt: each friend makes t toasts, each requiring np grams. So per friend, t * np. Total is n * t * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nThus, the correct value of t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nk*l =20, n=3, nl=3 → 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → floor to 2.\n\nc*d=10*8=80, n=3 → 80/3=26.666 → 26.\n\np=100, n=3, np=1 → 100/(3*1)=33.333 →33.\n\nMinimum is 2 → correct.\n\nSo why does the note say that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts? Because according to this model, the drink allows for 20/(3*3) = 2.222 toasts per friend. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts per friend? No, that would be impossible. \n\nAlternatively, the note is considering that the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts in total. Which would be t_total = 6. Then, since there are 3 friends, each makes 2 toasts. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo in that case, the drink allows for t_total = (k*l) / nl = 20 /3 = 6.666 → 6. \n\nBut how does that relate to the per-friend t? Well, t_total = n * t → t = t_total /n.\n\nSo in this case, t_total is the minimum between:\n\n(k*l)/nl → 20/3 =6.666 →6\n\n(c*d) / 1 → 80/1=80\n\np / np → 100/1=100.\n\nThen, t_total is min(6, 80, 100) =6. Then t is 6 /3 = 2 → which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach would also work. So the question is: which of these models is correct?\n\nIn this case, the two approaches are equivalent. Because:\n\nt_total = min( (k*l)/nl, (c*d)/1, p / np )\n\nt = t_total // n.\n\nBut in this model, the constraints are:\n\nFor drink: t_total * nl = n * t * nl → t_total = n * t.\n\nSo substituting into the drink constraint:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l)/(n * nl) → which is the same as t_total = n * t ≤ (k*l)/nl → t_total ≤ (k*l)/nl.\n\nSo the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nSo in the first sample, the first approach gives t = min(2, 26, 33) =2.\n\nThe second approach gives t_total = min(6, 80, 100) =6 → t=6/3=2. Same result.\n\nSo both approaches are correct. The difference is in how you calculate the constraints.\n\nSo which approach should I use in code?\n\nWell, the second approach may be easier to code. Because for the drink, it's (k*l) // nl → then divided by n. But wait, no. Because the first approach is:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c*d) // n \n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nthen t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nt_total_drink = (k*l) // nl \n\nt_total_lime = (c*d) // 1 \n\nt_total_salt = p // np \n\nthen t_total = min(t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt)\n\nt = t_total // n \n\nBut which one is correct?\n\nLet me take an example where (k*l) is exactly divisible by nl, but not by n * nl.\n\nFor example, suppose n=2, nl=3, k*l=6. So t_drink in first approach is 6/(2*3) = 1. \n\nIn the second approach, t_total_drink is 6/3=2. t_total = min(2, ...), then t = 2//2=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: n=2, nl=3, k*l=7. \n\nFirst approach: t_drink = 7/(2*3) = 7/6 = 1.166 → floor to 1.\n\nSecond approach: t_total_drink = 7//3 = 2. t_total = min(2, ...) → t = 2//2 =1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: n=2, nl=3, k*l=9. \n\nFirst approach: 9/(2*3) = 1.5 → 1.\n\nSecond approach: t_total_drink =9//3=3 → t=3//2=1. Same.\n\nSo both approaches give the same result. Therefore, the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nSo in code, which way is better? It depends on which is easier to compute.\n\nSo for the code, I can calculate each of the three constraints as follows:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nsalt_total = p \n\nt_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = lime_total // n \n\nt_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nOr alternatively:\n\nt_total_drink = (k*l) // nl \n\nt_total_lime = (c*d) // 1 \n\nt_total_salt = p // np \n\nt_total = min(t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt)\n\nresult = t_total // n \n\nWhich is better? Both are same.\n\nBut for example, if the numbers are large, perhaps there's a difference due to integer division. But since both approaches are mathematically equivalent, they will yield the same result.\n\nSo in code, either approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, looking back at the note's explanation, it uses the second approach. For example, the first sample's drink_total is 20, nl=3. 20//3=6. Then, divided by n=3 gives 2.\n\nSo the note's explanation is using the second approach.\n\nSo, for code, perhaps it's easier to compute the three t_total values, then divide by n.\n\nBut in code, we need to be careful with integer division. Let me think.\n\nLet me take the first approach:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nBut if (k*l) is not divisible by n * nl, then floor division is done.\n\nSame for others.\n\nIn the second approach:\n\nt_total_drink = (k*l) // nl \n\nt_total_lime = (c*d) // 1 \n\nt_total_salt = p // np \n\nt_total = min(t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt)\n\nresult = t_total // n \n\nWhich is also correct.\n\nSo for code, which approach is better? Let's see.\n\nFor example, if n=3, k*l=20, nl=3 → t_total_drink is 20//3=6. t_total = min(6, 80, 100) → 6. Then 6//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo in code, the second approach may be easier to implement, but need to make sure that the divisions are done properly.\n\nSo, the steps for code:\n\nRead the input values: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l \n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nt_total_drink = total_drink // nl \n\nt_total_lime = total_lime_slices // 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend, but for t_total toasts, the total slices needed is t_total. Because each toast is one per friend? Or no?)\n\nWait, in the second approach, t_total is the total number of toasts across all friends. For example, each toast is for one friend. So for t_total toasts, each toast requires one slice. So total slices needed is t_total. So the constraint is t_total <= c*d → t_total_lime = c*d.\n\nSo in that case, t_total_lime = c*d.\n\nSimilarly, for the salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So for t_total toasts (each for one friend), the total salt is t_total * np. So the constraint is t_total * np <= p → t_total <= p // np.\n\nSo in code:\n\nt_total_drink = (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drinks, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. We need to calculate how many toasts can be made with the available resources considering all friends.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Convert the total available resources into their usable forms:\n   - Total drink available: `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices available: `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available: `p` grams.\n3. **Determine Toast Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Calculate how many total toasts can be made with the available drink by dividing the total drink by the drink required per toast (per friend).\n   - **Lime Limit**: Calculate how many total toasts can be made with the available lime slices by dividing the total lime slices by 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt Limit**: Calculate how many total toasts can be made with the available salt by dividing the total salt by the salt required per toast (per friend).\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts per Friend**: The minimum of the three calculated limits (drink, lime, salt) gives the total number of toasts that can be made across all friends. Divide this by the number of friends to get the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into individual integers\n    values = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = values\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum possible total toasts for each resource\n    t_total_drink = total_drink // nl\n    t_total_lime = total_lime_slices\n    t_total_salt = total_salt // np\n    \n    # Find the minimum of the three\n    t_total = min(t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt)\n    \n    # Each friend can make t_total // n toasts\n    print(t_total // n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the problem parameters.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total available resources (drink, lime slices, salt) are computed based on the given inputs.\n- **Toast Limits**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts that can be made is calculated. This is done by dividing the total available resource by the resource required per toast (considering all friends).\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum of the three calculated limits gives the total number of toasts that can be made across all friends. Dividing this by the number of friends gives the number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring everyone makes the same number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using basic arithmetic operations and ensures that all constraints are respected.",
