For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset must satisfy that for every binary string s (of length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. And the multiset is of exactly n-length strings.\n\nThe key here is to find the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for each possible assignment of c_s values, we need to check if the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. Then count all such assignments.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. For a given set of c_s values, what is the maximum number of strings that can be in a beautiful multiset?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to model constraints on prefixes. Each time we add a string to the multiset, it contributes to all its prefixes. For example, adding \"01\" would count towards the prefixes \"0\" and \"01\".\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s values. To maximize the size, we need to select as many strings as possible without violating any of the constraints.\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where each node (binary string) has a capacity constraint, and the selection of strings must not exceed these capacities for all their prefixes. The maximum number of strings would be determined by some kind of flow or greedy approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem that can be modeled using a trie structure. Each binary string of length up to n can be thought of as nodes in a trie, where each node represents a prefix. The root is the empty string (but maybe not considered here since the strings start from length 1). Each node has two children: 0 and 1.\n\nFor the maximum beautiful multiset, the constraints are that for each node (prefix s), the number of strings in the multiset that pass through s (i.e., have s as a prefix) is at most c_s.\n\nBut since each string of length n contributes to all its prefixes (from length 1 up to n), the problem becomes selecting as many strings as possible such that for each node s (prefix), the count of selected strings passing through s does not exceed c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of such a multiset is then the minimum over all possible constraints. But how to compute this?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum of the capacities along certain paths. Alternatively, think of it as a problem of choosing the capacities c_s such that the maximum number of strings that can be selected is f.\n\nBut how to model the maximum possible size given the c_s's?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a trie structure. For each node (prefix), the number of strings in the multiset that have this prefix is limited by c_s. However, when you add a string, it contributes to all its prefixes. Therefore, the constraints form a hierarchy.\n\nThis problem resembles the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes in a tree where each node has a capacity, and each selected leaf node (the full-length strings) contributes to all its ancestors. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected without exceeding any ancestor's capacity.\n\nIn such a scenario, the maximum number of strings would be determined by the minimum capacity along the path from the root to each leaf. Wait, no. Because each leaf contributes +1 to all its ancestors. So, for example, if a leaf is selected, then each of its ancestors' counts increases by 1. Therefore, the total number of leaves that can be selected is constrained by the capacities of all their ancestors.\n\nThis seems like a problem where the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (the capacity of that node divided by the number of leaves that pass through it). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem. Each node (prefix) can have a certain capacity. The selection of a leaf (string) consumes one unit from each of its ancestors. So the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the maximum flow that can be routed through the trie, with each leaf having a demand of 1, and each node having a capacity of c_s.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum? It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves that can be chosen such that for each node, the number of leaves passing through it does not exceed c_s. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves such that for every node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Because each node's subtree includes all leaves that have that node as a prefix. So, for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree (i.e., the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of leaves (strings of length n) such that for every node (prefix s), the number of selected leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. And we want the maximum size of such a subset.\n\nNow, the maximum size of such a subset is determined by the constraints. How can we compute this maximum?\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected is equal to the minimum value of (c_s) over all nodes s, multiplied by something? No, perhaps not directly.\n\nWait, for example, consider the root node (the empty string?), but in our case, the root is not considered since the strings are of length from 1 to n. Let's think of the trie as all prefixes of length 1 to n. Each node corresponds to a prefix of some length. The root could be considered as the empty string, but since all the strings are of length ≥1, the root's subtree is all the leaves.\n\nBut for our problem, the root (empty string) is not part of the input. The constraints for each prefix s of length 1 to n. However, the root (if considered) would have a capacity that's not given here. Wait, no. The problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have c_s. So the root (empty string) isn't part of the constraints. But the problem says that the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. So each string in the multiset is a leaf in the trie (depth n).\n\nSo, the constraints for all prefixes of the leaves. For example, if a leaf is \"01\", then the prefixes are \"0\", \"01\". The constraints for these prefixes must be satisfied.\n\nThe problem of selecting the maximum number of leaves under the constraints that for each node (prefix), the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. How to compute this maximum?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves given that each node can have at most c_s leaves in its subtree. The solution is to take for each node the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints. For each node, the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. But since each leaf is in the subtree of all its prefixes, the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming on the trie. Let me think of the trie as a tree where each node has two children (0 and 1), and the depth ranges from 1 to n. The root is the empty string (but perhaps not considered here). Each node at depth d (from 1 to n) has two children at depth d+1 (unless d = n).\n\nTo find the maximum number of leaves that can be selected, the constraints are that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe way to maximize the number of leaves is to assign to each node the minimum of its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, that's the idea behind the problem of maximum matching with constraints. For example, suppose that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. Then, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum between the capacities of the root (which would be the sum of the capacities of its children, but since the root isn't considered here?), but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For a node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is min(c_s, sum of the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in each child's subtree). Wait, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, for example, if a node has two children. Each child can contribute up to their own capacities. But the node's capacity is c_s. So the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the max leaves from each child. Because each leaf in the subtree of s must pass through s, so the total number can't exceed c_s. However, the children's capacities may limit the sum.\n\nSo, for example, if a node s has capacity 5, and each of its two children can contribute up to 3 and 4, respectively, then the maximum number of leaves under s is min(5, 3+4) = 5. But if the children can contribute 6 and 7, then the maximum is 5, because the parent's capacity is 5.\n\nThis recursive approach seems correct. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves (the size of the beautiful multiset) is determined by this recursive formula. So for the root (depth 1?), the maximum is min(c_root, sum of children's max leaves). Wait, but the root here would be the nodes of depth 1. Wait, perhaps the entire trie is built with nodes of depth 1 to n. The leaves are at depth n.\n\nSo, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is computed as follows:\n\nFor each node s (starting from the deepest level and moving up), the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max). For leaves (nodes at depth n), their left and right children don't exist, so their max is 0? Or wait, for a node at depth n, it's a leaf in the trie. Its subtree consists of only itself. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (if we include it), but the capacity is c_s. So for a node at depth n, the max number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, 1). Because including this node contributes 1 to the count.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the multiset is made of strings of length exactly n. So each node at depth n can be included in the multiset once. But the constraints for each prefix require that the number of times that prefix is a prefix of the multiset elements is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, for a node s at depth n (a leaf), the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is exactly the number of times s is present in the multiset. Since each element is exactly s, the count is the number of times s appears in the multiset. But since the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string (as it's a multiset), but the problem says that for each s, the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. However, in the problem statement, the user chooses c_s for each s, and then the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined.\n\nBut in the problem, the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string. However, in the example given, the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} includes two copies of 01. So the count for the prefix '01' is 2, which must be ≤ c_{01}.\n\nBut for the maximum possible size of the multiset, perhaps the optimal way is to take as many copies as allowed by the constraints. However, since the problem allows multiple copies of the same string, but each copy adds to the counts of all prefixes.\n\nBut this complicates things. However, the problem statement says that the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is exactly f. So how do we model this?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the multiset is of binary strings of length exactly n. So each element is a string of length n. So for a given set of c_s values, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is the maximum number of elements (possibly with duplicates) that can be added such that for every prefix s, the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum size?\n\nLet me think of each element as contributing +1 to all its prefixes. So, for example, adding a string s (of length n) contributes +1 to each of its prefixes (from length 1 to n). Therefore, the problem becomes: select a multiset of strings (each of length n) such that for each prefix s, the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. We want to maximize the size of this multiset.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of elements (possibly with duplicates) that can be added, such that for every prefix s, the number of elements whose prefix is s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to model this maximum?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with linear programming, but since we are dealing with integers, perhaps there's a way to compute it greedily.\n\nAnother approach: For each node (prefix) s, the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of elements in the multiset that are in the subtree of s. For example, the subtree of s includes all strings that start with s. So for the maximum number of elements, the constraints are that for each node s, the number of elements in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to maximize the total number of elements (which is the number of elements in the root's subtree, which is all elements, since all elements are in the root's subtree). However, the root here is the empty string, which is not considered. Wait, the root of the trie would be the empty string, but the constraints for the problem are for prefixes of length 1 to n.\n\nWait, the constraints are for all prefixes s of length 1 to n. So, for example, the root's children are the prefixes of length 1. So the entire trie is built with nodes of depth from 1 to n.\n\nSo, for the entire trie, the root (depth 0) is not considered. The root's children are the prefixes of length 1. Each node at depth d has two children at depth d+1 (if d <n).\n\nSo, for the maximum number of elements, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of elements (each being a string of length n) such that for each node s (prefix of length 1 to n), the number of elements in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute this maximum number.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow problem. Each node s has a capacity c_s. Each element (leaf) contributes 1 to all its ancestors. So, the problem is to select as many leaves as possible such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected, given that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming on the trie. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in each of its children's subtrees. Wait, but for a node s at depth d (d <n), it has two children. The maximum number of leaves in s's subtree is the sum of the leaves in the children's subtrees, but cannot exceed c_s. But since each leaf in the children's subtree is also in the subtree of s, the sum of the children's max leaves can't exceed c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves for s's subtree is min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max).\n\nFor a node at depth n (a leaf), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, 1). Because the subtree of a leaf is just itself. So you can take either 0 or 1 elements (since adding the element contributes 1 to its count, which must be ≤ c_s). But since we want maximum, it's min(c_s, 1). However, if c_s is ≥1, then you can take 1. If c_s is 0, then you can't take anything.\n\nBut this approach would give us the maximum number of elements possible for the multiset, given the c_s values. Therefore, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the value computed by this DP approach on the trie, starting from the leaves and working upwards.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: for a given set of c_s values, compute this DP value, which is the maximum possible size. Our task is to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k inclusive) such that this DP value equals exactly f.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments of c_s (for all prefixes s of length 1 to n) such that the DP value computed as described is exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this count efficiently.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of prefixes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is about 65k. That's manageable for some dynamic programming approaches, but perhaps not for all possibilities.\n\nBut how can we model the DP for the trie and compute the number of assignments that result in the DP value being exactly f?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the DP value depends on the c_s of that node and the DP values of its children. Therefore, the overall DP value is determined by the choices of c_s for all nodes.\n\nBut since the DP is computed bottom-up, perhaps we can model this as a tree and use memoization or dynamic programming based on the structure of the trie.\n\nBut the problem requires considering all possible assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) and counting those that result in the overall DP value being exactly f.\n\nThis seems computationally heavy, but perhaps we can find a way to model this with dynamic programming, considering the structure of the trie.\n\nLet me think about the trie as a tree. Each node has two children (except for leaves). The DP value for a node is min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp), where left_dp and right_dp are the DP values of the children.\n\nBut for leaves (depth n), the DP value is min(c_s, 1).\n\nBut how can we model the number of ways to assign c_s values to all nodes such that the DP value of the root (the top-level nodes?) is exactly f.\n\nWait, the root of the trie here is not a single node but the nodes of depth 1. Because the trie starts with nodes of depth 1. For example, for n=2, the trie has nodes of depth 1 (two nodes: '0' and '1'), each with two children (depth 2: '00', '01', '10', '11').\n\nSo, the overall DP value is the sum of the DP values of the root nodes (depth 1) ?\n\nNo, because the DP value of the root (depth 1) is min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp). But the overall maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the DP values of the root nodes? No, because each root node (depth 1) corresponds to a prefix of length 1, and the DP value for that node is the maximum number of leaves in its subtree. But the overall maximum size is the sum of the DP values of the root nodes? No, that would be incorrect. Because the leaves are counted in both subtrees. Wait, no. The root nodes are '0' and '1'. Each leaf (string of length n) belongs to exactly one of the root nodes' subtrees. So the total maximum number of leaves is the sum of the DP values of the root nodes. However, the DP value of each root node is min(c_s, ...), which ensures that the number of leaves in its subtree doesn't exceed its capacity.\n\nBut in this case, the overall maximum size is the sum of the DP values of the two root nodes (for n=2). However, this is not correct. Because each leaf is in exactly one of the two root subtrees. Therefore, the total number of leaves is the sum of the DP values of the root nodes. So the overall maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the DP values of the root nodes (depth 1).\n\nBut then, how to compute this sum? For each root node, we compute its DP value (min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp)), and then sum them.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, for the purpose of counting the number of assignments of c_s values that result in the overall maximum size being exactly f, we need to find all assignments where this sum equals f.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThis seems very complex, especially for n up to 15. Let's think of the trie as a binary tree of depth n. Each node has two children except for the leaves (depth n). For each node, the DP value depends on its c_s and the DP values of its children.\n\nBut since the DP is computed bottom-up, perhaps we can model the problem recursively. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s values to that node and its subtree such that the DP value of the node is a certain value. Then combine these for the entire tree.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's define for a node at depth d (with children at depth d+1), the function dp(node, val) = number of ways to assign c_s values to this node and all its descendants such that the DP value of this node is exactly val.\n\nThen, the answer is the number of ways for the root nodes (depth 1) such that the sum of their DP values is f.\n\nBut for the root nodes, their DP value is min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp). So for each root node, we need to compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's values such that their DP value is a certain value, then sum across all possible combinations that add up to f.\n\nBut even this seems challenging. However, for n=15, the number of nodes is manageable if we can compute this recursively with memoization.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the base case. For a leaf node (depth n), the DP value is min(c_s, 1). So for each leaf node, the number of ways to assign c_s such that the DP value is v is:\n\nif v == 0: the number of c_s values that are 0 (since min(c_s, 1) is 0 only if c_s is 0).\n\nif v == 1: the number of c_s values that are ≥1 (since min(c_s, 1) is 1 when c_s ≥1).\n\nBut since c_s can be between 0 and k, inclusive, then:\n\nFor a leaf node:\n\nways_leaf(v) = \n   if v == 0: 1 (only c_s=0)\n   if v == 1: (k + 1 - 1) = k (since c_s can be 1..k)\n   else: 0\n\nBut wait, the c_s can be from 0 to k. So for a leaf node, the DP value is min(c_s, 1). So:\n\n- For c_s = 0 → DP = 0.\n- For c_s ≥1 → DP = 1.\n\nThus, for a leaf node, the number of ways to get DP value v is:\n\nif v == 0 → 1 way (c_s=0)\nif v == 1 → k ways (c_s can be 1 to k)\nelse 0.\n\nNow, for a non-leaf node (depth <n). Let's say it has two children, left and right. The DP value of this node is min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp).\n\nWe need to compute for this node, the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's c_s values such that the DP value of this node is exactly v.\n\nBut since the DP value depends on the sum of the children's DP values, we can model this recursively.\n\nFor a non-leaf node, the possible DP values are min(c_s, sum_children). So for each possible value of sum_children (let's call it S), and for each possible c_s, the DP value is min(c_s, S).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. For a non-leaf node, the DP value is determined by the sum of the DP values of its two children (S) and the value of c_s. For each possible S, and for each possible choice of c_s, the DP value of the node is min(c_s, S).\n\nBut since the children's DP values are already computed, we can precompute for each node the possible ways that the sum of the children's DP values can be S, and then for each possible c_s, compute the contribution.\n\nBut for each non-leaf node, the children are processed recursively, and for each possible value of their DP values, we can combine them.\n\nLet me formalize this. For a node with two children, left and right. Let's denote for the left child, the possible DP values are l_vals, and for the right child, r_vals. For each possible combination of l_val and r_val, the sum S = l_val + r_val. Then, for this node, the DP value is min(c_s, S). So, for each possible S, and for each possible choice of c_s, the DP value of the node is min(c_s, S).\n\nBut since c_s can be chosen independently (from 0 to k), we can compute for each possible S, the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = v, multiplied by the number of ways to get l_val and r_val such that their sum is S.\n\nBut how to combine this for all possibilities.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each node, we compute a dictionary (or array) that maps possible DP values of that node to the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's values to achieve that DP value.\n\nFor a leaf node, this is straightforward as discussed.\n\nFor a non-leaf node, we first compute the possible combinations of the left and right children's DP values. For each possible l_val and r_val, we calculate S = l_val + r_val. Then, for this S, we consider the number of ways that the left and right children can produce l_val and r_val respectively. Multiply these numbers to get the number of ways for the combination (l_val, r_val). Then, for each such S, we can compute for this node the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = v, and accumulate the counts for each v.\n\nSo, for the current node, the total number of ways for a given v is the sum over all possible S of (number of ways to get S from children) multiplied by (number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = v).\n\nBut how to compute the number of ways for c_s given S and desired v?\n\nLet me think. For a given S and desired v, how many c_s values between 0 and k satisfy min(c_s, S) = v?\n\nWe can split into cases:\n\nCase 1: v ≤ S. Then min(c_s, S) = v implies that c_s ≥ v and c_s ≤ v (since if c_s ≥ v and c_s ≤ S, then min(c_s, S) is v only if c_s =v? No, wait:\n\nWait, min(c_s, S) = v. So:\n\nEither:\n\n- v = S and c_s ≥ S (so min(c_s, S) = S = v). But this would require that v = S and c_s ≥ S.\n\nOr:\n\n- v < S and c_s =v (since min(v, S) =v).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe min(c_s, S) can be equal to v in two scenarios:\n\n1. c_s ≥ v and S ≥ v, and min(c_s, S) =v. This is only possible if v is the minimum between c_s and S. Which requires that either:\n\na) c_s =v and S ≥v. Then min(c_s, S) =v.\n\nOR\n\nb) S =v and c_s ≥v. Then min(c_s, S) =v.\n\nSo, combining these, the condition is that min(c_s, S) =v is equivalent to:\n\nEither (c_s =v and S ≥v) OR (S =v and c_s ≥v).\n\nBut this seems overlapping. For example, if S =v and c_s =v, both conditions are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, think of all c_s that satisfy min(c_s, S) =v. Let's see:\n\nmin(c_s, S) =v implies that:\n\nv ≤ c_s and v ≤ S, and (either c_s =v or S =v).\n\nWait, no. Let me think of the possible cases:\n\nIf S is fixed, then for min(c_s, S) =v, there are two possibilities:\n\nCase A: v = S. In this case, min(c_s, S) =v implies that c_s ≥v. Because min(c_s, S) = S (since S is the smaller of the two if c_s ≥S, or c_s if c_s <S). Wait, no:\n\nWait, S is fixed. For min(c_s, S) to be equal to v, then:\n\nv must be ≤ S (since min(c_s, S) can't be larger than S). Also, v must be ≤ c_s (since min(c_s, S) is ≤ c_s).\n\nSo, if v = S, then min(c_s, S) = S if and only if c_s ≥ S. Because if c_s ≥ S, then min(c_s, S) is S. If c_s <S, then min is c_s <S =v.\n\nIf v < S, then min(c_s, S) =v implies that v = c_s and v ≤ S. Because if c_s is v, then min(c_s, S) is v (since v ≤ S). If c_s >v, then min(c_s, S) is at least v (if S ≥v), but could be higher.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of c_s in [0, k] that satisfy min(c_s, S) =v is:\n\nif v > S: 0 (since min(c_s, S) can't be larger than S)\n\nelse:\n\nif v < S: the number of c_s =v (so 1 if v is within [0, k], else 0)\n\nplus if v = S: the number of c_s ≥ S and ≤k (so max(0, k - S +1)).\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for example, if S=5 and v=3 (which is less than S), then the only way is c_s=3. If S=5 and v=5, then c_s must be ≥5.\n\nSo, combining:\n\ncount = 0\n\nif v < S:\n\n   if 0 ≤v ≤k: count +=1\n\nelse: 0\n\nif v == S:\n\n   if S <=k: count += (k - S +1)\n\nelse: 0\n\nBut note that when v < S, and S is larger than v, but v is not in [0, k], then it's zero.\n\nSo, for each S and v, we can compute the number of c_s choices that would make min(c_s, S) =v.\n\nTherefore, for a non-leaf node, given that the sum of the children's DP values is S, the number of ways to choose c_s for this node to get a DP value of v is:\n\nif v <= S:\n\n   if v < S: then 1 (if v is in 0..k) else 0\n\n   plus if v == S: then (k - S +1) if S <=k else 0.\n\nBut wait, the above is for the case where the sum of children is S, and we want the current node's DP value to be v. So the count for this scenario is the number of c_s choices that satisfy min(c_s, S) =v.\n\nTherefore, for a non-leaf node, the process is:\n\nFor each possible combination of left and right DP values (l_val and r_val), compute S = l_val + r_val.\n\nThen, for this S, compute for each possible v, the contribution to the current node's count of v.\n\nBut how to aggregate this across all possible combinations of l_val and r_val.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute a frequency map (like a dictionary or array) that maps possible DP values of the node to the number of ways to achieve it. This frequency map is built based on the frequency maps of the children.\n\nSo, for a non-leaf node, we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Get the left child's frequency map (left_dp), which is a dictionary where the keys are possible DP values for the left child, and the values are the number of ways to achieve them.\n\n- Similarly, get the right child's frequency map (right_dp).\n\n- For all possible pairs (l_val, r_val) in left_dp and right_dp, compute S = l_val + r_val. For each such S, compute the contribution to the current node's frequency map based on the number of ways to choose c_s for this node.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute this?\n\nLet me think about the convolution of the left and right frequency maps. For each possible l_val and r_val, their sum S is l_val + r_val. The number of ways to get S is the sum over all pairs (l_val, r_val) where l_val + r_val = S of left_dp[l_val] * right_dp[r_val].\n\nOnce we have the total number of ways to get each S, we can then compute for each possible v, the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) =v, multiplied by the number of ways to get S.\n\nBut this seems computationally feasible for small n. For n=15, the maximum depth is 15. The number of nodes is O(2^n), which for n=15 is 32768. However, for each node, the possible DP values can be up to the sum of the children's DP values. For example, for a node at depth d, the maximum possible DP value is the sum of the DP values of its children, which could be up to 2^{n-d} * ... ?\n\nBut for n=15, the maximum possible DP value for the root node is 2^15 (since each leaf contributes 1, and there are 2^15 leaves). However, for f up to 2e5, this seems manageable.\n\nBut with n=15, the maximum possible DP value for the root node is 2^15 = 32768. However, the problem says that f can be up to 2e5. So for some test cases, f can be larger than the maximum possible DP value. In such cases, the answer is zero.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, when computing the number of ways, we need to consider all possible DP values up to the maximum possible for each node.\n\nBut how to manage this in code?\n\nPerhaps we can represent the frequency maps as arrays. For each node, we can have an array dp_vals where dp_vals[v] is the number of ways to assign c_s values to this node and its subtree such that the DP value of this node is v.\n\nSo, for a leaf node, the array would have:\n\ndp_vals[0] = 1 (if c_s=0)\n\ndp_vals[1] = k (if c_s >=1)\n\nall other entries are 0.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, we need to compute the convolution of the children's dp_vals arrays, then for each possible sum S, compute the contribution to the current node's dp_vals based on the possible c_s choices.\n\nBut how to handle the convolution efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for a non-leaf node:\n\n1. Compute the convolution of the left and right dp_vals arrays. The convolution gives for each possible sum S, the number of ways to have left_val + right_val = S.\n\n   For example, for left_vals and right_vals, the convolution is sum_{l_val} left_vals[l_val] * right_vals[S - l_val], for all possible l_val and r_val where l_val + r_val = S.\n\n   However, since the possible values of l_val and r_val can be up to some maximum, the convolution can be computed with dynamic programming.\n\n   For example, for the left and right children, the maximum possible sum S is (max_left_val + max_right_val). For each node, we can compute the possible sum S up to that maximum.\n\n   But for n=15, the maximum possible DP value for a node at depth d is 2^{n -d} (since each level",
