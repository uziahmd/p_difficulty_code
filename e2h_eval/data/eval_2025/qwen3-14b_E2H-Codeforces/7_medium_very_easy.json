The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me understand the construction rules again.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, every vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) are each connected to k new vertices. And this process of adding k new vertices to each leaf node must be done at least once. So the construction has multiple layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's model the structure.\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node (the root)\n- Step 1: Add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes = 1 + k.\n- Step 2: Each of the k nodes from step 1 is a leaf. Each gets k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n- Step 3: Each of the k^2 nodes from step 2 is a leaf. Add k^3 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n- And so on, until some step m.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the process of adding new nodes to the leaves (each leaf gets k new nodes) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two steps: step 1 and step 2. For example, the minimal snowflake for k=4 would be 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 21? But the example input says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Wait, let's check the example.\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input includes 6, output is NO. Let's see why. For example, if n=6, can we find a k?\n\nLet me think about possible values of k. Let's consider possible numbers of steps.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that the snowflake is built for m steps. The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Wait, no. Because step 0 is 1 node. Then step 1 adds k nodes. Step 2 adds k^2 nodes. Step m adds k^m nodes. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. However, the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when m is at least 2. Because step 1 is adding the first layer, then step 2 is adding the second layer. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial step (adding k nodes to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step is adding k nodes to each of the leaves (which are the ones added in the first step). So for the snowflake to be valid, the process of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two steps: the initial step (adding k nodes) and then the second step (adding k^2 nodes). Therefore, the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nSo for example, when k=2, the minimal is 1 + 2 + 4 =7. For k=3, it's 1+3+9=13. Which matches the sample input where n=13 is YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as the sum of a geometric series with ratio k, starting from 1, with at least two terms (since the sum must be 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1? Wait, wait. Let me re-express.\n\nThe sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. But the steps require that after the initial step (adding k nodes), there's at least one more step. So the minimal is m=2 steps (sum 1 +k +k^2). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- Start with 1 node (step 0).\n- Then add k nodes (step 1). Now, the total is 1 + k.\n- Then, each of the k nodes (which are leaves) is connected to k new nodes. This is step 2. So adding k * k nodes. Now total is 1 +k +k^2. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So this requires that the process of adding new nodes to leaves (step 2) is done once. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. But what if there are more steps? Like step 3, adding k^3 nodes. Then the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the snowflake can have any number of steps m ≥ 1? Or m ≥ 2? Because the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is required, and then at least one more step. So the sum must be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (so that the number of terms is m+1, but the steps are m steps? Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe process is:\n\nStart with one node.\n\nThen, add k nodes (this is the first expansion step). Now, each of the k nodes is a leaf. Then, the second expansion step is to add k nodes to each of these leaves. So this is done once. So the total nodes after two expansion steps is 1 +k +k^2. So the snowflake requires that there is at least one expansion step after the initial one. Therefore, the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (so that the sum has at least two terms after the initial 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes (so the sum is 1 +k). Then, the second step is adding k^2 nodes. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So m is the number of expansion steps. So for the snowflake to be valid, the number of expansion steps must be at least 1 (so that the second step is done once). So the total number of nodes is S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, the sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. The first expansion step (adding k nodes) corresponds to m=1 (sum 1 +k). But the problem says that after adding the initial k nodes, you have to do at least one more step. So the minimal is m=2 (sum 1 +k +k^2). So the snowflake must have sum S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥ 2. Or maybe m ≥ 1, but with the condition that the number of expansion steps is at least 1. Because the initial expansion step (adding k nodes) is required, and then at least one more expansion step (so m ≥ 2). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m where m ≥ 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be written as S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1), where m is the number of steps (but I need to clarify how m is counted here).\n\nBut regardless, for a given n, we need to check if there exists a k>1 and integers m ≥ 2 such that n equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the snowflake, the process requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So the minimal case is when m=2, because:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node.\n\n- Step 1 (expansion step 1): add k nodes. Now, the sum is 1 +k. But this is not sufficient because the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So after step 1, we need to perform step 2 (adding k^2 nodes). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So m is the exponent in the sum, which would be 2. So the formula for the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m ≥ 2?\n\nNo. Let me recheck. For example, sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which is correct. So the snowflake requires that m ≥ 1 (so that the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1?), but with the condition that the expansion steps are done at least once. Wait, the expansion steps are: the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first expansion step. Then, the second expansion step is adding k^2 nodes. So the total number of expansion steps is m. So for the snowflake to be valid, the number of expansion steps must be at least 1. So m ≥ 1. But then, for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (which is the second expansion step) must be done at least once. Wait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, okay. So the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf (the step that is done after the initial step) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is required. Then, the step of adding k nodes to each leaf (which is the second step) must be done at least once. So the snowflake must have at least two steps: the initial step (adding k nodes) and the second step (adding k^2 nodes). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Thus, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because m is the highest exponent. For example, m=2 gives sum 1 +k +k^2. If m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nTherefore, for a given n, we need to check if there exists a k>1 and integer m ≥ 2 such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which is correct. So the problem requires that n is equal to this sum for some k>1 and m≥2.\n\nSo our task is, given n, to check whether there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible k, we can check if there exists an m ≥ 2 such that n is equal to the sum. However, since k can be up to something like sqrt(n) or similar, and n is up to 1e18, we need an efficient approach.\n\nBut considering that for each possible m, we can check for possible k.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible m (starting from 2 upwards), check if there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n. Since m can't be too big, because for m ≥ 2, the minimal value of the sum for a given m is when k=2. For example, for m=2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 =7. For m=3, it's 1+2+4+8=15. For m=4, 31, etc. So for a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n). For example, if n is 1e18, log2(n) is about 60. So m can be up to 60. So for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 up to 60, and for each m, check if there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check for all possible m from 2 up to log2(n) (since for m steps, the minimal sum is 1+2+...+2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So if n is less than that, then no solution for that m.)\n\nBut for each m, we can compute the possible k. Let me think:\n\nThe sum S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation as:\n\nk^{m+1} -1 = n*(k-1)\n\nWhich is:\n\nk^{m+1} - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is not straightforward. However, for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible k. For example, for m fixed, the sum S increases with k. So for a given m, S is strictly increasing in k. Therefore, for each m, we can binary search for k.\n\nBut how to find the possible k for a given m?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, the sum S is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) = n. Let's denote this as f(k) = n.\n\nBut f(k) is strictly increasing in k. So for a given m, we can perform binary search over k to see if there exists a k>1 such that f(k) equals n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) efficiently, and also find the possible k?\n\nAlternatively, since for each m, the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. Let's denote this sum as S. For a given m and n, we can compute the possible k as follows:\n\nWe can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. What's the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, for a given m, the sum S is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Since m >= 2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. For k >= 2, the sum is >= 1 + 2 + 4 =7. For a given n, the maximum possible k for a given m is such that 1 +k + ... +k^m <=n. Since the sum is dominated by k^m, for k^m ~n, so k is up to n^(1/m). So for binary search, the upper bound can be n^(1/m) + 1. But since m can be up to 60, and n is up to 1e18, even for m=2, the upper bound is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9, which is manageable for binary search?\n\nBut considering that t is up to 1e4, and for each test case, m can be up to 60, and for each m, binary search up to 1e9 steps, that would be O(t * 60 * log(1e9)) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for m up to 60, and for each m, we can perform a binary search for k in the range [2, ... , upper_bound].\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and m? For example, for k=2 and m=60, the sum is 2^61-1/(2-1) = 2^61 -1, which is about 2e18. So for n up to 1e18, this is possible.\n\nBut calculating the sum directly might overflow, but since Python handles big integers, that's not a problem.\n\nBut for binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nsum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. Which can be computed as (k^(m+1) -1) // (k-1). But for large exponents, this may take time? Well, for m up to 60, even k=1e9, k^m would be 1e540, which is a very big number. However, since n is up to 1e18, we can stop the calculation early if the sum exceeds n. Because during the binary search, if during the calculation of the sum, it exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo here's an idea for the sum function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for i in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for m up to 60, this loop is manageable. Also, this avoids calculating large exponents and possible overflows (though in Python, it's not a problem, but for efficiency, perhaps better to compute this way).\n\nBut for binary search, for each candidate k, we can compute the sum for the given m, and compare with n.\n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\nCheck if n is 1. Then answer is NO (since the snowflake requires at least 1 +k +k^2, which for k>1 is at least 1 +2 +4 =7. So for n=1, answer is NO. Similarly for n=2, 3, 6, etc. As per sample input.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check for any m ≥ 2, and any k ≥ 2, if the sum equals n.\n\nNow, the approach for the code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nIf n is less than 7 (the minimal possible sum for m=2 and k=2), then answer is NO.\n\nElse:\n\nIterate m from 2 up to max_m, where max_m is the maximum possible m such that 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m <= n. Since for m steps, the minimal sum is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So for example, for n=1e18, the maximum m is around 60, since 2^60 is ~1e18.\n\nSo for each m in 2 to 60:\n\n   We perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound], where upper_bound can be found as follows. For the sum to be n, since the sum for k is 1 +k + ... +k^m. For k >= 2, the sum is at least 1 + 2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. For k=2, the sum is 2^{m+1}-1. For larger k, the sum increases. So the upper bound for k can be found by noting that the sum for k is at least k^m (since the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^m ≥k^m). So k^m ≤n → k ≤ n^(1/m). So the upper bound for binary search can be set to n^(1/m) + 1. But since m can be up to 60, and n up to 1e18, n^(1/m) can be calculated using integer roots.\n\nBut in practice, for each m, we can perform a binary search on k from 2 to some upper limit. For example, for each m, the upper limit can be set to n^(1/m) + 1. However, calculating n^(1/m) can be done via binary search as well. Alternatively, since for binary search, we can start with low=2, high=2, and double high until the sum for that k is larger than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps it's easier to perform a binary search for k in the range [2, ... , upper], where upper is something like 1e6, but for larger m, the upper is small.\n\nBut given that for each m, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^m = n. For example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. So solving for k: k^2 +k +1 =n →k^2 +k + (1 -n) =0. The positive root is [-1 + sqrt(4n -3)] / 2. So for m=2, the maximum possible k is around sqrt(n). So for m=2, the upper bound for k is sqrt(n). For m=3, it's cube root of n, etc.\n\nThus, for each m, we can perform a binary search between 2 and upper, where upper is n^(1/m) +1.\n\nBut how to compute upper in code?\n\nIn Python, we can compute the integer part of n^(1/m) using something like pow(n, 1/m), but since n can be up to 1e18, and m up to 60, this can be done with binary search.\n\nAlternatively, for the binary search for k, we can start with low=2, and high=2, and keep doubling high until compute_sum(high, m) >=n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach avoids computing the exact upper bound and works for all cases.\n\nSo, for each m, we can:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, m) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce we have a high where compute_sum(high, m) >=n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nFor each candidate k in this binary search, compute the sum. If it equals n, return True.\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, m) efficiently, without overflowing? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but for performance, it's better to compute it in a way that stops early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo here's a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but m is the number of terms. For example, m=2: 0,1,2 terms (three terms). So for m steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So the loop runs m+1 times. So the code above is correct.\n\nSo for each candidate k and m, compute_sum returns the sum, or infinity if it exceeds target (n).\n\nSo for each m, we perform a binary search on k. If during this process, we find a k where compute_sum(k, m) ==n, then return YES.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = input value\n\n    if n < 7:\n\n        print 'NO'\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in 2 to 60:\n\n        # compute possible k for this m\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        while compute_sum(high, m, n) < n:\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # now binary search between low and high\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n            if s == n:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s < n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        print 'YES'\n\n    else:\n\n        print 'NO'\n\nBut wait, what about m being larger than log2(n) +1? For example, for m=60, the minimal sum is 2^61 -1, which is 2e18. So for n=1e18, this would be larger than n. So in that case, the loop for m would check up to m where 2^{m+1} -1 <=n. So for each m, we need to check whether the minimal sum for that m (with k=2) is <=n. Otherwise, there's no need to check higher m.\n\nSo perhaps, for m, we can loop up to the maximum possible m where 2^{m+1} -1 <=n. For example, for n=1e18, 2^m+1 -1 <=1e18 → m+1 <= log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So m can be up to 59.\n\nSo in code, for m in 2 to max_m, where max_m is determined as the maximum m for which 2^{m+1} -1 <=n.\n\nBut how to compute max_m? For example, for n=1e18, m can be up to 59 (since 2^60 is 1.15e18, so 2^60 -1 is 1.15e18 -1, which is larger than 1e18. So for m=59, 2^60 -1 is 1.15e18, which is larger than n=1e18. So the maximum m is 59-1=58? Wait, for m=59, the minimal sum (k=2) is 2^{m+1} -1 = 2^60 -1. For n=1e18, this is 1.15e18, which is larger than n. So for m=59, the minimal sum is already larger than n, so no need to check for m=59.\n\nSo the maximum m to check is the largest m where 2^{m+1} -1 <=n. Which can be found by finding the maximum m such that 2^{m+1} <=n +1. Taking logs, m+1 <= log2(n+1). So m_max = floor(log2(n+1)) -1.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can loop m from 2 up to 60 (since for n up to 1e18, log2(n) is about 60). So even if m is up to 60, the code will check for m=60, but for many n, it will quickly find that the minimal sum for that m is larger than n, and thus skip the binary search.\n\nSo in code, for each test case, we can loop m from 2 to 60.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=13.\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\ncompute_sum(k, 2) = 1 +k +k^2 =13 →k^2 +k +1 =13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=(-1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 →sqrt(49)=7 →k=( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes. Hence answer is YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=6. The minimal sum for m=2 is 7. So 6 is less than that, so answer is NO.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255. Let's see. For m=2: 1 +k +k^2 =255 →k^2 +k -254 =0 →k = [-1 + sqrt(1 + 1016)] / 2 → sqrt(1017) is around 31.9, so (30.9)/2 ~15.4. So trying k=15: 1+15+225=241 <255. k=16: 1+16+256= 273>255. So no solution for m=2. Try m=3: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =255. Let's see for k=4: 1+4+16+64=85. k=5: 1+5+25+125=156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259. Close to 255. So no. k=5.5? Not integer. So no solution for m=3. Try m=4: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4. Let's see for k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no. Try m=7: sum for k=2 is 2^8-1=255. Yes! So m=7, k=2. Because sum is 1+2+4+8+...+128 = 255. So for m=7 (since m+1 is 8, sum is 2^8-1=255). So yes. So the code would find this when m=7.\n\nThus, the code would find for m=7, k=2.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The sample output is NO. Let's see why. Let's check if there exists a k and m such that sum equals 1e18.\n\nFor example, for m=2, we need 1 +k +k² =1e18. Solving k² +k +1 =1e18. Approximate solution k~sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute for k=1e9: 1e18 + 1e9 +1 = 1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So k is slightly less than 1e9. But since k must be integer, perhaps no solution here. For m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. For k=1e6, sum is 1 + 1e6 + 1e12 + 1e18, which is way larger than 1e18. For m=59, the sum for k=2 is 2^60 -1 = 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. For m=58, sum is 2^59 -1 ~ 5.7e17 < 1e18. So for m=58, maybe there's a k between 2 and 3. But since k must be integer, no. So for m=58, k=2 gives sum 2^59 -1 ~ 5.7e17 <1e18. k=3: sum is (3^59 -1)/2. Which is way larger than 1e18. So no solution here. Thus, for 1e18, there's no k and m that satisfy the condition. Hence output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, what about n=7? It's 1+2+4=7. So for m=2, k=2. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=15. Which is 1+2+4+8=15 (m=3). So code returns YES.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases. For example, n=7, which is allowed. Also, n=1+2+4+...+k^m for various k and m.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nImplement the helper function compute_sum, which for given k, m, and target n, computes the sum, returning infinity if it exceeds n.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's better to implement this as a loop, adding terms and checking if it exceeds n.\n\nNow, in Python, for each test case, we can loop m from 2 up to 60. For each m, perform binary search for k.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, handle the case when n is 1, 2, 3, etc. For example, n=1 is impossible. For n=2, the minimal sum is 7. So answer is NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n < 7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nloop m from 2 to 60:\n\n   perform binary search for k.\n\n   if found, return YES.\n\nif none found, return NO.\n\nBut what about when m is larger than log2(n+1) -1? For example, for m=60, the minimal sum is 2^61 -1 which is 2.3e18. So for n=1e18, this is larger than n, so during the binary search for m=60, the initial high=2 would have compute_sum(2, 60, n) = (2^61-1)/(2-1) = 2^61 -1 which is larger than n. So during the binary search, the code would check and find no solution.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper function compute_sum:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for m=60 and k=2, this would compute 61 terms (from 0 to 60 exponents). For each term, multiply by k.\n\nNow, for the binary search part.\n\nBut in code, for each m, the binary search for k:\n\nfor m in range(2, 61):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   while compute_sum(high, m, n) < n:\n\n       high *=2\n\n   # now binary search between low and high\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n       if s == n:\n\n           return True\n\n       elif s < n:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\nBut in Python, for each test case, we need to loop through m from 2 to 60, and for each m, perform this binary search.\n\nBut how to handle the case where compute_sum returns infinity? For example, when the sum exceeds n, we know that the current k is too big.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut for the code, the helper function compute_sum is called with parameters (k, m, n). However, in Python, it's better to pass the target n as a parameter.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t.\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n < 7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n\n        # Binary search for k\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        # Find upper bound for high\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n\n            if s >= n:\n\n                break\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n            if s == n:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s < n:\n\n                low = mid + 1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the while loop for finding high is inside the for m loop. However, the compute_sum function may return infinity (if the sum exceeds n). But in the code, the while loop checks if s >=n. But in reality, compute_sum returns infinity if the sum exceeds n. So in that case, the code would break the loop. However, when compute_sum returns infinity",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists any valid configuration of vertices that meets the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each vertex added in a layer must be connected to `k` new vertices, where `k > 1`. This expansion must be done at least once after the initial layer.\n2. **Geometric Series Insight**: The total number of vertices in a snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series sum. For a valid snowflake, the number of vertices `n` must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series with ratio `k` (where `k > 1`) for some integer `m ≥ 2`.\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each possible value of `m` (from 2 to 60, since `2^60` exceeds `10^18`), we perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > target:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for m in range(2, 61):\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            # Find upper bound for high\n            while True:\n                s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n                if s >= n:\n                    break\n                high *= 2\n            # Binary search between low and high\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n                if s == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif s < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series up to `m` terms starting from `k^0` and checks if it exceeds the target value `n`, returning infinity if it does.\n- **Main Logic**: For each test case, we check if `n` is less than 7 (the minimum possible vertices for a valid snowflake). If not, we iterate over possible values of `m` from 2 to 60. For each `m`, we use binary search to find a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n- **Binary Search**: For each `m`, we expand the upper bound for `k` dynamically until it exceeds `n`, then perform a binary search within this range to check for valid `k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations using geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring we handle the large constraints effectively.",
