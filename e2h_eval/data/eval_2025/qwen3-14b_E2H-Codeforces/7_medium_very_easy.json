The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is like building layers. Let me think about the structure. \n\nLet me think of it as a tree. The initial node is the root. Then, in the first step, we add k children. Then, each of those children (which are leaves) must have k children added. And this process is repeated for at least one more step. \n\nSo the snowflake is a tree where each node has exactly k children except for the leaves. But the construction requires that each leaf (nodes with degree 1) is expanded by adding k children. So the process is like building a tree with multiple levels, where each level is generated by expanding all leaves from the previous level.\n\nLet me model the number of nodes for different steps. Let's consider the steps:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node (root)\n- Step 1: Add k children to root. Total nodes: 1 + k.\n- Step 2: Each of the k nodes from step 1 has k children. So adding k * k nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k + k².\n- Step 3: Each of the k² nodes from step 2 has k children. Adding k³ nodes. Total: 1 + k + k² + k³.\n- And so on.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the process must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step (adding k children to the root) is the first expansion. Then the next step (expanding each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do two expansions. For example, for k=4, the minimal snowflake would be 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 1 +4+16=21? But the example says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, for n=6, the output is NO. Let me think why. Let's see possible k and steps.\n\nLet me think for possible values of n.\n\nThe snowflake can be constructed if there exists some k>1 and some number of steps m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe initial step is creating the root and connecting it to k new vertices. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process is:\n\n- First, create the root and connect to k children. Now, the leaves are the k children. Then, we must perform the expansion step at least once. So, expand each of the k leaves by adding k children each. That would make the total number of nodes 1 + k + k*k. So for the minimal case, the number of nodes is 1 +k +k². \n\nBut what about if we do more expansions? For example, after expanding once, we can expand again. So for m expansions, the total nodes would be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. But the problem says that the expansion step (the step where you add k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is 1. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is at least 1?\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The initial step is creating the root and connecting it to k children. Then, the expansion step is done once. So the expansion step is the second step. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k (from the first step) plus k * k (from the expansion step). So 1 +k +k². \n\nBut perhaps the expansion can be done multiple times. For example, after the first expansion (adding k² nodes), the leaves are those k² nodes. So another expansion would add k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k² +k^3. So for m expansions, the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i} minus k^0? No, wait:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart with 1 node.\n\nThen, first expansion (step 1): add k nodes. So total 1 +k.\n\nThen, expansion step (step 2): add k * k nodes. So total 1 +k +k².\n\nAnother expansion (step 3): add k² *k =k^3. Total 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansions. But the expansion must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Wait, but the initial step is the first expansion. So for the minimal case, m is 1, leading to 1 +k +k^2 ?\n\nNo, wait. Let me re-express. The initial step is the creation of the root and the first k children. Then, the expansion step is done once. So that's adding k² nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². So the number of expansions is 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of expansions is the number of times you perform the step of adding k children to each leaf. The first expansion (after the initial step) is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. \n\nBut then, if you perform another expansion, the total becomes 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i} where m is the number of expansions plus 1? Or perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state is 1 node. Then, the first expansion (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once (step 2), adding k^2 nodes. Then, if you do another expansion step (step 3), adding k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the number of expansion steps is m, and the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} }, where m ≥1. Because the expansion steps are done m times. Wait, no. For example, the initial step (adding k children) is part of the construction. Then, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k². So m is the number of expansion steps. So m ≥1. \n\nTherefore, the total number of nodes can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i} where m ≥1. Wait, because sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. So for m=1, sum is 1 +k. But that would be the case where there is no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Therefore, the correct formula is sum_{i=0}^m k^i} where m ≥2? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart with 1 node (sum is 1).\n\nStep 1: add k nodes (sum is 1 +k). This is the first expansion (connecting the root to k children). Then, the expansion step (connecting each leaf to k children) is done once. So that's step 2, which adds k^2 nodes. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So the total number of expansion steps is 1. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^{3} -1)/(k-1) -k^0 ? No, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case when there are two expansion steps? Or perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is 1 +k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to model the problem correctly. Let me think of the structure as a tree where each node has exactly k children, except for the leaves. But the way the tree is built is that each expansion step adds a layer of nodes. So the tree has depth d. For example, the root is depth 0. Its children are depth 1. Their children are depth 2, etc. \n\nThe construction requires that the expansion step is done at least once. So the tree must have at least two layers. So the minimum depth is 2. \n\nFor example, the minimal case is when the tree has depth 2. The number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. \n\nIf the tree has depth 3, then the number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. \n\nSo for any snowflake, the number of nodes is S = sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2. \n\nWait, but for d=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2. For d=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. \n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal depth is 2. \n\nSo for any possible snowflake, the number of nodes is S = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2, and k ≥2. \n\nWait, but that's only if the tree is built to depth d. So for example, the depth is d, and the number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i} = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the depth is at least 2. \n\nSo, given n, we need to check if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut wait, that's not the case. Because for example, if d=2, then the sum is 1 +k +k^2. But what if we have d=2 and stop there. So for example, for the snowflake, the expansion step is done once. \n\nBut then, the problem allows for more expansion steps. So the number of nodes could be any of these sums. \n\nSo the question reduces to: given n, does there exist integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that n equals (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut wait, that formula is for a geometric series. Let me confirm: sum_{i=0}^d k^i} = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). Yes. \n\nSo for example, for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). \n\nSo the problem becomes checking if n can be written in this form for some k ≥2 and d ≥2. \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)? \n\nLet me think about the approach. For each test case n, we need to check if there exists k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nAlternatively, since (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d. \n\nBut for d ≥2, the minimal value for k=2 and d=2 is 1 +2 +4=7. So for n less than 7, the answer is NO. Looking at the sample input: for n=1, 2,3,6, the answer is NO. For example, n=6 is not achievable. \n\nSo the problem is to find for a given n, if there exists k≥2 and d≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n. \n\nBut how to check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible d ≥2, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n. \n\nBut since d can be up to log_2(n), because for d steps, the minimal sum is 1 +2 + ... +2^d = 2^{d+1} -1. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to around 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). \n\nSo for each possible d from 2 up to 60, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n < 7 (since minimal sum is 7 when k=2, d=2), return NO.\n\nElse:\n\n- For d from 2 to max_d (like 60):\n\n   - Check if there exists an integer k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n. \n\n   - How to check this? For fixed d, the sum is S = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\n   - We can rearrange this equation to find k. For each d, we can perform a binary search on k. Since for fixed d, the function S(k) increases with k. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper bound. \n\nBut what is the upper bound for k? For fixed d, the sum is S(k) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d. For k ≥2, S(k) ≥ 1 +2 + 2² + ... +2^d = 2^{d+1} -1. So for a given d, the maximum possible k is such that S(k) ≤n. \n\nAlternatively, since for fixed d, the sum S(k) is increasing with k, we can perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound]. What is the upper bound? Well, for k ≥2, S(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^d ≥1 +k. So for S(k) =n, k ≤n-1. But that's a very loose upper bound. However, since d is small (up to 60), even for d=60, the binary search for k can be done quickly. \n\nSo for each d from 2 to 60:\n\n   - Binary search for k in [2, ... , upper], such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n. \n\nBut how to compute the sum? For large d and k, the sum can be very big, but since n is up to 1e18, we can compute it with care, and stop early if the sum exceeds n. \n\nAlternatively, for fixed d and k, we can compute the sum incrementally. Let's think:\n\nsum = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d. \n\nBut for a given k and d, we can compute this as follows:\n\nInitialize total = 0. \n\ncurrent_term = 1 (for k^0)\n\nfor i in 0..d:\n\n   total += current_term\n\n   current_term *=k \n\nBut for large k and d, this could overflow, but since n is up to 1e18, we can check during the computation if the total exceeds n and break early. \n\nSo, for each d, perform a binary search on k. \n\nBut how to find the possible range for k for a given d?\n\nThe minimal possible sum for a given d is when k=2: sum = (2^{d+1} -1)/(2-1) = 2^{d+1} -1. \n\nThe maximum possible sum for a given d and k is when k is such that sum equals n. So for binary search, the lower bound is 2, upper bound can be something like n^(1/d). Because for sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n, the largest term is k^d. So k^d ≤n → k ≤n^{1/d}. \n\nBut since d is up to 60, and n is up to 1e18, n^(1/d) is manageable. For example, for d=60, n^(1/60) is about 1e18^(1/60) ≈ e^( (18 ln 10)/60 ) ≈ e^( (18*2.3)/60 ) ≈ e^(0.69) ≈ 2. So for larger d, the upper bound is small. \n\nThus, for each d, the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/d) +1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nAlternatively, for binary search, we can start with low=2 and high= some value. For example, high can be 2, and then double until the sum exceeds n. \n\nBut perhaps for each d, the upper bound for k can be found as follows: since sum_{i=0}^d k^i ≥k^d. So k^d ≤n → k ≤n^(1/d). So the upper bound can be set to n^(1/d) +1. \n\nBut calculating n^(1/d) can be done via binary search or using math.pow. However, since n can be up to 1e18 and d up to 60, even for d=2, n^(1/2) is 1e9, which is manageable for binary search. \n\nBut for each d, the binary search on k would take O(log n) steps, and for each step, computing the sum would take O(d) steps. Since d is up to 60, and t is 1e4, the total time would be acceptable. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n < 7 → output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for d in 2 to 60:\n\n         perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper] to see if there exists a k such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n      also, check for the case where the sum is 1 +k. Wait, no, because the expansion steps must be done at least once. So for d=1, the sum is 1 +k, which would correspond to the initial step (adding k children) but no expansion steps. Which is invalid. So the minimal d is 2. So our loop for d starts at 2.\n\nBut what about the case where the snowflake is built with multiple expansions. For example, d=2 gives 1 +k +k². But what if d=3, and the sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3. \n\nSo the code will check for all possible d ≥2. \n\nNow, let's think about the sample input. For example, n=13:\n\nCheck for d=2:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =13 → k² +k +1 =13 →k² +k -12=0. Solving quadratic equation: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +48)]/2 = [-1 +7]/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes. So answer is YES. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nAnother sample: n=15. \n\nCheck for d=2: 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k -14=0 → discriminant 1+56=57. sqrt(57) is ~7.5, so k is (-1 +7.5)/2 ~ 3.25. Not integer. \n\nCheck for d=3: sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3 =15. Try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So answer is YES. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nSo the code needs to check for all possible d ≥2, and for each, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n. \n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement a function that, given n, checks for any d from 2 up to say 60, and for each d, check if there exists k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n. \n\nImplementing the sum calculation with possible overflows. \n\nBut since n is up to 1e18, and d is up to 60, for each k and d, the sum can be calculated as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k \n\n    return total \n\nBut wait, for d steps, the loop runs d+1 times (from 0 to d). \n\nBut for example, when d=2, it's 0,1,2 → 3 terms. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for each candidate k and d, compute the sum. If it equals n, return yes. \n\nBut how to perform the binary search for k for each d. \n\nFor each d, the minimal possible k is 2. The maximum possible k can be determined as follows. Since sum_{i=0}^d k^i ≥k^d. So k^d ≤n →k ≤n^(1/d). So the upper bound for k is n^(1/d) + 1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nAlternatively, we can perform a binary search between low=2 and high= something. For example, high can be 2, and we can keep doubling until compute_sum(high, d) >n. Then perform binary search between low and high. \n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps for each d, we can set low=2, high=2, and while compute_sum(high, d) <n, set high *=2. Once we have a high where compute_sum(high, d) >=n, perform binary search between low and high. \n\nBut for each d and k, compute_sum can be done as above. \n\nSo here's the code outline for a single n:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n <7:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, and for d=60, the minimal sum is 2^61 -1 which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, d can't be larger than 60.\n\n    for d in range(2, max_d+1):\n\n        # find if there's a k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n\n\n        # perform binary search on k.\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        # find upper bound for high\n\n        while compute_sum(high, d) <n:\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # now binary search between low and high\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d)\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                return True\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut what about the compute_sum function? Also, need to handle cases where the sum overflows (exceeds n). \n\nWait, the compute_sum function returns the sum, but during the calculation, if at any point the total exceeds n, we can return early. \n\nBut in code, how to implement that? Let's write a helper function that computes the sum for given k and d, and returns whether it equals n, or returns early if it exceeds n. \n\nBut in code:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, target):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k \n\n    return total \n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, it's okay. \n\nBut for example, when d is 60 and k is 2, the sum is 2^61 -1, which is about 2e18. For n up to 1e18, this is acceptable. \n\nBut for the binary search, the code for each d would proceed as follows. \n\nBut there's another case: for some d, even with k=2, the sum may be larger than n. For example, if n is 7, and d=2, then k=2 gives sum 1+2+4=7. So it's okay. \n\nNow, let's think about the code. \n\nBut for the sample input n=6, the code would check d=2, and for k=2, sum is 7>6, so returns no. For d=2, the binary search would find no k. For higher d's, the sum would be even larger. So returns false. \n\nAnother sample: n=255. \n\nLooking for possible d and k. Let's see:\n\nFor d=2, sum is 1 +k +k² =255. Let's see: k² +k +1 =255 →k² +k -254=0 → discriminant is 1 + 4*254 = 1+1016=1017. sqrt(1017) is about 31.89. So k=( -1 +31.89)/2 ≈ 15.44. Not integer. \n\nFor d=3, sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3 =255. Let's try k=5: 1+5+25+125= 156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259. Which is larger than 255. So no. \n\nk=5: sum is 156. \n\nk=5.5? Not integer. \n\nWhat about d=4? sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3 +k^4. Let's try k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no. \n\nk=3.5? Not integer. \n\nd=7? Let's see for k=2: sum is 2^8-1 =255. Oh! Because sum_{i=0}^7 2^i = 2^8 -1 = 255. So for d=7, k=2. So yes. So the code would find this. \n\nSo the code would check for d=7. \n\nSo the code would check for d from 2 to 60. For d=7, compute_sum(2,7,255) would return 255. \n\nSo the code would return yes. \n\nWhich matches the sample input. \n\nAnother sample: n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. \n\nBut why? Let's think. For example, for d=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2. Let's see if there's a k where this equals 1e18. \n\nk^2 +k +1 = 1e18. For large k, k^2 ≈ 1e18 →k≈1e9. Let's compute k=1e9: 1e18 + 1e9 +1 ≈ 1e18. So sum is larger than 1e18. So for k= 999999999, sum is (approx) 1e18. But perhaps there's no integer k for which sum equals exactly 1e18. \n\nBut the code would check all possible d's and k's. \n\nBut according to the sample, the answer is NO. \n\nSo the code would check for all possible d and k, and find none. \n\nSo the code seems to work. \n\nNow, the code in Python. \n\nBut for handling very large exponents, the compute_sum function may take O(d) time. For each d up to 60, and for each binary search step, which is O(log (upper_bound)), which is acceptable. \n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n, check if it can be represented as sum_{i=0}^d k^i for some k≥2 and d≥2. \n\nBut also, note that for some n, there might be multiple possibilities. For example, n=7 can be achieved with d=2 and k=2. \n\nNow, implement the code. \n\nBut for the code, the helper function compute_sum needs to be written. \n\nBut in Python, for each k and d, we can compute the sum. \n\nBut also, for some cases, the sum can be computed as (k^(d+1) -1) // (k-1). However, for large exponents, this may cause overflow. However, in Python, integers are arbitrary precision. \n\nBut perhaps using this formula is more efficient than looping. However, for the code, perhaps the loop is easier to implement and avoid overflows. \n\nBut in practice, for the code, the loop is manageable. \n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n <7: print 'NO'\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 2 to 60:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] such that compute_sum(k, d) ==n. \n\n      if found, return 'YES'\n\n   after all d's, return 'NO'\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the binary search part. \n\nBut for the code, let's write a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, target):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d + 1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, this could take time, but since d is up to 60, and per test case, it's manageable. \n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nBut in code, for each d in 2 to 60:\n\nBut what is the maximum d needed? For example, for k=2, the sum for d steps is 2^{d+1} -1. For n up to 1e18, 2^{d+1} -1 ≤1e18 → d+1 ≤ log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So d can be up to 59. So setting max_d as 60 is sufficient. \n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    t = int(input[0])\n\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n\n    for n in cases:\n\n        if n < 7:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        found = False\n\n        max_d = 60\n\n        for d in range(2, max_d +1):\n\n            # Binary search for k in [2, ... ]\n\n            low = 2\n\n            high = 2\n\n            # Find upper bound for high\n\n            while True:\n\n                s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n                if s >= n:\n\n                    break\n\n                high *=2\n\n            # Now binary search between low and high\n\n            while low <= high:\n\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n                s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n                if s == n:\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                elif s < n:\n\n                    low = mid +1\n\n                else:\n\n                    high = mid -1\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nBut wait, the code has a problem. The compute_sum function returns inf if the sum exceeds n. But during the binary search, when we check for mid, we need to compare s with n. \n\nBut in the code, the compute_sum returns the actual sum if it's <=n, else inf. \n\nBut for the binary search, when s is inf, it means that the sum is larger than n, so we need to adjust high. \n\nBut in the code, during the binary search, when we compute s, if s is inf, then it's treated as larger than n. \n\nBut in code, the compute_sum function returns inf if during the sum calculation, the total exceeds n. \n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. For example, when the sum is exactly n, the code returns it. Otherwise, if during the calculation, the sum exceeds n, returns inf. \n\nBut in the code, during the binary search, when we compute s, if s is inf, then we treat it as larger than n, and adjust high accordingly. \n\nBut perhaps in the code, the compute_sum function can be modified to return the actual sum if it's <=n, else return something larger than n. \n\nBut for the code, the compute_sum function returns the actual sum if it's <=n, else returns inf. \n\nBut in the code, when the compute_sum returns inf, it's considered as larger than n. \n\nBut how to handle this in the binary search. \n\nAnother approach: compute the sum, but during the calculation, if it exceeds n, return something larger than n. \n\nBut for the code, the helper function compute_sum is as written. \n\nBut let's test with the example where d=7 and k=2, n=255. \n\ncompute_sum(2,7, 255) would calculate:\n\nterms: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. Sum is 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 = 255. So returns 255. \n\nAnother example: k=2, d=7, n=255. \n\nSo during the binary search, the code would find it. \n\nBut what about when the sum is exactly equal to n? \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code for compute_sum. \n\nBut in Python, for large exponents, the code may take some time, but for d up to 60, it's manageable. \n\nBut what about when the sum is exactly n? \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n13\n\n15\n\n255\n\n10101\n\n1000000000000000000\n\nSample Output:\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nFor n=10101, the code should return YES. Let's see. \n\nWhat's 10101? \n\nLet me think. For example, for d=2, k= 100. 1 +100 +10000 = 10101. Yes! So k=100, d=2. \n\nSo the code would find this. \n\nThus, the code would return YES. \n\nAnother case: n=1000000000000000000. \n\nThe code checks for all possible d and k. \n\nBut for example, for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. Solving for k: k^2 +k +1 =n. \n\nk^2 +k +1 = 1e18 →k^2 ≈ 1e18 →k ≈ 1e9. Let's compute k= 999999999:\n\nk^2 = (1e9 -1)^2 = 1e18 - 2e9 +1. \n\nk^2 +k +1 = 1e18 -2e9 +1 + 1e9 -1 +1 = 1e18 -1e9 +1. Which is less than 1e18. \n\nk= 1e9: k^2 +k +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. \n\nSo there's no integer solution here. \n\nFor other d's, perhaps there is no solution",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists a valid configuration of vertices that matches the given $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with a single vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each layer is formed by connecting every leaf node (nodes with only one connection) to $ k $ new vertices. The total number of vertices after $ d $ layers (with $ d \\geq 2 $) is given by the sum of a geometric series: $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^d $.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible depth $ d $ (from 2 to 60, since $ 2^{60} $ is approximately $ 10^{18} $), we check if there exists an integer $ k \\geq 2 $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each depth $ d $, perform a binary search on possible values of $ k $ to determine if the sum of the series equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, target):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(d + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > target:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        max_d = 60\n        for d in range(2, max_d + 1):\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            # Find upper bound for high\n            while True:\n                s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n                if s >= n:\n                    break\n                high *= 2\n            # Binary search between low and high\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n                if s == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif s < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If $ n $ is less than 7, it's immediately determined that no valid snowflake can be formed.\n- **Geometric Series Calculation**: For each depth $ d $ from 2 to 60, we use binary search to find a valid $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $. The `compute_sum` function efficiently checks if the sum exceeds the target value $ n $ and returns early if it does.\n- **Binary Search**: For each depth $ d $, we adjust the upper bound for $ k $ dynamically and perform binary search to check if any valid $ k $ exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph within the constraints, leveraging the properties of geometric series and binary search for optimal performance.",
