She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The browser has n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current open tabs' boundaries), or close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. The challenge is to find the minimal steps to get only the [l, r] tabs open.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what needs to be done. The tabs outside of [l, r] need to be closed. So, depending on where the current position is, and where l and r are, we need to find the optimal way to close those tabs.\n\nLet me consider the different scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], maybe we don't need to do anything if l to r is already the entire range. But otherwise, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nBut how do the operations work? Closing tabs to the left or right requires that the cursor is positioned at a certain point. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the current cursor, you have to be at some position i, then perform that operation. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal steps to reach positions where you can perform the closing operations.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed. Let's say that the required segment is [l, r]. So any tabs before l must be closed, and any after r must be closed. \n\nSo, for the left side: we need to close all tabs to the left of l. To do that, we need to be at position l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, for the right side, we need to be at position r, then close all tabs to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close multiple sections in one go. But I think that's not possible. Because once you close some tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of open tabs) change. But in this problem, the initial state is all tabs open. So when we start, the a is 1 and b is n. But once we close some tabs, the a and b will adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial state is all tabs open. So, the initial a and b are 1 and n. But when you close tabs, the a and b would be adjusted. However, in this problem, the goal is to close all tabs outside [l, r]. So during the process, the a and b would be changing as we close tabs.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal strategy is to first close all tabs to the left of l, and then close all tabs to the right of r. Or vice versa. Or maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the first example:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The required tabs are 2,3,4. The initial tabs are 1-6. So she needs to close tabs 1,5,6.\n\nIn the example solution, she moves to tab 2, closes left (which would close tab 1). Then moves to 3, then 4, and closes right (closing 5 and 6). Let's count steps:\n\nMoving from 3 to 2: 1 second. Then close left: 1 second. Then moving from 2 to 3 (1 sec), then 3 to 4 (another sec). Then close right (1 sec). Total is 1+1 + 2 + 1 = 5 seconds. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe she could first close the right side first. Let's see: suppose she moves to 4 (current position is 3, so moving right once to 4. Then close all tabs to the right (so closing 5 and 6). Then she needs to close tabs to the left of 2. So she needs to move to 2, then close left. How long would that take?\n\nFrom 3 to 4 (1 sec), close right (1 sec). Then from 4, move left to 3 (1 sec), then to 2 (another sec). Close left (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1 + 2 + 1 = 5 again. Same total.\n\nSo regardless of the order, maybe the steps are the same. But maybe in some cases, the order matters.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 6 3 1 3. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Target Positions**: Determine the positions where Luba needs to close tabs. Specifically, she needs to close tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`.\n2. **Calculate Movement Steps**: Calculate the steps required to move the cursor to the appropriate positions to perform the closing operations efficiently.\n3. **Determine Closing Operations**: Depending on the initial position and the target segment, decide whether moving to the left or right first would minimize the total steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    pos = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    r = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    # If the current segment is already the entire range, no action needed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Determine if we need to close left and/or right\n    close_left = l > 1\n    close_right = r < n\n\n    # Calculate the steps needed\n    steps = 0\n\n    # If we need to close left\n    if close_left:\n        # Need to reach l, then close left\n        steps += abs(pos - l)\n        steps += 1  # closing left\n\n    # If we need to close right\n    if close_right:\n        # Need to reach r, then close right\n        # But after closing left, the current position is l, so need to move to r\n        # Or, if we didn't close left, current position is pos\n        # So calculate the movement from the current position (after possible left close)\n        if close_left:\n            steps += abs(l - r)\n        else:\n            steps += abs(pos - r)\n        steps += 1  # closing right\n\n    # However, there's a possibility that we can optimize by closing right first\n    # Let's compute both scenarios and choose the minimum\n\n    # Alternative scenario: close right first, then left\n    alt_steps = 0\n    if close_right:\n        alt_steps += abs(pos - r)\n        alt_steps += 1\n    if close_left:\n        if close_right:\n            alt_steps += abs(r - l)\n        else:\n            alt_steps += abs(pos - l)\n        alt_steps += 1\n\n    # Also, consider the case where we don't need to move at all if pos is already in the right place\n    # For example, if we need to close left and right, but pos is already at l or r?\n\n    # Choose the minimum between the two scenarios\n    total_steps = min(steps, alt_steps)\n\n    print(total_steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] is already the entire range of tabs, no operations are needed.\n3. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n4. **Calculate Steps**: Compute the steps required for both scenarios (closing left first or closing right first) and choose the minimum of the two.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps by considering both possible orders of closing operations, thus optimizing the total time required.",
