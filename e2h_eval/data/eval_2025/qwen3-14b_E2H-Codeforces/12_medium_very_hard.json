The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. How many steps? Well, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around. Because moving clockwise, from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps. Then she does task 2. Then task 3 is at 3 again. So she's at 2, moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time taken to move from the previous position to the current task's position, moving clockwise. But how do we compute that?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two positions. Suppose Xenia is currently at position prev, and needs to go to position curr. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (curr - prev) mod n if curr >= prev? No, wait. Wait, if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then moving clockwise would be (n - prev + curr) steps. For example, n=4, prev=3, curr=2: steps are 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Well, (curr - prev) is -1, but adding n gives 3. So yes, the formula would be (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Alternatively, (curr - prev) % n? Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then (curr - prev) is negative. Let's take the example where prev=3, curr=2, n=4. (curr - prev) is -1. Mod n would be 3, which is correct. So the number of steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev + n) % n. But wait, if curr is greater than prev, then (curr - prev) is positive, and adding n would make it larger than n. But mod n would give the same as (curr - prev). So maybe the correct formula is (curr - prev) % n? Let me test.\n\nFor prev=3, curr=2, n=4: (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. For prev=1, curr=3, n=4: (3-1) mod 4 = 2, which is correct. So yes, the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) mod n. But wait, what if curr is equal to prev? Then steps are zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each task in order, compute the steps from the previous position (initially 1) to the current a_i, and accumulate the total.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in a list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if a_i is the same as a_{i+1}, then moving from a_i to a_{i+1} takes zero steps. So the code needs to process each task in order, and for each task, compute the steps from the previous position to the current a_i, and add that to the total.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a:\n\n    steps = (current_task - current_position) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_position = current_task\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's check the first example. The list is [3,2,3]. Let's process each step:\n\ncurrent_position starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. steps = (3-1) mod 4 = 2 → add 2. total is 2. current becomes 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. steps = (2-3) mod 4 → (-1) mod 4 = 3 → add 3 → total 5. current becomes 2.\n\nThird task is 3. steps = (3-2) mod 4 = 1 → add 1 → total 6. Which matches the example. So yes.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, tasks [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2)=1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps 0 → total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the second example.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing each task in order, accumulating the steps from the previous position to the current task's position, using the formula (current_task - previous_position) mod n.\n\nBut wait, why is that correct? Because the movement is clockwise, and the minimal steps between two positions is exactly that. Because the ringroad is a circle, and moving clockwise, the distance between prev and curr is (curr - prev) mod n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, considering the input. The input is two lines. First line has n and m. Second line has m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'], but perhaps that's a way to represent multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. But the sample input shows two different inputs, each with their own outputs. However, the user's problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or is that part of the example?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The user says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains m integers a_1 ... a_m.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as two separate cases. However, perhaps that's part of the example showing two different test cases. But the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as two different cases. But the output is two different outputs. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? Or perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The input is given as two lines. The sample input shows two different test cases. But perhaps that's not the case. Wait, the original problem's sample input may have two test cases. But the user's problem here says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains m integers.\n\nSo for each test case, there are two lines. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nand the output is 6.\n\nThen another input is:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\noutput is 2.\n\nBut perhaps the user's code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\nWhich is perhaps a way to represent two test cases. However, the actual problem may not have multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check the original problem.\n\nLooking back, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains m integers a_1 ... a_m.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. Therefore, the sample input may have two test cases, but perhaps that's an error. However, the user's code needs to process a single test case. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. However, the sample output shows two outputs. So perhaps the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement says nothing about that. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The original problem is from Codeforces, perhaps. Let me think. The problem is called \"Xenia and Ringroad\", which is a Codeforces problem. Let me recall. Oh right, in the original problem, there is only one test case. So perhaps the sample input shown here is a mistake. For example, perhaps the user intended to show two different examples, but in reality, the code should process one test case. So in the problem, the code should read n and m, then the list of a_i's, and output the answer.\n\nTherefore, the code should read from stdin, process one test case, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the total time as per the steps discussed.\n\nNow, the code in Python would be straightforward.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. Then the total time is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: m=0? But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Wait, the input says m is between 1 and 1e5. So m can be 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when moving from the last house to the first. For example, n=4, current position is 4, next task is 1. Steps would be (1-4) mod 4 = (-3) mod 4 = 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is one step.\n\nAnother example: current position is 4, next task is 2. (2-4) mod 4 is (-2) mod4 = 2. Which is steps 4→1→2: 2 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each ai in the list:\n\n   steps = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, let's test the first example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2 → total 2.\n\ncurrent_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4=3 → total 5.\n\ncurrent_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1 → total 6. Correct.\n\nSample Output is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4=1 → total 1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2)=1 → total 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: 0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split().\n\nBut for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin. However, for the problem constraints (n and m up to 1e5), using input() should be acceptable.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the list a is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod2=0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Steps (2-1) mod2=1 → output 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5, 1]. Steps for first is (5-1) mod5=4 → total 4. Then (1-5) mod5= ( -4 ) mod5 = 1 → total 5. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct: moving from 1 to 5 (4 steps), then from 5 to 1 (1 step).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code in Python is straightforward. So the code is as written above.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values? No. Wait, in Python, (-1) %4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to compute the time taken to move between consecutive tasks efficiently, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. Moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from house `prev` to house `curr` can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The formula `(curr - prev) % n` gives the correct number of steps needed to move clockwise from `prev` to `curr`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in sequence, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the next task's house and accumulate this time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time initialized to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the steps required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Add the computed steps to the total time and update the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
