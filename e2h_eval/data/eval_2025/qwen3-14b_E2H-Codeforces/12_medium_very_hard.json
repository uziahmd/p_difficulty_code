The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3 (time 2), then from 3 to 4→1→2 (time 3 more?), then from 2 to 3 (time 1). Total 2+3+1 = 6? Wait, maybe I should think of each step between consecutive tasks.\n\nWait, the initial position is house 1. For the first task, which is at 3. How much time does it take to get there? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around. Because from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2: that's 3 steps. Then, third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. So total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time between them. But how?\n\nThe main challenge is to compute the distance between two consecutive houses in the ringroad. Since the movement is clockwise, the distance from current position to next target is (target - current) mod n? Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose current is at position a, and the next target is b. How many steps to move clockwise?\n\nIf a < b, then the steps are b - a. If a > b, then steps are (n - a) + b. Because you go from a to n (n - a steps), then from 1 to b (b steps). So total steps is (b - a) if a < b, else (n - a + b).\n\nBut wait, for example, if a is 3 and b is 2 in a ringroad of 4 houses. Then the steps would be 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between a and b is (b - a) if a <= b, else (n - a + b). Alternatively, this can be written as (b - a) % n if the movement is allowed to be clockwise. Wait, no. Because if a is 3 and b is 2, (b -a) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So yes, (b - a) mod n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, for example, when a=1 and b=3, (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. When a=3 and b=2, (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between a and b is (b - a) mod n. But since the movement is only clockwise, that's the correct way to compute it.\n\nBut wait, what if a is 1 and b is 1? Then the distance is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the distance between the current position and the next task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. The distance from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Because if a_1 is 3, then moving from 1 to 3 is 2 steps. Which is (3 -1) mod 4 is 2. Correct. If a_1 is 2, then (2-1) mod 4 is 1. Correct. If a_1 is 1, then 0 steps. So yes.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m:\n\n   compute distance between current_position and a_i.\n\n   add that distance to total_time.\n\n   set current_position to a_i.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of all these distances.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the distance is zero, so nothing added. So that's handled correctly.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing each task in order, and adding the distance between the current position and the next task's position, then updating the current position.\n\nSo the key is to process the list of a_i's in order, and for each step, calculate the distance between previous position and current a_i.\n\nNow, the input is given as n and m, then m integers a_1 to a_m.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nfor each a_i in the list:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n ?\n\nWait, no. Because (a_i - current_pos) could be negative. But in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers in a way that might not be desired. Wait, for example, if current_pos is 3, a_i is 2, n is 4. (2 -3) is -1. -1 mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for example, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, (a_i - current_pos) % n gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, let's test some examples.\n\nCase 1: current_pos = 3, a_i = 2, n =4. (2-3) = -1. -1 mod 4 = 3. Correct.\n\nCase 2: current_pos = 1, a_i = 3. (3-1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\nCase 3: current_pos = 4, a_i = 1. (1-4) = -3 mod 4 is 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step (since it's clockwise, moving from 4 to 1 is one step).\n\nYes. So the formula (a_i - current_pos) % n gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result. So for example, (a_i - current_pos) could be negative, but mod n will give the correct positive value.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    delta = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nreturn total_time\n\nBut wait, let's test the first example.\n\nFirst example input is n=4, m=3, a = [3, 2, 3].\n\nLet's process each step:\n\nInitial current_pos = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. delta = (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. delta = (2-3) mod 4 = (-1 mod 4) = 3. total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. delta = (3-2) mod4 = 1. total_time is 5+1=6. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nAnother example given is input '4 3\\n2 3 3', output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2. delta is (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3. delta (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3. delta is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the delta is (1-1) mod2=0. So total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [1, 2]. First step: 1 to 1: 0. Then 1 to 2: (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [2, 1]. First step: (2-1) mod2 = 1. Then (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 = 1. Total is 2. Which makes sense: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the problem is to read the input correctly. The input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nThen read the second line, split into m integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, there might be leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as input().split(), then convert to integers.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the above logic.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list a.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\n   compute delta = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   add delta to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to ai.\n\nFinally, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the problem statement, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of m integers.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. delta is (3-1) mod4= 2. total is 2.\n\ncurrent_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3. total is 5.\n\ncurrent_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 6. Output 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a = [2,1]. Output is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator for negative numbers returns a positive value. For example, (-1) %4 is 3. So yes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but let's check the case where the list is empty. But according to the problem statement, m ≥1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=1, a=[1]. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5, 1]. The first step is (5-1) mod5 =4. Then (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 = 1. Total time is 4+1=5. Which is correct: 1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps), then 5→1 (1 step). Total 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, the distance between two houses can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. The distance from house `a` to house `b` in a clockwise direction is `(b - a) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in sequence, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the next task's house using the modulo operation. Accumulate these times to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Add this distance to the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle circular movements, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
