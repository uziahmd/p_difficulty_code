The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is calculated as 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8 cells, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. Then the next is two cells in, which would make the next rectangle smaller by 2 cells on each side. So the width and height decrease by 2*2=4 each time? Oh right, because for each ring, you're moving in by 1 cell on each side, so the total reduction is 2 cells per side. So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are w - 4*(i-1) and h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for the first ring, i=1, so it's w and h. Then for i=2, subtract 4*(1) from each dimension. So that makes sense.\n\nBut then, for each ring, we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle, and sum them all.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   - Compute current_width = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - Compute perimeter: 2*(current_width + current_height - 2)\n\n   - Add to total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_width or current_height becomes less than 1? Well, the constraints on k ensure that this doesn't happen. Because the input k is given such that it's <= floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check that.\n\nFor example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3 + 1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which would make for i=1, current_width and current_height are 3 and 3. Then for i=2, 3-4*(1) = -1. But since k is limited, that's not allowed. So the constraints on k ensure that for all i up to k, the current_width and current_height are at least 3? Or maybe more?\n\nWait, let me think. The formula for k is floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let's take min(w, h) as m. So for example, if m is 3, then (3 + 1)/4 is 1, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For that case, the first ring is 3x3, which is okay. For i=1, the dimensions are 3 and 3. For i=2, it would be 3-4*(1) = -1, but since k is 1, that's not possible.\n\nSo the constraints ensure that for each i from 1 to k, the current_width and current_height are at least 3? Wait, maybe not. Let's take m=5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. But if m=7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. For i=2, the current dimensions would be 7 -4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. Which is okay. So for each i up to k, the current dimensions are at least 3? Because when i=k, then the dimensions are:\n\ncurrent_width = w -4*(k-1)\n\ncurrent_height = h -4*(k-1)\n\nBut since k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ), where m is min(w, h). Let me see. Suppose m is",
