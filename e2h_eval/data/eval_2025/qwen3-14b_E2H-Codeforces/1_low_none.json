The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the next one is 2*2=4 less in both dimensions. Wait, for example, the first ring is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from each edge. So the original rectangle is w x h. Then the next ring would be (w - 4) x (h -4) ? Because for each side, you subtract 2. So for example, if you have a rectangle of width w, then subtracting 2 from each side (left and right) gives w - 2*2 = w-4. Same for height.\n\nSo each ring is the perimeter of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if that rectangle is valid. But how do we compute the perimeter for each ring?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle (for the number of cells in the border) is 2*(width + height - 2). Because for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter cells are the outermost layer. The formula for the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but the corners are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Which gives 8, which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each i, the rectangle must have at least 1 row and column. So, for each i, we need to check if the current dimensions are valid. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, maybe that's ensuring that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So for example, for the i-th ring, the width and height after subtracting 4*(i-1) must be at least 1. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait 2*(3+5) is 16, minus 4 gives 12? Wait 3+5 is 8, multiplied by 2 is 16. Subtract 4 (because corners counted twice?), yes. So 16-4=12. Then total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example's output.\n\nYes, so that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is: for each i from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (",
