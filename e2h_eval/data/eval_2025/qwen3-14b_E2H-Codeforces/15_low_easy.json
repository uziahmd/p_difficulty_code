They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, there's a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has multiple phases. Each phase halves the number of teams. The results of each game in a phase depend on the skill levels of the teams. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the string s tells us whether higher or lower skill wins. For example, if s_i is 0, then in that phase, the team with lower skill level wins each match. If it's 1, then higher skill wins.\n\nThe task is to find all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) that can be the winning team for some permutation p of the skill levels. So, for each x, determine if there exists a permutation p where x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. How to model this? Well, the key is to figure out for each possible x, what conditions must be satisfied so that x can be the champion given the rules of the tournament.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament proceeds. Each round, the teams are paired, and based on the current phase's rule, the winner is determined. The structure of the tournament is a binary tree. Each team must win all their matches in each phase until the end.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily, we need to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the other teams such that x can win all required matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the permutation p is given, and the string s determines the outcomes. But we need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nSo the question is: for a given x, can we arrange the permutation p such that when the tournament is run with the rules given by s, x is the winner.\n\nLet me think about how to model the tournament for a given x. Let's think recursively. Let's consider each round (phase) and what must happen for x to proceed through each phase.\n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} games. Each game is between two consecutive teams. The winner of each game moves on to the next phase. Then, in phase 2, the winners are grouped into pairs again, etc.\n\nBut the rules for each phase are given by the string s. For phase i (assuming that the first phase is phase 1?), the rule is s[i-1] (since the string is of length n).\n\nWait, the problem says: the string s has length n. Each character corresponds to the i-th phase. For example, the first phase (with 2^{n-1} games) is phase 1, and the i-th phase has 2^{n - i} games. So for phase i, the rule is s[i-1], since the string is 0-based.\n\nSo, for example, if n is 3, then the string is of length 3. The first phase (i=1) uses s[0], the second phase (i=2) uses s[1], third phase (i=3) uses s[2].\n\nNow, for x to be the champion, it must win all matches in each phase. Let's think about the tournament structure as a binary tree. Each match in a phase is part of a bracket.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for x to win?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to reach the final, in each round, it must be placed in a position where it can win according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be arranged, perhaps we can model for each round, what constraints are placed on the possible opponents of x.\n\nLet me think about the first phase. Suppose the first phase uses rule s_0 (s[0]). In this phase, x must win its match. Depending on the rule, that requires that x's skill is either higher or lower than its opponent.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, we can choose which team x is paired with in each round, as long as the other teams are arranged in a way that allows x to proceed.\n\nWait, but the pairing is fixed based on the initial order. For example, in the first phase, the teams are split into pairs (1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc.). So the initial arrangement of the permutation p will determine which teams are in which positions. However, since we can choose any permutation p, we can arrange the initial positions of the teams in any way.\n\nTherefore, to find if x can be the champion, we need to arrange the permutation such that x is in a position where, in each phase, it can win against its opponent, given the rule for that phase.\n\nSo, the idea is that for each phase, x must have opponents that",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure and rules are defined by a string where each character indicates whether the higher or lower skill level team wins in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree with $2^n$ teams. Each phase halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (given by the string `s`) indicating whether the higher (`1`) or lower (`0`) skill level team wins.\n3. **Skill Constraints**: For a team with skill level `x` to be a champion, it must win all matches in each phase. This requires that in each phase, `x` is paired with opponents that allow it to win according to the phase's rule.\n4. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, we calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of `x` that can win based on the rules of that phase. This involves maintaining ranges of valid values as we move through each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    size = 2 ** n\n    min_val = [1] * (n + 1)\n    max_val = [size] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if s[i - 1] == '0':\n            # Lower skill wins in this phase\n            # So x must be the minimum in its bracket\n            min_val[i] = min_val[i - 1]\n            max_val[i] = max_val[i - 1] - 1\n        else:\n            # Higher skill wins in this phase\n            # So x must be the maximum in its bracket\n            min_val[i] = min_val[i - 1] + 1\n            max_val[i] = max_val[i - 1]\n    \n    result = []\n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        if min_val[n] <= x <= max_val[n]:\n            result.append(str(x))\n    \n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values for `n` and the string `s`.\n2. **Range Tracking**: We use two arrays, `min_val` and `max_val`, to track the valid range of skill levels that can win the tournament through each phase.\n3. **Phase Iteration**: For each phase, we update the valid range based on the rule (higher or lower skill wins). If the rule is '0', the valid range narrows to lower values; if '1', it narrows to higher values.\n4. **Result Collection**: After processing all phases, we collect all skill levels within the final valid range and print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the valid skill levels by iteratively narrowing down the possible values through each phase of the tournament, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
