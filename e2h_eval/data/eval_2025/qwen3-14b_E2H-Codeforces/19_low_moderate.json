The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between every pair of districts), and we need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to maximize the sum. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the higher-numbered districts contribute way more than the lower ones. Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how do we do that? Well, the optimal strategy would be to keep the largest possible districts, but we need to make sure they are connected. So maybe we can think of it as selecting a subset of n - k districts that form a connected subtree, and which includes the highest possible numbers.\n\nWait, but since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible districts, perhaps the best approach is to select the largest (n - k) districts, but ensure that they form a connected subtree. However, if they aren't connected, we need to remove some of the smaller ones to connect them.\n\nBut how do we find which districts to remove?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a problem where we need to choose a subtree of size (n -k) that has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum depends on the districts kept, and the districts are numbered from 1 to n, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how can we find such a subtree?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to start with the largest districts and greedily include them, making sure that they are connected. But how?\n\nAnother idea: since the districts with higher numbers contribute more, we want to keep them. So perhaps we can think of the problem as selecting a connected subtree that includes as many of the largest districts as possible. So, the process could be:\n\n- Start with all districts except the first k ones (but that might not be connected). But that's probably not correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a priority problem. We need to keep the districts with the highest possible numbers. So, perhaps the optimal set is the largest (n -k) districts, but if they are not connected, we need to remove some of the smaller ones and add some larger ones. But how?\n\nWait, but the largest (n -k) districts may not form a connected subtree. For example, imagine that district n is connected only to district 1, and the rest of the districts form a chain. If we need to remove k=1, then we can't just remove district 1, because then the remaining districts would include n and others, but maybe not connected. Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal set of districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree, and the sum is maximized. Since the sum is maximized when we have as many high-numbered districts as possible, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we want to keep the highest (n -k) districts, but if they are not connected, we need to remove some of the lower-numbered ones among them and add some higher ones.\n\nWait, but how can we check if the largest (n -k) districts form a connected subtree? Because if they do, then that's the optimal solution. Otherwise, we need to find which ones to remove.\n\nBut checking that directly might be computationally intensive. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of building a subtree. The maximum sum is achieved by keeping the districts with the largest possible numbers. So, we need to select a subtree that contains as many of the largest numbers as possible. So, perhaps the solution is to start with the largest districts and then find which ones to keep so that the subtree is connected.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that the optimal subtree must include the largest possible districts. So, perhaps we can perform a greedy algorithm where we start with the largest district, and then add the next largest districts that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how do we manage that? Let's think about the following steps:\n\n1. The districts are numbered from 1 to n. The value of each is 2^i, so higher numbers are better.\n\n2. We need to select (n -k) districts that form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we want to include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\n3. So, perhaps the optimal way is to select the (n -k) largest districts, but ensure that they are connected. If they are not connected, we need to remove some of the smaller ones (from the selected ones) and replace them with",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, ensuring there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Selection**: Since higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more fans, we prioritize keeping these districts.\n3. **Connected Subtree**: We need to ensure that the selected districts form a connected subtree.

But this doesn't directly help.\n\n    # Given time constraints, perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\n    # We start with the highest node. Then, we perform a BFS or DFS to collect all nodes in the tree, and mark them as included if they are among the top (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # Wait, no. That's not helpful.\n\n    # Let's look for an alternative solution. Consider that the optimal subtree must contain the largest possible nodes. Therefore, we can perform a BFS/DFS starting from the highest node and greedily include the largest nodes first.\n\n    # Here's a better plan:\n\n    # 1. We want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n    # 2. Start with the highest node.\n    # 3. Perform a BFS/DFS from this node, and during traversal, prioritize visiting nodes with higher numbers. This way, we collect the largest possible nodes that are connected to the initial node.\n\n    # This approach ensures that we include the largest nodes connected to the starting node, which is the highest-numbered node.\n\n    # This sounds promising. Let's implement this.\n\n    # We can use a priority queue (max-heap) to perform a modified BFS, always selecting the next highest-numbered node to visit.\n\n    # Let's try this:\n\n    # Start with the highest node, mark it as included.\n    # Use a max-heap to store the nodes that are adjacent to the current component but not yet included.\n    # For each step, extract the highest node from the heap, include it, and add its neighbors to the heap if not already included.\n\n    # This way, we include the largest possible nodes in the connected component.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # Initialize the included array\n    included = [False] * (n + 1)\n    included[start_node] = True\n    count = 1\n\n    # Use a priority queue (max-heap) to store nodes to consider\n    # We can use a max-heap, but Python's heapq is min-heap, so we store negatives\n    heap = []\n    # Start with the highest node's neighbors\n    for neighbor in edges[start_node]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))  # (priority, node)\n\n    # Now, while we haven't included enough nodes\n    while count < (n - k):\n        if not heap:\n            break  # shouldn't happen as per problem constraints\n        # Get the next highest node\n        neg_node, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if included[node]:\n            continue\n        # Include this node\n        included[node] = True\n        count += 1\n        # Add its neighbors to the heap\n        for neighbor in edges[node]:\n            if not included[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n    # Now, the included array has the nodes we want to keep\n    # The nodes to remove are those not included\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not included[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    # Sort the result and print\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()",
