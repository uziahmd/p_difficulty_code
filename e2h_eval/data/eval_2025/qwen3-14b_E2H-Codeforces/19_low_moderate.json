The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair of districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to select a subset of n - k districts that are connected, and maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which grows exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. Because higher numbers contribute way more to the sum. So the strategy should be to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how do we ensure connectivity? Well, perhaps we can think of it as choosing a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But since the tree is connected, maybe we need to find a way to select the nodes with the highest values, but also ensure that they are connected.\n\nWait, but the problem is similar to finding a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of their 2^i is maximum. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. However, the challenge is to select those nodes in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the approach might be to start from the highest-numbered node and greedily include as many high nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting which nodes to remove. Since we need to remove k nodes, and the remaining must form a connected component. The problem is equivalent to selecting a connected subtree of size (n - k), which has the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how do we find that subtree? Since the sum is maximized by keeping higher-numbered nodes, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes from some high number down, but connected. However, the tree structure may not allow that.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum sum is achieved by including all the nodes with numbers greater than or equal to some value, but connected. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to choose which nodes to keep. Since the higher-numbered nodes contribute more, we want to keep them. So perhaps we can start by considering all nodes except the first k ones, but that's not necessarily connected. So we need to find a way to select the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think of the process as follows:\n\nWe want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps we can start by including the highest-numbered node (node n), and then include as many higher-numbered nodes as possible, ensuring that they are connected. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, but the tree is connected. So if we have to keep a subset of nodes that includes the highest possible nodes, maybe we can perform a kind of priority-based selection where we select the nodes with the highest values, and then check if they are connected. However, checking connectivity for arbitrary subsets is not efficient.\n\nAlternative idea: since the nodes' values are 2^i, which are unique and ordered, the optimal set of nodes to keep is the set of the (n - k) nodes with the highest numbers, provided that they form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes and include higher ones. But how to find that?\n\nBut how can we check if the top (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree? For example, if the tree is a chain like 1-2-3-4-5-6, and k=3, then the top 3 nodes are 4,5,6. They form a connected subtree (since 4 is connected to 5 and 6 via 5?), no. Wait, if the tree is 1-2-3-4-5-6, then 4,5,6 are connected as a chain. So yes. So the maximum sum would be 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6.\n\nBut what if the tree is structured such that the highest nodes are not connected? For example, imagine a star-shaped tree where node 6 is connected to node 1, node 2, node 3, etc. Then, if we want to keep nodes 4,5,6. But node 4 and 5 are not connected to 6 unless they are connected through another node. So in this case, the nodes 4,5,6 may not be connected. Therefore, we need to find a connected subset that includes as many high-numbered",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine which districts to remove from the tree structure such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and maximize the sum of fans, where each district's fan count is given by $2^i$.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ increases exponentially with $i$, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Constraint**: The remaining districts must be connected. This implies we must choose a connected subtree of size $n - k$.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Greedy Approach**: Start from the highest-numbered node and use a priority queue (max heap) to always consider the next highest-value node that can be included in the connected component.\n- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)**: Efficiently check and merge connected components.\n- **Traversal**: Perform a DFS or BFS from the highest-numbered node to ensure connectivity.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Build the Tree**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.\n2. **Prioritize Nodes**: Use a max heap to prioritize nodes with higher values.\n3. **DFS/BFS for Connectivity**: Starting from the highest node, traverse the tree to include as many high-value nodes as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n4. **Track Removals**: Keep track of which nodes are kept and which are removed.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data) and data[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(data):\n        return\n    \n    n, k = map(int, data[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        while idx < len(data) and data[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(data):\n            break\n        a, b = map(int, data[idx].split())\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts\n    # Start from the highest number and try to build the connected component\n    # Using BFS/DFS to find the connected component that includes the largest nodes\n    # Use a max heap to process the largest nodes first\n    \n    # Mark nodes to keep\n    keep = [False] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Start with the highest node\n    start = n\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append(start)\n    visited[start] = True\n    keep[start] = True\n    count = 1\n    \n    while count < n - k:\n        # Find the next highest node not yet in the connected component\n        # We need to check all nodes not in the current component\n        max_node = -1\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                max_node = i\n                break\n        if max_node == -1:\n            break\n        \n        # Check if it's connected to the current component\n        # Use BFS or DFS to see if there's a path from the current component to max_node\n        # If yes, add it to the component\n        # Else, skip (but this shouldn't happen because the tree is connected)\n        # So we can just perform BFS from the current component to reach max_node\n        # However, since the tree is connected, we can directly connect it via traversal\n        \n        # To avoid repeated work, we can perform a BFS/DFS from the current component to find the next node\n        # Let's use BFS to find the next node and expand the component\n        # But this approach may not be efficient enough for large n\n        \n        # Alternative approach: start from the highest node and do BFS/DFS to mark all reachable nodes\n        # Then collect the top (n - k) nodes from the reachable set\n        \n        # So let's do a BFS/DFS starting from the highest node and collect all reachable nodes\n        # Then pick the top (n - k) ones among them\n        \n        # But this would not work directly because the initial BFS may not include enough nodes\n        # So instead, let's use a priority queue to always pick the next highest node that can be connected\n        \n        # Another approach: use a max heap to store all nodes not yet in the component, and try to connect them\n        # This is similar to Krusky's algorithm for MST\n        \n        # Build a max heap of all nodes not in the component\n        # But we need to check if they can be connected\n        \n        # Instead, let's do a BFS/DFS from the highest node and collect all reachable nodes\n        # Then, among those, select the top (n - k) nodes\n        \n        # But we need to make sure that the component is connected and has size (n - k)\n        \n        # So here's a better plan:\n        # 1.
