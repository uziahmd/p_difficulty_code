After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for three subjects.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nSo, how to process the data?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read the next n lines as a list of strings. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe subjects are columns 0, 1, 2.\n\nSubject 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2. So any student with 2 in subject 0 is best here. Student 1 and 2 have 2 here. But wait, student 1's first subject is 2, student 2's first is 2. But the max is 2. So both are best in subject 0? Wait, but the note says in the first sample, student 1 is best in subject 1 and 3. Wait, maybe I need to check the indexes correctly.\n\nWait the first sample input is:\n\nStudents are:\n\nStudent 1: 2 2 3 → subjects 0, 1, 2?\n\nWait the first sample input is:\n\nThe input is 3 3, then the three lines are 223, 232, 112.\n\nSo student 1's marks are [2,2,3], student 2's are [2,3,2], student 3's are [1,1,2].\n\nFor subject 0 (the first column), the marks are 2, 2, 1. The maximum is 2. So students 1 and 2 are best in this subject. But according to the note, student 1 is best in subject 1 and 3. Wait, maybe the subjects are 0-based or 1-based? The problem says \"subjects 1 and 3\" in the note. Wait the first sample input's first student has marks 2,2,3. So for subject 1 (assuming 0-based, it's the second column) the marks are 2,3,1. So the max is 3, which is student 2. So student 2 is best in subject 1 (second column). But the note says student 1 is best in subjects 1 and 3. Wait maybe the subjects are 1-based in the note. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the first sample test, the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3. Let's see. The first student's marks are 2,2,3. So for subject 1 (if 1-based), the marks are 2,3,1. So student 1's mark is 2, but student 2 has 3. So why is student 1 best in subject 1? Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the note. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the note says: In the first sample test, student 1 is best at subjects 1 and 3. Let me look at the subjects. Let's think of subjects as 1-based.\n\nSubject 1: for all students, their marks are:\n\nstudent 1: 2, student 2: 2, student 3: 1. So maximum is 2. So student 1 and 2 are best here. So student 1 is best in subject 1. Then subject 3: student 1 has 3, student 2 has 2, student 3 has 2. So student 1 is the only best here. So student 1 is best in subject 1 and 3. So that's why the note says that.\n\nSo for each subject, the maximum is determined, and any student who has that maximum in that subject is considered best in that subject. So the problem is to check for each student if they have at least one subject where they are the best.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each subject (column), compute the maximum value.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, then count them.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines as a list of strings. Then, convert each string into a list of integers. So for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each column (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value. So for column j, iterate through all students' marks in that column and find the max.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column. If yes, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then read n lines.\n\nBut in Python, the input can be read via input() function. However, when dealing with multiple test cases, perhaps the input is given as multiple lines. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first sample. Wait, looking at the example input given:\n\nThe first example input is ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'] — but that's probably the input for two test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Wait no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as the first line with n and m, then n lines of m digits. So for each test case, the code reads n and m, then the n lines. However, the sample input shows two examples. But in the problem statement, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. Because the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the actual code is supposed to process one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line with n and m, then n lines. The output is the single number. So the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows two examples. But that's probably for the purpose of the example. So the code should read from stdin once.\n\nWait, the user provided the sample input as a list of two examples. But in reality, the code should read from standard input, which for the problem would be a single test case. So the code should read n and m, then read n lines, process, output the answer.\n\nSo, the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nThen process.\n\nSo, the first step is to read the data.\n\nOnce the data is read, for each column, find the max.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\ngrades = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nmax_per_subject = [2, 3, 3]\n\nWait, for column 0:\n\nstudents have 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3.\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3.\n\nSo for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nStudent 1: [2,2,3]. For column 0, 2 is equal to max (2) → yes. So he is successful. Also, column 2 has 3 which is the max. So he's successful.\n\nStudent 2: [2,3,2]. Column 0: 2 is max. So yes. Also column 1 has 3 which is max. So successful.\n\nStudent 3: [1,1,2]. For column 0, 1 < 2. column 1: 1 <3. column 2: 2 <3. So no. So not successful. Hence total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to compute for each student, whether they have at least one mark that is the max in their respective column.\n\nNow, how to compute the max per column.\n\nIn Python, for each column j, iterate over all rows (students) and collect the j-th element.\n\nSo for example, for grades as a list of lists, for j in range(m):\n\nmax_val = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\nSo, for each column, compute that.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo for each student, loop through their marks. For each mark in position j, check if it equals max_per_subject[j]. If any of them is true, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. Convert each string into a list of integers. So for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nCompute max_per_subject as a list of m elements, where max_per_subject[j] is the maximum value in column j.\n\nThen, for each student in the list, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to max_per_subject[j]. If yes, increment the count.\n\nSo, the code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read n lines:\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_per_subject:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each column j, get the max.\n\nOnce that is done, for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max for that column.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo, for each student, loop through each of their marks. If any of them is equal to the max in that column, then count and break.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the first student has in column 0 (subject 0) 2, which is the max. So he is counted once. Then, the code breaks and moves to next student. So that's correct.\n\nTesting this code on the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nFor first student: 2 (column 0) is equal to 2 → yes. So count increases by 1.\n\nSecond student: column 0 is 2 (equal to 2) → yes. So count increases by 1.\n\nThird student: for column 0, 1 < 2. column 1: 1 <3. column 2: 2 <3. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8]\n\n[1,1,8,2,8]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nSo max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nNow check each student.\n\nFirst student: [9,1,7,2,8]. Check each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9 == 9 → yes. So counted.\n\nSecond student: [1,1,8,2,8]. column 1: 1 ==1 → yes. Also column 2: 8 ==8 → yes. So counted.\n\nThird student: [1,1,1,1,1]. Check columns:\n\ncolumn 0: 1 <9. column 1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nThus total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase when all students have same marks. Like n=2, m=1. All have 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is best. So count is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for each column, max is 9. Both students have all marks equal to max. So each is counted once. So total 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 8], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for column 0, max is 9. Both students have 9. So student 1 has 9 in column 0, so counted. Student 2 has 9 in column 0 and 9 in column 1. So counted. So total 2.\n\nSo code seems to handle these.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code for max_per_subject could be written as:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nBut using list comprehensions is more concise. However, for code clarity, perhaps the code is better written as:\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(row[j] for row in grades) for j in range(m)]\n\nWait, since grades is a list of rows, each row is a list of integers. So for j in range(m), row[j] is the value in column j for that row. So for each j, max(row[j] for row in grades) gives the maximum value for column j.\n\nYes. So that's another way to write it.\n\nBut in the code, the original code uses:\n\ngrades[i][j] for i in range(n). But that's equivalent to row[j] for row in grades.\n\nSo, the code can be written either way.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the grades as a list of lists.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max for that column.\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. For example, in Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(row[j] for row in grades) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for j=0: max(2,2,1) =2; j=1: max(2,3,1)=3; j=2: max(3,2,2)=3.\n\nSo the code counts 2 students.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject for j=0: 9, j=1: 1, j=2:8, j=3:2, j=4:8.\n\nEach student:\n\nFirst student: 9 in j=0 → yes.\n\nSecond student: 1 in j=1 (max is 1) → yes.\n\nThird student: 1 in j=1 → yes.\n\nSo total 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1 followed by 5 and 5. Then max_per_subject is 5. Both students have 5. So count is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the grades of each student.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject, compute the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum grade in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(row[j] for row in grades) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as integers for the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Each subsequent line is converted into a list of integers representing the grades of a student.\n2. **Maximum Grades Calculation**: For each subject (column), we compute the maximum grade using a list comprehension. This gives us an array where each element represents the highest grade in the corresponding subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we iterate through their grades and check if any of their grades match the maximum grade for that subject. If a match is found, the student is counted as successful, and we move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 100).",
