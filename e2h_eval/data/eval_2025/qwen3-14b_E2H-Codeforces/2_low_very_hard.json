Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the problem says both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, all cells in the main diagonal must be the same as each other, and all cells in the other diagonal must be the same as each other. Also, the two diagonals must have the same letter? Or can they be different?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, that means that all the letters on the two diagonals are the same. So, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the other diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the wording is: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, each diagonal must have all letters same. But the two diagonals can have same or different letters? Or does it mean that both diagonals have the same letters (so same as each other)?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the letters on the paper form an 'X' if: on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh, so the first condition is that each diagonal has all same letters. But the two diagonals can have same or different letters? No, because the second condition says that all other squares have the same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares need to be different from both. But that's impossible unless the two diagonals have the same letter. Because suppose the main diagonal is 'x' and the other is 'y'. Then the other squares need to be a letter different from both x and y. But then, the other squares would have to be some third letter. But then, the problem says that all other squares have the same letter. So that's possible. But then, the problem says that the letters on the diagonals are same. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first condition.\n\nWait, the first condition is that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So for example, the main diagonal must have all same letters. The other diagonal must have all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters. However, the second condition says that all other squares (non-diagonal) have the same letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the two diagonals have different letters, then the non-diagonal letters must be different from both. But that's possible only if the two diagonals have different letters, but then the non-diagonal letters must be a third letter. However, the problem says that the non-diagonal letters must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals. So, for example, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the non-diagonal letters must be different from both. But that's possible. But then, how can the diagonals have different letters?\n\nBut looking at the sample input. Let's look at the second example:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe output is YES.\n\nLet's see. The diagonals here are:\n\nFor the first diagonal (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)): 'w', 's', 'w'. Wait, that's not all same. Wait, but the sample output says YES. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me recheck the sample input. Oh, the second input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe main diagonal is (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Ensure that all characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure that all characters not on the diagonals are the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Collect the characters from both diagonals\ndiag1 = set()\ndiag2 = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.add(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.add(grid[i][n - 1 - i])\n\n# Check if both diagonals have the same character\nif len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if both diagonals have the same character\n    if diag1 == diag2:\n        diagonal_char = diag1.pop()\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n    # Check all other cells\n    other_char = None\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            current_char = grid[i][j]\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = current_char\n            else:\n                if current_char != other_char:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if other_char == diagonal_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonals Check**: We use sets to collect characters from both diagonals. If either set has more than one unique character, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For each cell not on the diagonals, we check if they all have the same character. If they do, we ensure this character is different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Final Validation**: If all checks pass, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using sets and loops, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
