Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must have the same character. But wait, the problem says that both diagonals have all letters the same. So, for example, all cells in the main diagonal must be the same, and all cells in the anti-diagonal must be the same. However, the two diagonals can have different letters? No, wait the problem says that the letters on the diagonals are the same. Wait, the first condition says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, does that mean that all letters on both diagonals are the same? Like, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must have the same character?\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'a's and the anti-diagonal has all 'a's, then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's, then it's not okay. Because the letters on both diagonals must be the same. So both diagonals must have the same character. So, all cells on the main diagonal and all cells on the anti-diagonal must be the same character. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So, each diagonal must have all letters same. But the two diagonals can have different letters? Or do they have to be the same?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter X\" if:\n\n- on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;\n\n- all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\nSo, the first condition is that each diagonal has all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters? No, because the second condition says that the other squares have the same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the two diagonals have different letters, then what is the 'letter on the diagonals'? Because the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. So, perhaps the diagonals must have the same letter. Because otherwise, the other squares would have to be different from both, but if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares would have to be different from both. But the problem says that the other squares have the same letter. So, that implies that the diagonals must have the same letter. Otherwise, the other squares would have to be different from both, but the diagonals have two different letters. So, for example, if the diagonals are 'a' and 'b', then the other squares must be a letter that is different from both. But that's possible. However, the problem says that the other squares have the same letter. So, maybe the diagonals can have different letters. But then, the other squares must be a single letter different from both. But how can that be possible?\n\nWait, let me look at the example input. Let's see the second example input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nThe output is YES. Let's see. The diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0) = 'w', (1,1) = 's', (2,2) = 'w'. Wait, that's not all the same. Wait, but according to the sample input, the output is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait no, the sample input is given as:\n\nThe second input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Let me write the grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. So all same. The anti-diagonal is (0,2",

The conditions are that both diagonals of the square must have the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Ensure that all elements on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure that all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Collect the characters from both diagonals\ndiag1 = set()\ndiag2 = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.add(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.add(grid[i][n - 1 - i])\n\n# Check if both diagonals have the same character\nif len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if both diagonals have the same character\n    if diag1.pop() != diag2.pop():\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # Now check all other cells\n        other_char = None\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    continue\n                c = grid[i][j]\n                if other_char is None:\n                    other_char = c\n                elif c != other_char:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid and other_char != diag1.pop():\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We collect characters from both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal into sets. If either set has more than one unique character, the diagonals do not meet the criteria.\n3. **Character Consistency Check**: If both diagonals have the same character, we then check all non-diagonal elements to ensure they are consistent and different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Validation**: If all non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal characters, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using sets for diagonal checks and nested loops for non-diagonal elements, ensuring correctness and performance within the problem constraints.",
