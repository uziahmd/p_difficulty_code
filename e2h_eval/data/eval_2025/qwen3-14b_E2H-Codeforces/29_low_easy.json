Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The main challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing all occurrences in the string each time, that would be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which could be too slow for large inputs. Because for each query, replacing every occurrence of a digit might take O(len(s)) time, and with n queries, it's O(n * len(s)), which could be up to 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a certain digit with another string. But substitutions are applied in order. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', and then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '00' and then each '0' becomes '1', leading to '11'.\n\nBut if I process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe I can track how each digit is transformed. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in the order given. So the first query is applied first, then the next, etc. So the substitutions are cumulative. So the problem is that when a substitution is done, it affects all subsequent substitutions. For example, if I have a substitution for '2' and then later a substitution for '0', which was part of the replacement for '2', then the later substitution will affect the '0's that were added by the first substitution.\n\nBut if I model this as a mapping from each digit to its replacement, but considering that once a substitution is done, any future substitutions on the digits in the replacement string would also apply. However, if I process the queries in reverse order, perhaps I can build up some kind of transformation function for each digit. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think about the final result. Each original digit in the initial string s may be replaced multiple times. For example, suppose the initial string has a '2', and there's a query that replaces '2' with '3', and then another query that replaces '3' with '4'. Then the original '2' would become '3' then '4'.\n\nSo the key idea is that each substitution is applied in sequence, so the replacements are dependent on the order. Therefore, the problem is that when a substitution is made for a digit, all future substitutions will affect the digits that are in the replacement string.\n\nBut if I try to track for each digit what it's currently mapped to, I need to make sure that when a substitution is applied, I update the mappings accordingly. For example, if I have a mapping for digit d, and then I get a query that replaces d with some string t, then for each digit in t, I need to replace them with their current mappings? No, wait. Because the substitution is applied as per the current state. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of the mappings as a way to represent what each digit would expand to. Suppose I have a dictionary, say, replace_map, where replace_map[d] represents the string that d is replaced with. Initially, replace_map[d] is empty (or maybe each digit maps to itself? No, because the initial string is s, and the substitutions are applied in sequence. So initially, each digit is just itself. But when a substitution is made, like replacing '2' with '00', then any occurrence of '2' in the string would be replaced with '00'. Then, if later there's a substitution for '0' to '1', then the '0's that were added by the first substitution would be replaced with '1's.\n\nBut if I model this with a replace_map, then when a substitution is made for a digit, say d, then I need to replace all instances of d in the current string with the replacement string. However, the replacement string may contain digits that have their own substitutions. But how do I track that?\n\nWait, but if I process the substitutions in order, and for each substitution, I can track what each digit is currently mapped to. But when a substitution is made, say, d → t, then any future substitution for digits in t will affect the expansion of d. So for example, if I first have d → t, and then later, a substitution for a digit in t, say x → u, then the expansion of d would be t with x replaced by u.\n\nBut how can I represent this in a way that allows me to compute the final expansion of each original digit?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The key challenge is to avoid repeatedly modifying the string directly, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of applying substitutions in the order they are given, we process them in reverse. This allows us to build up a mapping from each digit to its final representation.\n2. **Dynamic Mapping**: We maintain a dictionary that maps each digit to its current replacement string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. As we process queries in reverse, we update these mappings to reflect the cumulative effect of all subsequent substitutions.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the final result needs to be computed modulo $10^9 + 7$, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize the mapping: each digit maps to itself\n    replace_map = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        # Compute the value of t using the current replace_map\n        # But since we are processing in reverse, we need to replace the digits in t with their current mappings\n        # Wait, no.
