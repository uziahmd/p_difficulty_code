Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. But each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Oh right, that's an important detail. So the weights are small, which might allow for some optimized approach.\n\nThe classic knapsack problem, but with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. The standard dynamic programming approach for knapsack would be O(nm), which here would be 3e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group items by their weight and then find the optimal selection for each group. Let me think.\n\nFor each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums. This way, when we have to choose how many items to take from each group, we can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally? Because taking some number of weight 1 items, some weight 2, and some weight 3, such that the total weight is <= m.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have for each weight type, sorted lists of their costs. For example, for weight 1, we have sorted in descending order. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. Then, for each possible number of weight 1 items taken, we can compute the best possible combination of weight 2 and 3 items that fit into the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that seems challenging. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate over the number of weight 1 items taken. For each possible count of weight 1 items, say k, then the remaining weight is m - k*1. Then, we need to find the best combination of weight 2 and 3 items that fit into this remaining weight.\n\nBut for each possible k, how do we compute the best combination for weight 2 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, since weight 2 and 3 can be combined in various ways, perhaps we can precompute for each possible weight capacity, the best possible sum for weight 2 and 3 items. However, with m up to 3e5, that might be feasible if we can find a way to compute it efficiently.\n\nWait, but for weight 2 and 3, maybe we can process them in a way similar to the unbounded knapsack, but since each item can be used once (they are unique items), it's more like the 0-1 knapsack. But again, with n up to 1e5, that's not feasible for a standard DP approach.\n\nBut since the weight is only 2 and 3, perhaps there's a way to optimize.\n\nAnother thought: Let's split the problem into three parts: handling weight 1, 2, and 3 items. Let's first handle the weight 1 and 2 items, then combine with weight 3 items. Or perhaps find for all possible combinations of weight 1 and 2 items, then see how much weight is left for weight 3 items.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea. Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), we can precompute for each weight group the best possible selections. For example, for weight 1, we can take as many as possible (sorted by value) and for weight 2, same. But how to combine them?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, group the items by their weight. For each group, sort the items in descending order of cost and compute prefix sums. So for weight 1, we have a list of prefix sums where prefix_sum_1[i] is the maximum cost of taking the first i items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes selecting a number of items from each group (say, a items from weight 1, b from weight 2, c from weight 3) such that a*1 + b*2 + c*3 ≤ m. And we want to maximize the sum of the prefix sums for each group.\n\nBut how to find the optimal a, b, c?\n\nThis seems like a three-dimensional problem, but perhaps we can reduce it. Let's consider that for each possible number of weight 1 items (a), and weight 2 items (b), we can compute the maximum possible c for the remaining weight. But even that, with a and b up to m, it's O(m^2), which is way too big for m=3e5.\n\nSo that's not feasible. Need another idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's fix the number of weight 3 items taken, then for the remaining weight, find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items. Or fix the number of weight 2 items taken, and so on. But again, how to do that efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: Since the weight is small, for the weight 2 and 3 items, we can precompute for each possible weight capacity, the maximum value we can get using only those items. Then, for each possible weight allocation between weight 1 and the rest, we can combine with the precomputed values.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum value for weight 2 and 3 items?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 2 and 3 items, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nSuppose we have a certain amount of weight W. We can take some number of weight 2 items and some number of weight 3 items. How to maximize the value?\n\nBut again, with W up to m, which is 3e5, and the number of items being large, how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 and 3 items can be considered as items with weights 2 and 3, but the problem is that they are part of a larger problem. Maybe we can find for each possible total weight (up to m), the maximum value achievable with weight 2 and 3 items, and then combine with the weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, how to compute that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum total weight is m. Let's consider that for weight 1, we can take any number of items (up to the number available, and up to m). For each possible number of weight 1 items (say, a), the remaining weight is m - a. Then, for this remaining weight, we need to compute the maximum value from weight 2 and 3 items. But how?\n\nBut even this, if we loop through all possible a (up to m), then for each a, compute the best for weight 2 and 3 items for the remaining weight. But how to compute that part quickly?\n\nWell, for the weight 2 and 3 items, we can precompute a DP array. Let's say dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with total weight w using only weight 2 and 3 items. Then, for each a, the remaining weight is rem = m - a. Then, the answer would be prefix_sum_1[a] + dp[rem].\n\nBut how to compute dp[w]?\n\nThe problem is that the weight 2 and 3 items are individual items, not unlimited. So this is a 0-1 knapsack problem for items with weights 2 and 3. However, with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, a standard 0-1 knapsack approach (O(nm)) would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps, since the items are grouped by weight, we can find a way to compute this efficiently. For example, for weight 2 items, we can take as many as possible (since they are sorted by value), and similarly for weight 3 items.\n\nWait, but combining them is tricky. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the case where I have to select some items of weight 2 and 3, and for a given total weight W, what's the maximum value. How can I compute this efficiently?\n\nFor example, suppose we have sorted lists of weight 2 items (sorted in descending order of value) and weight 3 items (same). For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (say, x), the total weight taken from weight 2 is 2x. Then, the remaining weight is W - 2x, which can be filled with weight 3 items. For each x, we can find the maximum number of weight 3 items that can be taken (y) such that 3y ≤ W - 2x. Then, the total value is prefix_2[x] + prefix_3[y]. We can compute this for all x and take the maximum.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all possible W?\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, we can compute the best combination of x and y for weight 2 and 3 items. But even that, for each W, this would take O(k) time where k is the number of weight 2 items. However, if we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 2 and 3, then for a given W, we can try all possible x (number of weight 2 items taken) and compute the corresponding y (max possible for weight 3 items given the remaining weight).\n\nBut the number of weight 2 items could be up to n, which is 1e5. So for each W, this would take O(1e5) time, which multiplied by m (3e5) would be O(3e10), which is way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. Need another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 2 and 3 items, since their weights are small, perhaps we can find for each possible total weight up to m, the best way to select items. But how?\n\nAnother observation: For the weight 2 items, since we can take any subset, but we want maximum value, we can take the top k items for any k. Similarly for weight 3 items. So, for weight 2 items, the maximum value for a total weight of 2k is the sum of the top k items. Similarly for weight 3 items.\n\nNow, for a given total weight W, how to choose how many weight 2 and 3 items to take.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For the weight 2 and 3 items, the maximum value for a given W is the maximum over all possible x (number of weight 2 items taken) where 2x ≤ W. For each x, the maximum number of weight 3 items is floor((W - 2x)/3). Then, the total value is prefix_2[x] + prefix_3[y], where y is the maximum possible for that x. We can compute this for all x in 0 to min(len_2, W//2), and take the maximum.\n\nBut for a given W, this would take O(min(len_2, W//2)) time. However, if we need to do this for every possible W (from 0 to m), then the total time would be O(m * len_2), which again is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps, in our problem, we don't need to compute this for every W. Because the original problem is to compute for the entire problem, which includes the weight 1 items. Let me think again.\n\nLet me go back to the initial plan. Suppose I have the prefix sums for weight 1, 2, and 3. Then, the maximum total value is the maximum over all a (number of weight 1 items taken), and for each a, compute the best combination of weight 2 and 3 items for the remaining weight (m - a). Let's call this rem = m - a. If rem is negative, skip. For each a, the best combination of weight 2 and 3 items for rem is computed as described above. So for each a, the time to compute this is O(k), where k is the number of weight 2 items. If a ranges from 0 to min(m, len_1), then this would be O(m * k), which for m=3e5 and k=1e5 is again 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nSo that approach is not going to work.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min(n1, m), where n1 is the number of weight 1 items. Let's say that for weight 1 items, we can take up to a_max = min(len_1, m) items. Then, for each a in 0 to a_max, the remaining weight is rem = m - a. Now, for rem, we can compute the best combination of weight 2 and 3 items. But how to compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think about the weight 2 and 3 items. Let's precompute for all possible x (number of weight 2 items taken) and y (number of weight 3 items taken) such that 2x + 3y ≤ W. But again, how?\n\nBut perhaps, for each possible total weight W, we can find the best combination of weight 2 and 3 items. Let's denote this as f(W). How can we compute f(W) for all W up to m?\n\nBut how to compute f(W) efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for f(W):\n\nFor each possible number of weight 3 items taken (y), the maximum possible is min(len_3, floor(W/3)). For each y, the remaining weight is W - 3y, which can be filled with weight 2 items. The maximum number of weight 2 items is floor( (W - 3y)/2 ). So for each y, the value is prefix_3[y] + prefix_2[ floor( (W - 3y)/2 ) ].\n\nThen, the maximum over all possible y (from 0 to min(len_3, floor(W/3))) would be f(W).\n\nSimilarly, for each W, this would take O(len_3) time. Again, for all W up to m, this would be O(m * len_3), which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps, considering that the len_3 is up to 1e5, and m is 3e5, this would be 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nHmm. So, this suggests that the initial approach of trying to compute for each possible a (number of weight 1 items) and then compute the best for weight 2 and 3 is not feasible unless we can find a way to compute the best for weight 2 and 3 quickly.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight of items is small, maybe we can use some mathematical optimization. For example, for weight 2 and 3 items, the maximum value for a given weight W is the maximum between taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 3 items, or vice versa.\n\nBut how to find that maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: For a given W, the optimal choice of x and y is such that 2x + 3y ≤ W, and we want to maximize prefix_2[x] + prefix_3[y]. Since the prefix arrays are non-decreasing (as adding more items increases the value), perhaps for a given W, the optimal y is around W//3, and the optimal x is around (W - 3y)/2. But even so, how to find the best combination.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 2 and 3 items, we can precompute the best possible for all possible W up to m, using a two-pointer approach. Let me think.\n\nLet me imagine that I have the prefix_2 and prefix_3 arrays. For each possible total weight W, we want to find the best x and y. Let's say that for each W, we can iterate y from 0 to max_y (where max_y is min(len_3, W//3)), and compute x as floor( (W - 3y)/2 ), then take the maximum of prefix_2[x] + prefix_3[y]. However, this is O(W) per W, which again is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps, for a given W, we can find the optimal y in O(1) or O(log n) time. How?\n\nLet me think of the following. For each possible y, the maximum x is floor( (W - 3y)/2 ). Since prefix_2 is non-decreasing, for a fixed y, the maximum x is floor( (W - 3y)/2 ), and the value is prefix_3[y] + prefix_2[ floor( (W - 3y)/2 ) ].\n\nBut since y can vary, and the term (W - 3y) decreases as y increases, perhaps the optimal y is somewhere around W//3, and we can check a few candidates around that.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can find the best y in the range [max(0, y0 - k), min(y_max, y0 + k)] for some small k. For example, k=200. Since for each W, we check a limited number of y's, this could be feasible.\n\nBut how to choose k. Well, considering that the optimal y is such that 3y is as close as possible to W - 2x, but I'm not sure. However, this approach would be heuristic and may not work for all cases. But given that the time constraints are tight, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix_3 is non-decreasing, and for each y, the corresponding x is floor( (W - 3y)/2 ), which decreases as y increases, perhaps the function we're trying to maximize is unimodal. If that's the case, we can use ternary search to find the optimal y. But I'm not sure if the function is indeed unimodal.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each W, we can try all possible y in the vicinity of W//3 and W//3 - 1, etc., since the optimal y is likely to be near that value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose W is 10. Then, possible y values could be 0, 1, 2, 3 (since 3*3=9 ≤10). For each y, compute the maximum x.\n\nFor y=0, x can be 5 (2*5=10). Value is prefix_3[0] + prefix_2[5].\n\nFor y=1, 3*1=3 → 7 left. x=3 (2*3=6). Value is prefix_3[1] + prefix_2[3].\n\nFor y=2, 6 → 4 left → x=2. Value is prefix_3[2] + prefix_2[2].\n\nFor y=3, 9 → 1 left → x=0. Value is prefix_3[3] + prefix_2[0].\n\nThe maximum of these four possibilities would be the best.\n\nBut how many possibilities do we need to check? For each W, the maximum possible y is up to W//3. So if W is up to 3e5, then W//3 is up to 1e5, which is again too large.\n\nBut perhaps, since the prefix_3 array is sorted, and the prefix_2 is also sorted, we can find the optimal y by checking a few candidates around the value where 3y is as close as possible to W minus some multiple of 2.\n\nAlternatively, here's another idea. For the weight 2 and 3 items, we can precompute for each possible total weight W, the maximum value of taking some number of weight 2 and 3 items. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can use a greedy approach.\n\nWait, but the greedy approach for knapsack doesn't work in general. However, since all items have weight 2 or 3, and we can take any subset, but we want to maximize the value. Since the items are sorted in descending order of value, perhaps taking the highest value items first is the way to go. But how to balance between taking weight 2 and 3 items.\n\nBut even that, it's unclear. For example, suppose you have a weight 2 item with value 100, and a weight 3 item with value 150. If the remaining weight is 3, then taking the weight 3 item is better. But if the remaining weight is 4, then taking two weight 2 items (total 4) with value 200 is better than one weight 3 and one weight 2 (but that would require 5 weight, which is over). So the optimal choice depends on the available weight.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps for a given weight W, the optimal way is to take as many as possible of the higher value items. But how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For the weight 2 and 3 items, the best way to fill a weight W is to take some number of weight 2 and 3 items, where the sum of their weights is <= W, and the total value is maximized. Since the items are sorted in descending order, the optimal strategy is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, but this depends on their weights.\n\nBut how to find this combination.\n\nMaybe we can model this as follows: for each possible number of weight 3 items taken, up to the maximum possible (say, y_max), and for each such y, take as many weight 2 items as possible. Then, the maximum of all these possibilities is the best for W. Similarly, for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, take as many weight 3 items as possible. Then, the maximum of all these possibilities is the best.\n\nBut again, for large W, this would be O(y_max) time per W.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the number of weight 2 and weight 3 items is manageable. For example, if the number of weight 2 items is up to 1e5, and the number of weight 3 items is up to 1e5, then for each W, we can try all possible y in 0 to min(len_3, W//3), and compute the corresponding x, and take the maximum. But for m=3e5, this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThis suggests that we need a different approach.\n\nLet me think again. What's the maximum possible total weight? It's 3e5. Let's think about the total number of items. Since each item has weight 1, 2, or 3, but n is 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, what if we precompute for weight 2 and 3 items, the best possible way to fill any weight W using those items. How?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the weight 2 and 3 items:\n\nFor each possible weight W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 3 items.\n\n- Taking some number of weight 3 items and filling the rest with weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small (2 and 3), perhaps we can find for each W, the maximum number of weight 2 and 3 items that can be taken, considering that for each W, the optimal solution is either:\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill with weight 3.\n\n- Or take as many weight 3 items as possible, then fill with weight 2.\n\n- Or take a combination that balances the two.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the weight 2 and 3 items, we can create a new array that contains all items, and then perform a modified knapsack. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to optimize.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the following approach is feasible:\n\nGroup the items by weight. For each group, sort them in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums.\n\nThen, for the entire problem, we can consider the following:\n\nIterate over the possible number of weight 3 items taken (c). For each c, the weight used is 3*c. The remaining weight is m - 3*c. Then, we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for this remaining weight.\n\nSimilarly, for each c, we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for the remaining weight. How to compute that?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, we can use a similar approach: for each possible a (number of weight 1 items taken), the remaining weight after a is (remaining_weight - a), which can be filled with weight 2 items.\n\nBut again, this seems like it could be O(m) per iteration.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible weight W, the maximum value achievable. Let's call this g(W). Then, for each c, the total weight is 3*c, and the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*c. If rem >=0, then the total value is prefix_3[c] + g(rem). The maximum of this over all c is the answer.\n\nBut how to compute g(W), which is the maximum value achievable using weight 1 and 2 items for weight W.\n\nSimilarly to earlier ideas, for g(W), we can iterate over the number of weight 1 items taken (a), and compute the maximum number of weight 2 items that can be taken (b) such that a + 2*b <= W. Then, the value is prefix_1[a] + prefix_2[b].\n\nBut again, for large W, this is O(W) per W. However, if we can compute g(W) efficiently, then we can proceed.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, since they have weights 1 and 2, perhaps we can find a way to compute g(W) efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible W, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min(a_max, W), where a_max is the number of weight 1 items. For each a, the remaining weight is W - a, and the maximum number of weight 2 items is min(b_max, (W - a) // 2). So the value is prefix_1[a] + prefix_2[min(b_max, (W - a) // 2)]. We can compute this for all a in 0 to min(a_max, W), and take the maximum.\n\nBut again, for large W, this is O(W) per W, which is not feasible.\n\nBut here's an idea: since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, the prefix_1 is non-decreasing. Similarly for weight 2 items. So for a given W, the optimal a is likely to be around W, but how?\n\nLet me think of the following: For each W, the best a is the minimum between the number of weight 1 items and W. But since taking more weight 1 items allows us to fill the remaining weight with weight 2 items. However, since weight 1 items have higher value per unit weight (if they are more valuable), but this depends on the actual items.\n\nAlternatively, since we can take as many weight 1 items as possible, and for each a, the remaining weight is W - a, which allows us to take up to (W - a)/2 weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to find the best a for a given W.\n\nLet me think: for a given W, the maximum value of prefix_1[a] + prefix_2[b], where a + 2b <= W.\n\nSince a can vary from 0 to min(W, len_1), and for each a, b is min( (W - a) // 2, len_2 ). But how to find the best a.\n\nLet me consider that for a fixed W, the optimal a is such that (W - a) is as large as possible to allow more weight 2 items. But since a increases, (W - a) decreases, which reduces the number of weight 2 items.\n\nBut since the prefix_1 is increasing, and prefix_2 is also increasing, there's a trade-off between the two.\n\nThis sounds like a convex function, and the maximum can be found by checking a few candidates around the point where the marginal gain of taking one more weight 1 item equals the loss of weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, since for each W, the optimal a is between max(0, W - 2*len_2) and min(W, len_1). Because if you take more than W - 2*len_2 weight 1 items, then you can't take any weight 2 items. So the range of a to check is from max(0, W - 2*len_2) to min(W, len_1). This reduces the number of a's to check.\n\nFor example, if len_2 is small, then this range could be small. But if len_2 is large, then the range could be large.\n\nBut perhaps, for practical purposes, even if we check all possible a in this range, it would be manageable.\n\nLet me think of the worst case. Suppose W is 3e5, and len_2 is 1e5. Then, 2*len_2 is 2e5. So the range of a is from 3e5 - 2e5 = 1e5 to min(3e5, len_1). Assuming len_1 is also 1e5, this would be a range of 1e5 a's. For each W, this would be O(1e5) operations, which again is not feasible.\n\nSo this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: Since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the prefix_1 is non-decreasing, and for each a, the value of prefix_2[b] is non-decreasing as a decreases (since b increases), the total value is a combination of two non-decreasing functions. Wait, no. As a increases, prefix_1[a] increases, but b decreases, so prefix_2[b] decreases. So the total value may have a single peak, which can be found with binary search.\n\nIf the function is unimodal, then we can perform ternary search to find the maximum. Let's assume that for a given W, the function f(a) = prefix_1[a] + prefix_2[ (W - a) // 2 ] is unimodal. Then, we can use ternary search to find the optimal a in the range [low, high].\n\nIf this is the case, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search in O(log n) time, which would make the overall complexity acceptable.\n\nBut how to verify if this function is unimodal.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose prefix_1 is [0, 10, 20, 30], and prefix_2 is [0, 5, 10, 15]. For W = 5.\n\nFor a=0: b = 5//2 = 2 → 0 + 10 = 10.\n\na=1: 1 + (5-1)/2=2 → 10 + 10 = 20.\n\na=2: 20 + (5-2)/2=1 → 20 + 5 = 25.\n\na=3: 30 + (5-3)/2=1 → 30 +5=35.\n\na=4: but a can't exceed W=5.\n\nSo the function increases with a. So it's not unimodal in this case.\n\nAnother example: W=4.\n\na=0: b=2 → 0+10=10.\n\na=1: (4-1)/2=1.5 → 1 → 10 +5=15.\n\na=2: (4-2)/2=1 → 20 +5=25.\n\na=3: (4-3)/2=0.5 → 0 → 30 +0=30.\n\na=4: (4-4)/2=0 → 40 +0=40? No, because prefix_1[a] is up to a=3. So this is just 30 + 0 =30.\n\nSo the function increases as a increases. Again, no peak.\n\nAnother example where it might decrease: suppose W=3.\n\na=0: b=1.5 → 1 → 0+5=5.\n\na=1: (3-1)/2=1 → 10 +5=15.\n\na=2: (3-2)/2=0.5 → 0 → 20 +0=20.\n\na=3: (3-3)/2=0 → 30 +0=30.\n\nAgain, increasing.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the function is monotonically increasing in a, which would mean that the maximum is achieved when a is as large as possible. But why?\n\nBecause adding more weight 1 items increases the prefix_1, and the loss in the prefix_2 is less than the gain in prefix_1. But this depends on the actual values of the items.\n\nBut this seems to suggest that for a given W, the optimal a is the maximum possible, i.e., min(len_1, W). Then, the corresponding b is (W - a) // 2.\n\nBut this would imply that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal strategy is to take as many weight 1 items as possible, and fill the remaining weight with weight 2 items. Is this correct?\n\nLet me think of a counterexample. Suppose:\n\nWeight 1 items: [10, 10] (prefix_1[0]=0, prefix_1[1]=10, prefix_1[2]=20)\n\nWeight 2 items: [15] (prefix_2[0]=0, prefix_2[1]=15)\n\nW=3.\n\nIf we take a=2 (weight 2), then remaining weight is 1, which can't take any weight 2 items. Total value is 20 + 0 = 20.\n\nIf we take a=1, remaining weight is 2 → take 1 weight 2 item. Total is 10 + 15 = 25, which is better.\n\nSo in this case, taking fewer weight 1 items gives a better total. This shows that the function is not monotonically increasing, and thus the previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nSo the function can have a peak, and thus ternary search might be applicable.\n\nIn this example, the optimal a is 1. So how can we find it?\n\nFor W=3, the possible a ranges from 0 to 3 (but len_1 is 2). So a can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nFor a=0: 0 + 15 = 15.\n\na=1: 10 + 15 = 25.\n\na=2: 20 + 0 = 20.\n\nSo the maximum is at a=1.\n\nThis suggests that the function is not monotonic, and thus ternary search could be applicable.\n\nBut how to determine if it's unimodal. If the function first increases and then decreases, then it's unimodal. In this example, it increases from a=0 to a=1, then decreases from a=1 to a=2. So it is unimodal.\n\nAnother example: suppose W=4.\n\nWeight 1 items: [10, 10], prefix_1[0]=0, 10, 20.\n\nWeight 2 items: [15, 15], prefix_2[0]=0, 15, 30.\n\nPossible a values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But len_1 is 2, so a can be 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor a=0: b=4//2=2 → 0 + 30 = 30.\n\na=1: b=(4-1)/2=1 → 10 + 15 = 25.\n\na=2: b=(4-2)/2=1 → 20 +15 =35.\n\nSo the function increases from a=0 to a=2. So it's not unimodal here. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, in this case, the function increases from a=0 to a=2. So it's increasing. So it's not unimodal.\n\nBut in the previous example, it was increasing then decreasing.\n\nSo it's not clear whether the function is unimodal in general. This makes it difficult to apply ternary search.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps we can find that for each W, the optimal a is in a small range around the value where the marginal gain of adding a weight 1 item equals the marginal loss of removing a weight 2 item.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of weight 1 items is up to 1e5, and for each W, the range of a to check is small, perhaps we can precompute for each W the best a by checking a limited number of candidates.\n\nFor example, for each W, we can check a = max(0, W - 2*len_2) to min(W, len_1), but even this could be up to 1e5 for each W, which is not feasible.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's look for alternative approaches.\n\nLet me think of the following: since",
