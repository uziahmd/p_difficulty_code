The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nFirst, I should think about the parity of the numbers. Because adding two numbers gives an odd sum if one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, a chest with an odd a_i needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the problem reduces to matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. But how do I maximize the number of such matches?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's count the number of even and odd chests. Similarly, count the number of even and odd keys.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- even_chests = number of chests with even a_i\n- odd_chests = number of chests with odd a_i\n- even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n- odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\nNow, for the even chests, they can be matched with odd keys. For the odd chests, they can be matched with even keys. \n\nBut the maximum possible for each is the minimum between the count of chests and the count of keys in their respective categories. \n\nFor example, the number of even chests that can be opened is min(even_chests, odd_keys). Similarly, the number of odd chests that can be opened is min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nAdding these two numbers together would give the maximum possible chests opened. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. Suppose there are 3 even chests and 2 odd keys. Then we can open 2 chests (since there are only 2 keys). Similarly, if there are 5 odd chests and 4 even keys, then we can open 4. So yes, the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys) should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are more keys than needed? Like, if even_chests is 2 and odd_keys is 5, then we take 2. Similarly for the other part. \n\nYes. So the approach is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, let me test this against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity.\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (indices 2,3,4?), no, wait the numbers are 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So even_chests is 3 (14,6,2) and odd_chests is 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parity. 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nSo min(even_chests, odd_keys) is min(3, 1) = 1. min(odd_chests, even_keys) is min(2, 3) = 2. Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output. So that works.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1, chests are 2,4,6,8,10 (all even). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chests is 5, odd_keys is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other part is min(0, 0) since odd_chests is zero. So total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other part: odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, m=1. Chest is 3 (odd), key is 2 (even). Then min(1,1) for odd_chests and even_keys. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys, where a chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This requires matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parity Analysis**: The sum of two numbers is odd if one is even and the other is odd. Therefore, we need to count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Similarly, we count the number of even and odd keys.\n2. **Matching Strategy**: \n   - Even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can only be opened by even-numbered keys.\n3. **Maximization**: For each category (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys), the maximum number of matches is determined by the minimum count between the chests and keys in those categories. Summing these two values gives the total maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n    \n    res = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the list of chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Calculating Maximum Matches**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures we use the available keys and chests optimally to maximize the number of opened chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, ensuring optimal use of available resources with a time complexity of O(n + m), which is suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
