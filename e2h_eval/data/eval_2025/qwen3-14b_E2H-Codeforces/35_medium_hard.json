    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So Valera has an array a of n integers, and a function f(x) which sums the elements of a where the i-th bit in x's binary representation is set. Our task is to find the maximum value of f(x) for all x between 0 and m, inclusive. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input correctly. The input gives us n, then the array a, then a binary string s which represents m. So m is calculated as the sum of 2^i for each position i where the binary string has a '1'. For example, if the binary string is '10', then m is 2^1 = 2.\n\nThe challenge is to find the maximum possible sum of selected a[i]s, where the selection corresponds to the bits set in x, and x can't exceed m. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the function f(x) is just the sum of a[i] for each bit set in x, the maximum value of f(x) would be achieved by selecting as many high-value a[i]s as possible, but under the constraint that the corresponding bits form a number x that's ≤ m.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find which combination of bits (i.e., which subset of the array elements) gives the maximum sum, while ensuring that the binary number formed by those bits is ≤ m?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we want to select certain bits, but with constraints based on the binary representation of m. \n\nLet me think of the bits of m. Let's consider the binary digits of m as a string. For each bit position, we can decide whether to include it or not. However, including a bit might require that the bits chosen so far don't exceed m's bits. \n\nAn idea comes to mind: the maximum sum would be achieved by selecting all the bits where a[i] is positive. However, if selecting all those bits would form a number larger than m, we need to adjust. So perhaps we need to find the subset of bits that are allowed by m's binary representation, but with the highest possible sum.\n\nWait, but how to handle the constraint that x must be ≤ m. For example, suppose m is 1010 (binary), which is 10 in decimal. If the a array has high values for bits 3 and 1 (so positions 3 and 1), then the maximum would be to take those bits if their combination is allowed. But if taking both bits 3 and 1 gives 1010 (which is exactly m), then that's allowed. However, if there's a higher sum possible by taking some other combination, that's better.\n\nBut how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem, but with n up to 1e5, that's not feasible. Wait, but n can be up to 1e5, but the binary representation of m can have up to n bits. Wait, no. Because m is given as a binary string of length n. Wait, looking at the input description: the third line is a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1. So the length of the binary string is exactly n. Therefore, m is a number with up to n bits. So n can be up to 1e5, which means m can be as big as 2^1e5, which is way too big to handle directly. So we can't iterate through all x from 0 to m. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, considering that n is up to 1e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nLet me think again. The function f(x) is the sum of a[i] for each bit i set in x. So, the maximum possible sum is the sum of all a[i] where the bit is set. But that's only possible if the binary number formed by all those bits is less than or equal to m. Otherwise, we need to find the best subset of bits that is allowed by m.\n\nSo the key is to find the subset of bits (positions) that can be set in x such that x <= m, and the sum of their a[i] is maximum.\n\nBut how to find that subset?\n\nLet me think of the bits of m. Let's process the bits from the highest to the lowest. For each bit position, we can decide whether to include it or not, but ensuring that the resulting number doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut since the bits are interdependent, this seems complex. For example, if we include a bit at position i, but the bits after that are set in a way that makes the number exceed m, we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is the one that has the same bits as m, but possibly with some lower bits adjusted. But how?\n\nAnother approach: The maximum sum is achieved by selecting all the bits where a[i] is positive, provided that their combination is <= m. If not, we need to find the best way to exclude some bits.\n\nBut how to check if the combination of all positive a[i] bits is <= m?\n\nWait, but even if all a[i] are positive, the maximum possible x would be 2^n - 1 (all bits set). But if m is less than that, then we need to find the best subset.\n\nBut considering that m is given as a binary string of length n, which implies that m is a number with exactly n bits (possibly leading zeros?), but no, the input says that the third line is a sequence of digits of length n. So for example, if n=2, the binary string could be '10', which is 2, or '01' which is 1, etc.\n\nSo the problem is to find a subset of bits (positions 0 to n-1) such that the number formed by those bits (as a binary number) is <= m, and the sum of a[i] for those bits is maximum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing a subset of bits (each bit is either 0 or 1 in x's binary representation) such that the binary number x is <= m, and the sum of the a[i] for the bits set is maximized.\n\nNow, how can we model this? Let's think of the binary representation of m as a string. Let's say the binary string is s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], where s[0] is the most significant bit (since for example, in the first sample input, the binary string is '10' for n=2. That would be 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2, which is m=2.)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the third line is the binary representation of m. For example, in the first sample input, the third line is '10', which is 2 in decimal. So the binary string is s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1} where s_0 is the highest bit. So for n=2, the binary string is two digits, the first being the 2^1 place, the second the 2^0 place.\n\nSo when processing the binary string, the first character (index 0) represents the highest bit (2^{n-1} ?) Wait, no. Wait, the binary string is s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, and m is equal to the sum of s_i * 2^i. Wait, no. Because for example, in the first sample input, the binary string is '10' for n=2. Then m is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. So yes, the first character (s_0) is the 2^{n-1} place? Wait, no. Wait, for a binary string of length n, the leftmost digit is the highest bit, which is 2^{n-1} place. For example, for the binary string '10', which is two digits, the leftmost is 2^1, the rightmost is 2^0. So the position i (0-based) in the string corresponds to the 2^{n-1 - i} place? Or maybe I should think of the bits as being indexed from 0 to n-1, where the first bit (s_0) is the highest bit (2^{n-1}) and the last bit (s_{n-1}) is the lowest (2^0).\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again. Let's take the example where the binary string is '10' for n=2. The value of m is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. So the first character (s_0) is the 2^1 place, the second (s_1) is 2^0. So the index in the string is i, and the exponent is (n-1 - i) ? No, for i=0, exponent is (n-1 - i) = 1. Which matches. For i=1, exponent is 0. So yes. So the value of m is sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (s_i) * 2^{n-1 - i} ?\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of each bit in the binary string as representing a certain position. For example, the binary string s is of length n. Let's think of the bits as being in positions 0 to n-1, where position 0 is the highest bit (the first character of the string) and position n-1 is the lowest (the last character). So for each position i (from 0 to n-1), the bit contributes s[i] * 2^{n-1 - i} to m.\n\nBut perhaps for our problem, the exact way of calculating m is not important. What matters is that we need to find the subset of bits (positions) that can be set in x, such that x is <= m, and the sum of a[i] for those positions is maximum.\n\nNow, the problem is similar to finding the maximum subset sum, with the constraint that the subset's binary representation is <= m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the bits of x. Let's imagine that we can choose to set some bits. The maximum sum would be achieved by setting all the bits where a[i] is positive. However, if that combination is larger than m, we need to find a way to adjust.\n\nBut how can we check if that combination is allowed?\n\nFor example, suppose we have all a[i] positive. Then, the maximum sum would be the sum of all a[i], but only if the binary number with all bits set is <= m. If not, we need to find the next best option.\n\nBut how to find that next best option?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can use a greedy approach, but with some backtracking. For example, we can start by trying to set all bits where a[i] is positive, but if that's not allowed, we can look for the first bit where we can toggle it to 0 and set lower bits as needed.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building the binary number x bit by bit, starting from the highest bit to the lowest. At each step, decide whether to set the current bit or not, considering the constraints imposed by m's bits.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming approach. However, with n up to 1e5, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think of the bits of m. Let's process them from the highest to the lowest. For each bit, we can decide whether to include it in x or not. However, including a bit may affect the possibility of including lower bits.\n\nLet's consider the following approach:\n\nWe can greedily include a bit if it's allowed by m. But what does \"allowed\" mean here?\n\nFor example, if the current bit in m is 1, then we can choose to set it in x, but if we set it, then the lower bits can be anything (but must not make x exceed m). Alternatively, if we don't set it, then the lower bits can be set freely (but perhaps not, because m's higher bits are already fixed).\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the binary representation of m as a string, and for each bit position from left to right (highest to lowest), we can decide whether to include the bit in x or not. The decision depends on whether including it is allowed by m's bits, and whether it's beneficial (i.e., a[i] is positive).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the binary string of m as s. Let's process each bit from left (most significant) to right (least significant). For each bit position i (from 0 to n-1), we can decide whether to include it in x. However, the inclusion of this bit must not cause x to exceed m.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose we are at position i. The bits we have already decided for positions 0 to i-1 are fixed. Now, for the current bit, if the bit in m is 1, then we can choose to set it in x, or not. But if we set it, then the remaining bits can be set to 1 (maximizing the sum). However, if we don't set it, then the remaining bits can be set to 1 as well, but that would be allowed. Wait, but if we don't set the current bit, then the remaining bits can be set to 1, but that would make x smaller than m. So in that case, including those bits would be allowed.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. For each bit position i, we can track whether we are tight to m's bits so far. That is, whether the bits we have chosen so far are exactly the same as m's up to this point, or less than. If we are tight, then the current bit can't exceed m's current bit. If we are not tight, then we can choose to set the current bit to 1 or 0, as long as it's allowed.\n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem with states. However, with n up to 1e5, a DP approach with O(n) time and space is feasible.\n\nBut how to model the state. The state can be whether we are tight to m's bits so far. So for each position i, we can have two possibilities:\n\n- tight: the bits chosen so far are exactly equal to the prefix of m up to i.\n\n- not tight: the bits chosen so far are less than the prefix of m up to i.\n\nIn the tight state, the current bit can be chosen as 0 or 1, but not exceeding m's current bit. In the not tight state, we can choose 0 or 1 freely.\n\nBut how to track the maximum sum in each state.\n\nLet's think of this as a DP problem. The DP[i][state] represents the maximum sum achievable up to the i-th bit, with the state being tight or not.\n\nThe transitions would be as follows:\n\nAt each step i (processing the i-th bit of m), for each state (tight or not), we can consider possible choices for the current bit (0 or 1), and update the state accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf we are in the tight state (so far, the bits chosen match m's prefix), then for the current bit, we can choose to set it to 0 or 1, but not exceeding m's current bit. For example:\n\n- If m's current bit is 1, then we can choose to set it to 1 (remaining tight) or 0 (now not tight).\n\n- If m's current bit is 0, then we can only choose to set it to 0 (remaining tight), because setting it to 1 would make x exceed m.\n\nIf we are in the not tight state, then we can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1, and remain in the not tight state.\n\nAdditionally, for each choice, we add a[i] to the sum if the current bit is set to 1.\n\nThe initial state is tight (since we start with nothing chosen, and the prefix is empty).\n\nThe final answer is the maximum between the two states after processing all bits.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's see how this would work for the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=2, a=[3,8], m's binary is '10' (so m=2).\n\nProcessing the bits from left to right (bit 0 is first, which is 1, then bit 1 is 0).\n\nLet's model the DP steps.\n\nInitialize DP[0][tight] = 0 (sum so far), and DP[0][not tight] = -infinity or something. Wait, the initial state is tight before processing any bits.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP is defined as follows:\n\nWe have two variables, tight and not_tight. Initially, tight is 0 (sum is 0, and we are tight to m's prefix so far). not_tight is -infinity (since we haven't made any choice yet).\n\nFor each bit position i (from 0 to n-1):\n\ncurrent_bit = s[i] (either '0' or '1').\n\nFor each state (tight and not_tight), we can consider transitions.\n\nLet me think of the steps for the first example.\n\nInitial state: tight = 0, not_tight = -inf.\n\nProcessing first bit (i=0, which is the first bit of m, which is '1').\n\nCase 1: previous state is tight.\n\nWe can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1, but not exceeding m's current bit (which is 1).\n\nOption 1: set to 0. Then, the new state is not_tight (since the current bit is less than m's bit). The sum is 0 (since a[0] is 3, but we didn't set the bit. Wait, the a array is [a0, a1], but the first bit (i=0) corresponds to the first position in the binary string, which is the highest bit (2^1 in the first example). But the a[i] is for the i-th position in the array. Wait, the problem says that the function f(x) is sum of a[i] where the i-th bit is set in x. So for each bit position in the binary string (i from 0 to n-1), that corresponds to the i-th bit in x's binary representation. Wait, but how is that connected to the actual value of x?\n\nWait, the problem defines that the function f(x) is sum of a_i where the i-th bit of x is set. So for example, if x is 5 (binary 101), then for i=0, the bit is 1, so a_0 is added. For i=1, the bit is 0, so not added. For i=2, the bit is 1, so a_2 is added. Wait, but the binary representation of x is of arbitrary length, but the problem says that the bits are considered for positions 0 to n-1. So, the array a has n elements, and each element corresponds to a bit in x's binary representation. So the bits are numbered from 0 to n-1, where bit i refers to the 2^i place.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with the earlier analysis. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: for example, if n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3. Because the binary representation of x has 1's in positions 0, 1, and 3. Wait, but in binary, 11 is 8+2+1 = 1011, which is bits 0, 1, 3 (assuming 0-based from the right). So the i-th bit in the problem refers to the i-th position in the binary representation, counting from 0 (the least significant bit). But the input gives m as a binary string of length n. So for example, in the first sample input, the binary string is '10', which is length 2. So for n=2, the binary string represents the bits of m as follows: the first character (s[0]) is the 2^1 place (bit 1), and the second (s[1]) is the 2^0 place (bit 0). But according to the problem's definition, the function f(x) considers the i-th bit of x (for 0 ≤ i < n). So the bits of x are considered as 0 to n-1, where the i-th bit is the 2^i place.\n\nBut in that case, the binary string s for m is of length n, and represents the bits of m in positions 0 to n-1. Wait, but how? For example, if the binary string is '10', then m is 2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. Which would correspond to bits 0 and 1. But the binary string is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, where each s_i is the bit for the 2^{n-1 - i} place? Or is it for the 2^i place?\n\nThis is crucial for the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement's example.\n\nIn the first example, the input is:\n\nn=2\n\narray is [3, 8]\n\nbinary string is '10' which represents m=2 (binary 10). According to the note, in the first test case, m=20 (wait no, the first example says m=20? Wait the first example says:\n\nIn the first test case m=20=1, but that's probably a typo. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nWait the user provided the first example as:\n\nInput:\n\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', ...]\n\nThe note says that in the first test case, m=20=1, but that seems incorrect. Wait the note says:\n\n\"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\nWait that seems wrong. Probably, it's a typo. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\nAh, so the binary representation of x is considered with bits numbered from 0 (LSB) upwards. So for x=11 (binary 1011), the bits set are positions 0, 1, 3. Thus, the function adds a0, a1, a3.\n\nTherefore, the binary string s for m is of length n, and each character s[i] corresponds to the i-th bit in the binary representation of m. Wait, but how? For example, if the binary string is '10', which is two characters, then for n=2, the bits of m are:\n\nbit 0: 0 (since the binary string is '10', which is 2^1 + 0*2^0. So the bits are:\n\nbit 0 (LSB) is 0, bit 1 (next) is 1. But the binary string is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1} where s_0 is the first character. So in this example, the binary string is '10' for n=2. So s_0 is '1', s_1 is '0'. But that would correspond to the binary number s_0 * 2^{n-1} + s_1 * 2^{n-2} ... ?\n\nNo, that would be the case if the string represents the binary digits from the most significant to least significant. For example, for n=2, the binary string '10' represents 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. So the first character (s_0) is the MSB (bit position 1), and the second character (s_1) is the LSB (bit position 0). So the binary string is for the bits of m, where s[i] is the value of the bit in position (n-1 - i) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how the binary string is interpreted. The problem says that the third line is the binary representation of m. So for example, if the binary string is '10', then m is 2, which is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0. So the first character of the string is the highest bit (bit position 1), and the second is the lowest (bit position 0). Therefore, the binary string s has s[0] as the bit for position (n-1) in the binary representation of m. Wait, no. For example, for a binary string of length n, the first character is the highest bit (which is 2^{n-1} place), the next is 2^{n-2}, and so on, until the last character is 2^0.\n\nThus, the bit positions in the binary string s are such that s[i] corresponds to the bit in position (n-1 -i) of the binary representation of m. But this seems complicated. However, for the purposes of the problem, when we're considering x's bits, the i-th bit (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to the 2^i place. So the binary string s represents the bits of m in positions 0 to n-1, but the way they are stored is reversed. For example, for the binary string '10', the bits for m are:\n\nbit 1 (position 1): 1\n\nbit 0 (position 0): 0\n\nSo m is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\nBut the binary string s is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1} where s_0 is the first digit (MSB) of the binary representation of m.\n\nSo for the problem, when we are considering the bits of m, the i-th character in the string s corresponds to the bit in position (n-1 - i) of the binary representation of m. Or wait, perhaps not. For example, if the binary string is '101' for n=3, then m is 5 (binary 101). The bits are:\n\nbit 2 (position 2) is 1 (MSB)\n\nbit 1 is 0\n\nbit 0 is 1 (LSB)\n\nSo the binary string s is s[0] = '1', s[1] = '0', s[2] = '1'.\n\nSo for each position i in the string (from 0 to n-1), the value of the bit is s[i], and it represents the 2^{n-1 - i} place in m's value. Therefore, the bit positions in the string are not the same as the bit positions in the function f(x).\n\nBut for the function f(x), the bits are numbered from 0 to n-1, where each corresponds to 2^i in x's value. So for example, if x has bit 0 set, that contributes a_0 to the sum. So the binary string s represents the bits of m in positions 0 to n-1, but the way they are stored is reversed. Wait, no. The binary string is the actual binary representation of m. So for example, the binary string '10' represents m=2, which has bits set at position 1 (value 2^1). So the bits of m are not the same as the bits considered in f(x). \n\nWait, this is getting very confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe function f(x) is defined based on the bits of x. Each bit in x's binary representation, for positions 0 to n-1. So, for example, if x is 5 (binary 101), and n is 3, then the bits are 0:1, 1:0, 2:1. So the function f(x) would be a_0 + a_2.\n\nNow, the input gives a binary string s which represents m. For example, if the binary string is '10', then m is 2, which is 10 in binary. So the binary string is the standard binary representation of m, with the first character being the most significant bit. So for n=2, the binary string is two characters, which represent the 2^1 and 2^0 bits. So the bits of m are in positions 0 and 1 (for n=2), but the binary string's first character (s[0]) is the 2^1 bit (bit position 1), and the second character (s[1]) is the 2^0 bit (bit position 0). So for the problem, the bits of m are in positions 0 to n-1, but the binary string's characters correspond to the bits in positions (n-1 - i) ?\n\nNo, for example, if the binary string is '10' for n=2, then m is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0. So the bits of m are:\n\nbit 1 (value 2^1) is 1.\n\nbit 0 (value 2^0) is 0.\n\nSo the binary string s is of length n, and for each position i in the string (from 0 to n-1), the character s[i] represents the value of the bit at position (n-1 - i) in the binary representation of m. Wait, no. Because for i=0, the character is the most significant bit of m, which is the bit for position (n-1) in the binary representation. For example, for n=2, the first character is the bit for position 1 (since n-1=1), and the second character is the bit for position 0.\n\nSo, to get the bit of m at position i (for 0 ≤ i < n), we need to look at the character at position (n-1 - i) in the string. For example, for m's bit at position 1 (i=1), we look at s[0] (since n-1 - i = 2-1 -1 = 0).\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps for our problem, it's easier to precompute the bits of m for each position 0 to n-1. Let's create an array m_bits, where m_bits[i] is 1 if the i-th bit of m is set, else 0. How to compute this array?\n\nGiven that the binary string is s, which represents m as a binary number, with the first character being the most significant bit (the highest power of 2), we can compute m_bits as follows:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n    m_bits[i] = int(s[n-1 - i])\n\nBecause for example, in the first sample input, the binary string is '10' for n=2. For i=0 (bit 0 of m), it's s[1] = '0'. For i=1 (bit 1 of m), it's s[0] = '1'.\n\nYes. So m_bits[i] is the value of the i-th bit in m's binary representation. This way, for each position i (0-based), m_bits[i] tells us if that bit is set in m.\n\nOnce we have m_bits, we can proceed with the dynamic programming approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input: read n, the array a, and the binary string s.\n\n2. Compute m_bits: for each i from 0 to n-1, m_bits[i] = int(s[n-1 - i]).\n\n3. Use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of a[i] where the selected bits form a number x ≤ m.\n\nNow, back to the dynamic programming idea. We can process each bit from 0 to n-1 (from the least significant to most significant?), or from most significant to least significant. Wait, in the DP approach earlier, we processed the bits from left to right (most significant to least significant) of the binary string. But now, since the m_bits array is for each position i (0-based, least significant to most?), no. Wait, m_bits[i] is the i-th bit of m, where i ranges from 0 (LSB) to n-1 (MSB?), no. Wait, no. For example, in the first sample, m_bits[0] is 0 (LSB), m_bits[1] is 1 (the next bit). So for n=2, the bits are 0 (bit 0) and 1 (bit 1). So m_bits is ordered from bit 0 (LSB) to bit n-1 (MSB).\n\nBut for the DP approach, it's easier to process the bits from the highest to lowest. Because when you choose a bit, higher bits have more weight. So perhaps we should process the bits in order from the highest (bit n-1) to the lowest (bit 0). However, in the m_bits array, the highest bit is at position n-1. So for processing, we can iterate from i = n-1 downto 0.\n\nBut regardless, the DP approach needs to consider the bits in order, and for each bit, decide whether to set it or not, considering the constraints of m's bits.\n\nLet me rephrase the DP idea with the m_bits array.\n\nLet's define the DP as follows: we process the bits from the highest (bit n-1) down to the lowest (bit 0). At each step, we track whether we are still tight to the bits of m. For example, if we have processed bits higher than i and have chosen the same bits as m, then we are tight for the current bit. If we have chosen a bit less than m's bit at that position, then we are not tight anymore.\n\nLet me think of the DP states as:\n\ndp[tight] = maximum sum achievable so far.\n\nInitially, tight is True (we haven't chosen any bits yet, and are tight to m's bits).\n\nFor each bit position i (processed from highest to lowest), we consider the current bit of m (m_bits[i]).\n\nIf we are tight, then we can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1, but not exceeding m's bit.\n\nIf we are not tight, we can set the current bit to 0 or 1 freely.\n\nBut how to model this with transitions.\n\nLet me think of the DP as having two states: tight and not_tight.\n\nInitially, the maximum sum is 0, and we are tight.\n\nFor each bit i (from highest to lowest), we can consider the possible choices for the current bit.\n\nLet's think of the steps for each bit:\n\nCase 1: current state is tight.\n\nIf the current bit in m is 1:\n\n- Option 1: set this bit to 1. Then, the new state remains tight. We add a[i] to the sum.\n\n- Option 2: set this bit to 0. Then, the new state becomes not_tight. We do not add a[i].\n\nIf the current bit in m is 0:\n\n- We can only set this bit to 0. The state remains tight. Do not add a[i].\n\nCase 2: current state is not_tight.\n\nWe can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1. Either way, the state remains not_tight. We add a[i] if we choose to set it.\n\nSo, during the processing of each bit, we can calculate the new possible states and their maximum sums.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nWe'll keep track of two variables:\n\n- max_sum_tight: the maximum sum achievable when we are still tight to m's bits up to this point.\n\n- max_sum_not_tight: the maximum sum achievable when we are not tight.\n\nInitially, before processing any bits, max_sum_tight = 0, max_sum_not_tight = -infinity (since we haven't made any choices yet).\n\nFor each bit i from highest (n-1) to lowest (0):\n\n    current_m_bit = m_bits[i]\n\n    new_max_tight = -infinity\n    new_max_not_tight = -infinity\n\n    # Case 1: previous state was tight\n    if max_sum_tight is not -infinity:\n        if current_m_bit == 1:\n            # option 1: set current bit to 1, stay tight\n            new_max_tight = max(new_max_tight, max_sum_tight + a[i])\n            # option 2: set current bit to 0, become not tight\n            new_max_not_tight = max(new_max_not_tight, max_sum_tight)\n        else:\n            # current_m_bit is 0, can only set to 0, stay tight\n            new_max_tight = max(new_max_tight, max_sum_tight)\n            # no option to set to 1, since that would exceed m\n\n    # Case 2: previous state was not tight\n    if max_sum_not_tight is not -infinity:\n        # can choose to set to 0 or 1\n        # option 1: set to 1, add a[i]\n        new_max_not_tight = max(new_max_not_tight, max_sum_not_tight + a[i])\n        # option 2: set to 0, don't add\n        new_max_not_tight = max(new_max_not_tight, max_sum_not_tight)\n\n    # Update the max_sum_tight and max_sum_not_tight for the next iteration\n    max_sum_tight, max_sum_not_tight = new_max_tight, new",
