And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those weeks.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the input. The first line has n and k. Then the second line has n integers representing the sleep times each day. The output should be the average of all the possible weeks' averages.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that efficiently? Because if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach of checking each window and summing would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right! Sliding window technique. Because each consecutive window overlaps with the previous one. So I can compute the sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving and add the new element that's entering. That way, each step is O(1), leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first k elements.\n2. Then, for each next window, subtract a[i] and add a[i + k], for i from 0 to n - k - 1.\n3. Keep track of all these sums, then divide each by k to get the average for each week.\n4. Finally, take the average of all those averages.\n\nBut wait, since we need the average of all the averages, maybe we can compute the total sum of all the window sums and then divide by (number of windows) * k?\n\nWait, because each average is sum / k. So the average of all averages is (sum of all window sums) / (number of windows * k). Because each window's average is sum_i/k, and there are m = n -k +1 windows. So total average is (sum of all sum_i) / (m *k).\n\nSo instead of calculating each average and then averaging them, I can just compute the total sum of all window sums, then divide by (m *k). Which is better because it avoids dealing with floating points until the end.\n\nSo how to compute the total sum of all window sums?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2. The windows are [3,4] sum 7, [4,7] sum 11. Total sum is 18. Number of windows is 2. So average is 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... Wait wait no, the sample output says for the first input, the output is 9.000... Wait what's the sample input again?\n\nWait the first input is:\n\nInput: 3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe output is 9.000000...\n\nWait wait, the note says that for that example, the result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 ?\n\nWait no. Wait the problem says that the answer is the average of all weeks. So for each week, compute the average, then take the average of those.\n\nIn the example, the two weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output says 9.000... Wait that's conflicting. Wait no, looking back at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nWait the first example's output is '9.0000000000'? Wait that can't be. Wait the problem says:\n\nIn the third example there are 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nFirst input is '3 2\\n3 4 7' and the output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait that's impossible. Because the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. The average of the averages would be 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the output is 9.0? That suggests that maybe the problem is not to average the averages, but to sum all the weeks' sums and divide by the number of weeks. Wait that would be 18/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nWait that's a contradiction. What's the actual problem statement?\n\nThe problem says: \"the average sleep time over all weeks\". So the average of the averages. But according to the sample input, the first example's output is 9.0, which would be the sum of the two weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 9. Which is the same as the average of the sums of the weeks. But why?\n\nAh, because the average of the averages is (sum of the averages) / (number of weeks). Which is equal to (sum of the sums) / (number of weeks * k). But in the sample, the output is (sum of the sums) / number of weeks. Which suggests that the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums.\n\nWait that's conflicting with the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ...\".\n\nIn that example, the result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 ?\n\nBut according to the sample output given in the problem, the output is 9.000..., which is 9. So let's compute:\n\n(3+4)/2 = 3.5, (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Average of these is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says: \"the average sleep time over all weeks.\"\n\nBut the note says: \"In the third example there are n−k+1=7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nWait that suggests that the answer is the sum of all the weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks. Which would be the average of the sums. Not the average of the averages. Which would be different.\n\nWait that's a critical point. So the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Because in the third example, they say that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which is the average of the sums. But why?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait what's the result? The sample input given in the problem has the first input as 3 2 and the output as 9.000... So for that case, the sum of the weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which is the sample output. So the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums of the weeks. Which is the same as the sum of all the sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nBut why does the problem description say \"average sleep time per week\"? That would imply that each week's average is computed, then the average of those. But according to the sample, it's the average of the sums.\n\nWait this is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nPolycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a = [3,4,7], then the result is ... \n\nIn the example, the result is (sum of the weeks) / (number of weeks). Which is 18/2 =9. But why?\n\nThe problem says, the answer is the average sleep time over all weeks. So for each week, the average is (sum of the week's sleep times) /k. Then the overall average is the average of those values. Which would be (sum of all week sums) / (k * m), where m is the number of weeks.\n\nBut according to the sample, the answer is sum of all week sums divided by m. Which suggests that the problem is to compute the average of the sums of the weeks, not the average of the averages.\n\nThis is a critical discrepancy. So what is correct here?\n\nLooking at the note in the problem:\n\n\"In the third example there are n−k+1=7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nSo the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which is the average of the sums. So that suggests that the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Which would be the same as the sum of all the sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the problem statement's wording. However, the sample indicates that the correct approach is to compute the average of the sums, not the average of the averages.\n\nSo for the first example, the sum of the weeks is 7+11=18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which is the sample output. So the problem is to compute the average of the sums of the weeks, not the average of the averages.\n\nBut why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider the average per week, but the problem requires the average of the sums. That seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, and the actual required output is the average of the sums. Which would make sense with the sample.\n\nSo, given that the sample indicates that the answer is the sum of all the sums divided by the number of weeks, we need to proceed accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute the sum of all the sums of each window, then divide by the number of windows (m = n -k +1).\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the sums of the weeks, not the average of the averages. Which is why the sample outputs are as such.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: compute the sum of all sliding window sums, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nSo how to compute the sum of all sliding window sums?\n\nThe sliding window approach can be used. For example, for the first window, sum is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then, for each next window, subtract a[i] and add a[i +k], etc. But for the purpose of getting the total sum of all window sums, we can accumulate each window's sum as we go.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, the first window sum is 7, then the next is 11. The total is 18.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first window. Then, for each next window, add (current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]) to the total. So the total is accumulated as we go.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial window sum.\n\n2. Add it to the total.\n\n3. Then for each i from 0 to (n -k -1):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]\n\n   add to total.\n\nThen, divide the total by m (number of windows) to get the answer.\n\nYes. So that's manageable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo first, read n and k. Then read the array.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, for the rest of the windows, update the sum and add to the total.\n\nBut how to handle the initial sum?\n\nLet me think.\n\nFor example, for the first window, sum is sum(a[0...k-1]).\n\nThen, for the next window, it's sum - a[0] + a[k].\n\nThen, for the next, sum -a[1] + a[k+1], etc.\n\nSo the total number of windows is m = n -k +1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead list a.\n\nif k ==0? Well, constraints say 1<=k<=n, so no.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nthen for i in range(1, m):\n\n   initial_sum = initial_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n   total += initial_sum\n\nThen, the answer is total / m.\n\nBut wait, for m = n -k +1. So for example, when n=3, k=2, m=2. So the loop runs from i=1 to m-1? Because for m=2, the loop runs once (i=1). Let me check:\n\nThe initial sum is added once. Then, for each of the remaining (m-1) windows, we compute and add.\n\nYes. So the loop runs for (m-1) times. So for i in 0 to m-2? Or for i in 1 to m-1?\n\nIn code, for example, in Python, for i in range(1, m):\n\nBut m is n -k +1. So for the first window, we have already added it. Then for the next (m-1) windows, we compute each.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n   total += current_sum\n\nBut how to compute i +k -1?\n\nWait, for the first iteration, i=1. The previous window starts at i=0. The next window starts at i=1. So the new element is at position i +k -1 = 1 +k -1 =k. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the first window, starting at index 0, the next window starts at index 1. The previous element is a[0], and the new element is a[1 +k -1] = a[k].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nOnce the total is computed, the answer is total / m.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer needs to be printed with enough decimal digits, with absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. So we need to output it with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, total is 18, m is 2. 18/2 =9. So output 9.0000000000.\n\nSo in Python, how to print that?\n\nWe can compute the value as a float, then format it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut for large numbers, perhaps using floating point division could have precision issues. However, given that the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, and that Python uses double-precision floats (which have about 15-17 decimal digits of precision), it's safe to compute the total as a sum of integers, then divide by m as a float.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute initial_sum as sum of first k elements.\n\ntotal = initial_sum.\n\nThen for i in 1 to m-1:\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n   total += current_sum\n\nThen answer = total / m.\n\nPrint answer with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle the cases when m is 0? Well, since k <=n, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n\ninitial_sum = 3+4=7.\n\nm = 3-2+1=2.\n\ntotal starts as 7.\n\nThen, for i=1 (since m-1 is 1, the loop runs once):\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7 -3 + a[2] = 4 +7 = 11. total becomes 7+11=18.\n\nanswer is 18/2=9. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nInput is '1 1\\n10'\n\nm =1-1+1=1.\n\ntotal is sum([10]) =10. answer is 10/1=10. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nInput is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'\n\nSo the array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1], k=2, n=8. m=8-2+1=7.\n\nSo the windows are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3\n\n[2,4] sum 6\n\n[4,100000] sum 100004\n\n[100000, 123] sum 100123\n\n[123,456] sum 579\n\n[456,789] sum 1245\n\n[789,1] sum 790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n3 +6 =9.\n\n+100004 = 100013.\n\n+100123 = 200136.\n\n+579 = 200715.\n\n+1245 = 201,960.\n\n+790 = 202,750.\n\nThen divide by 7: 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output of '28964.2857142857'.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the array? Let's see.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nThen read the array as list of integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k]).\n\ntotal = initial_sum.\n\nThen for i in range(1, m):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n   total += current_sum\n\nThen, answer = total / m.\n\nThen, print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut for large n and k, the sum can be very big. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut for the case when m is 1, the loop doesn't run, and total is initial_sum, which is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the user provided the input as:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems like multiple test cases. However, the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the user says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). \n\nSo the problem is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking back, the problem says:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nBut this suggests that there are three test cases. However, the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. But looking at the problem statement again, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input given in the problem seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the way the user presented the sample input.\n\nBut in the problem statement's note, the third example is given as input 8 2 followed by some numbers, and output is 28964.285..., which is correct. So perhaps the sample input provided by the user is for multiple test cases. However, the problem as stated is for a single test case.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases, but the original problem is for a single test case. This is a bit confusing. However, looking at the problem statement's input and output sections, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input given by the user shows multiple test cases. However, perhaps that's a mistake. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nIn the problem statement's sample input, the first line is:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich would produce the first output. But the user's sample input shows three separate test cases. However, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem's formatting. For example, perhaps the user intended to show that the code should process multiple test cases, but the original problem only requires processing one.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input in the problem shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's an error. But given that the user included that in the problem, perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin. How is the input provided? For example, in programming competitions, each test case is processed separately. But in the problem's sample input, there are three test cases. However, the original problem's input is for a single test case.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, looking back at the problem statement's input and output sections:\n\nThe input is two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nThe output is one line with the answer.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the sample input given by the user shows multiple test cases. Perhaps that's a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to present three examples. However, the code should handle a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem's note shows three test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the way the user presented the problem. For example, perhaps the user is showing three examples, each with their own input and output. But the actual code should read one test case.\n\nIn any case, the code should read from stdin, and process a single test case.\n\nSo the code will read two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nThus, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and k.\n\nRead the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen compute as discussed.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. However, sometimes for multiple lines, it's better to read all input at once.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, the code should read the two lines.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is provided via multiple lines, the code may need to read them correctly.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the second line has exactly n numbers.\n\nOnce that's done, proceed.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for cases where n is 1, k is 1. Then m is 1, and the sum is a[0], divided by 1.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead a.\n\nm = n -k +1.\n\nif m ==0: impossible since k <=n.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k]).\n\ntotal = initial_sum.\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum.\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\nans = total / m\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nBut in Python, when you print, you need to ensure that even if the number is an integer, it's printed with 10 decimal digits.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, 9.0 is printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nIn Python, formatting with .10f will do that.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nans = 9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: 10.0 → same.\n\nThird sample's ans is 28964.2857142857... which when printed with 10 decimals would be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut how to format it correctly?\n\nPython's string formatting will handle that.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nBut in code:\n\nWe need to read the input correctly. Also, note that sometimes the second line may have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what about when the input is read via sys.stdin?\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    m = n - k + 1\n\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n    total = current_sum\n\n    for i in range(1, m):\n\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n        total += current_sum\n\n    ans = total / m\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nBut wait, for the third sample, the code computes the total as 202750, divided by 7 → 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimals is 28964.2857142857.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, when you use the format string with .10f, it rounds to 10 decimal places. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So printing 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, test for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n =k =1. So m=1. The sum is a[0], divided by 1 → a[0]. Output as a float.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, k=2. Then m=1. Same as above.\n\nEdge case 3: n=5, k=3. m=3. So the windows are [a0,a1,a2], [a1,a2,a3], [a2,a3,a4].\n\nSum of sums is (sum1 + sum2 + sum3). Divided by 3.\n\nNow, code should handle this.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=1. Then each window is a single element. The sum of all windows is sum(a), and divided by m =n. So the average is sum(a)/n. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as k consecutive days from a list of n recorded sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of all possible k-day windows and then determining the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum of each k-day window from scratch, we use a sliding window approach to efficiently update the sum as we move from one window to the next. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n2. **Sum Calculation**: We start by calculating the sum of the first k elements. For each subsequent window, we adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is left behind and adding the new element that comes into the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: After computing the total sum of all window sums, we divide this total by the number of valid windows (n - k + 1) to get the final result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    m = n - k + 1\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n        total += current_sum\n    ans = total / m\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains two integers n (number of days) and k (length of a week). The second line contains the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is calculated to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures that each sum calculation is done in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of valid windows (m) to compute the final average, which is printed with 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result using linear time complexity, making it suitable even for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
