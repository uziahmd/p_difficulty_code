For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it cycles back to C. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of semitones when moving from the lower to the higher note. But since the order is cyclic, I need to find the positions of each note in this list and compute the differences.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the notes. Maybe create a list that contains all the notes in order. Then for any note, its index in this list can be used to compute distances.\n\nFor example, the list would be:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that after H comes C again. So the distance between H and C is 1 semitone. Also, the distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but only if we consider the direction. Wait no, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Let's check:\n\nC is index 0. E is index 4. 4-0=4. So that's correct. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because you have to go from E (index 4) to H (index 11) which is 7 steps, then to C (index 0) which is one more, total 8. So the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) if y is higher than x, else (12 - (x_pos - y_pos))? Or perhaps (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12? Wait no, because when you take the distance from X to Y along the scale, you have to go upwards. So if X is before Y, then it's (y - x) semitones. If X is after Y, then it's (12 - (x - y)) semitones. For example, from E (4) to C (0) is 8 semitones. Which is (0 + 12 -4) = 8? Wait, 0 -4 is -4, but mod 12 would be 8. So maybe the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12? Wait no. Because if X is at position 0 (C), Y is at position 4 (E), then the distance is 4. Which is (4-0) mod 12 =4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note, so if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. Otherwise, it's the other way around. So the formula (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12 gives the correct distance. Wait, but for example, if X is C (0) and Y is H (11), then the distance is 11-0 = 11 semitones. Which is correct. If X is H (11) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1 semitone. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (y -x). If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (x - y)). Which is equivalent to (y - x) mod 12. Because for example, if x is 0, y is 11: (y -x) is 11 mod 12 is 11. If x is 11, y is 0: (0 -11) mod 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent the musical notes in a list in their cyclic order. This helps in calculating the distances between any two notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, calculate the distance in semitones using their positions in the list. The distance from note X to note Y is calculated as `(y_pos - x_pos) % 12`.\n3. **Check Permutations**: Since the order of notes in a chord can vary, generate all permutations of the three input notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n4. **Major and Minor Criteria**: A major chord requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note. A minor chord requires a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    # Define the order of notes\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    \n    # Read input\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to map note to its index\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    \n    # Check all permutations of the three notes\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        \n        # Calculate distances\n        dist_xy = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        dist_yz = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        \n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    \n    # If none matched\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Order and Indexing**: The list `notes_order` contains the notes in their cyclic order. This allows us to quickly find the position of any note using a dictionary `note_to_index`.\n- **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that we check every possible ordering of the notes to see if they form a valid major or minor chord.\n- **Distance Calculation**: Using modular arithmetic, we compute the distances between notes in semitones, ensuring correctness even when notes wrap around the end of the scale.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes and correctly identifies whether the chord is major, minor, or neither.",
