For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. For example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, C# to D is another, D to D#, then D# to E. So that's 4 steps. So the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but since the distance is measured as the number of semitones from lower to upper, maybe we need to calculate it as (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the distance between two notes can be calculated by taking the difference in their positions in the list, modulo 12, but considering the direction. Wait, no. Let me think: for example, the distance between C (index 0) and E (index 4) is 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because moving forward from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No. Wait, if X is before Y, then the distance is Y_index - X_index. If X is after Y, then the distance is (12 - X_index + Y_index). Wait, but that's equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No. Because if Y is before X, then (Y_index - X_index) would be negative. But the distance is always positive. So for example, if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0), then the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (0 - 4 + 12) = 8. So the formula is (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12? No, because if Y is higher than X, then Y_index - X_index is positive, and adding 12 and mod 12 would give the same value. Wait, but the distance is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the upward direction. So the correct way is to compute (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then 4-0=4, mod 12 is 4. Correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then 0-4 = -4. mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (12 - (X_index - Y_index))? Which is the same as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Because mod 12 gives the correct value. So, yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Wait, but mod 12 returns a value between 0 and 11. However, the distance between two different notes is between 1 and 11 semitones. Because if they are same note, the distance is zero. But in our case, the problem says that a chord is a set of three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. But perhaps they can be same? Well, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But perhaps the input will have three distinct notes. But according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But for the problem, the input is three notes. So perhaps they are all distinct. But regardless, the code must handle any input",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves calculating the distances between the notes in a cyclic manner and checking if they meet the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: First, we map each note to its corresponding index in the sequence of 12 musical notes. This helps in quickly calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using their indices. The distance from note X to note Y is determined as `(Y_index - X_index) % 12`. This ensures that the distance is measured in the upward direction along the musical scale.\n3. **Check Major and Minor Triads**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if they form a major or minor triad by verifying the required distances:\n   - A **major triad** has distances of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A **minor triad** has distances of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note into its corresponding index in the list of musical notes, facilitating distance calculations.\n- **Distance Check**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation match the criteria for major or minor triads.\n- **Permutations Check**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. If none do, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are considered, and efficiently determines the type of chord using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
