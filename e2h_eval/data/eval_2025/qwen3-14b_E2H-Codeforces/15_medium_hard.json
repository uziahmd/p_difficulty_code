They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given certain rules for each phase. \n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There are 2^n teams, and each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The tournament has n phases. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the string s tells us whether higher or lower skill wins. For example, if s is \"101\", then phase 1 (the first phase) uses higher skill, phase 2 uses lower, phase 3 uses higher. Wait, the description says that s_i corresponds to the i-th phase, which has 2^{n-i} games. So for n=3, the phases are 3 in total. The first phase (i=1) has 2^(3-1) = 4 games. Then phase 2 has 2^(3-2)=2 games, and phase 3 has 2^(3-3)=1 game. \n\nThe key here is that for each phase, the way matches are decided depends on the character in s. For example, during phase i, every match in that phase is decided by either the higher or lower skill level. \n\nThe goal is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, but we need to find for which x there exists some arrangement where x ends up as the winner.\n\nBut how to model the tournament structure and the rules for each phase?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for each round, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winner is determined based on the current phase's rule. \n\nThe challenge is that the permutation p determines the initial positions of the teams. However, since we can choose any permutation, perhaps we can arrange the initial positions such that the team x can reach the final by winning each round according to the rules.\n\nBut how do we model the possible paths that x can take through the tournament?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each possible x, determine if there exists a way to arrange the initial positions such that x can win all the rounds, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how to model the rounds? For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. But the actual team's positions depend on the permutation. So, perhaps the problem is to find for each x, whether there's a way to assign the teams into the bracket such that x can win each round according to the phase rules.\n\nBut how can we model the rounds? Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each round is a level of the tree. The leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node represents a match between two teams. The winner proceeds to the next round.\n\nBut the structure of the tournament is fixed. The way the matches are arranged is fixed: for example, in the first round, the first two teams play each other, then the next two, etc. The next round is between the winners of adjacent pairs, etc. So the structure is fixed. However, the initial positions of the teams (i.e., the permutation p) can be arranged in any way.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the permutation p is given. Wait no, the problem says that the permutation p is chosen by us (as part of finding whether x is a winning integer). We need to find if there exists a permutation p such that when the tournament is run according to the rules of the string s, the team with skill x is the winner.\n\nSo the question is, for each x, can we arrange the teams in the initial bracket in such a way that x can win through all rounds, given the rules for each phase.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, depending on the phase (which corresponds to the round number), the winner is determined by the rule (higher or lower skill).\n\nSo, for example, in the first round (phase 1), each match is determined by the rule s[0] (assuming 0-based index). Then, the second round (phase 2) uses s[1], and so on.\n\nBut how does the structure of the tournament affect the path of the team x?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team starts at a leaf. Each match in the first round is between two leaves. The winner moves up to the next level, and so on until the root.\n\nThe problem is that the initial positions of the teams (the permutation) can be arranged in any way. So, for x to be a winner, we need to arrange the initial bracket such that x can win all the required matches, considering the rules for each phase.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's path through the tournament?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a function that, given the current round (phase) and the set of possible teams that can reach this round, returns the possible candidates that can proceed to the next round.\n\nAlternatively, for each round (phase), we can model what is the minimal and maximal skill level that can reach that round.\n\nWait, but the rules for each phase are different. For example, in phase i, the matches are determined by whether s[i] is 0 or 1. So, during phase i, when two teams meet, the winner is the one with lower or higher skill.\n\nBut the problem is that the tournament is structured in a way that, for each round, the teams are grouped into pairs. For example, in the first round, the initial teams are grouped into pairs. The winners of those pairs go to the next round, grouped again into pairs, etc.\n\nSo, for a team to reach the final, it must win each round. The key is to determine, for each round, what constraints are placed on the team's skill level.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints? Let's think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round k (from 1 to n), the team must win in that round. The way they win depends on the rule for that phase.\n\nBut the team's path through the tournament depends on the initial arrangement. For example, in the first round, the team can be placed in any position, but the opponents in each round depend on the structure.\n\nBut perhaps, for x to be the winner, we can determine for each round what is the minimum and maximum possible value that x must have compared to the other teams in its path.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose n=1, s is '1'. So there are 2 teams. In phase 1 (the only phase), the higher skill wins. So the team with higher skill (2) will win. Therefore, the output is 2.\n\nAnother example: n=2, s is '01'. The string is length 2. Phase 1 (first round) uses 0 (lower skill wins), phase 2 (second round) uses 1 (higher skill wins). How can x be the winner?\n\nLet's think. There are 4 teams. The first round has 2 matches. Let's say in phase 1, lower skill wins. So for the first round, the team with lower skill wins. Then in the second round, higher skill wins.\n\nSuppose x is 2. How can it win?\n\nIn the first round, x must be in a match where it has lower skill than the opponent. Wait, but the rule is that lower skill wins. So if x is 2, then in the first round, the opponent must have higher skill. Then x would win the first round. Then in the second round, the two winners (x and someone else) must play. The rule here is higher skill wins. So x (2) must be higher than the other. So the other must be 1. So the arrangement would be:\n\nFirst round: 1 vs 2 (lower wins: 1 wins?), but wait no, if x is 2, then in the first round, x must win. For that, the opponent must be higher. So in the first round, x (skill 2) is paired with a team with higher skill (say 3 or 4). Then x would win because in phase 1, lower skill wins. Wait, no. If the rule is lower skill wins, then the lower of the two skills wins. So if x is 2, and the opponent is 3, then 2 is lower, so x wins. Then in the second round, x (2) must face someone else. Let's say the other winner is 1. Then, in phase 2, the rule is higher skill wins. So between 2 and 1, higher (2) wins. So x=2 is champion. So that's possible. Therefore, 2 is a valid answer.\n\nBut what about x=3? Let's see. To get to the second round, in phase 1, x (3) must be in a match where the opponent has higher skill (so that 3 is lower and wins). For example, if x is paired with 4. Then 3 wins. Then in the second round, x (3) must face someone. Let's say the other winner is 1. Then phase 2 is higher skill wins. 3 is higher than 1, so wins. So yes, x=3 is possible. Similarly, x=4 can be arranged as follows: in the first round, pair with someone higher (but there's no one higher than 4). So that's not possible. So x=4 can't make it. So for the example input of n=2, s=01, the output is 2 and 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample input given. For example, the third sample input is 2\\n01, and the output is 2 3.\n\nSo how do we model this for general cases?\n\nThe idea is that, for each round (phase), the team must be able to win that round's matches, given the rule. But the opponents in each round depend on how the team is placed in the bracket.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial positions, perhaps we can find for each x, the minimal and maximal constraints on the other teams in its path.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team must be able to win against the possible opponents in that round, based on the rule for that phase.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents?\n\nPerhaps for each round, the team x must be either the minimum or maximum in its subtree, depending on the rules of that phase.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Let's consider that in order to reach the final, the team x must win in each round. For each round, the way x wins depends on the rule for that round.\n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is 0, then in each match, the lower skill wins. So, for x to win the first round, it must be that x is the lower-skilled team in its match. Therefore, the opponent must have a higher skill than x. But since we can arrange the initial positions, we can choose that x is paired with someone higher. But then, in the next round, x must again win, according to the rule of phase 2.\n\nBut how do the subsequent rounds affect the possible opponents?\n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps we can model for each possible round, the constraints on x's skill relative to the other teams in its path.\n\nAnother approach: For each x, determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to win all rounds, given the rules.\n\nFor example, during phase 1 (first round), if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the lower in its match. Therefore, in that round, x must be the minimum of the two teams in that match. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can arrange that x is in a match where the other team is higher. So for this round, x can be any value, as long as there exists a higher value in the same group. But then, for the next rounds, the constraints may vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering for each round, what is the required relation between x and the other teams in the same bracket.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. The root is the final match. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node has two children (the matches that feed into it). \n\nTo reach the root, x must win all the matches along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nEach match in the path is in a certain phase. For example, the first match (leaf's parent) is in phase 1. The next match (the parent of that node) is in phase 2, and so on.\n\nSo, for x to reach the root, in each of these matches, x must be the winner according to the phase's rule.\n\nNow, the key is that for each match in the path, the other participant must be such that x wins. However, the other participants in the matches depend on the structure of the tournament and the arrangement of the initial bracket.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps for each round, we can choose the opponents in such a way that x can win.\n\nLet me think of the rounds in reverse. For example, in the last round (phase n), there's only one match. The rule is s[n-1]. For x to win, it must be the higher or lower skill, depending on the rule. So, in this match, x must be the winner. The other participant must be such that x beats them.\n\nBut the other participant comes from the other half of the bracket. How can we ensure that?\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, maybe for each round, we can find the constraints on x's skill relative to the number of teams that must be in certain ranges.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved with a recursive approach, considering for each round the necessary conditions on x's skill.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round (from the last to the first), determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the rules of the phases.\n\nLet me think of the process for each round. Suppose that in the current round (phase i), the rule is r (0 or 1). For x to reach this round, it must have survived all previous rounds. Now, during this round, x must be able to win against the opponent in this round.\n\nBut the opponent is the winner of another subtree. How can we model the possible opponents?\n\nAlternatively, for each round, the number of teams that x must \"defeat\" is determined by the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first round, x must defeat one team. In the second round, another, etc.\n\nBut perhaps, for each round, we can model the constraints on x's skill level based on the rules of that round and the subsequent rounds.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define for each depth d (where d=0 is the first round, and d=n-1 is the last round), the possible range of x's skill that allows it to reach the final.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. For each round, the team must be able to win in that round. For example, in the last round (phase n), the team must be the winner of the match, which depends on the rule. Let's assume that in the last round, the team x must be the maximum or minimum of the two teams in that match. But since we can arrange the other team, perhaps we can choose the other team to be either higher or lower than x, depending on the rule.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for the last round. Suppose the rule is 1 (higher skill wins). Then, x must be higher than the other team. Since we can arrange the other team to be any team except x, but we need to make sure that this other team can be in the other half of the bracket. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the other team to be any value less than x. Similarly, if the rule is 0, x must be lower than the other team, so we can choose the other team to be higher than x.\n\nBut how does this affect the previous rounds?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for a given round (depth), we need to determine what is the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model for each round (starting from the last one and moving backward) the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have in order to reach the final.\n\nFor example, in the last round (phase n), the rule is s[n-1]. For x to win this round, the other team must be such that x is either higher or lower than it, depending on the rule. Since we can choose the other team, we can set this condition. However, the other team must have been able to reach this round, which requires that it passed all previous rounds.\n\nBut how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, for each round, we can find the minimal and maximal value that x must have in order to survive all rounds up to that point, considering the rules of the phases.\n\nLet's think of this as follows:\n\nLet’s define for each round (depth) k (starting from 0 for the first round, up to n-1 for the last), the minimal and maximal possible value of x that can reach the final, given the rules up to that round.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me try with an example. Take the sample input where n=3 and s is '101'.\n\ns is '1','0','1' for phases 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet's work backwards. Starting from the last phase (phase 3, which is the third round, the final match). The rule is '1', meaning higher skill wins. So, in this match, x must be higher than the opponent. The opponent must have reached this round, which means it has passed all previous rounds.\n\nBut how to model the opponent's constraints?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for a given round, the number of teams that x must defeat is 2^{k} teams, where k is the number of rounds passed. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the structure.\n\nEach round halves the number of teams. So, for the first round, there are 2^{n} teams. After each round, it's halved. The last round (round n) has 2 teams.\n\nSo, for x to reach the final, it must have survived n rounds. Each round has a certain rule.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round, starting from the last one and moving backward, determine the constraints on x's value based on the rule of that round and the constraints from the next rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n), during which the rule is s[i-1], we can compute the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have in order to pass through all rounds up to that point.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by some solutions I've seen before for similar problems. Let's think of the tournament as a series of rounds, and for each round, the team must be either the minimum or maximum in its subtree, depending on the rules of that round.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nAt each round, the team must be the minimum or maximum in its group of size 2^{k}, where k is the number of rounds remaining. For example, in the last round (round n), the group is of size 2 (the two teams). The team must be the maximum or minimum, depending on the rule of that round.\n\nFor the previous rounds, the group size is larger, and the constraints accumulate.\n\nFor example, suppose in the last round (round n), the rule is 1 (max wins). Then, in that round, x must be the maximum of the two teams. Therefore, in the previous round (round n-1), x must have been the winner of its match, which depends on the rule of that round.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for all rounds?\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's imagine that for each round i (starting from the first to the nth), the team must be the minimum or maximum in a group of size 2^{n - i + 1} teams. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe tournament has n rounds. The first round (round 1) has 2^{n-1} matches. Each team in this round is part of a group of 2 teams. The winner proceeds to the next round.\n\nIn round 2, each group of 2 teams from round 1 is combined into groups of 2, leading to 2^{n-2} matches. So, each team in round 2 is the winner of a group of 2 teams from round 1. Thus, for a team to reach round 2, it must have been the winner of a group of 2 teams in round 1.\n\nSimilarly, for round i, the team must have been the winner of a group of 2^{i-1} teams. Because each round doubles the group size. For example, in round 1, group size is 2^1 teams (since you need to win one match). Round 2, group size is 2^2 teams. And so on until round n, where group size is 2^n teams (the entire tournament).\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, for each round i, the rule s[i-1] determines whether the team must be the minimum or maximum in its group of size 2^i teams. Because during that round, the team must have won its match, which depends on the rule.\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, during round i, the team is in a match against another team. The winner is determined by the rule for that round. So, for the team to have won that match, it must be the minimum or maximum of the two teams in that match. But the match is part of a larger group of teams that the team must have defeated in previous rounds.\n\nBut perhaps, for each round, the team must be the minimum or maximum in the group of size 2^{i} teams. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the following: For the team to reach round i, it must have been the winner of a group of size 2^i teams. The way it was determined depends on the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me take the example of n=3, s=101 (phases 1: higher, phase 2: lower, phase 3: higher).\n\nLet's consider for each round, what the constraints on x are.\n\nStarting from the last round (phase 3, rule is higher). For x to win this round, it must be the higher of the two teams in the final match. So, the other team must be lower than x. But how did that other team get to the final? It must have passed through all previous rounds with their own rules.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding x's possible value, perhaps we can model the constraints as follows:\n\nAt each round i, the team x must be either the minimum or maximum of a group of 2^i teams, depending on the rule of that round.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn round 1 (phase 1), the rule is higher (s[0] = '1'). So, x must be the maximum of a group of 2^1 = 2 teams. Therefore, in this group, x is the maximum.\n\nIn round 2 (phase 2), the rule is lower (s[1] = '0'). So, x must be the minimum of a group of 2^2=4 teams. Because during round 2, the team must have won its match by being the lower of the two teams. But since the group of 4 teams includes the previous group of 2 teams (from round 1) and another group of 2 teams (from round 1), the team x must be the minimum of the two groups' winners. Which requires that x is the minimum of the four teams.\n\nWait, this might not be correct. Let me think again. For round 2, the group of 4 teams is formed by combining two groups of 2 teams each. The winner of each group is the one that passed round 1. For x to be the winner of round 2, during phase 2 (rule is lower), x must be the lower of the two teams in the match. So, during round 2, x's opponent is the winner of another group of 2 teams. For x to win this match, x must be lower than that opponent. But how does that relate to the entire group of 4 teams?\n\nWell, the group of 4 teams consists of the two groups of 2 teams each. The winner of the first group is x (who was the maximum in that group due to phase 1's rule). The winner of the second group must be the maximum of that group (if the rule for phase 1 was higher). Wait, but phase 1's rule is higher, so during round 1, the winners are the maximums of their groups. So in round 2, the two teams are maxima of their respective groups of 2. For x to win round 2 (rule is lower), x must be the lower of these two maxima. Therefore, x must be the minimum of the two maxima. Which implies that x is the minimum of all four teams in the group of 4. Because the other group's maximum is higher than x (since x is the minimum between the two maxima). Wait, no. Suppose the first group has max x, and the second group has max y. For x to be the lower of the two, x < y. Therefore, x is the minimum between x and y. But the group of four teams includes both groups. The maximum of the four teams would be y. But x is the minimum of the two maxima. However, the group of four teams could have other teams that are lower than x. So, perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nHmm. This line of thinking seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAnother idea: For each round, the team must be able to survive that round. To survive, it must be the best (according to the rule) in its match. The opponents in each round depend on the previous rounds. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can arrange the opponents in such a way that x can win each round.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each round, the team x must be able to be the best (according to the rule) in its match. To ensure that, we can choose the opponents in such a way that in each round, x is the best possible according to the rule. \n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is higher, then x must be the higher of the two teams. So, we can pair x with a team that has a lower skill. Then, x wins. For the next round (phase 2), if the rule is lower, then x must be the lower of the two teams in that round. So, we can arrange that the other team in the match is someone with higher skill than x. Then, x wins. And so on.\n\nBut how do we ensure that such opponents exist in each round? For example, in the first round, there must be at least one team with lower skill than x (if phase 1 rule is higher). Similarly, in the next round, there must be at least one team with higher skill than x (if phase 2 rule is lower). But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange that.\n\nBut the problem is that the opponents in each round are determined by the initial bracket. For example, in the first round, x is paired with someone. In the second round, x is paired with the winner of another group. But how to ensure that the winner of that other group has the required skill relative to x?\n\nThis seems to require that in each round, there are enough teams with the appropriate skills to allow x to win.\n\nSo, for x to be able to win the tournament, it must satisfy certain constraints based on the rules of each round. For example, for each round i, depending on the rule of that round, x must be either the minimum or maximum of a certain number of teams.\n\nLet me think of it this way: For each round i, during which the rule is r_i (0 or 1), the team x must be able to be the r_i-winner (minimum or maximum) in a group of size 2^i teams. Because, for each round, the team x must have defeated 2^{i-1} teams (since each round halves the number of teams). Wait, for example, in round 1, the group size is 2^1=2 teams, and x must be the winner of that group. In round 2, the group size is 2^2=4 teams, and x must be the winner of that group (by having won two rounds). So, the group size doubles each round. Therefore, for round i, the group size is 2^i teams, and x must be the winner of that group, according to the rule of that round.\n\nIf this is true, then we can model the problem as follows: For x to be a winning integer, there must exist a sequence of group sizes (2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^n) such that for each i-th round (1-based), x is either the minimum or maximum of the group of 2^i teams, depending on the rule for that round.\n\nBut how can we determine this for x?\n\nLet me think about the constraints for each round. For example, for round i, the rule is r_i. So, x must be the minimum or maximum of a group of 2^i teams. \n\nLet me think about what this implies for x. For example, if in round 1, the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum of a group of 2 teams. So, there must be at least one team with lower skill than x. For round 2, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the minimum of a group of 4 teams. So, in this group of 4 teams, x is the smallest. Which implies that there are three teams with higher skill than x. But how can this be possible if in the first round, x was the maximum of a group of 2 teams (so there was at least one team lower than x)? \n\nThis seems contradictory. Because, in the first round, x was the maximum of a group of 2 teams. In the second round, x is the minimum of a group of 4 teams. That implies that in the second round's group of 4 teams, x is the smallest. Which would mean that the other three teams have higher skills than x. But in the first round, x was the maximum of a group of 2 teams, which implies that there is at least one team lower than x. However, this team could be part of the same group as x in the second round. Wait, but in the second round, the group of 4 teams consists of two groups of 2 teams each. The first group had x as the maximum (so there was one team lower than x). The second group had some other teams. For x to be the minimum of the group of 4 teams, the other group must have teams all higher than x, and the first group's other team must also be higher than x. But that would require that x is the minimum of all four teams. However, the first group's other team was lower than x. So this seems impossible. \n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect. So, what's wrong with the reasoning?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in assuming that the group size for round i is 2^i. Let me re-express this.\n\nLet me think of the group size for each round. For example, the first round (round 1) has groups of 2 teams. Each team in this round is part of a group of 2. To win this round, the team must be the winner of that group. The next round (round 2) has groups of 2 teams, each consisting of two winners from round 1. So, the group size for round 2 is 2 teams, but each group is made up of 2^1 teams from the previous rounds. Wait, no. The group size for round i is 2 teams, but the number of teams that x has to be better than increases with each round.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each round, the number of teams that x must be the best among is 2^{i} teams. For example, in round 1, x must be the best among 2 teams. In round 2, x must be the best among 4 teams (because it has to win two rounds). In round 3, x must be the best among 8 teams, and so on. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each round i, x must be the best (according to the rule) of 2^i teams. \n\nBut how does this fit with the example I mentioned earlier?\n\nTake n=3, s='101' (rules are [1,0,1]). For x to be the winner, it must be the best in 2^1=2 teams (round 1), then best in 2^2=4 teams (round 2), then best in 2^3=8 teams (round 3).\n\nLet's take x=4. \n\nRound 1: rule is 1 (higher wins). So x must be the maximum of 2 teams. So there is one team with lower skill than x (say 1, 2, or 3).\n\nRound 2: rule is 0 (lower wins). So x must be the minimum of 4 teams. This means that all other 3 teams in this group must be higher than x. But in the first round, x was the maximum of its group of 2 teams. So, in that group, there's one team lower than x. But this team is part of the group of 4 teams in round 2. So, this team is lower than x, which contradicts the requirement for round 2 that x is the minimum of the group of 4 teams. Hence, this suggests that x=4 cannot be a valid solution. But according to the sample input for n=3 and s=101, the output is 4 5 6 7. So clearly, there's a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, the sample input for the first example is n=3, s=101, and the output is 4 5 6 7. So x=4 is a valid solution. How is that possible?\n\nLet me think for x=4. Let's try to construct a scenario where x=4 wins.\n\nPhase 1 (round 1): rule is higher. So x must win its match by being higher. So, x=4 is paired with a team with lower skill, say 1. So 4 wins.\n\nPhase 2 (round 2): rule is lower. So x must win its match by being lower. So, in this round, x is paired with another team. Who is that team? It is the winner of another group from round 1. Let's say that group was between 5 and 6. The rule for round 1 is higher, so 6 wins. Now, in round 2, x=4 (from the first group) faces 6 (from the second group). The rule is lower, so the lower of the two wins. 4 is lower than 6, so x wins.\n\nPhase 3 (round 3): rule is higher. x=4 is paired with the winner of another group. Let's say that group was between 2 and 3. Rule for round 1 is higher, so 3 wins. Then, in round 2, rule is lower. So 3 faces another winner (say 7, from a group of 7 and 8, where 8 wins round 1). In round 2, rule is lower: 3 is lower than 8, so 3 wins. Now, in round 3, x=4 faces 3. Rule is higher, so 4 wins. Hence, x=4 is the champion. \n\nSo this works. But according to the earlier reasoning, in round 2, x=4 must be the minimum of a group of 4 teams. However, in this scenario, the group of 4 teams for round 2 consists of the teams 1, 4 (from the first group), and 5, 6 (from the second group). Wait, no. The group of 4 teams for round 2 is the two groups from round 1. Each group has two teams. The winners are 4 and 6. So in round 2, the group of 4 teams includes the original 4 teams (1,4 in one group; 5,6 in another). But x=4 is the winner of its group. In round 2, x is in a match against 6. The other group's winner is 6. So the group for round 2 has two teams: 4 and 6. But why is this considered a group of 4 teams? Because the group size for round 2 is 2 teams, but the number of teams that x has to be the best of is 2^2=4? That doesn't seem to align.\n\nAh, I think the earlier assumption about the group size was incorrect. So, perhaps the correct way to think is that, for each round i, the team x must be able to win its match in that round, given the rule of that round. The opponents in that match depend on the previous rounds, but since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponents such that x can win.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to determine what constraints are placed on x's skill level based on the rules of that round and the subsequent rounds.\n\nLet",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure and rules for each phase are provided, and we need to find all possible winning skill levels.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `2^n` teams and `n` phases. Each phase halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either higher or lower skill level wins) which determines the winner of each match in that phase.\n3. **Constraints Analysis**: For a team with skill level `x` to be a winner, it must be able to win each phase according to the rules. This involves ensuring that `x` can be the minimum or maximum in its group of teams for each phase, depending on the rule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # For each x in 1..2^n, check if it can be the winner\n    max_val = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    result = []\n    \n    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):\n        # We need to check if x can be the winner\n        # We'll simulate the constraints from each phase\n        # For each phase i (0-based), we track the required min and max\n        # We'll use a recursive approach to compute the necessary ranges\n        # Let's think of it as building up the constraints from the last phase to the first\n        \n        # Initialize the current range for x\n        # At each phase, we will compute the required min and max\n        # Starting from the last phase (phase n-1)\n        low = 1\n        high = max_val\n        \n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            # current phase is i-th (0-based), which corresponds to the (i+1)-th round\n            rule = s[i]\n            # For this phase, we need to adjust the low and high based on the rule\n            # How many teams are in the group for this phase?\n            # For phase i (0-based), the group size is 2^(n - i)\n            # But how does this affect the constraints?\n            # Let's think recursively:\n            # If the rule is '1' (higher wins), then in this phase, x must be the maximum in its group.\n            # So, there must be at least one team in the group that is less than x.\n            # Therefore, the minimal number of teams that must be less than x is 2^{i} - 1 (since group size is 2^{n-i}, but this might not be correct)\n            # Alternatively, for each phase, the number of teams that x must be compared against increases.\n            # Another approach: for each phase, we determine the minimal and maximal value that x must have to satisfy the rule.\n            # For example, during phase i, if the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group.
