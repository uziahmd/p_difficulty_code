They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament proceeds in phases, and each phase's matches are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the matches are decided based on whether s[i-1] is 0 or 1. In each match of phase i, the lower or higher skill level team wins, depending on the character.\n\nOur task is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x whether it can be the champion under some permutation p that fits the rules of the string s.\n\nBut how do we approach this? Let's think about the structure of the tournament. Since the tournament is a single-elimination bracket, each team must win all their matches to become champion. The structure of the tournament depends on the string s, which determines the outcome of each match in each phase.\n\nWait, but the string s gives for each phase (from first to nth) the rule: in phase i (which is the ith phase?), during that phase, each match is decided by higher or lower skill. But what's the order of phases? Like, the first phase is when there are 2^n teams, then 2^{n-1} games, then next phase has 2^{n-1} teams, etc. So there are n phases in total. For example, when n=3, the first phase has 4 games (2^3-1 = 7 games total?), no. Wait, the problem says that the tournament consists of 2^n -1 games. For each phase, the number of games is halved each time. So the first phase has 2^{n-1} games (since each game eliminates one team, and you need to go from 2^n to 2^{n-1} teams). Then the second phase has 2^{n-2} games, and so on until the last phase has 1 game.\n\nSo the string s has length n. Each character corresponds to a phase. For example, the first character (s[0]) corresponds to phase 1 (the first round), which has 2^{n-1} games. The second character (s[1]) corresponds to phase 2, which has 2^{n-2} games, etc. So during phase i, the matches are between the winners of the previous phase's matches. \n\nThe problem is that for each x, we need to check if there's a permutation p (i.e., an arrangement of the skill levels) such that x is the champion. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the process of the tournament. The tournament is a binary tree structure. Each team must pass through n rounds. For example, in the first round, they are grouped into pairs, then the winners proceed to the next round, etc.\n\nBut the way the matches are decided depends on the phase. For each phase, the rule is fixed. For example, during phase i, when two teams meet, the winner is determined by comparing their skill levels. If the phase is 0, the lower skill wins; if 1, the higher skill wins.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily (as long as it's a permutation of 1..2^n), we need to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the teams such that x can win all the required matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how to model the constraints on x?\n\nAlternative approach: For a given x to be the champion, it must be possible that in each round (phase) of the tournament, x wins its match according to the rule of that phase. However, the other teams' positions and their skills must be arranged in such a way that x can reach the final and win all matches.\n\nBut how to model the path that x takes through the tournament. Let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose we have a function that, given a certain round (depth), and a set of possible candidates, returns the possible winners. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match. For x to be the champion, it must be in the correct path through the tree, and in each match along that path, x must win according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how to model the constraints on the other teams. For example, in the first phase, x's opponent must be a team that x can beat according to the rule of phase 1. Then, in the next phase, x's opponent must be someone that x can beat according to phase 2's rule, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is that the opponents depend on the structure of the bracket. For example, in the first phase, x is paired with another team. The winner of that pair moves on to the next phase. Then, in the next phase, that winner is paired with another winner from another pair. The pairing depends on the initial bracket structure.\n\nWait, but the initial bracket structure is fixed. The first phase pairs team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. Then the next phase pairs the winners of 1-2 vs 3-4, etc. So the structure of the bracket is fixed. So for any given x, the path through the bracket is determined by the initial position of x.\n\nWait, but the initial positions are determined by the permutation p. Because the permutation p assigns the skill levels to the teams. Wait, no. The problem says that the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. So the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket is fixed. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teams are split into pairs in the first phase as team 1 plays against team 2, etc. So the initial bracket is fixed. But the permutation p determines which team (by their index) has which skill level. So for example, team 1's skill is p_1, team 2's is p_2, etc. So the structure of the bracket is fixed (team indices are fixed), but the permutation p determines the skill levels of each team.\n\nBut our goal is to find for which x (values from 1 to 2^n) there exists a permutation p such that the team with skill x (i.e., the team whose p_i is x) is the champion.\n\nWait, but how does the permutation p affect the bracket? The permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. So for example, team 1 (the first team in the initial bracket) has skill p_1, team 2 has p_2, etc. The tournament is structured based on the initial positions (team 1, 2, etc.), but the actual skill levels are determined by the permutation. Our job is to choose p such that the team with skill x (i.e., the team in some position in the bracket) wins all the matches according to the rules of the string s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining for each x, whether there's a way to assign the skill levels (permutation p) such that the team with skill x (which is in some position in the bracket) can win all the matches in the tournament according to the rules of s.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the path that the team with skill x must take through the tournament. For example, in the first phase, the team is in some position, say position k. Depending on the bracket structure, the team will face a specific opponent. The result of that match depends on the rule for phase 1 (s[0]). Then, the winner proceeds to the next phase, where they face another opponent determined by the bracket structure, and so on.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary, we can arrange the skills of the teams in such a way that x can win all the matches. The challenge is to find the constraints on x based on the rules of the string s.\n\nLet me think about the tournament as a series of rounds. Each round corresponds to a phase. For example, the first round (phase 1) has 2^{n-1} matches. The second round (phase 2) has 2^{n-2} matches, etc.\n\nIn each round, the team must win their match according to the rule of that phase. Let's imagine that for x to be the champion, in each round i (from 1 to n), when x is playing in that round, the opponent must be a team that x can beat according to the rule of that phase. Also, the opponent must be such that they lose to x in that round.\n\nBut the problem is that the opponents are determined by the bracket structure. For example, in the first round, x's opponent is fixed based on their initial position. However, since the permutation p can be arranged, we can choose which team is in which position. So perhaps the idea is to arrange the permutation p such that x is placed in a position where, in each round, the opponents are weaker (or stronger, depending on the phase's rule) than x, allowing x to win all matches.\n\nBut how to model the required conditions for x.\n\nLet me consider the following approach. For x to be the champion, in each round i (from 1 to n), when x is playing in that round, the opponent must be such that:\n\n- If the rule for phase i is 1 (higher skill wins), then x must have higher skill than the opponent.\n\n- If the rule for phase i is 0 (lower skill wins), then x must have lower skill than the opponent.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in the phase i, the rule applies to all matches in that phase. So during phase i, when two teams meet, the winner is determined by comparing their skills. For example, during phase 1, the rule is s[0]. So, for x to win their match in phase 1, the opponent must have a skill that is either higher or lower than x's skill, depending on the rule. But how do we ensure that in the subsequent rounds?\n\nMoreover, in each round, the opponent depends on the previous rounds. For example, in the first round, x must beat their initial opponent. Then, in the second round, x must beat the winner of another match from the first round. And so on.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen, we can arrange the other teams' skills in such a way that x can always win in each round. However, the constraints are that in each round, the opponent in that round must be such that x can beat them according to the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how can we model the required conditions for x?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think about the minimum and maximum possible values that x must have in each round.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for each round i (starting from the first round to the nth), the team x must have certain properties relative to the teams that it faces in that round.\n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), x's opponent is another team. To win, x must be either higher or lower than that opponent, depending on the rule. Then, in the second round (phase 2), x's opponent is the winner of another match from phase 1. For x to beat that opponent, x must be higher or lower than that opponent, depending on phase 2's rule. And so on.\n\nBut how can we model the required constraints for x?\n\nLet me think of it as building a set of constraints on x. For each round i, x must be able to beat the opponent in that round, which depends on the rule of that round. However, the opponent in round i is determined by the previous rounds.\n\nBut perhaps we can model for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have, considering the rules up to that round.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match. For x to be the champion, it must be present in the leaves, and then win all matches along the path to the root.\n\nThe key is that for each match along the path, the rule of that phase determines how x must compare to the opponent in that match. However, the opponents are not known in advance, but we can arrange the permutation p to ensure that x can beat all of them.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother way to think: For x to be the champion, in each of the n rounds (phases), the team x must be the winner of that round's match. Let's consider the rounds in reverse order. For example, in the last round (phase n), there is only one match. The two teams that reach this round must be the ones that won all previous rounds. The rule for phase n is s[n-1]. So, for x to be the champion, in the final match, x must beat the other team according to the rule. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can make sure that the other team is either weaker or stronger than x, depending on the rule.\n\nBut how to model this for all rounds?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each round i (starting from 1 to n), during that phase, the rule is s[i-1]. For x to proceed to the next round, in that phase's match, x must be the winner. So, during phase i, the opponent must be such that x beats them according to the rule.\n\nBut to model this, perhaps we can determine for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have in order to proceed through that round. However, since the opponents are determined by the bracket, and we can arrange the other teams' skills, maybe we can find for each round i, the constraints on x.\n\nLet me think about the first round. Suppose the rule for phase 1 is '1' (higher skill wins). Then, in order for x to win, the opponent must have a skill less than x. So, in the first round, x must be higher than the opponent. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponent's skill to be anything less than x. However, in the next rounds, the opponent will be the winner of another match. So, for example, in phase 2, the rule is s[1], and the opponent must be beaten by x according to that rule.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe for each round, we can track the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have to proceed through that round.\n\nLet me try to think recursively. Let's define for each round i (from 1 to n), the minimal and maximal value that x must have in order to be able to reach the final and win. For example, in the first round (i=1), if the rule is '1', then x must be higher than its opponent. But since the opponent can be any team with lower skill, we can arrange that. However, in the next round (i=2), the opponent is the winner of another match. So, for x to beat that opponent, depending on the rule of phase 2, x must be higher or lower than that opponent.\n\nBut how to model the opponent's possible skill levels?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here. For example, during phase i, the rule is s[i-1], and the team x must have a certain relation to the opponent in that phase. Let's imagine that in phase i, the opponent is the best (or worst) possible team that x could face, based on the rules of the previous phases.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from some competitive programming problems. For each round, the required condition for x is that it is the \"winner\" in that round. So, for each round i, the team x must be able to beat the opponent, which depends on the rule of that round. However, the opponent's strength depends on the previous rounds. \n\nTo model this, perhaps we can compute for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have in order to survive up to that round. Let me think of it as follows:\n\nLet's start from the last round and work backwards. For example, in the final round (phase n), there are two teams. One is x, and the other is some team y. According to the rule of phase n (s[n-1]), x must beat y. So, if s[n-1] is 1, x must be higher than y. If it's 0, x must be lower than y. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose y to be either lower or higher than x, as needed. However, for x to reach the final round, it must have survived all previous rounds.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for the previous rounds?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that during phase i (from the bottom up), x needs to be able to win against an opponent in that phase. The opponent in phase i is the winner of a subtree. So, for example, during phase i, the opponent comes from a different part of the bracket, and has passed through the same rules as x up to that point.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that, for x to survive up to phase i, it must have a certain strength relative to the number of teams that could have possibly reached that phase.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as requiring x to be the strongest in certain parts of the bracket, or weakest, depending on the rules of the phases.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n101\n\nSample Output: 4 5 6 7\n\nSo n=3, s = \"101\". The string is of length 3. Let's break down the phases:\n\nPhase 1 (first round): rule is '1' (higher skill wins)\nPhase 2 (second round): rule is '0' (lower skill wins)\nPhase 3 (third round, final): rule is '1' (higher skill wins)\n\nSo for x to be the champion, it must:\n\n- Win in phase 1 (higher skill)\n- Win in phase 2 (lower skill)\n- Win in phase 3 (higher skill)\n\nHow can this happen?\n\nLet me think about the path x must take. In phase 1, x must be higher than its opponent. Then, in phase 2, x must be lower than its opponent. Wait, but that seems contradictory. How can x be lower than the opponent in phase 2, but then in phase 3, x must be higher than the opponent?\n\nWait, but in phase 2, the opponent is the winner of another match from phase 1. So, during phase 2, x is facing that opponent. Let's think of the scenario where x is in the first half of the bracket. Let's say x is in the left half. Then, during phase 1, x beats its opponent (higher skill). Then, in phase 2, x is facing the winner of the right half of the first phase. For x to win phase 2, which has rule 0 (lower skill wins), x must have lower skill than that opponent. But that opponent was the winner of phase 1 (higher skill), so that opponent must have higher skill than their own opponent in phase 1. But how can x have lower skill than that opponent, but still have higher skill than their own opponent in phase 1?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose x is 4. In phase 1, x must beat its opponent. Let's say x's opponent is 3. Since phase 1 rule is higher skill wins, x (4) beats 3. Then, in phase 2, x faces the winner of another match. Let's say that winner has skill 5. Phase 2 rule is lower skill wins, so x (4) must have lower skill than 5. That's true. Then, in phase 3, x (4) faces the winner of the other half of the bracket. Let's say that winner is 6. Phase 3 rule is higher skill wins. x (4) must be higher than 6? No, that's not possible. Wait, but in that case, x would lose. So how can x win?\n\nAh, here's the problem. In phase 3, the rule is higher skill wins. So x must be higher than the opponent. But in the previous step, x was lower than the opponent in phase 2. How can that be possible?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose during phase 2, x is facing an opponent y. The rule is lower skill wins. So x must be lower than y. So y has higher skill than x. Then, during phase 3, x must face another team z, and according to the rule (higher skill wins), x must be higher than z. But how can x be higher than z if during phase 2, x was lower than y (which was higher than x)?\n\nWell, z is the winner of the other half of the bracket. So during phase 1, z must have beaten their opponent. Then during phase 2, they beat their opponent (which is x's opponent in phase 2). Let's think of the scenario:\n\nPhase 1: x (4) beats opponent (3). Another match in phase 1: 5 beats 6 (since phase 1 rule is higher skill wins). Then in phase 2, x (4) faces 5. Since phase 2 rule is lower skill wins, x (4) is lower than 5, so x wins. Then in phase 3, x (4) faces the winner of the other bracket. Suppose that other bracket's winner is 7. Then during phase 3, rule is higher skill wins. x (4) must be higher than 7? No. So x would lose. So this scenario doesn't work.\n\nBut how can x win in phase 3? Let's think. For x to win in phase 3, the opponent must be someone with lower skill than x. So during phase 3, x must be higher than the opponent. So, in the other half of the bracket, the winner must be someone with lower skill than x. How can that happen?\n\nLet me try to construct a scenario where x=4 can be champion.\n\nLet's think of the entire bracket:\n\nPhase 1 (rule 1: higher wins):\n\nGroup A: x (4) vs a (some team with lower skill than 4, say 1).\n\nGroup B: b (say 5) vs c (some team with lower skill than 5, say 2).\n\nGroup C: d (say 6) vs e (some team with lower skill than 6, say 3).\n\nGroup D: f (say 7) vs g (some team with lower skill than 7, say 8? Wait, but n=3, 2^3=8 teams. So the teams are numbered 1-8.)\n\nWait, in the first phase, there are 4 matches. Let me think of the initial bracket as follows:\n\nMatch 1: Team 1 vs Team 2 → winner is higher (phase 1 rule 1).\n\nMatch 2: Team 3 vs Team 4 → winner is higher.\n\nMatch 3: Team 5 vs Team 6 → winner is higher.\n\nMatch 4: Team 7 vs Team 8 → winner is higher.\n\nThen, phase 2 (rule 0: lower wins):\n\nMatch 5: winner of match 1 vs winner of match 2 → lower wins.\n\nMatch 6: winner of match 3 vs winner of match 4 → lower wins.\n\nPhase 3 (rule 1: higher wins):\n\nMatch 7: winner of match 5 vs winner of match 6 → higher wins.\n\nNow, suppose that x is the team that is in Team 1's position. Let's assign the skills such that Team 1 has skill 4. Let's see.\n\nPhase 1: Team 1 (4) vs Team 2 (must be lower than 4). Let's say Team 2 has 1. So Team 1 wins.\n\nTeam 3 vs Team 4: suppose Team 3 has 5, Team 4 has 2. Then Team 3 wins (higher).\n\nTeam 5 vs Team 6: Team 5 has 6, Team 6 has 3 → Team 5 wins.\n\nTeam 7 vs Team 8: Team 7 has 7, Team 8 has 8 → Team 8 wins (higher). Wait no, because phase 1 rule is higher wins. So Team 8 has higher skill (8) than 7, so Team 8 wins.\n\nPhase 2:\n\nMatch 5: Team 1 (4) vs Team 3 (5). Rule is lower wins. So 4 < 5 → Team 1 (x) wins.\n\nMatch 6: Team 5 (6) vs Team 8 (8). Rule is lower wins. 6 < 8 → Team 5 wins.\n\nPhase 3: Match 7: Team 1 (4) vs Team 5 (6). Rule is higher wins. 4 < 6 → Team 5 wins. So x (4) loses. Not good.\n\nHmm. How to make x win phase 3? We need Team 5 to have lower skill than x (4). But in phase 2, Team 5 is the winner of match 6, which is between Team 5 and Team 8. So during phase 2, the rule is lower wins. So Team 5 must have lower skill than Team 8. So Team 5's skill is less than Team 8's. But Team 5's skill must be higher than their own opponent in phase 1 (which is Team 6). So Team 5's skill must be higher than Team 6's. But Team 6's skill is something we can choose.\n\nSo let's try to adjust this. Let's have Team 5's skill be 3, Team 6's skill be 2. Then in phase 1, Team 5 (3) beats Team 6 (2) (higher skill wins). Then in phase 2, Team 5 (3) faces Team 8 (say 8). Rule is lower wins. So Team 5 (3) is lower than 8, so Team 5 wins. Now, in phase 3, Team 1 (4) faces Team 5 (3). Rule is higher wins. 4 > 3 → Team 1 (x) wins. So x (4) becomes champion.\n\nYes! So this works. So in this case, x=4 can be a winning integer.\n\nSo how did this happen? The key was that during phase 2, the opponent of x (Team 3) had higher skill than x, and during phase 3, the opponent (Team 5) had lower skill than x.\n\nSo the constraints for x are that in each phase, the opponent must be either higher or lower than x, depending on the phase's rule. But how to model these constraints for any x?\n\nIt seems that for each phase i, the x must be either the minimum or maximum in some subset of teams, depending on the rules of the phases.\n\nPerhaps the way to model this is to compute for each x, the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have to satisfy all the constraints of the phases.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's think of the required conditions for x to pass through each round.\n\nIn the first round (phase 1), x must be either the maximum or the minimum in its group of two, depending on the rule. For example, if the rule is 1, then x must be the maximum in its initial pair. If the rule is 0, then x must be the minimum.\n\nIn the second round (phase 2), x is in a group of two winners from the first round. To win this round, x must be the minimum or maximum in this group of two, depending on the rule of phase 2.\n\nBut how to model this for all rounds?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each round, x must be the minimum or maximum in a certain subset of teams, depending on the rules of the rounds. However, the subsets depend on the previous rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation p, perhaps we can model for each round i, the number of teams that x must be the minimum or maximum of, and thus derive constraints on x's value.\n\nFor example, in the first round, if the rule is 1, x must be the maximum in its pair. So, there is one other team in the pair that must have a lower value than x. For the second round, if the rule is 0, x must be the minimum in its pair of two teams. So, the other team in that pair must have a higher value than x. But that other team is the winner of another pair from the first round, which would have been the maximum (if rule was 1) or minimum (if rule was 0) of their respective pairs.\n\nThis seems recursive. So for each round i, the number of teams that x must be the min or max of depends on the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nThis suggests that for each round i, the number of teams that must be \"under\" x (either lower or higher) depends on the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: for each round i, the required condition is that x is the min or max in a group of size 2^{i} teams. Because each round halves the number of teams, and after i rounds, there are 2^{n-i} teams left. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first round (phase 1), there are 2^{n} teams. After the first round, 2^{n-1} remain. In the second round (phase 2), there are 2^{n-1} teams, after which 2^{n-2} remain. So, during phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i + 1} }, and after phase i, it's 2^{n - i}.\n\nBut during phase i, the matches are between groups of two teams, which are the winners from the previous rounds. So for x to win phase i, it must be the min or max in a group of two teams. However, the other team in that group is the winner of another group from the previous rounds. Therefore, the other team has passed through the previous rounds' rules.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can model for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible number of teams that x must be greater than or less than.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round i, the required condition is that x is either the minimum or maximum of the group it belongs to in that round. The group size is 2 in each round. However, the other team in the group is the winner of another group from the previous rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other teams' values to satisfy the constraints. Thus, for x to be able to pass through all rounds, it must satisfy that, for each round i, there exists a certain number of teams that are either all less than or all greater than x, depending on the rules.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the idea of ranges. For each round i, depending on the rule, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to pass through that round. For example:\n\nLet’s define for each round i, a lower bound L_i and an upper bound U_i for x. Initially, for the first round, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its opponent. So, there must be at least one team with lower value than x. But since we can arrange the permutation, this is always possible unless x is 1. Wait, but x can be any value except 1. However, this depends on the other rounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each round i, the required condition is that x must be the minimum or maximum in a certain number of teams. For example, in the first round, if the rule is 1, x must be the maximum in a group of two. In the second round, if the rule is 0, x must be the minimum in a group of two. In the third round, if the rule is 1, x must be the maximum in a group of two. \n\nBut for each of these steps, the group of two teams must be such that the other team has passed through the previous rounds' rules.\n\nBut how to model this for all rounds?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each round i, the required condition for x is that it is either the minimum or maximum in a certain number of teams. Let's think of it as follows:\n\n- For each round i, starting from 1 to n, we have a direction (min or max) based on the rule s[i-1].\n\n- For x to survive round i, it must be the direction (min or max) in a group of size 2^{i} teams. Wait, why?\n\nBecause in each round, the number of teams that x must \"dominate\" (either be higher or lower than) increases exponentially. For example, in the first round, x must be the max of 2 teams. In the second round, it must be the min of 2 teams, which were themselves the max of 2 teams each. So for x to be the min of two teams in round 2, those two teams must be the max of their respective groups of two from round 1. Hence, x must be smaller than both of them, which implies that x must be smaller than 2 teams that are each larger than their own opponents. Thus, x must be smaller than 2 teams, which in turn are each larger than their own opponents. This suggests that x must be smaller than 2 * 1 = 2 teams (but I'm not sure about this).\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x. For example:\n\nIf in round i, the rule is to be the maximum, then x must be greater than the other team in that round's match. That other team, in turn, must have been the maximum or minimum of their previous rounds. Depending on the rules, this creates a chain of dependencies.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using the concept of \"required\" ranges. For example, for each round i, depending on the direction (min or max), we can calculate how many teams must be either less than or greater than x. Then, x must be within a certain range based on the number of teams that must be less than or greater than it.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's think of the tournament as a sequence of n rounds. For each round i, we can determine whether x must be the minimum or maximum in that round's match. For that to happen, x must be in a certain position relative to other teams.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that after processing the first i rounds, x must be the minimum of a certain number of teams, or the maximum. Let's define two variables for each round i:\n\n- low[i]: the minimal number of teams that must be less than x to satisfy the rules up to round i.\n\n- high[i]: the maximal number of teams that must be greater than x to satisfy the rules up to round i.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each round i, the number of teams that x must be greater than (or less than) depends on the rules up to that round. For example, if in round i, the rule requires x to be the maximum, then x must be greater than one team. But that team itself may have been the maximum or minimum of their previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round i, the required number of teams that x must be greater than (or less than) is 2^{i-1}.\n\nWait, for example, in the first round (i=1), if the rule is 'max', then x must be greater than 1 team. In the second round (i=2), if the rule is 'min', then x must be less than 1 team. But that team must have been the max of their own first round. So, that team must be greater than 1 team. Hence, x must be less than a team that is greater than 1 team. So, x must be less than a team that is greater than 1 team, which means that x must be less than 1 + 1 = 2 teams? Or something like that.\n\nThis seems to suggest that for each round, the number of teams that x must be greater than or less than is doubling each time, depending on the direction of the rule.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern. Suppose that for each round i, we have a direction (min or max) based on the rule. Then, the number of teams that x must be compared to in a certain way is 2^{i-1}.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Round 1: direction is max → x must be greater than 1 team.\n\n- Round 2: direction is min → x must be less than 1 team. But that team is the max of their own round 1 group. Which means that team must be greater than 1 team. So, in total, x must be less than a team that is greater than 1 team. Thus, x must be less than 1 team, but that team is greater than 1 team. So, x must be less than 1 team, and that team is greater than 1 team. So, in terms of x's required relations, x must be less than 1 team, and there are 1 team that is greater than x, and that team is greater than 1 team. So overall, x must be less than 1 team, and there are 1+1=2 teams that are greater than x? Or not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: For x to survive all rounds, it must have a certain number of teams that are either strictly less than or strictly greater than it. The number of such teams depends on the directions of the rules in each round.\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each round i, if the rule",

The tournament structure is such that teams are paired in each phase, and the winner of each match advances to the next phase based on the specified rule (either higher or lower skill level wins).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is a single-elimination bracket with $2^n$ teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one champion remains.\n2. **Rules per Phase**: Each phase has a specific rule (higher or lower skill level wins). These rules are provided as a string `s`.\n3. **Constraints on Winning Skill Levels**: For a team with skill level $x$ to be the champion, it must win all matches according to the rules of each phase. This means, depending on the phase's rule, $x$ must be either the minimum or maximum in its respective group of teams through each phase.\n\n### Key Insights\n- **Minimum and Maximum Requirements**: For each phase, depending on the rule, we track how many teams must be either less than or greater than $x$.\n- **Recursive Calculation**: We use a recursive approach to calculate the minimum and maximum values that $x$ must satisfy to win all phases.
