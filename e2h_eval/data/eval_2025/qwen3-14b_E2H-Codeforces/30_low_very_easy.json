Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. The output should be the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves this maximum sum. \n\nHmm, the key here is to find the optimal way for them to pick digits so that their combined total is maximized. Since each move takes the leftmost digit, the order in which they take digits affects their numbers. \n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the number A has 2n digits, and each player takes exactly n digits. The problem is to decide for each step whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit. But since the choice affects future steps, we need to consider all possibilities. However, with n up to 18, the total number of steps is 36. For a brute force approach, considering all possible combinations would be O(2^36), which is way too big. That's impossible for n=18. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a greedy strategy here. Let's think: when it's Homer's turn, he should take the largest possible digit available, but then again, if he takes a digit now, it might affect the choices later. Similarly for Marge. But since the total sum depends on both players' digits, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose at each step the option (H or M) that gives the maximum possible sum for the remaining digits. But how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a dynamic programming problem. The state would be the current position in the string (how many digits have been taken so far) and the count of H and M moves taken so far. But since each player must take exactly n moves, the state can be represented by how many H and M moves have been made. Let's think:\n\nAt any point, the number of digits taken is k (from 0 to 2n). The number of H moves taken is h, and the number of M moves is m. Since each move takes one digit, k = h + m. Also, since the total number of moves is 2n, and each player must take exactly n moves, the state can be represented by (h, m), but since m = k - h, maybe we can just track h and the current position. Wait, the current position is determined by how many digits have been taken. For example, after taking k digits, the next digit is at position k in the original string. So, the state is (k, h), because m = k - h, and since h can't exceed n, and m can't exceed n. \n\nSo the DP state can be represented by (current position, number of H moves taken so far). For each state, we can decide whether the next move is H or M, provided that the counts don't exceed n. \n\nThe DP transition would be: for each state (k, h), we can choose to take H if h < n, or take M if (k - h) < n. Then, for each choice, we calculate the value of the current digit (if it's taken by H or M) and add it to the total. However, since the digits are part of the numbers S1 and S2, their contribution to the total sum depends on their position in the number. \n\nWait, wait! Oh right. Because each time a player takes a digit, it's added to their number. For example, if Homer takes a digit first, that's the first digit of his number. Then, when he takes another digit, that's the second digit, etc. So the digits are added in the order they are taken. Therefore, the value of a digit depends on its position in the number. For example, the first digit taken by Homer contributes 10^{n-1} * digit, the second contributes 10^{n-2} * digit, and so on. Similarly for Marge. \n\nBut calculating the exact value of the digits for the total sum would be complicated. However, the problem requires that the total sum S1 + S2 is maximized. So, for each digit that is chosen, the contribution to the sum depends on which player takes it and the position in their respective numbers. \n\nThis complicates things. For example, when choosing between H or M for the next move, we need to consider not just the digit's value, but also how much it contributes to the total sum based on where it's placed in their numbers. \n\nBut how can we model this in a dynamic programming approach? Because for each state, the positions in the players' numbers depend on how many times they've already taken digits. \n\nLet's think. Suppose we have a state where Homer has taken",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The key insight is to use dynamic programming to explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently, considering the constraints on the number of moves each player can make.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a memoization-based approach to explore all possible sequences of moves. The state in our DP function is defined by the current position in the string and the count of moves made by Homer so far.\n2. **Greedy Strategy with Lookahead**: At each step, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively determine the optimal result from that point forward. This ensures that we always choose the move that leads to the maximum total prize.\n3. **Memoization Cache**: We use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h_count):\n        # pos is the current index in A (number of digits taken so far)\n        # h_count is the number of H moves taken so far\n        m_count = pos - h_count\n        if pos == length:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        \n        # Determine possible choices\n        choices = []\n        if h_count < n:\n            # Homer takes the next digit\n            digit = int(A[pos])\n            # The contribution of this digit to the total sum\n            # depends on its position in Homer's number\n            # which is (h_count)th position (0-based), so value is digit * 10^(n - 1 - h_count)\n            contribution = digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h_count))\n            next_pos = pos + 1\n            next_h = h_count + 1\n            res, path = dp(next_pos, next_h)\n            total = contribution + res\n            choices.append((total, 'H' + path))\n        if m_count < n:\n            # Marge takes the next digit\n            digit = int(A[pos])\n            contribution = digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m_count))\n            next_pos = pos + 1\n            next_h = h_count\n            res, path = dp(next_pos, next_h)\n            total = contribution + res\n            choices.append((total, 'M' + path))\n        \n        # Choose the option with maximum total, preferring 'H' if tie\n        max_total = -1\n        best_path = \"\"\n        for total, path in choices:\n            if total > max_total or (total == max_total and path < best_path):\n                max_total = total\n                best_path = path\n        return (max_total, best_path)\n    \n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Function (dp)**: The function `dp(pos, h_count)` computes the maximum total prize starting from the current position `pos` with `h_count` moves made by Homer so far. It returns the maximum total prize and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n- **Memoization**: Using `functools.lru_cache`, we memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.\n- **Contribution Calculation**: For each digit taken by Homer or Marge, we calculate its contribution to the total prize based on its position in their respective numbers. This contribution is determined by the digit's place value (i.e., powers of 10).\n- **Choice Selection**: At each step, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge) and select the one that leads to the maximum total prize, breaking ties by preferring 'H' if necessary.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible sequences of moves while maximizing the total prize using dynamic programming and memoization.",
