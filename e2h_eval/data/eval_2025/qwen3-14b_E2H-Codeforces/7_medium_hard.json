The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine whether a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nThe snowflake is built in a certain way. Starting with one vertex. Then, each time we add new vertices by connecting each leaf (vertex with only one connection) to k new vertices. And this process must be done at least once. Also, k must be greater than 1.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's try to model the construction steps.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that the snowflake is built in layers. The initial step is layer 0: just one node. Then, layer 1: connect the initial node to k nodes. So total nodes now is 1 + k. Then, for each subsequent layer, each leaf node (which are the nodes added in the previous step) get connected to k new nodes. \n\nWait, but the problem says that each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step should be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, the next step is taking all the leaves (those k nodes) and adding k new nodes to each. Then, perhaps another step, etc. But the process must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two steps: initial step (adding k nodes to the root), then adding k nodes to each of those k leaves. So total nodes would be 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k². For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? But the example given says that the minimal for k=4 is 6? Wait, maybe I misunderstood the steps.\n\nWait, looking at the example input. For example, in the sample input, when n=6, the output is NO. But for n=13, it's YES. Let me check the example given. Let me see the sample input:\n\nSample Input includes 6, which outputs NO. Then 13 outputs YES. Let's think about what possible n values are allowed.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\nInitially, one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (so those k new vertices) are connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process of adding layers must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. Let's see:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then add k nodes connected to the root. Now, each of these k nodes is a leaf. Then, we perform the step once: connect each of these leaves to k new nodes. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nOriginal root (1) + first layer (k) + second layer (k * k). So total is 1 + k + k². But for this to be valid, the step of adding the second layer must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when k is 2, and the total nodes is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. But according to the sample input, n=6 gives NO. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then, what about other possibilities? For example, maybe the snowflake can have multiple steps. Like, after the initial step, you can add multiple layers. For example, after the initial step (1 + k), then adding a layer (each leaf gets k children), then another layer (each leaf of that layer gets k children), etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many layers are added. Let's model this.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as having m layers. The initial node is layer 0. Then, layer 1 is the first set of nodes connected to the root. Then layer 2 is the nodes connected to layer 1 nodes, and so on.\n\nBut the process requires that the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done at least once. So the minimum number of layers is 2. Because the initial step is adding layer 1 (the first step), and then the step of adding layer 2 (the second step) is required once.\n\nSo the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach time we add a new layer. Let's think:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root).\n\nLayer 1: k nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k.\n\nThen, each of the k nodes in layer 1 is a leaf. We add k new nodes to each of them. So layer 2 has k * k nodes. Total nodes: 1 +k +k².\n\nThen, if we add another layer, each of the nodes in layer 2 (which are leaves) get k new nodes. So layer 3 has k³ nodes. Total nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two layers (layer 1 and layer 2). So the minimal number of nodes is 1 +k +k². However, for some cases, maybe the snowflake can have more layers. For example, if we have layers up to m, then the total nodes would be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (layer 1) and then the step is done once (adding layer 2). So m is the number of layers after the initial step. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is adding layer 1 (k nodes). Then, the first step (must be done at least once) adds layer 2 (k² nodes). Then, if we do another step, we add layer 3 (k³ nodes), etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k * (1 + k + k² + ... + k^{m-1} } ), where m is the number of steps taken after the initial step. Wait, maybe not. Let me rephrase.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows:\n\nThe initial step is adding layer 1 (k nodes). Then, for each step, we take all current leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous step) and add k new nodes to each. So each step adds a new layer. The number of steps (after the initial step) must be at least 1. So for example:\n\nIf there's one step after the initial step (so total two layers), the total nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nIf there are two steps after the initial step (so three layers), then the total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of the sum. The initial node is 1. Then, the first layer is k nodes. Then, each step adds k times the previous layer's count. So the sum is:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers after the initial step. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe first layer is k nodes (layer 1). Then, each step adds a new layer. The second layer is k^2 nodes. The third layer is k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the initial step (adding layer 1) is mandatory, and then the step of adding layer 2 is mandatory once. So m can be 1 (so layers 1 and 2?), or higher.\n\nWait, the sum for m layers would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But how does m relate to the steps?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n- The first step (mandatory) is adding layer 1 (k nodes). So that's the initial step. Then, the first expansion step (mandatory) adds layer 2 (k^2 nodes). Then, if we do another expansion step, we add layer 3 (k^3 nodes), etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d, where d is the number of layers. Since the expansion step must be done at least once, d must be at least 2. Because:\n\nd=1: 1 +k. But that would mean that the expansion step was not done. Because the expansion step is adding the next layer. So for d=2, the total is 1 +k +k². Which is the minimal case.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k² + ... + k^d, where d ≥ 2 (since the expansion step is done at least once). Wait, no. Wait, the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first layer. Then, the expansion step (adding k² nodes) is the second layer. So the total number of layers is d = 2, and the sum is 1 +k +k². So in general, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d, where d ≥ 2. Or perhaps the sum is 1 + k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m} ), where m is the number of expansion steps. Let me re-express.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as:\n\nWe have a root node. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step (required) adds the first layer (k nodes). Then, each subsequent expansion step adds a new layer. Wait, no. The initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, the first expansion step adds the second layer (k² nodes). Then, the second expansion step adds the third layer (k³ nodes), etc. So the number of expansion steps is m, which must be at least 1. Then the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m+1}? No, let's think again.\n\nOriginal node (1). Then, first expansion step: add k nodes. Now, the total is 1 +k. Then, second expansion step: add k *k nodes. Now total is 1 +k +k². Third expansion step: add k³ nodes. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. But since the expansion steps must be done at least once, m ≥ 1. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 1. But sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Wait, no: sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=1, sum is 1 +k, which is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = (k-1)(k+1)/(k-1) )=k+1. Correct.\n\nBut in this case, the expansion steps are m steps. Wait, but the initial step (adding the first layer) is part of the expansion steps? Or is the initial step separate?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the initial step (adding the k nodes) is part of the process. Then, the step of adding more nodes (the expansion step) must be done at least once. So the initial step is mandatory. Then, the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nInitial step (1 +k) + expansion steps (each step adds k * previous layer's size). So for example, if the expansion steps are done once, then the total is 1 +k +k². If done twice, 1 +k +k² +k³, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1? Let me think again. For m being the number of layers. Let's take the expansion steps as being done t times, where t ≥1. So the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. So for t expansion steps, the total layers are 1 (initial) + t. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t+1}? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then, first step (adding k nodes): total nodes is 1 +k. Then, first expansion step (t=1): add k² nodes. Total is 1 +k +k². Then, second expansion step (t=2): add k³ nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³. So for t expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t+1}? No, because when t=1 expansion steps, the exponents go up to 2. So the sum is 1 +k +k². Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So the exponent is t+1. So the sum is (k^{t+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nNo, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So in this case, for t expansion steps, the sum is from i=0 to (t+1) ?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes (so the sum is 1 +k). Then, each expansion step adds another layer. So for t expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t+1}? Because:\n\nt=0: no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So t ≥1.\n\nSo for t ≥1, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i - k^0 ? No. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. So the initial sum is 1 +k. Then, each expansion step adds a new term. For example:\n\nt=1: expansion steps once. Sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nt=2: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the sum is 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^t) ?\n\nBecause the initial step is 1 +k, then for t expansion steps, adding k², k³, ..., k^{t+1}? Wait, no. Let me think of t as the number of expansion steps. Each expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step adds k² nodes (since each of the k leaves in the first layer gets k new nodes). The second expansion step adds k³ nodes (each of the k² leaves in the second layer gets k new nodes). So for t expansion steps, the total nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t+1} ?\n\nYes. So the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t+1} = sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i. But since t ≥1, the exponent goes up to t+1 ≥ 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether there exists integers k >1 and t ≥1 such that n equals sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i. Alternatively, since sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for our case, m = t+1, and since t ≥1, m ≥ 2. Therefore, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for our case, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is t+1. Wait, no. Let me recheck. For example, when m=2, sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Which is correct. So yes. So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m is the maximum exponent. So in our case, m = t+1, and the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nNo. Wait, m is the maximum exponent. So for example, when the sum is up to exponent m, then sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So in our case, the sum is up to exponent m, where m = t+1. So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nNo. Wait, m is the maximum exponent. For example, sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for our case, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the maximum exponent. So in our problem, the maximum exponent is m = t+1. So the sum is (k^{(t+1)+1} -1)/(k-1) = (k^{t+2} -1)/(k-1). But this seems conflicting with earlier examples. Let me take m=2 (sum 1 +k +k²). Then, the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². Correct. So yes.\n\nBut in our case, the sum is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the maximum exponent. But m is the number of terms minus one. For example, in the sum 1 +k +k², there are 3 terms, m=2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem? The problem says that for a given n, we need to check if there exists k>1 and m≥2 (since m is the maximum exponent, which is t+1, and t≥1 implies m ≥ 2) such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m is the maximum exponent. Wait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe sum is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for our case, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m ≥ 2 (since m = t+1, and t ≥1 implies m ≥2). So the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in the form (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m≥2.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, when m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. Which is the case where we have two expansion steps? Or wait, earlier analysis said that for t=1 expansion steps (the minimal case), the sum is 1 +k +k². Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. So m is 2, and the formula is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m+1 is 3. So m is 2, which is the maximum exponent. So in this case, the formula is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = sum_{i=0}^m k^i.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for a given n, check if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, this is equivalent to checking whether n can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with ratio k, starting from 1, with m+1 terms. And m+1 ≥ 3 (since m ≥2). Because m is the maximum exponent, which is t+1, and t≥1 implies m≥2, so m+1 ≥3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the formula as (k^{s} -1)/(k-1), where s is the number of terms. For example, if s=3 terms (1, k, k²), then the sum is (k^3-1)/(k-1). So for our problem, the number of terms is s ≥3 (since m+1 ≥3). So the problem is to check if n can be written as (k^s -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and s≥3.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form.\n\nNow, the question is how to check this for given n.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4. So we need an efficient algorithm for each test case.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists integers k>1 and s≥3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{s-1}.\n\nSo for example, for s=3, this is 1 +k +k². For s=4, it's 1 +k +k² +k³, etc.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists any s ≥3 and k ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nBut how?\n\nOne approach is to iterate over possible s (number of terms), and for each s, check if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and s can be up to log_2(n) (since for s=3, k^s is at least 2^3=8, and the sum is at least 1+2+4=7, which is 7. For larger s, the sum increases rapidly. So for each n, the maximum possible s is log_2(n) + something. So for example, for s=3, the minimal sum is 7 (k=2). For s=3, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k +k² ≤n. So k can be up to sqrt(n). Similarly for other s.\n\nBut for each test case, trying all possible s up to log_2(n) may be feasible.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each n, check for all possible s ≥3, and for each s, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} =n.\n\nBut how to check for each s?\n\nLet me consider for fixed s, solving for k.\n\nThe equation is:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i = n → (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nThis is equivalent to k^s -1 =n(k-1) → k^s -n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for integer k is difficult for arbitrary s. However, for fixed s, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nFor example, for a given s, the minimal possible k is 2, and the maximal possible k can be found based on the fact that the sum is increasing with k.\n\nFor example, for s=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For given n, we can find k such that this equals n. Since the function is increasing with k, for each s, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nSo for each possible s, we can do a binary search on k between 2 and upper bound.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given s?\n\nThe sum is at least 1 + 2 + 2² + ... + 2^{s-1} = 2^s -1. So for n to be equal to this sum, 2^s -1 ≤n. So for a given s, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≤n. Since the sum is increasing with k, for each s, the maximum possible k is such that k^{s-1} ≤n. So for example, k_max can be up to n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can compute the upper bound as something like n^(1/(s-1)) +1.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: answer is NO (since the minimal is 7 for s=3, k=2).\n\n- Else, iterate over possible s from 3 up to log_2(n) +1 (since for s=3, the minimal sum is 7, and for larger s, the minimal sum is 1 + 2 + ... + 2^{s-1} = 2^s -1. So for s_max, we can compute up to the maximum s where 2^s -1 ≤n. For example, s_max can be up to 60, since 2^60 is around 1e18.)\n\nFor each s in 3 to s_max:\n\n   perform binary search on k in [2, ... , upper_bound] to see if there exists a k such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nIf for any s and k, this holds, return YES.\n\nElse, after checking all possible s, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute s_max?\n\ns_max can be found as the maximum s such that 2^s -1 ≤n. For example, for n=1e18, 2^60 is about 1.15e18, so s_max would be up to 60.\n\nThus, for each n, the number of s to check is up to 60, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the challenge is to perform the binary search for each s.\n\nBut how to compute (k^s -1)/(k-1) efficiently and accurately, without overflow?\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and k can be up to say 1e6 (for s=3, the maximum k is sqrt(n)), but even with s=3 and k up to 1e9, computing k^s could be problematic. However, since we're doing binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n.\n\nWait, for a given s and k, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nWe can compute this sum incrementally. For example, for s=3, sum is 1 +k +k². For each term, we can compute it step by step, and if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nThis avoids dealing with very large exponents directly, and also prevents integer overflow in Python (since Python can handle big integers, but for efficiency, it's better to avoid unnecessary computations).\n\nSo here's the plan for the binary search for a given s:\n\nlow = 2, high = some upper bound.\n\nCompute the upper bound for k. Since the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{s-1} =n. The sum is at least k^{s-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut for binary search, we can set high to be n^(1/(s-1)) + 1. However, calculating n^(1/(s-1)) can be done via binary search as well. Alternatively, for the upper bound, we can use something like 2e9, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, during binary search, we can start with high=2 and double until the sum exceeds n, then set high to that value. That way, we don't have to compute the exact upper bound.\n\nBut for the purposes of binary search, perhaps the following approach is better:\n\nFor a given s, perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper limit. The upper limit can be determined as follows: the sum for k is at least k^{s-1} (since sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1} for k ≥2). So k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(s-1)). So the upper limit can be set to n^(1/(s-1)) +1. However, calculating this in code can be done using integer exponents. But in Python, we can compute it as something like high = int(n ** (1/(s-1))) + 2.\n\nBut for large exponents, this may not be precise. So perhaps during the binary search, we can start with low=2 and high=2, and keep doubling high until the sum for that k is larger than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nSo for each s, the steps are:\n\nInitialize low = 2, high = 2.\n\nWhile the sum for k=high is less than n: double high.\n\nOnce high is such that the sum for k=high is larger than n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and s?\n\nWe can compute the sum as follows:\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to s-1:\n\n    sum += k^i\n\nBut for large s (like 60), and large k, this could take O(s) time. However, since s is up to 60, and per test case, it's manageable.\n\nBut even better, we can compute the sum incrementally and break early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo for example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for s terms, the loop runs s times. For each term, current is k^i, where i ranges from 0 to s-1.\n\nYes. So for example, for s=3, the terms are 1, k, k².\n\nSo for a given k and s, compute the sum. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, return something larger than n.\n\nOnce we have this function, we can perform binary search for k.\n\nSo, for each s, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the minimal possible sum for s is possible. For example, the minimal sum is when k=2, sum is 2^s -1. If this is larger than n, then no need to check for this s.\n\nOtherwise, perform binary search on k.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n < 7: return NO (since the minimal sum for s=3 and k=2 is 7)\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n       if 2^s -1 >n: break (since for higher s, the minimal sum is even larger)\n\n       else:\n\n           perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to find if there's a k such that compute_sum(k, s) ==n.\n\n           if found, return YES.\n\n   after checking all s, return NO.\n\nBut how to find max_s?\n\nmax_s can be found as the maximum s where 2^s -1 <=n. Since 2^s grows exponentially, for n up to 1e18, the maximum s is about 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can loop s from 3 up to 60 (or until 2^s -1 exceeds n).\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor example, n=13.\n\nCheck possible s:\n\ns=3: minimal sum is 7, max sum for k=3 is 1+3+9=13. So yes. So for s=3, k=3, sum is 13. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 15. Let's see:\n\ns=3: 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k +1 =15 →k² +k -14=0 →k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +56)] / 2 → sqrt(57)=~7.5 → ( -1 +7.5)/2 ~3.25. So no integer solution. Try k=3: 1+3+9=13 <15. k=4: 1+4+16=21>15. So no solution for s=3. Try s=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =15. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes. So for s=4, k=2, sum is 15. So answer is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. Let's see:\n\nFor example, 255 = 2^8 -1 = 255. So for s=8, the sum is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So yes. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000. The output is NO. So for that n, there is no such k and s.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n is 1: output NO.\n\nelif n is 2,3, etc. up to 6: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n       min_sum = 2^s -1. If min_sum >n, break.\n\n       else:\n\n           perform binary search on k for this s.\n\n           if found, return YES.\n\n   after all s, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute max_s? Well, for each n, we can compute s up to log2(n+1). Since 2^s -1 ≤n → 2^s ≤n+1 → s ≤ log2(n+1). So in code, for each n, we can loop s from 3 up to 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18, which is the max n).\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor s in range(3, 61):\n\n   if 2^s -1 >n:\n\n       break\n\n   else:\n\n       perform binary search for k.\n\nBut how to compute 2^s? For s up to 60, 2^s can be computed as 1 << s, but for s=60, that's 1e18.\n\nBut in Python, exponentials can be handled with pow(2, s).\n\nNow, for each s, perform binary search for k.\n\nImplementing the binary search:\n\ndef check(n, s):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   # find upper bound for high\n\n   while compute_sum(high, s) < n:\n\n       high *=2\n\n   # Now binary search between low and high\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       sum_val = compute_sum(mid, s)\n\n       if sum_val ==n:\n\n           return True\n\n       elif sum_val <n:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   return False\n\nBut compute_sum needs to be implemented as a function that returns the sum for k and s, and returns something larger than n if it exceeds.\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total =0\n\n    current =1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return n+1  # something larger than n\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for very large k and s, this could be slow. However, since s is up to 60, and for each test case, this is manageable.\n\nBut for the code, we need to pass n into compute_sum. However, in the code, for each test case, we can pass n as a parameter.\n\nNow, let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nAnother thing to note is that for s=3, the equation is 1 +k +k² =n →k² +k +",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers starting from a single vertex, and each subsequent layer adds more vertices based on a parameter `k > 1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is built in layers where each layer adds vertices based on a geometric progression. The number of vertices for a snowflake with `s` layers (where `s >= 3`) and parameter `k` is given by the sum of a geometric series: $ \\frac{k^s - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible number of layers `s` (starting from 3 up to a maximum determined by the constraints), we check if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: For each possible number of layers `s`, use binary search to find a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. This involves checking values of `k` efficiently using binary search within a dynamically adjusted range.\n\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Directly handle small values of `n` which cannot form a valid snowflake graph due to insufficient vertices.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(s):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check(n, s):\n    low = 2\n    high = 2\n    # Find upper bound for high\n    while True:\n        val = compute_sum(high, s, n)\n        if val >= n:\n            break\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search between low and high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        val = compute_sum(mid, s, n)\n        if val == n:\n            return True\n        elif val < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n        for s in range(3, max_s + 1):\n            min_sum = (1 << s) - 1  # 2^s -1\n            if min_sum > n:\n                break\n            if check(n, s):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `s`, stopping early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n- **check**: This function uses binary search to determine if there exists a valid `k` for a given `s` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n- **solve**: Reads input, processes each test case, and checks for valid snowflake configurations using the above helper functions. It handles edge cases directly and iterates over possible layer counts `s` to check for valid configurations.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential values of `k` and `s` using binary search and geometric series properties, ensuring the solution works within the problem constraints.",
