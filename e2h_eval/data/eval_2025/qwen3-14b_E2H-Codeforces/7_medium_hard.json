The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is iterative. Let me think about the structure. Let's take an example. For k=4, the smallest snowflake would have:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then connect to 4, making total 5 nodes. Now, each of those 4 nodes is a leaf. Then, each of them is connected to 4 new nodes. So for each of the 4 leaves, adding 4 nodes. That would add 4*4 = 16 nodes. Total becomes 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But according to the example given, when n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. Let me think again. How can 13 be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the construction steps. Let's say the snowflake is built with some number of layers. Each layer adds more nodes.\n\nLet me think recursively. The snowflake starts with a root node. Then, each time, all the leaves (nodes with degree 1) get expanded by adding k children. The process must be done at least once. So the initial step is to create the root and connect it to k nodes. Then, each of those k nodes (which are leaves) must be connected to k new nodes. So the minimal case would be when we do this expansion once. Let's see:\n\nLet's model the number of nodes after each step.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as having m levels of expansion. The first level is the root connected to k nodes. Then, each of those nodes is connected to k nodes, and so on. However, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step (connecting the root to k nodes) is the first part, and then the second step (expanding each leaf once) is required. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this expansion once.\n\nSo let's model the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as being built with d layers. Let's say that the root is layer 0. Then, layer 1 consists of k nodes connected to the root. Then, each node in layer 1 is connected to k nodes in layer 2. And so on. However, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the snowflake must have at least two layers. Because the initial step (layer 1) is done, and then the expansion step (layer 2) is done once.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then, the step of expanding the leaves (those with only one connection) is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when after the initial step, we do the expansion once. So the total number of nodes would be:\n\nInitial node (1) + k (from first step) + k * k (from the expansion step). So total is 1 + k + k^2. But wait, in the example given, when n=13, the answer is YES. Let's see: 1 + k + k^2 =13. Let's solve for k: k^2 +k -12 =0. The roots are (-1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 = (-1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes, 1+3+9=13. So that's possible. Hence, the sample input for 13 is YES.\n\nAnother example from the sample input: n=6. Let's see if there's any k>1 such that 6 can be written as the sum of the nodes in the snowflake structure.\n\nBut what are the possibilities? Let's think about different numbers of expansion steps.\n\nThe snowflake can be built with different numbers of expansion steps. For example, perhaps after the initial step, we can do multiple expansions. So the number of nodes depends on how many times we expand.\n\nLet me think of the general formula. Suppose that the snowflake has m expansion steps. Let me think:\n\nThe initial step creates 1 node (the root). Then, the first expansion adds k nodes (so total 1 +k). Then, each expansion step adds k^d nodes, where d is the depth?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Let me model the number of nodes after each expansion step.\n\nLet me consider that each expansion step applies to all current leaves. Let me think of the process:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node (root)\n- Step 1: connect root to k nodes. Now, total nodes: 1 + k. The leaves are these k nodes.\n- Step 2: each of the k leaves is connected to k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Now, total nodes: 1 + k + k^2. Leaves are now the k^2 nodes added in step 2.\n- Step 3: each of those k^2 leaves is connected to k new nodes. Adding k^3 nodes. Total nodes: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Leaves are those k^3 nodes.\n- And so on.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the expansion step (step 2 and beyond) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have step 1 (initial) and step 2 (expansion once). Thus, the total number of nodes would be 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the snowflake can be built with more steps. For example, after step 1 (total 1 +k), then step 2 (add k^2), then step 3 (add k^3), etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥1 (since expansion steps must be done at least once).\n\nWait, but what is the definition of the expansion steps? The problem says:\n\nEach vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so after the initial step (the root connected to k nodes), the expansion step is done once. So during that expansion step, all leaves (the k nodes) are expanded. Then, perhaps, you can do more expansion steps. For example, after expanding once, the new leaves (the ones added in that step) can be expanded again, and so on. But the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the snowflake can have any number of expansion steps, as long as it's at least one.\n\nTherefore, the total number of nodes can be written as:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m, where m ≥1 and k ≥2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial step is the first addition of k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k^d nodes for each level. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} } ), where m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is 1 node. Then, the first expansion step (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, each subsequent expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. But each expansion step is applied to all the leaves. So, for example:\n\nAfter step 1 (the initial step), we have 1 node (root) connected to k nodes. These k nodes are leaves. Then, the first expansion step (required) adds k *k nodes. Now, the total is 1 +k +k^2. The leaves are the k^2 nodes added in this step. Then, if we perform another expansion step, each of those k^2 leaves gets k new nodes, adding k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥1 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Because m represents the number of expansion steps. Let me check:\n\nFor m=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2? No. Wait, initial step is 1 node. Then the first expansion step is adding k^1 nodes (the initial expansion step?), no. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root and connecting it to k nodes. That's step 0? Or step 1? Let me think again. The problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step is adding k nodes (step 1). Then, the expansion step (step 2) must be done at least once. So for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is:\n\n1 + k + k*(k) + k*(k)^2 + ... ?\n\nWait, the initial step (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. But each expansion step is applied to all the leaves. So after the initial step, the leaves are k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k *k nodes. Then, the next expansion step adds k *k^2 nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes is:\n\n1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... +k^{m} ?\n\nNo. Because for m expansion steps, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k^2, the second adds k^3, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m}, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, but m must be at least 1. Because the expansion steps must be done at least once. So for example, m=1 would give total nodes 1 +k +k^2? No. Wait:\n\nLet me think:\n\nOriginal node count is 1.\n\nAfter initial step (adding k nodes): total is 1 +k. This is after the first part (the initial step). Then, the expansion steps are done. For m expansion steps, each step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. So:\n\nFirst expansion step (m=1): the leaves are the k nodes from the initial step. Each is connected to k new nodes, adding k*k =k^2 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSecond expansion step (m=2): leaves are the k^2 nodes. Each is connected to k new nodes, adding k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, because m is the number of expansion steps. Let me rephrase:\n\nNumber of expansion steps: m ≥1.\n\nTotal nodes = 1 (root) + k (from initial step) + k^2 (from first expansion) + k^3 (from second expansion) + ... +k^{m} (from m-th expansion)?\n\nWait, no. Because the first expansion step adds k^2 nodes. The second adds k^3. So for m expansion steps, the sum would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} ?\n\nYes. Because the initial step is adding k (so 1 +k). Then, m expansion steps add k^2, k^3, ..., up to k^{m+1}? Or no?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, for each expansion step, the number of nodes added is k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. The initial step's leaves are k nodes. So first expansion step adds k *k =k^2. Then, the leaves are k^2 nodes. Next expansion adds k^3. So for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is:\n\n1 (root) + k (initial) + k^2 (expansion 1) + k^3 (expansion 2) + ... +k^{m} (expansion m-1?) Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nIf m is the number of expansion steps, then:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Let me take m=1 expansion steps. Then total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 +k*(k^0 +k^1 + ... +k^1) ? Not sure. Alternatively, the sum is 1 +k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} ) ?\n\nNo. Let me think again. The initial step adds k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves. The leaves after the initial step are k nodes. After expansion step 1, the leaves are k^2 nodes. After expansion step 2, they are k^3 nodes. So for m expansion steps, the total nodes is:\n\n1 +k +k^2 +k^3 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Because for m=1 expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 +k*(1 +k). So the sum is 1 +k*(1 +k + ... +k^m) ?\n\nWait, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo, for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes would be 1 +k*(sum_{i=0}^m k^i) ?\n\nWait, the initial step adds k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k * (number of leaves from previous step). The number of leaves after the initial step is k. Then, each expansion step adds k * (number of leaves) and the new leaves are k * previous leaves. So the expansion steps add k *k, then k *k^2, etc. So for m expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, for m=1 expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 +k*(1 +k). So that's 1 +k*(sum_{i=0}^1 k^i). For m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k*(sum_{i=0}^m k^i) ?\n\nYes. Because the initial step adds k nodes (which is k *k^0). Then, each expansion step adds k *k^i where i is the step number. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=0}^m k^{i+1} } = 1 +k * sum_{i=0}^m k^i.\n\nBut sum_{i=0}^m k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Therefore, the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k * [ (k^{m+1} -1) / (k-1) ) ].\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, because that would be sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. Which is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But that's not the same as the previous expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial node is 1. Then, each expansion step adds k^d, where d is the depth. For example:\n\n- After initial step (depth 1): 1 +k.\n- After one expansion step (depth 2): 1 +k +k^2.\n- After two expansion steps (depth 3): 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\nSo for m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo, that would be m+1 terms. Wait, for m expansion steps, the initial step is the first addition of k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds another term. So m expansion steps would add m terms. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nNo. Let's take m=1 expansion steps. Then the sum is 1 +k (initial step) +k^2 (expansion step). So total is 1 +k +k^2 = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the formula for n is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) - (k^0 -1)/(k-1) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d, where d is the number of layers. For example, the minimal case is d=2 (layers 0, 1, 2). Because the initial step adds layer 1 (k nodes), and the expansion step adds layer 2 (k^2 nodes). Then, if there are more expansion steps, we add higher layers.\n\nSo for a snowflake, the number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d, where d ≥ 2. Because the expansion steps must be done at least once, which requires that the snowflake has at least two layers (the initial step adds layer 1, and the expansion step adds layer 2). So d is the number of layers, and d ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but for d=2, S = 1 +k +k^2. For d=3, S = 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as S = sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2, and k ≥2. Because for d ≥2, sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). And since d ≥2, the sum is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, for example, when d=2, sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nSo the problem is to find if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that n equals (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the expansion steps are not done completely? For example, after the initial step (adding k nodes) and one expansion step (adding k^2 nodes), but then not doing further steps. That's allowed. So the snowflake can have any d ≥2.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for a given n, does there exist integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, for example, the sample input n=6. Let's check if it can be expressed in that form.\n\nLet me see:\n\nCheck possible k and d values.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nCheck d=2: (2^3 -1)/(2-1) = (8-1)/1 =7. Not 6.\n\nd=1? No, because d must be ≥2.\n\nk=3, d=2: (3^3-1)/2 = (27-1)/2 = 13. Which is the sample input for n=13. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about n=6? Let's see other possibilities.\n\nIs there a way to have n=6?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the snowflake can be built with different structures. For example, maybe the expansion steps are not done all the way. Like, maybe the snowflake is built with two layers, but not all leaves are expanded. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So once you expand once, you can't stop. Wait, no. The expansion step is done once. For example, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once (adding k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. But what if there's another way to build the snowflake? Like, maybe some leaves are expanded more than others? No, the problem says that each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected to k new vertices. So during each expansion step, all leaves are expanded. So the structure is a full tree, where each node in a certain level has exactly k children, except for the leaves.\n\nThus, the only way to construct a snowflake is as a full k-ary tree with depth d+1, where the depth is at least 2. Wait, no. Because the depth here is the number of layers. For example, the root is depth 0, then layer 1, then layer 2, etc. So for the snowflake with d layers (as per the previous notation), the depth is d.\n\nBut regardless, the formula for the number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2 and k ≥2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k≥2 and d≥2.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nConstraints: t is up to 1e4, and n can be up to 1e18. So we need an efficient algorithm.\n\nSo the approach would be for each n, check if there exists k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that the equation holds.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the equation:\n\nn = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d.\n\nNote that this is the same as the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWe need to find for given n, if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that this equation holds.\n\nBut for each possible k, we can compute for varying d whether the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, trying all possible k's is not feasible unless we find a way to limit the possible k's.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each possible d ≥2, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut for each d, what is the maximum possible value of d?\n\nFor example, for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. For k ≥2, the minimum value is 1+2+4=7. So for n <7, it's impossible.\n\nFor d=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. For k=2, sum is 15. So for n=15, possible.\n\nBut how to find all possible d's?\n\nThe maximum possible d for a given n is log_2(n). Because for k=2, the sum for d is 2^{d+1} -1. So for example, for n=1e18, the maximum d would be around 60 (since 2^60 is ~1e18).\n\nSo for each test case n, we can iterate d from 2 up to log_2(n) (which is up to 60), and for each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n:\n\n- Check if n is 1. Then answer is NO (since the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k^2, which is at least 1+2+4=7).\n\nWait, but for the sample input, n=1 is output NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut for each n:\n\nLoop over possible d from 2 up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, the sum increases exponentially with d).\n\nFor each d, compute the possible k such that 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d =n.\n\nBut how to find k for a given d?\n\nThe sum for given d and k is S = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). We need to find integer k ≥2 such that S =n.\n\nBut solving for k is challenging. However, since for fixed d, the function S(k) is strictly increasing in k, we can perform a binary search on k for each d.\n\nSo for each d, binary search k in [2, ... upper_bound], and check if S equals n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nFor a given d, the sum S(k) is 1 +k + ... +k^d. For k ≥2, this is ≥1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^d = 2^{d+1} -1.\n\nBut for S(k) to equal n, we have k^d ≤ S(k) ≤ n. So k ≤ n^(1/d). So for binary search, the upper bound can be n^(1/d) +1.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for each d, perform a binary search on k from 2 to some upper limit (like n^(1/d) +1). For each candidate k, compute S and compare to n.\n\nBut how to compute S for large exponents?\n\nBut for large d and k, even for d=60 and k=2, the sum could be up to 2^61-1, which is manageable as Python can handle big integers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is less than 7 (since the minimal possible sum for d=2 and k=2 is 1+2+4=7), return NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop d from 2 to max_d (where max_d can be up to 60, since for k=2, the sum for d=60 is 2^61 -1 which is about 2e18, which is larger than 1e18).\n\nFor each d:\n\n- Binary search for k in [2, ... upper] such that S(k) =n.\n\nIf found, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all d's, nothing is found, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute S(k) for given d and k?\n\nBut S(k) = (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1). However, when k=1, this formula is invalid. But since k ≥2, we can use it.\n\nBut calculating k^{d+1} can be expensive for very large exponents. However, since d is up to 60, and k can be up to n^(1/d) which for n=1e18 and d=60 is about 1e18^(1/60) which is about 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So for d=60, k can be up to 2. So the exponents are manageable.\n\nBut for each binary search step, we need to calculate S(k) and compare to n.\n\nBut for some cases, the sum might overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n is 1, output NO.\n\nElse, check for each possible d from 2 up to max_d (say 60):\n\n   For each d, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, for a given d, the sum S(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^d =n.\n\nSince each term is positive, k^d <= S(k) =n → k <= n^(1/d).\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be n^(1/d) +1. But how to compute that?\n\nIn Python, we can compute the integer part of n^(1/d) using something like int(n ** (1/d)) + 2, but need to be careful with floating point inaccuracies.\n\nAlternatively, during binary search, we can start with low=2, high= some value. For example, since for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^d = 2^{d+1} -1. So if n is less than that, then for this d, no solution. So for each d, we can check if the minimal sum (for k=2) is greater than n. If so, skip this d. Else, proceed.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k?\n\nLet me think. For a given d, the sum S(k) increases with k. So for a given d, we can find the minimal and maximal possible k.\n\nFor example, for d=2, S(k) =1 +k +k^2 =n → k^2 +k +1 =n → k^2 +k +1 -n =0 → solving for k gives k = [-1 + sqrt(4n -3)] / 2. So for each d, the possible k is in a certain range.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps it's easier to set low=2 and high= some upper limit, say, 2e6, but that's not feasible for large n.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, the upper bound for k can be n^(1/d) + 1. For example, for k^d ≤ n → k ≤ n^(1/d). So for binary search, high can be n^(1/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python?\n\nWe can compute it as high = int(n ** (1/d)) + 2.\n\nBut for exponents, we can use Newton-Raphson or binary search to find the integer part.\n\nAlternatively, for binary search, we can set the initial high to 2, and keep doubling until S(high) exceeds n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach avoids dealing with floating point inaccuracies.\n\nSo for each d:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_S(high, d) < n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce we have a high where compute_S(high, d) >=n, we can perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut compute_S(k, d) is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d.\n\nBut for large k and d, this can be expensive. However, since d is up to 60, and k is up to something like 1e18^(1/2) = 1e9 for d=2, but for each binary search step, the computation of the sum may be O(d) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for very large exponents, even O(d) steps may be manageable.\n\nBut let's think: for each binary search step, we need to compute the sum for k and d. Let's code that as a helper function.\n\nBut wait, the sum can be calculated as (k^(d+1) -1) // (k-1). However, when k=1, this formula is invalid. But since k ≥2, this is okay.\n\nSo for a given k and d, the sum is (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1).\n\nBut calculating k^{d+1} could be done via pow(k, d+1). However, for very large exponents, this might be slow. But given that d is up to 60, and k is up to say 1e9, even 1e9^60 is way beyond the limits of Python's handling, but since n is up to 1e18, the sum (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) must be equal to n. So for k and d where the sum is larger than n, we can stop early.\n\nWait, but for example, if we compute (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1), but for large exponents, this might be a very big number, but since we're comparing it to n (up to 1e18), perhaps we can compute this in a way that stops early if it exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, compute the sum incrementally and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking if the sum equals n, perhaps the incremental approach is better, as it can avoid computing very large numbers and detect overflow early.\n\nLet me think: For a given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d.\n\nWe can compute this as:\n\ns = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to d:\n\n    s += current_term\n\n    current_term *=k\n\nBut for k=2 and d=60, this would be 60 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, even for large exponents, this is manageable as long as the sum doesn't exceed n. However, if the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo for the helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut since we are comparing to n, which is known, this can be optimized.\n\nBut during binary search, for a given k and d, we need to compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nSo during the binary search steps, for a given k and d, compute the sum as described, and check if it equals n.\n\nSo the code for checking for each d would be:\n\nfor d in 2 to max_d:\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    # find upper bound for k\n\n    while compute_sum(high, d) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, d)\n\n        if s == n:\n\n            return YES\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\nBut what about when compute_sum returns infinity (because it exceeds n)? In that case, we treat it as larger than n.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code.\n\nSo the helper function returns either the actual sum or a value larger than n.\n\nBut in code, perhaps it's better to compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n, returning early.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible cases.\n\nLet me take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: n=13.\n\nCheck for d=2:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k^2 =13 → k^2 +k +1=13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=3. So for d=2, k=3, which is valid. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. Let's see:\n\nCheck for d=2: 1 +k +k^2 =6 →k^2 +k -5=0 → roots are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2 → approx 1.79. Not integer. So no solution. For d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Let's see for k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no solution. So overall, returns NO.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Let's see:\n\nPossible options:\n\nFor example, 255 = 2^8 -1. Which is 1 +2 + ... +2^7 = 2^8 -1 =255. So d=7, k=2. Since d ≥2, this is valid. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why.\n\nWe need to check if there exists k and d such that sum equals 1e18. For example, for k=2 and d=59, the sum would be 2^60 -1, which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975, which is larger than 1e18. For d=58, sum is 2^59 -1 ≈ 5.7e17, which is less than ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists a valid configuration of vertices that matches the given $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with a single vertex, then expands iteratively by connecting each leaf node to $ k $ new vertices. This expansion must be done at least once.\n2. **Geometric Series Insight**: The number of vertices in a snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series sum. For given integers $ k $ (number of children per node) and $ d $ (depth of expansion), the total number of vertices is $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^d $.\n3. **Efficient Check**: For each possible depth $ d $ (starting from 2 up to a reasonable maximum), perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $. This approach leverages the properties of geometric series and binary search for efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1  # k^0\n    for _ in range(d + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, which is larger than 1e18\n    for d in range(2, max_d + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n            if s >= n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Binary search between low and high\n        left = low\n        right = high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Minimum Valid Value**: If $ n $ is less than 7, it's immediately determined to be invalid since the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Depths**: For each depth $ d $ from 2 up to 60 (as higher depths would exceed the problem constraints), we check if there exists a $ k $ such that the geometric series sum equals $ n $.\n4. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each depth $ d $, a binary search is performed over possible values of $ k $ to find if the sum of the geometric series matches $ n $. This ensures efficient checking even for very large values of $ n $.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible configurations using mathematical insights and binary search, ensuring it handles the large constraints effectively.",
