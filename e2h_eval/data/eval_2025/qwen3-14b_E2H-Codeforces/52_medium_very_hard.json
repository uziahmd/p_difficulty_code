Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is b: every b burned candles can be made into a new one. And this new candle can be used again, which in turn will burn for an hour and then be added to the pile again. So the process continues until he can't make any more new candles.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of hours he can light the room.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which gives 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned candles. Since b is 2, he can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned candles. Again, he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 burned candle. Since 1 is less than 2, he can't make any more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example is 6 and 3. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6 candles. Burn them all (6 hours). Now 6 burned. Make 6/3 = 2 new. Burn those (2 hours). Now 2 burned. Can't make any new since 2 < 3. Wait, but wait, the example output is 8. Oh, 6+2 is 8? Oh yes. Wait, but what about the 2 burned candles? Wait, maybe there's a step I'm missing here. Let me check the note again. Oh the second example input is 6 3, output 8. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 6 candles: 6 hours. Then 6 burned, make 6/3=2 new. Burn those: 2 hours. Now, 2 burned. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total is 6+2=8. Correct. So that's how it works.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new candles. But how to model this?\n\nThe key is to track the total hours, and the number of burned candles. Let me think about the steps:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Each time you light a candle, it burns for an hour. So, each time you use a candle, you add 1 hour, and then you have one more burned candle.\n\nBut the process is:\n\nInitially, you have a candles. You can light them all, which gives a hours. Then, you have a burned candles. Then, you can convert as many as possible into new ones. Each time you make a new candle, you can light it, which adds another hour, and then it becomes a burned candle again.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nburned = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of:\n\nEach time you have some candles that can be lit. So:\n\nInitially, you have a candles. You light them all. So total_hours += a. Then, those a candles become burned. So burned += a. Then, you can make new candles from the burned ones. How many? It's (burned // b). But each time you make a new candle, you subtract b burned candles and add 1 new candle. But then, when you light that new candle, it adds an hour, and then becomes burned again.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nWe can model this with a loop. While we have enough burned candles to make at least one new candle:\n\n- Take the number of new candles we can make: new_candles = burned // b\n\n- Add new_candles to total_hours (since each new candle is lit and burns for an hour)\n\n- Subtract new_candles * b from burned (since we used those to make new candles)\n\n- Add new_candles to burned (because after burning, they become burned again)\n\nWait, no. Because when you make a new candle, you can light it, which takes an hour. So the steps are:\n\nEach time you make new_candles, you add new_candles to the total hours. Then, those new_candles are now burned after being lit. So, the burned count is updated by subtracting (new_candles * b) and adding new_candles.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose you have x burned candles. You can make x//b new candles. So, you take x//b * b burned candles, and convert them into x//b new candles. Then, those new candles are lit, which adds x//b hours. After that, those new candles are now burned, so you add x//b to the burned count.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nthen, while burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles \n\nSo this loop continues until burned is less than b.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each time, the number of burned candles is converted into new ones, which are then added to the total hours, and then those new ones become burned again.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts as 4. burned is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nburned >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total_hours becomes 4+2=6. burned becomes 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, burned is 2 >=2. new_candles = 2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2. So loop ends. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours starts as 6. burned is 6.\n\nLoop: 6 >=3. new_candles = 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. burned is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So loop ends. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burned is 5. Then new_candles is 5//5=1. total becomes 5+1=6. burned is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. burned=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew_candles =5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. burned is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nNow, 3 >=2. new_candles=3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. burned is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new_candles=1. total is 8+1=9. burned is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nLet's check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them all (5h). Burned=5.\n\nMake 2 new (5//2=2). Burn those (2h). Now burned is 5-2*2=1 +2=3. \n\nThen, make 1 new (3//2=1). Burn that (1h). Now burned is 3-2=1 +1=2.\n\nMake 1 new (2//2=1). Burn that (1h). Now burned is 0 +1=1. So total is 5+2+1+1=9. Yes. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes. So the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if a=1, b=2? Then initial total is 1. burned is 1. Since 1 <2, loop ends. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. burned=2. new=1. total becomes 3. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. burned is 3. new is 1. total is 4. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So output 4.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 10. burned=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew = 10//3 =3. total becomes 13. burned is 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nLoop again: 4 >=3. new=1. total 14. burned is 4%3=1 +1=2. loop ends. So total is 14.\n\nCheck manually:\n\nStart with 10. Burn 10h. Burned=10.\n\nMake 3 new. Burn them (3h). Burned is 10 - 3*3 = 1 +3 =4.\n\nMake 1 new. Burn it (1h). Burned is 4-3=1 +1=2. No more.\n\nTotal is 10+3+1=14. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would read two integers from input, compute this.\n\nNow, the input is given as a single line with two integers, but the example shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with two integers. But the example shows two inputs, like ['4 2', '6 3'], but that's probably part of the sample input. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: the single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nBut the example shows two inputs. Oh, perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: the single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines? Or perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['7', '8']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says \"the single line contains two integers a and b\". So perhaps that's a mistake in the example. Or perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple lines?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is showing two separate test cases, but the actual input is one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written as two lines, but in reality, the code should read one line.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code should read one line, split into a and b. But in the sample input, there are two lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. Maybe the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. So the code should read one line, split into a and b.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines, perhaps indicating that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's sample input may be formatted as such. For example, perhaps the first sample input is \"4 2\" and the output is 7, and the second sample input is \"6 3\" with output 8. But the way the sample is presented is as a list of inputs and outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line of input, and output one line of output.\n\nTherefore, the code should read a single line, split into a and b, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Split the input line into two integers.\n\nThen compute the total as per the algorithm above.\n\nSo the code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the first sample input:\n\nFor input 4 2:\n\ntotal starts as 4, burned is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nburned >=2: yes.\n\nnew = 4//2=2. total is 6. burned is 0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: new is 2//2=1. total 7. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends.\n\nOutput 7.\n\nFor input 6 3:\n\ntotal is 6, burned is 6.\n\nnew = 6//3=2. total is 8. burned is 0 +2=2. loop ends. Output 8.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2 gives 9 as discussed.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when a is zero? But according to the constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nWhat about when b is 1? But the constraints say b is at least 2. So no, the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering he can reuse the burned-out candles to create new ones. The approach involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the burned ones optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`.\n2. **Burning Candles**: Each candle burns for one hour. After burning, each candle becomes a \"burned\" candle.\n3. **Reusing Burned Candles**: Convert groups of `b` burned candles into new candles. Each new candle can be burned again, contributing an additional hour of light.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue converting burned candles into new ones until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburned = a\nwhile burned >= b:\n    new = burned // b\n    total += new\n    burned = burned % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with `a` candles. Each candle is burned for one hour, contributing `a` hours initially. These burned candles are stored in the `burned` variable.\n2. **Conversion Loop**: As long as there are enough burned candles to make at least one new candle (i.e., `burned >= b`), we:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the burned ones.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours since each new candle will burn for one hour.\n   - Update the count of burned candles by subtracting the number used to make new candles and adding the newly created ones (which will be burned again after use).\n3. **Termination**: The loop stops when there are not enough burned candles left to form a new one, at which point we print the total hours accumulated.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of using and reusing candles, ensuring optimal usage and handling all edge cases within the given constraints.",
