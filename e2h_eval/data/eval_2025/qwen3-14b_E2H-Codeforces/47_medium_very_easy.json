    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem. Let me first understand what's happening here. The LCM of two numbers is minimized when the numbers are as small as possible and have a high GCD. Because LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So if the two numbers are close to each other, their GCD might be larger, which reduces the LCM.\n\nWait, but how do I find k here? Let's think: Let me denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is the same for both, x - a = y - b → x - y = a - b. So the difference between x and y is fixed. Let me call this difference d = a - b. Wait, but if a and b are swapped, it's the same. So maybe we can assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b? Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nLet me suppose that a and b are given. Let's say that a < b. Then, x = a +k and y = b +k. So y = x + (b - a). So the difference between y and x is fixed. Let me denote d = b - a. Then, y = x + d. So the LCM of x and x +d. How can I minimize that?\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x such that x ≥ a (since k ≥0, so x = a +k ≥a), and x +d ≥b (since y = b +k = x +d, and since k ≥0, then x +d = b +k ≥b. So x must be ≥a, and x +d ≥b. But since d is b -a, then x +d = x + (b -a) = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k, which is correct.\n\nSo the problem becomes, find x ≥a, such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, once we find x, k is x -a.\n\nBut what's d here? Let's take the example from the first input: a=6, b=10. Then d = 10-6=4. So x is a +k = 6 +k, and y is x +4. For k=2, x=8, y=12. LCM(8,12) is 24. Which is the minimum.\n\nSo how do we find x?\n\nThe LCM of x and x +d is equal to x*(x +d)/gcd(x, x +d). But since gcd(x, x +d) is the same as gcd(x, d). Because gcd(x, x+d) = gcd(x, d). So that simplifies things.\n\nSo LCM(x, x+d) = x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d). So to minimize this, we need to maximize the gcd(x, d), because x*(x +d) is fixed once d is fixed, but wait no. Wait, x varies. So the problem is to find x such that x*(x +d)/g is minimized, where g is gcd(x, d).\n\nBut how can we approach this? Let's think about the possible values of g. Since g is a divisor of d. Because g divides x and d, so it must divide d. So for all possible divisors of d, perhaps we can find the optimal x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is chosen such that x is as small as possible and has a large GCD with d. Let me think.\n\nLet me take the example where d is 4 (from the first test case). The possible divisors of d are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each possible divisor g of d, we can try to find x such that x is a multiple of g, and x is as small as possible. Because then the GCD(x, d) would be at least g, which would help in reducing the LCM.\n\nWait, but how to find the best x for each possible divisor of d.\n\nAlternatively, since d is fixed, and x can be any number >= a (assuming a < b?), perhaps the optimal x is such that x is as small as possible and x is a multiple of some divisor of d.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is chosen such that x is the minimal possible value that makes x and x +d share the maximum possible GCD.\n\nSo let's think. Let me consider that d is fixed. Let me assume that a < b. So d = b -a. Then, the problem is to find x >= a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nBut since x +d = x + (b -a) = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to find x?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For all possible divisors g of d, find the minimal x >=a such that x is congruent to -d mod g? Or something like that. Wait, since the GCD(x, d) is g, then x must be a multiple of g, and d must be a multiple of g. So, for each divisor g of d, we can try to find x such that x is a multiple of g, and x is as small as possible. Then compute the LCM for that x.\n\nWait, but if x is a multiple of g, then since d is also a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. However, it could be higher. For example, if d is 4 and x is 4, then GCD(4,4) is 4. If x is 8, then GCD(8,4) is 4. So for each divisor g of d, perhaps the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is g. So to maximize the GCD, we can consider all possible divisors of d, and for each, find the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and such that x >= a. Then compute the LCM for that x, and choose the minimal one.\n\nBut perhaps this is the way to go. Let's think of this approach:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|. Because if a and b are swapped, the problem is symmetric. Let me assume that a <= b. So d = b -a. Then, the problem is to find x >=a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nNow, for each divisor g of d, find the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM for that x. Then among all these possibilities, select the one with minimal LCM, and then the minimal k.\n\nBut why would that work? Because the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So by checking all divisors of d, we can find the x that gives the maximum possible GCD(x, d), which would minimize the LCM.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, in the first case, d=4. The divisors are 1, 2, 4. Let's take each:\n\nFor g=4: x must be a multiple of 4. The minimal x >=a (a=6) is 8. Then x +d = 12. LCM(8,12)=24.\n\nFor g=2: x must be a multiple of 2. Minimal x >=6 is 6. Then x +d = 6 +4=10. LCM(6,10) is 30. Which is higher than 24.\n\nFor g=1: x is any number. The minimal x is 6. LCM(6,10)=30.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when g=4. So the optimal x is 8, which gives k=8-6=2. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input is 5 and 10. So d=5. The divisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5: x must be multiple of 5. Minimal x >=5 is 5. Then x +d=10. LCM(5,10)=10. Which is better than the other options. So k=0. Which is the sample output.\n\nAnother example: input is 21 and 31. d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=10: x must be multiple of 10. Minimal x >=21 is 30. Then x +d=40. LCM(30,40)= 120.\n\ng=5: x must be multiple of 5. Minimal x >=21 is 25. Then x +d=35. LCM(25,35) is 175.\n\ng=2: x must be multiple of 2. Minimal x >=21 is 22. Then x +d=32. LCM(22,32) is 352.\n\ng=1: x=21. LCM(21,31) is 651. So the minimal is 120, achieved when x=30. So k=30-21=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = absolute difference between a and b. Let's assume a and b are given. Let me make sure that d is positive. So d = abs(a - b).\n\n- Then, find all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >= min(a, b) such that x is a multiple of g. Wait, no. Because x is a +k. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when a and b are given, and d = b -a (assuming a < b). Then x = a +k, and x must be >=a. So for each divisor g of d, find the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d (which is (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k). Then compare all these possibilities.\n\nBut if a > b, then d = a -b. Then x is b +k, and the same logic applies. So perhaps the code should first compute d = abs(a -b), and then proceed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. Find all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >= min(a, b) such that x is a multiple of g. Wait, no. Because x is a +k. Suppose that a is smaller than b. Then x = a +k, and x must be >=a. So the minimal x for a given g is the smallest multiple of g that is >=a. For example, if a is 6 and g is 4, then the minimal x is 8 (since 4*2=8, which is >=6). But if a is 5 and g is 5, then x is 5.\n\nOnce x is found, then the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d) = (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, d) (since x +d -x =d). And since x is a multiple of g, and g divides d, then gcd(x, d) is at least g. But perhaps more.\n\nBut in this approach, for each divisor g of d, we generate a candidate x. Then compute the LCM for that x, and then select the x with minimal LCM, and then the corresponding k.\n\nBut why do we need to consider all divisors of d? Because the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So by considering all divisors, we can find the x that maximizes the GCD(x, d), which will minimize the LCM.\n\nBut perhaps there's another case where x is not a multiple of any divisor of d. Wait, no, because all divisors of d are considered. For example, if x is such that the GCD(x, d) is some value g, which divides d. So that g must be a divisor of d. Therefore, by considering all possible divisors of d, we can find the x that gives the maximum possible GCD(x, d), which is the key to minimizing the LCM.\n\nBut how do I get all the divisors of d? Well, for that, I need to factorize d and generate all possible divisors. However, d can be up to 1e9, which is manageable. For example, for 1e9, the maximum number of divisors is small (for example, 1e9 has divisors 1, 2, ..., etc. But even if it's a number like 1e9, which is 2^9 * 5^9, the number of divisors is (9+1)*(9+1) = 100, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, handle the case when a == b. Then, d = 0. So x = a +k, y = b +k = a +k. So the LCM is x, which is minimized when k=0. So the answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, compute d = abs(a -b). Then find all divisors of d. For each divisor g, compute the minimal x >= min(a, b) such that x is a multiple of g. Wait, no. Wait, when a and b are such that a < b, then x is a +k, which must be >=a. So for the divisor g, the minimal x is the smallest multiple of g that is >=a. But how to compute that?\n\nFor example, given a value of a and a divisor g, the minimal x is:\n\nif a % g == 0, then x = a. Else, x = ((a // g) + 1) * g.\n\nBut for example, if a is 6, and g is 4, then 6//4 is 1, so x is 2*4=8.\n\nOnce we have x, then compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then compare all these possibilities.\n\nBut also, there's another case. What if x is such that x +d is less than x? No, because d is positive. So x +d is larger than x.\n\nBut wait, when d is zero, but that's handled separately.\n\nOnce we have all candidates for x, then for each x, compute the LCM and find the minimal one. Then, among those x's that give the minimal LCM, choose the smallest x (since k = x - a (if a was the smaller one)), and then the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple divisors that lead to the same LCM? For example, different divisors may generate different x's with the same LCM. We need to choose the smallest k in that case.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\n- If a == b, return 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Let d = abs(a -b)\n\n   - Find all divisors of d.\n\n   - For each divisor g, compute the minimal x >= min(a, b) such that x is a multiple of g. Wait, no. Because x is a +k, and a can be either the smaller or larger. Let me think again.\n\nWait, suppose a and b are arbitrary. Let me assume that a and b are such that a < b. So d = b -a. Then x = a +k. So x must be >=a. So for each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >=a which is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d (which is (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k). Then, the candidate k is x -a.\n\nBut if a > b, then similar steps. So the code can proceed by taking min_val = min(a, b), and max_val = max(a, b). Then d = max_val - min_val. Then, for each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >= min_val which is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then, the corresponding k is x - min_val. Because x = min_val +k. Wait, yes. Because if min_val is a, then x = a +k. If min_val is b, then x = b +k. But in that case, the original a is larger than b, so the original problem is to find k such that (a +k) and (b +k) have minimal LCM. But since a >b, then min_val is b. So x is b +k. Then, the other term is a +k = (b +k) + (a -b) = x +d. So same logic as before.\n\nSo regardless of which is bigger, the code can proceed by taking min_val = min(a, b), d = abs(a -b). Then, for each divisor of d, compute the minimal x >= min_val which is multiple of g. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then, collect all these possible candidates and find the one with minimal LCM, and then the minimal k.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the minimal LCM is achieved when x is not a multiple of any of the divisors of d? For example, if d is 4, and x is 4. Then x is a multiple of 4, which is a divisor of d. But suppose x is 6. Then, d is 4. GCD(6,4) is 2, which is a divisor of d. So in that case, the code would have considered the divisor 2. So the code would have generated x=6 as a candidate for divisor 2. So the code would have considered that case. Thus, considering all divisors of d covers all possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the steps for code:\n\nFirst, generate all divisors of d.\n\nHow to generate all divisors of a number?\n\nWell, for that, we can factorize d into primes, then generate all possible products of the primes' exponents. But for code purposes, perhaps it's easier to generate all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d).\n\nFor example:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in our problem, when a ==b, d is zero. But that case is handled separately.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    d = abs(a -b)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    then process each divisor.\n\nBut for the case when d is zero, but the code is handled separately.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, for each divisor g, compute the minimal x >= min_val (min_val is min(a, b)) which is multiple of g.\n\nOnce x is found, compute the LCM of x and x +d.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(x, y) = x * y // GCD(x, y).\n\nBut since x and x +d have GCD equal to GCD(x, d), as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, for x and x +d, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) // GCD(x, d).\n\nBut since x is a multiple of g, and g divides d, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. However, it could be higher. But that's okay.\n\nBut for the purpose of comparing, we can compute the actual LCM.\n\nOnce we have all the candidates, we can select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple candidates have the same LCM, we choose the one with the smallest x, which leads to the smallest k (since k = x - min_val).\n\nBut wait, in case of multiple x's with same LCM, the minimal k is the one with the smallest x. Because k = x - min_val.\n\nSo, for each candidate, we can compute (lcm_value, x), and then select the one with the smallest lcm_value, and then the smallest x.\n\nSo, the code can collect all possible (lcm, x) pairs, then select the one with minimal lcm, and then minimal x.\n\nOnce that x is selected, the k is x - min_val.\n\nBut there's another case: when x is min_val, and the minimal x. For example, if the minimal x is min_val, then k is 0.\n\nBut what if the minimal x is min_val, but there's another x that gives the same LCM but with a smaller k? No, because x is min_val, which gives k=0, which is the minimal possible.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with generating all possible candidates from the divisors of d, then selecting the best one.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: a = b. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: a = 5, b = 5. Output 0.\n\nCase 3: a = 1, b = 2. d =1. Divisors are 1. For g=1, x must be >=1. So minimal x is 1. Then LCM(1, 2) is 2. So k is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=3. d=1. Same as above. k=0.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=5. d=2. Divisors are 1, 2.\n\nFor g=2: minimal x >=3 is 4. LCM(4, 6) is 12.\n\nFor g=1: x=3. LCM(3,5) is 15. So the minimal is 12. k is 4 -3 =1. So output 1.\n\nBut what if there is a k smaller than that? For example, k=0: 3 and 5. LCM 15. k=1: 4 and 6, LCM 12. So yes, 1 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=6. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\nFor g=2: x must be >=4. So x=4. LCM(4,6) is 12. k=0.\n\nWhich is better than g=1, which gives x=4, LCM(4,6) is same. So in this case, the code would generate two candidates, but both have same LCM. So the minimal k is 0.\n\nSo the code would select the minimal x (since for same LCM, choose the minimal x, which gives minimal k).\n\nSo the code needs to collect all possible candidates, then select the one with minimal LCM, and then minimal x.\n\nSo, the code can generate all the possible candidates, then select the best.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the get_divisors function.\n\nBut note that for d=0, it's handled separately.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n\n    d = max_val - min_val\n\n    generate all divisors of d.\n\n    for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n        compute x = ?\n\n        x is the smallest multiple of g >= min_val.\n\n        how?\n\n        if min_val % g == 0:\n\n            x_candidate = min_val\n\n        else:\n\n            x_candidate = ((min_val // g) + 1) * g\n\n        then compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\n        add (lcm_value, x_candidate) to a list.\n\n    Also, what about the case when x_candidate +d is less than x_candidate? No, since d is positive. x_candidate +d is larger than x_candidate.\n\n    Now, after collecting all the (lcm_value, x_candidate) pairs, select the one with the minimal lcm_value. If multiple, select the one with the minimal x_candidate.\n\n    Then, the k is x_candidate - min_val.\n\nBut wait, what if there are other x's that are not generated by the divisors of d? For example, suppose that d=4, and x is 6. Then, GCD(6,4) is 2, which is a divisor of d. So the code would generate x_candidate for g=2. Let's see. For min_val =6, and g=2. min_val is 6, which is divisible by 2. So x_candidate is 6. Then x_candidate +d is 6+4=10. LCM(6,10) is 30. Which is higher than the case when x_candidate is 8 (for g=4). So the code would generate this candidate. So in this case, the code would find the minimal.\n\nBut what about when the optimal x is not generated by any of the divisors of d? For example, suppose d=6. Let's say the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. Suppose that x is 4. Then, GCD(4,6) is 2. Which is a divisor of d. So the code would generate x_candidate for g=2. For example, if min_val is 4, then x_candidate is 4 (since 4%2==0). So yes, the code would generate that x_candidate. So the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, the code to generate the divisors.\n\nBut for d=0, the code is handled separately.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return divisors\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in the code, when a !=b, d is positive. So no problem.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead a and b. Let's say the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is two integers a and b. Wait, looking back:\n\nInput: The only line contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e9).\n\nSo the code reads a single line with two integers. For example, in the sample input, the first input is ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'], but that's probably for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e9).\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers. But the sample input shows three test cases. Wait, the sample input shows that the user provided three test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem requires handling a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2', '9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps there's confusion here. But looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e9).\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers, not multiple lines. The sample input and output may be for multiple test cases, but in the actual problem, the code is supposed to read a single line. But the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers.\n\nThus, the code for reading input is:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nHandle the case when a == b.\n\nElse, compute d, get divisors, generate candidates, and select the best.\n\nBut also, what about when d is zero? Well, that's handled by the first condition.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return divisors\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n    d = max_val - min_val\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    candidates = []\n    for g in divisors:\n        # compute x_candidate >= min_val, multiple of g\n        if min_val % g == 0:\n            x_candidate = min_val\n        else:\n            x_candidate = ((min_val // g) + 1) * g\n        # compute LCM(x_candidate, x_candidate +d)\n        x = x_candidate\n        y = x_candidate + d\n        g_x_y = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm = x * y // g_x_y\n        candidates.append( (lcm, x_candidate) )\n    # Also, check the case when x_candidate is min_val - something? No, because x_candidate is the minimal >= min_val.\n    # Now find the best candidate\n    # sort by lcm, then by x_candidate\n    candidates.sort(key=lambda t: (t[0], t[1]))\n    best_lcm, best_x = candidates[0]\n    k = best_x - min_val\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM and x_candidate? Well, the sort will take care of that.\n\nBut let's test this code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10.\n\na=6, b=10. min_val=6, d=4. divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\ng=4: x_candidate is 8. LCM(8, 12) is 24.\n\nSo the candidates are [(30,6), (30,6), (24,8)]. When sorted, the first is (24,8). So k=8-6=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 21 31. min_val=21, d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=21. LCM(21, 31) is 651.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 22. LCM(22, 32) is 352.\n\ng=5: x_candidate is 25. LCM(25, 35) is 175.\n\ng=10: x_candidate is 30. LCM(30, 40) is 120. So the best is 120, x_candidate=30. k=30-21=9. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 10. min_val=5, d=5. Divisors of 5: 1,5.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=5. LCM(5, 10) is 10.\n\ng=5: x_candidate=5. LCM(5,10) is 10. So both candidates have same lcm and same x_candidate. So the k is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5. d=2. divisors 1,2.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=3. LCM(3,5) is 15.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 4. LCM(4,6) is 12. So the code returns 4-3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6. d=2. divisors 1,2.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=4. LCM(4,6) is 12.\n\ng=2: x_candidate=4. LCM(4,6) is 12. So the code returns 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=5. d=3. Divisors are 1,3.\n\nFor g=3: x_candidate is 3 (since min_val=2. 2%3 is 2, so ((2//3) +1)*3 = (0+1)*3=3. x=3, y=6. LCM(3,6) is 6.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate=2. LCM(2,5)=10. So the best is 6. k=3-2=1.\n\nSo the code returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=10. d=3. Divisors are 1,3.\n\nFor g=3: x_candidate is 9 (since min_val=7. 7//3 is 2, so 3*(2+1)=9. x=9, y=12. LCM is 36.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate is 7. LCM(7, 10) is 70. So the code returns 9-7=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there is a better k?\n\nFor example, k=2: 7+2=9, 10+2=12. LCM 36.\n\nk=1: 8 and 11. LCM 88. Worse.\n\nk=0: 7 and 10. LCM 70. Worse. So code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=3. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 2. LCM(2,4) is 4. k=2-1=1.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=1. LCM(1,3)=3. Which is better. So the code would return k=0. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, the code computes for each divisor. For g=1, x_candidate is 1. Then LCM(1,3) is 3. Which is better than 4. So the code would choose that.\n\nBut why? Because the code considers all divisors. So in this case, the code would generate candidates (3, 1) and (4, 2). The first is better, so the code returns k=0. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code would return 0, which is correct. Because the LCM is 3, which is better than 4.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when d is zero? Well, handled by the first condition.\n\nBut what about when d is zero but a and b are different? No, because if a and b are different, then d is non-zero. So the first condition checks if a ==b.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's efficiency.\n\nFor d up to 1e9. The number of divisors is O(number of divisors of d), which is up to around 1000 for numbers with many factors. For example, 1e9 has divisors up to 100 (as discussed earlier). So the code is efficient.\n\nThe math.gcd function is O(log min(x,y)), which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code is efficient.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, math.isqrt is available in Python 3.8+. So for older versions, it's better to use int(math.sqrt(n)), but for code submission, assuming that it's allowed.\n\nBut in code submission, using math.isqrt is better.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → Output 2.\n\nSample Input 2: 21 31 → Output 9.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 10 → Output 0.\n\nAll handled correctly.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=3 → output 0.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. If there are multiple values of $ k $ that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Special Case Handling**: If $ a $ and $ b $ are equal, the LCM is simply $ a $ (or $ b $) when $ k = 0 $, so the answer is immediately 0.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $.\n3. **Divisors of Difference**: Generate all divisors of $ d $. These divisors help in finding potential values of $ k $ that might minimize the LCM.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor, calculate the smallest value $ x $ (starting from the smaller of $ a $ and $ b $) that is a multiple of the divisor. This $ x $ helps determine the corresponding $ k $.\n5. **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate $ x $, compute the LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $, and track the minimum LCM along with the corresponding $ k $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return divisors\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n    d = max_val - min_val\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    candidates = []\n    for g in divisors:\n        if min_val % g == 0:\n            x_candidate = min_val\n        else:\n            x_candidate = ((min_val // g) + 1) * g\n        x = x_candidate\n        y = x_candidate + d\n        g_x_y = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm = x * y // g_x_y\n        candidates.append((lcm, x_candidate))\n    # Sort by LCM, then by x_candidate to choose the smallest k\n    candidates.sort(key=lambda t: (t[0], t[1]))\n    best_lcm, best_x = candidates[0]\n    k = best_x - min_val\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Special Case Handling**: Directly check if $ a $ and $ b $ are equal. If so, print 0 immediately.\n2. **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of a number $ d $ by iterating up to the square root of $ d $, ensuring efficiency.\n3. **Candidate Generation**: For each divisor $ g $, determine the smallest multiple of $ g $ that is greater than or equal to the smaller of $ a $ and $ b $. This ensures we start checking from the minimal possible value.\n4. **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate value derived from the divisors, compute the LCM of the two numbers formed by adding $ k $ to $ a $ and $ b $. Track the minimum LCM and corresponding $ k $.\n5. **Result Selection**: After evaluating all candidates, the solution selects the smallest $ k $ that results in the minimal LCM, ensuring correctness and efficiency.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential values of $ k $ using mathematical properties of divisors and LCM, ensuring optimal performance even for large input values.",
