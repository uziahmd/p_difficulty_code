    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the max minus min of the remaining elements. So, the problem is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, what happens when we remove it, and compute the instability. But if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), that approach would be O(n^2), which would be too slow. Because for each element, you'd have to find the max and min of the remaining elements, which takes O(n) time each. So for n=1e5, that's 1e10 operations. Definitely not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nWell, if the element we remove is the current max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly, if we remove the current min, the new min is the second lowest. But if the element we remove is neither the max nor the min, then the max and min remain the same. Wait, but maybe there are multiple instances of the max or min. For example, if the array is [1,3,3,7], the original max is 7, min is 1. If we remove 7, the new max is 3, min is 1. If we remove one of the 3s, the max is still 7, min is 1. So instability remains 6. But if we remove 1, the new min is 3, and max is 7, instability is 4. So in this case, the best is to remove the 7, leading to instability 2.\n\nSo the key idea here is that the optimal element to remove is either the max or the min. Wait, but maybe not always? Let's think of another example. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 5, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove one of the 5s, the instability becomes 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 5-2=3. If we remove 2, the instability is 5-1=4. So the best is to remove 1, which gives instability 3. So in this case, removing the min gives a better result. But if we remove the max, the instability would be 5-1=4. So in this case, the best is to remove the min. So perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the min or the max, but not sure.\n\nBut how do we know which one to remove? Well, maybe the answer is to consider the cases where we remove the first occurrence of the min or max, but perhaps there are other possibilities. However, considering that the instability is determined by the max and min of the remaining array, perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the min or the max. But how?\n\nWait, suppose that the array has multiple elements with the same value. For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]. Then the original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. So no matter which element you remove, the instability is the same. So the answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. If we remove 7, instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 3, instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 5, instability is 7-1=6. So the best is to remove either the first or last element, giving instability 4.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal is to remove the min or the max. So perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum between the instability after removing the min or after removing the max. But how do we compute that?\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So obviously, removing the max is better. So in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. Then removing the max (100) gives instability 4-1=3. But if we remove 5, the instability is 100-1=99. So again, the best is to remove the max.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 100, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 99. If we remove the 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove the 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So again, removing the max (100) gives better result.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 100, 101, 102]. The original instability is 101. If we remove 102, the instability is 100-1=99. If we remove 1, the instability is 102-100=2. So here, removing the min gives a better result.\n\nAh, so in this case, the optimal is to remove the min. So the minimal instability is min( (max after removing min) - (min after removing min), (max after removing max) - (min after removing max) )\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. So, the idea is that the minimal instability after removing one element can be achieved by either:\n\n- Removing the first occurrence of the minimum element, which would leave the rest of the array's min as the next smallest element. Or, if there are multiple minima, removing one of them would not change the min (if there are multiple minima, like two 1s in the array. Removing one leaves another 1 as the min).\n\nSimilarly for the max.\n\nBut how do we compute the possible instabilities when removing the min or the max?\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\nFirst, sort the array. Wait, but the problem requires that we remove exactly one element. However, if we sort the array, perhaps we can find the optimal element to remove.\n\nWait, for example, if the array is sorted as [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}].\n\nIf we remove the first element (a_0), then the instability is max(a_1 ... a_{n-1}) - min(a_1 ... a_{n-1}) = a_{n-1} - a_1.\n\nIf we remove the last element (a_{n-1}), the instability is a_{n-2} - a_0.\n\nIf we remove any other element, say a_i (where 1 <= i <= n-2), then the instability is (max of the array without a_i) - (min of the array without a_i). But since the array is sorted, the max is a_{n-1} and the min is a_0, so the instability is a_{n-1} - a_0. Which is the same as the original instability. So removing any element that is not the first or last in the sorted array would leave the instability as the original.\n\nBut wait, that's only if the array is sorted. So, in this case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a_{n-1} - a_1) and (a_{n-2} - a_0). Because those are the two options of removing the first or the last element.\n\nBut in this scenario, the minimal instability is the minimum between those two values. So, the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) ) ?\n\nWait, but this would be the case if the array is sorted. Let's take the first example from the problem.\n\nOriginal input is [1,3,3,7]. Sorted array is [1,3,3,7]. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If we remove the last element (7), the instability is 3-1=2. Which is the correct answer. So according to this approach, the answer is min(4,2)=2. Which is correct.\n\nIn the second example, input is [1, 100000]. Sorted array is [1, 100000]. Removing first element gives instability 0. Removing the second gives 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,4,5]. The original instability is 4. If we remove the first element, the instability is 4-2=2. If we remove the last element, the instability is 3-1=2. So the answer would be 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100, 2, 3, 4, 5]. When sorted, it's [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. So removing the first element gives instability 100-2=98. Removing the last element gives 5-1=4. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut what if there are multiple elements that are min or max. Like [1, 1, 3, 3, 7, 7]. So the sorted array is [1,1,3,3,7,7]. The original instability is 6. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-1=6. If we remove the last element (7), the instability is 7-1=6. But if we remove the first occurrence of 1, the instability is 7-1=6. However, if we remove the first occurrence of 7, the instability is 7-1=6. But maybe there's a better option. Wait, but in this case, if we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 7-1=6. So no matter which element we remove, the instability is 6. But according to our approach, the answer would be min( (7-1) , (7-1) ) = 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,5,7]. The sorted array is [1,3,5,7]. Removing the first element gives 7-3=4. Removing the last gives 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about an array where the optimal is to remove an element that is not the min or max. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. But what if we remove 5? Then the instability is 100-1=99. Which is worse. So in this case, the optimal is to remove the max. So according to the approach of checking the first and last elements of the sorted array, the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) ), which would be min( (100 - 2) = 98, (6 - 1) = 5 ). Wait, 6-1=5? Wait, the array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,100]. So when we remove the last element (100), the array is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The instability is 6-1=5. So the answer would be min(98,5) = 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the approach of checking the first and last elements of the sorted array, the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) ). Which is min(100 - 2, 6 - 1) = min(98,5) = 5. Which is correct. So in this case, the approach works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 100]. So sorted array is [1,2,5,6,7,100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. But what if we remove 5? Then the array is [1,2,6,7,100], instability is 100-1=99. So the best is to remove the max. Which gives 6. But according to the approach, the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]) = 100-2=98, (a[-2] - a[0])=7-1=6). So the answer is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, the minimal instability is the minimum between (the instability after removing the first element) and (the instability after removing the last element). Because removing the first element (the min) gives instability of (max of the rest) - (min of the rest) = a[-1] - a[1]. Similarly, removing the last element (the max) gives a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value as the min or max?\n\nFor example, sorted array is [1,1,3,3,7,7]. So, if we remove the first element (1), the instability is (7 - 1) = 6. But if we remove the last element (7), the instability is (7-1) = 6. But if we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 7-1=6. So the answer is 6. Which is indeed the minimum between the two options (a[-1] - a[1] = 7 - 1 = 6, a[-2] - a[0] = 7 - 1 = 6. So min is 6).\n\nAnother example: sorted array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]. The original instability is 3. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 4 - 2 = 2. If we remove the last element (4), the instability is 3 - 1 = 2. So the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work. Therefore, the solution is to sort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 2? For example, input is [1, 100000]. Then, after sorting, the array is [1, 100000]. Removing the first element gives instability 0, removing the last gives 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The options are:\n\nremove 1: instability 3-2=1.\n\nremove 2: instability 3-1=2.\n\nremove 3: instability 2-1=1.\n\nSo the answer is 1. According to the approach, the sorted array is [1,2,3]. The two options are (a[-1] - a[1]) = 3 - 2 = 1, and (a[-2] - a[0]) = 2 -1 =1. So min is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to work. Thus, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut why is this the case? Because when you remove the first element (the min), the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. Similarly, when you remove the last element (the max), the new max is a[-2], and the new min is a[0]. All other elements, when removed, would leave the min and max as a[0] and a[-1], so the instability is the same as original. So the minimal possible instability is the minimum between these two options.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it. Then compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nBut wait, what about when the array has more than one occurrence of the min or max?\n\nLike for example, sorted array [1,1,2,3]. Then, removing the first element (1) gives the array [1,2,3], instability 2. Removing the last element (3) gives [1,1,2], instability 1. So the answer is 1. According to the approach, the code would compute min(3 - 1=2, 2-1=1) → 1, which is correct.\n\nYes, that's right. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read the array as a list of integers.\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the two possibilities: (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\n- The answer is the minimum of these two.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2?\n\nFor example, n=2, array [1, 100000]. After sorting, the array is [1, 100000]. Then a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 1 (but a[1] is 100000?), wait:\n\nWait, for n=2, the sorted array is [a0, a1]. Then:\n\nIf we remove the first element, the array is [a1], so instability is 0. But according to the formula, a[-1] is a1, a[1] is a1. So a[-1] - a[1] is 0. Similarly, a[-2] is a0, a[0] is a0. So a[-2] - a[0] is 0. So the min is 0, which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code handles this case.\n\nAnother example: n=3, array [1, 1, 1]. Then after sorting, [1,1,1]. The two options are (1 - 1) = 0 and (1 -1) = 0. So answer 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, array [1, 2, 2]. Sorted array is [1,2,2]. The two options are:\n\na[-1] - a[1] = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\na[-2] - a[0] = 2 - 1 = 1. So min is 0. Which is correct. Because if you remove the first element (1), the array is [2,2], instability 0.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read list, sort, compute min between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code is correct. For n>2, the code works as well.\n\nThus, this approach is O(n log n) time due to the sorting step, which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n, then the list. Sort it. Then compute the two values and take the minimum.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\na[-1] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\na[-2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2. So min(4,2) is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] - a[0] is 1 -1 = 0. min is 0 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. min between 3-2=1 and 2-1=1 → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 1, 3, 3, 7, 7]. sorted. a[-1] -a[1] =7-1=6. a[-2]-a[0]=7-1=6. min is 6.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,5,6,7,100]. sorted. a[-1]-a[1] = 100-2=98. a[-2]-a[0] =7-1=6. min is 6.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, then list a. Sort a. Then compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut wait, for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], so a[-2] - a[0] is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would compute option1 as a[-1] - a[1] → a[1] - a[1] = 0. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] → a[0] - a[0] = 0. So min(0,0) is 0. So even if n=2, the code can be handled by the same formula. So the code can be written without checking for n==2.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the code would compute min( a[1] - a[1], a[0] - a[0] ) → min(0,0) → 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as such. Let's test for n=2.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1], which is the third element minus the second element. For example, sorted array [1,2,3]. a[-1] is 3, a[1] is 2 → 1. a[-2] is 2, a[0] is 1 → 1. So min(1,1) is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. Therefore, this is the solution.\n\nSo the Python code is:\n\nRead n, read list, sort, compute min between (last element - second element) and (second last element - first element). Print that.\n\nSo that's the code. Now, let's write it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between its maximum and minimum values. When we remove an element, the instability of the resulting array can be minimized by considering the effect of removing either the minimum or the maximum element.\n2. **Sorting Insight**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the potential instability after removing either the first or the last element (which are the minimum and maximum values respectively in the sorted array).\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: After sorting the array, the minimum instability can be found by considering two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element (minimum value) and calculating the instability of the remaining elements.\n   - Removing the last element (maximum value) and calculating the instability of the remaining elements.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum instability is the smaller value obtained from the two scenarios mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the array.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential minimum and maximum values after removing one element.\n3. **Calculating Instability**:\n   - **Option 1**: Remove the first element (minimum value) and calculate the instability as the difference between the last element (maximum value of the remaining array) and the second element (new minimum value).\n   - **Option 2**: Remove the last element (maximum value) and calculate the instability as the difference between the second last element (new maximum value) and the first element (minimum value).\n4. **Result**: The minimum value from the two calculated instabilities is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability in O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting, which is optimal for the given problem constraints.",
