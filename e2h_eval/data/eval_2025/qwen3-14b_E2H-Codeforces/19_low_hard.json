The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement says that we have a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between every two districts), and we need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to select n - k districts that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum of their 2^i values. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. However, since the districts form a tree, we have to make sure that the selected districts are connected.\n\nBut how do we approach this? Let's think about the problem in terms of choosing which nodes to keep. Since higher-numbered nodes contribute more, perhaps we should prioritize keeping them. But the challenge is ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but the tree is connected, and when we remove nodes, the remaining ones must be connected. So, the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i is maximum. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal strategy is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to select the largest possible nodes, and then make sure that they are connected. But how?\n\nLet me think: since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible nodes, maybe we can start by selecting all nodes from some threshold upwards, and then check if they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to add some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select a subset of nodes with the highest possible values, and then ensure that they are connected. So perhaps we can model this as a priority-based selection with some constraints.\n\nAnother approach: since the sum is the sum of 2^i for each node kept, and 2^i is larger for higher i, the optimal solution is to keep the (n - k) nodes with the highest possible numbers, but connected. However, if those nodes are not connected, we might need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how do we find which nodes to remove?\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the remaining districts form a connected component. So the idea is to find a connected subtree with exactly (n - k) nodes, and which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo here's an idea: since we want to maximize the sum, we should keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep all nodes except the smallest k nodes. But that's only possible if those nodes are connected. But that's not necessarily true. For example, imagine that the tree is structured in such a way that the highest-numbered nodes are spread out and not connected unless certain lower-numbered nodes are included.\n\nSo maybe the approach is to find a way to select the nodes with the largest numbers, but also ensure that they are connected. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since the tree is connected, and we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Let's consider that the highest-numbered node is n. We must include it. Then, we need to include other high-numbered nodes that are connected to it. But how?\n\nThis seems similar to finding a tree that includes the highest nodes, and possibly some lower ones to connect them. Maybe a way to approach this is to perform a greedy selection, starting from the highest-numbered nodes and building a connected subtree.\n\nAnother thought: the problem is equivalent to removing k nodes, so that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. The sum is maximized by keeping the nodes with the highest 2^i. Since 2^i is exponentially increasing, the best way is to keep the largest possible nodes. However, the constraint is that they must be connected.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n- Start with all nodes. We need to remove k nodes. The optimal is to remove the k nodes with the smallest values, but only if they can be removed without disconnecting the remaining nodes. However, this is not straightforward.\n\nWait, but what if we think of the problem as selecting the nodes to keep. Let's say we need to keep m = n - k nodes. Since we want the maximum sum, we need to select m nodes with the largest possible numbers, and which form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the problem becomes: select a connected subtree of size m, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nHow can we find such a subtree?\n\nAn approach could be to start with the highest-numbered node (n) and then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are structured as a tree, and each district's fan count is given by $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ increases exponentially with $i$, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connected Component**: The remaining districts must form a connected component.
