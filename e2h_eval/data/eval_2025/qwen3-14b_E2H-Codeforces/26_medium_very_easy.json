Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain inequalities based on the given A, B, C, D. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values that meet the constraints and check if x + y > z. But given that the maximum value for D is 5e5, a brute force approach would be way too slow. We need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The variables are ordered as x ≤ B, y ≥ B and ≤ C, z ≥ C and ≤ D. Also, since the problem says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D, so x can range from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and z ranges from C to D. But also, for each x and y, z must be at least C and up to D, but also must satisfy x + y > z. So for each pair (x, y), the valid z values are those between max(C, ... ) and min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, because z has to be less than x + y. So for a given x and y, the lower bound for z is C, and upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). But if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no valid z for this x and y. So the number of valid z's for a given x and y is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe steps I can think of:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible x in [A, B]\n2. Iterate over all possible y in [B, C]\n3. For each (x, y), compute the minimum z that satisfies z ≥ C and z < x + y. So the valid z's are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. The count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut if B and C are up to 5e5, then iterating x and y would be O(B*C) which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. This approach won't work for large inputs.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about the constraints again. Since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, but y can be up to C. So maybe we can find for each possible x and y, but find a way to compute the total counts without checking every possible pair.\n\nWait, but even if B and C are 5e5 each, the product is 2.5e11, which is way beyond what can be handled in Python in reasonable time. So we need to find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible z (from C to D), find the number of pairs (x, y) such that x ≤ B, y ≤ C, y ≥ B, x ≤ y, and x + y > z. Then sum over all z. But again, this seems tricky. However, maybe for each z, we can compute the number of (x,y) pairs that satisfy x ≤ B, y ∈ [B, C], x ≤ y, and x + y > z. But again, how to compute this quickly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each x and y, the range of z's. But again, the initial approach is too slow. Let's think about optimizing the x and y loops.\n\nLet me consider that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. But since x ≤ y (because x ≤ B ≤ y), then for each x, y starts from B up to C, but y must be ≥ x? Or no, because x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So x ≤ B ≤ y. Therefore, x ≤ y always holds. So for each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], the x and y satisfy x ≤ y.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all (x, y, z) where x is in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut since z is between C and D, and x + y must be > z. For each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nSo for each x and y, the count of z is:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → 0\n\nelse:\n\nnumber of integers between C and min(D, x + y -1) inclusive → which is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the total number of triangles is sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [ max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) ].\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nBut even with B and C being 5e5, the double loop would be O( (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) ), which could be up to 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nSo we need to find a way to compute this sum without iterating all possible x and y.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this sum.\n\nLet me denote for each x, the sum over y in [B, C] of the count of z for that x and y.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute the sum over y of the count.\n\nLet me fix x. Then, for each y in [B, C], the term is:\n\nmax(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - 1 - C + 1 )) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe term is:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → 0.\n\nElse, the count is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ncount = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 )\n\n= max( 0, min( D - C + 1, x + y -1 - C + 1 ) )\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nLet me define L = C, R = D. The z must be between L and R. The maximum z allowed is min(R, x + y -1). The number of z's is (max_z - L + 1) if max_z >= L, else 0. So:\n\nmax_z = min(R, x + y - 1)\n\nif max_z < L → 0 else (max_z - L + 1)\n\nSo for each x, and varying y, we can think of the contribution for each y.\n\nLet me think of x as fixed. Let me denote S = x. Then for each y in [B, C], we have:\n\nthe condition is S + y > z, and z >= C. Since z is at least C, we have S + y > C. If S + y <= C, then there are no z's. So for each y, we need to check if S + y > C. If not, then contribute 0. Otherwise, the count is min(D, S + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the sum over y is:\n\nsum_{y = B}^C [ if S + y > C then ( min(D, S + y -1) - C + 1 ) else 0 ]\n\nLet me think of S as fixed. Let me make a substitution for y. Let me denote y as varying from B to C.\n\nLet me first find the values of y where S + y > C. That is y > C - S. Since y is integer, y ≥ (C - S + 1). So for y in [max(B, C - S + 1), C], the term is non-zero.\n\nSo for a given x = S, the valid y's start from y_min = max(B, C - S + 1) to y_max = C.\n\nSo the sum for x is sum_{y = y_min}^{y_max} [ min(D, S + y -1) - C + 1 ].\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this sum for each x, and then sum over all x.\n\nSo how can we compute this sum efficiently for each x?\n\nLet me split into two cases based on whether S + y -1 <= D or not.\n\nFor a given y, S + y -1 is the upper bound for z. So for each y in [y_min, y_max], the value of S + y -1 can be:\n\nCase 1: S + y -1 <= D → then min(D, ...) is S + y -1. So the term becomes (S + y -1 - C + 1) = S + y - C.\n\nCase 2: S + y -1 > D → then min(D, ...) is D. So the term becomes D - C + 1.\n\nSo for a given x = S, we can find the threshold y where S + y -1 = D → y = D - S + 1.\n\nLet me call this threshold Y_threshold = D - S + 1.\n\nSo for y in [y_min, y_max], if y <= Y_threshold → case 1, else case 2.\n\nSo for each x, the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_case1 + sum_case2.\n\nLet me find for a given x, the y's that fall into case 1 and case 2.\n\nLet me compute Y_threshold = D - S + 1.\n\nThe y's in [y_min, y_max] can be divided into those ≤ Y_threshold and those > Y_threshold.\n\nLet me find the lower and upper bounds for these ranges.\n\nLet me define y_low = max(y_min, B) → but y_min is already max(B, ...), so y_low is y_min.\n\ny_high = y_max.\n\nLet me compute the split point between case1 and case2. Let me call it y_split = min(Y_threshold, y_max).\n\nIf Y_threshold < y_min → then all y are in case2.\n\nIf Y_threshold >= y_max → all y are in case1.\n\nOtherwise, the split is between y_split and y_split + 1.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute:\n\nnumber of y in case1: the count of y in [y_min, y_split] → which is y_split - y_min + 1.\n\nsum_case1 is sum_{y = y_min}^{y_split} (S + y - C) = sum_{y} (S - C + y) = (S - C) * (number_of_terms) + sum_{y} y.\n\nSimilarly, sum_case2 is (D - C + 1) * (number of terms in case2).\n\nSo for each x, the sum over y can be computed in O(1) time if we can find y_split.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to, for each x, compute y_min, y_split, and then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nSo now, the question is how to compute these values efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each x:\n\n1. Compute y_min = max(B, C - S + 1). Here S is x.\n\n   Because for y to satisfy S + y > C → y > C - S → since y is integer, y ≥ C - S + 1.\n\n   But since y must be ≥ B, y_min is max(B, C - S + 1).\n\n   However, if C - S + 1 > C (i.e., when S is very small?), but since S is x which is ≥ A ≥ 1, and C ≥ B ≥ A, but let's think. For example, if S is 1 and C is 100, then C - S + 1 = 100 - 1 + 1 = 100. So y must be ≥ 100, but y can be up to C which is 100. So y_min would be 100. So that's okay.\n\n   But if C - S + 1 is larger than C, then y_min would be larger than C, so the range [y_min, C] is empty. Thus, the sum for this x is zero.\n\n   So for each x, we need to check if y_min > C → then no contribution.\n\n   Else, proceed to compute y_split.\n\n2. Compute Y_threshold = D - S + 1.\n\n   Then, y_split is min(Y_threshold, C).\n\n   Because the maximum y is C.\n\n   So the case1 applies to y in [y_min, y_split], and case2 applies to y in [y_split + 1, C].\n\n   But only if y_split >= y_min. Otherwise, case1 is empty.\n\nSo for each x, after computing y_min, check if y_min > C → contribute 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y_split = min(Y_threshold, C).\n\nIf y_split < y_min → then case1 is empty, and all y are in case2?\n\nNo, because y_split is min(Y_threshold, C), and since y_min ≤ C (as per earlier check), but if Y_threshold is less than y_min, then y_split is Y_threshold, which is less than y_min. Hence, the case1 is empty. So all y in [y_min, C] are in case2.\n\nBut in that case, since y ≥ y_min > Y_threshold → which implies S + y -1 > D → hence case2.\n\nSo, for each x, once we have y_min and y_split, we can proceed.\n\nSo for the case where y_min ≤ C:\n\nLet me compute the number of y in case1 and case2.\n\nLet me define:\n\nstart = y_min\n\nend = C\n\nsplit_point = y_split = min(Y_threshold, C)\n\nif split_point < start → case1 is empty.\n\nelse:\n\ncase1_y_start = start\n\ncase1_y_end = split_point\n\ncase1_count = case1_y_end - case1_y_start + 1\n\nsum_case1 = (S - C) * case1_count + sum_y from case1_y_start to case1_y_end.\n\ncase2_y_start = split_point + 1\n\ncase2_y_end = end\n\ncase2_count = case2_y_end - case2_y_start + 1 → if case2_y_start <= case2_y_end else 0.\n\nsum_case2 = (D - C + 1) * case2_count.\n\nThen total for x is sum_case1 + sum_case2.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute sum_y from a to b, which can be done with formula (a + b) * (b - a + 1) // 2.\n\nSo, putting this all together, for each x, we can compute the contribution in O(1) time.\n\nNow, the total time complexity is O(B - A + 1) = O(5e5) operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   S = x\n\n   compute y_min = max(B, C - S + 1)\n\n   if y_min > C → continue (no contribution)\n\n   else:\n\n      Y_threshold = D - S + 1\n\n      split_point = min(Y_threshold, C)\n\n      start = y_min\n\n      end = C\n\n      if split_point < start:\n\n          # case1 is empty, all y are in case2\n\n          case2_count = end - start + 1\n\n          contribution = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n\n      else:\n\n          # case1: from start to split_point\n\n          case1_start = start\n\n          case1_end = split_point\n\n          case1_count = case1_end - case1_start + 1\n\n          sum_case1 = (S - C) * case1_count + (case1_start + case1_end) * case1_count // 2\n\n          # case2: from split_point + 1 to end\n\n          case2_start = split_point + 1\n\n          case2_end = end\n\n          if case2_start > case2_end:\n\n              contribution = sum_case1\n\n          else:\n\n              case2_count = case2_end - case2_start + 1\n\n              sum_case2 = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n\n              contribution = sum_case1 + sum_case2\n\n      add contribution to total\n\nSo this seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's walk through this.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\nS = 1.\n\ny_min = max(B=2, C - S + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3). So y_min = max(2,3)=3.\n\nCheck if 3 > C=3? No. So proceed.\n\nY_threshold = D - S + 1 = 4 -1 +1 = 4.\n\nsplit_point = min(4, 3) → 3.\n\nstart = 3, end = 3.\n\nsplit_point is 3 >= start (3).\n\ncase1_start = 3, case1_end = 3.\n\ncase1_count = 1.\n\nsum_case1 = (1 - 3)*1 + (3 +3)*1//2 → (-2) + 3 → 1.\n\ncase2_start = 3 + 1 = 4. case2_end = 3. So case2 is empty. contribution is 1.\n\nSo for x=1, contribution is 1.\n\nNow for x=2:\n\nS=2.\n\ny_min = max(B=2, C - S + 1 = 3 -2 +1=2). So y_min is 2.\n\nCheck if 2 <= C=3 → yes.\n\nY_threshold = D - S + 1 = 4 -2 +1 = 3.\n\nsplit_point = min(3, 3) → 3.\n\nstart is 2, end is 3.\n\nsplit_point is 3 >= start.\n\ncase1_start = 2, case1_end =3.\n\ncase1_count = 3-2+1=2.\n\nsum_case1 = (2 -3)*2 + (2+3)*2//2 → (-2) + (5 * 2 / 2) → -2 +5=3.\n\ncase2_start = 3+1=4, which is > end (3). So no case2.\n\ncontribution is 3.\n\nSo total contribution from x=2 is 3.\n\nTotal overall is 1 +3 =4. Which matches the first sample. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo for x in 1 to 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_min = max(2, C - S +1 = 2 -1 +1 =2). So y_min=2. Since C=2, so y ranges from 2 to 2.\n\nY_threshold = 5 -1 +1 =5.\n\nsplit_point = min(5, 2) → 2.\n\ncase1_start=2, case1_end=2. case1_count=1.\n\nsum_case1 = (1-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 → -1 + 2 → 1.\n\ncase2 is from 3 to 2 → nothing. So contribution is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_min = max(2, 2 -2 +1 = 1) → 2.\n\nY_threshold = 5 -2 +1 =4.\n\nsplit_point = min(4, 2) → 2.\n\nso case1 is from 2 to 2.\n\nsum_case1: (2-2)*1 + (2+2)*1/2 → 0 + 2 → 2.\n\ncase2 is from 3 to 2 → nothing. contribution is 2.\n\nTotal sum is 1 + 2 =3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nx ranges from 500000 to 500000. Only x=500000.\n\ny ranges from B=500000 to C=500000. So y=500000.\n\ny_min is max(500000, C - S +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 = 1) → 500000.\n\nY_threshold = D - S +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 =1.\n\nsplit_point = min(1, 500000) → 1. Which is less than start (500000). So case1 is empty. All y in case2.\n\ncase2_count = end - start +1 = 1 (since start and end are 500000).\n\nsum_case2 is (D - C +1) * case2_count → (500000 - 500000 +1)*1 = 1*1=1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop x in range A to B inclusive:\n\n   S = x\n\n   y_min = max(B, C - S + 1)\n\n   if y_min > C:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       Y_threshold = D - S + 1\n\n       split_point = min(Y_threshold, C)\n\n       start = y_min\n\n       end = C\n\n       if split_point < start:\n\n           # all in case2\n\n           case2_count = end - start + 1\n\n           contribution = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n\n       else:\n\n           # compute case1 and case2\n\n           case1_start = start\n\n           case1_end = split_point\n\n           case1_count = case1_end - case1_start + 1\n\n           sum_case1 = (S - C) * case1_count + (case1_start + case1_end) * case1_count // 2\n\n           case2_start = split_point + 1\n\n           case2_end = end\n\n           if case2_start > case2_end:\n\n               contribution = sum_case1\n\n           else:\n\n               case2_count = case2_end - case2_start + 1\n\n               sum_case2 = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n\n               contribution = sum_case1 + sum_case2\n\n       total += contribution\n\nFinally, print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if D - C +1 is negative? Well, since D >= C (given in input constraints), D - C +1 is at least 1 (when D=C). So that's okay.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, looping from A to B. But if A and B are up to 5e5, then this loop is O(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, loops over 5e5 elements are manageable, but we need to make sure that the code is optimized. However, given that each iteration is O(1), it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: When C - S +1 is larger than C. For example, S is very small. Like A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then x=1, y_min = max(1, 1 -1 +1) = max(1,1) =1. Which is <= C=1. Then Y_threshold = D - S +1 = 1 -1 +1 =1. split_point is min(1, 1) =1. So case1 is from 1 to 1. sum_case1 is (1-1)*1 + (1+1)*1//2 → 0 + 1 → 1. case2 is from 2 to 1 → nothing. contribution is 1. So total is 1, which is correct (triangle 1,1,1).\n\nAnother Edge Case: When x + y is exactly equal to z. But since the triangle must be non-degenerate, x + y must be > z. So if x + y = z, it's invalid. So our code correctly checks for x + y > z.\n\nAnother Edge Case: when D is very large. For example, when S + y -1 is larger than D. So the code would take min(D, ...) as D.\n\nAnother Edge Case: when y_min is B, but for some x, C - S +1 is less than B. For example, x is large enough that C - S +1 is less than B. So y_min is B.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as four integers. For each test case, process as above.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nThe first example input is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo the sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Because in the actual problem, the input is one line with four integers. However, in the sample input, the user provided three lines. But perhaps that's a formatting error. Looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D.\n\nSo the code should read a single line of input. But the sample shows three input lines. But that's probably because the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should process a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '1 2 3 4', and output is 4.\n\nBut in the note, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's a formatting error. The problem says that the input is four integers on the first line. So the code should read four integers from standard input.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's part of the problem's way of showing multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the actual input is one line with four integers. So the code should read one line, split into four integers, and compute the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three examples. However, in practice, the code should process one test case.\n\nTherefore, the code will read four integers from input, process them, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nThen compute the total as per the above logic.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nA, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    S = x\n\n    y_min = max(B, C - S + 1)\n\n    if y_min > C:\n\n        continue\n\n    Y_threshold = D - S + 1\n\n    split_point = min(Y_threshold, C)\n\n    start = y_min\n\n    end = C\n\n    if split_point < start:\n\n        case2_count = end - start + 1\n\n        contribution = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n\n    else:\n\n        # case1\n\n        case1_start = start\n\n        case1_end = split_point\n\n        case1_count = case1_end - case1_start + 1\n\n        sum_case1 = (S - C) * case1_count + (case1_start + case1_end) * case1_count // 2\n\n        # case2\n\n        case2_start = split_point + 1\n\n        case2_end = end\n\n        if case2_start > case2_end:\n\n            contribution = sum_case1\n\n        else:\n\n            case2_count = case2_end - case2_start + 1\n\n            sum_case2 = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n\n            contribution = sum_case1 + sum_case2\n\n    total += contribution\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if D - C +1 is zero? Well, since D >= C (given in the input constraints), D - C +1 is at least 1 (when D = C). So that's okay.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input: 1 2 3 4 → output 4. Which the code produces as explained.\n\nAnother sample: 1 2 2 5 → output 3. Which is correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nBut let's think about that case.\n\nx is 500000.\n\ny_min = max(B=500000, C - S +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 = 1) → 500000.\n\nWhich is <= C=500000.\n\nY_threshold = D - S +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 = 1.\n\nsplit_point = min(1, 500000) → 1.\n\nstart = 500000, end = 500000.\n\nsplit_point (1) < start (500000). So case2_count is 1.\n\ncontribution is (D - C +1) * 1 → (500000 - 500000 +1) *1 = 1 → correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2. Then x=2. y_min = max(2, 2 - 2 +1) = max(2, 1) = 2. Which is <= 2. Y_threshold is 2 -2 +1 =1. split_point is 1. Which is < start (2). So case2_count is 1. contribution is (2-2+1)*1 =1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=5. Let's see.\n\nx can be 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_min = max(3, 3 -1 +1) = max(3, 3) =3. Which is <=3.\n\nY_threshold = 5 -1 +1 =5. split_point = min(5, 3) =3. So case1_start=3, case1_end=3. case1_count=1. sum_case1 = (1-3)*1 + (3+3)*1//2 → -2 + 3 = 1. case2 is split_point +1 =4, which is > end (3). contribution is 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_min = max(3, 3 -2 +1) = max(3, 2) →3. Which is <=3.\n\nY_threshold =5-2+1=4. split_point is min(4,3) →3. case1_start=3, case1_end=3. sum_case1 = (2-3)*1 + (3+3)*1//2 →-1 +3 =2. case2 is 4>3. contribution 2.\n\nFor x=3:\n\ny_min = max(3, 3-3+1=1) →3. Y_threshold=5-3+1=3. split_point is 3. case1_start=3, case1_end=3. sum_case1 = (3-3)*1 + (3+3)*1//2 →0 +3=3. contribution is 3.\n\nTotal is 1+2+3=6.\n\nWhat are the valid triangles?\n\nPossible x, y, z:\n\nx can be 1, 2, 3. y is 3. z ranges from 3 to 5. But must satisfy x + y > z.\n\nFor x=1, y=3 → z must be < 1+3=4. So z can be 3. So for z=3: 1+3>3 → yes. So count 1.\n\nFor x=2, y=3 → z < 5. So z can be 3,4. So count 2.\n\nFor x=3, y=3 → z < 6. So z can be 3,4,5. So count 3. Total 1+2+3=6. Which matches. So code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we focus on ensuring $x + y > z$ since $x \\leq y \\leq z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ must satisfy $A \\leq x \\leq B$, $B \\leq y \\leq C$, and $C \\leq z \\leq D$. For each valid pair $(x, y)$, determine the valid range of $z$ such that $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating over all possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, which would be computationally expensive, we use mathematical insights to compute valid ranges for $z$ efficiently.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each $x$, determine the minimum $y$ such that $x + y > C$. Then, compute the valid range of $z$ values for each valid $(x, y)$ pair using arithmetic progression formulas to avoid nested loops.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n    total = 0\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        S = x\n        y_min = max(B, C - S + 1)\n        if y_min > C:\n            continue\n        Y_threshold = D - S + 1\n        split_point = min(Y_threshold, C)\n        start = y_min\n        end = C\n        if split_point < start:\n            case2_count = end - start + 1\n            contribution = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n        else:\n            # case1\n            case1_start = start\n            case1_end = split_point\n            case1_count = case1_end - case1_start + 1\n            sum_case1 = (S - C) * case1_count + (case1_start + case1_end) * case1_count // 2\n            # case2\n            case2_start = split_point + 1\n            case2_end = end\n            if case2_start > case2_end:\n                contribution = sum_case1\n            else:\n                case2_count = case2_end - case2_start + 1\n                sum_case2 = (D - C + 1) * case2_count\n                contribution = sum_case1 + sum_case2\n        total += contribution\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are read from standard input.\n2. **Iterating Over $x$**: For each $x$ in the range $[A, B]$, calculate the minimum $y$ value that can form a valid triangle with $x$.\n3. **Determining Valid $z$ Range**: For each valid $y$, compute the threshold $z$ value such that $x + y > z$. This is done by splitting the range into two parts where $z$ values either fall within the range determined by $x + y$ or the maximum $D$.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Efficiently compute the contributions of valid $z$ values using arithmetic progression formulas to avoid nested loops, ensuring the solution runs efficiently even for large input sizes.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently count valid triangles without explicitly iterating through all possible combinations, making it feasible for large input constraints.",
