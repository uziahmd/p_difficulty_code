Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. Hmm. So, the key here is to find a bipartite matching where each pair's line segments don't cross each other. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The input gives R spaceships and B bases. Since it's a perfect matching, R must equal B. Wait, the first line says R and B. Oh right, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so R must equal B. But the input might have R not equal to B? Wait, the problem says that the input is given with R and B. But the note says that in the example, the first input has 3 and 3. So perhaps the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If they are not equal, then immediately output No. Because a perfect matching requires that R = B. Oh right, because in a perfect matching, every element is matched. So if R != B, then it's impossible. So that's the first check.\n\nSo, first step: check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming R = B. Then, we need to find a perfect matching between the two sets (spaceships and bases) such that no two edges (lines) cross each other.\n\nBut how do we check for that?\n\nThe problem is similar to finding a non-crossing matching. So, for each possible perfect matching, we need to check if all pairs of edges are non-crossing. However, since R and B can be up to 10, the total number of possible perfect matchings is (R)! which for 10 is 3.6 million. Wait, 10! is 3,628,800. For each of these possibilities, we need to check all pairs of edges to see if they cross. But for 10 elements, each matching has 10 edges. Checking all pairs for each matching would be O( (n^2) ) per matching. For n=10, that's 10*10=100 per matching. So total operations would be around 3.6e8. Which might be manageable for small n like 10, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut considering that for n=10, even 3.6e8 operations could be slow in Python. However, perhaps with optimizations, it's manageable. Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to model this as a bipartite graph and find a matching that satisfies the non-crossing condition.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the matching must be such that when you connect each spaceship to its base, none of the lines cross. How can we model this?\n\nOne approach is to generate all possible perfect matchings and check each for crossing lines. If any of them passes, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut generating all possible matchings may be feasible for small n.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\n- Else, generate all possible perfect matchings between the two sets.\n\n- For each matching, check if all pairs of edges are non-crossing.\n\n- If any matching satisfies this, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to generating all permutations of the bases (assuming that the spaceships are fixed in some order, but since the matching is between the two sets, perhaps we can think of it as permutations of the bases for each spaceship).\n\nWait, for example, if there are R spaceships and R bases, then a perfect matching is a permutation of the bases. So for each spaceship i, assign it to base p[i], where p is a permutation of 0..R-1. Then, for each permutation, check if all the line segments between spaceship i and base p[i] are non-crossing.\n\nSo, the key is to generate all permutations of the bases, and for each, check for crossings.\n\nNow, how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWe need to determine if two line segments (from spaceship A to base X) and (spaceship B to base Y) intersect. But since all points are in general position (no three points are colinear), then two line segments can either cross or not. Also, the problem says that the paths are straight lines, and they should not intersect. So, even if they share an endpoint, but since each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, then two line segments cannot share an endpoint. So, for two different pairs (A,X) and (B,Y), their line segments can't share endpoints. Therefore, the only possibility is that the line segments cross each other in their interiors.\n\nSo, the problem is to check whether any two line segments in the matching cross each other.\n\nSo, the algorithm for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect is needed.\n\nHow to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nWell, there's a standard computational geometry approach for this. The idea is to use the orientation method.\n\nFirst, check if the two line segments AB and CD intersect by checking if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and similarly for (C, D, A) and (C, D, B). Also, handle the cases where points are colinear. However, the problem statement says that no three points are colinear, so this case can't happen. So, in our case, two line segments AB and CD will either cross or not, and if they do, they do so at a single point (not an endpoint). \n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, then for two line segments AB and CD, if they cross, then the intersection point is not any of the four points. So, for our problem, we can use the standard method to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nSo, the steps for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect:\n\nCheck if the points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and points A and B are on opposite sides of CD. If both conditions are true, then the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThe orientation function can be used. The orientation of three points p, q, r is determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. The value is positive if the turn from pq to pr is counterclockwise, negative if clockwise, and zero if colinear.\n\nSo, for points p1, p2, p3, the orientation can be computed as:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut since the problem says no three points are colinear, we can ignore the zero case here.\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD, the segments intersect if:\n\norientation(A,B,C) != orientation(A,B,D) and orientation(C,D,A) != orientation(C,D,B)\n\nSo, that's the condition.\n\nSo, in code, for each pair of edges in the matching, check if they cross using this method.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the bases (assuming that the spaceships are ordered, and each is assigned to the base in the permutation), we need to check all pairs of edges for crossing.\n\nBut for a given permutation, how many pairs do we need to check? For R=10, there are 10 edges, and the number of pairs is 10*9/2 = 45. For each pair, check if they cross.\n\nIf any pair crosses, then this permutation is invalid. Else, it's valid.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of the bases (since the spaceships are fixed in their positions), check if all pairs of edges in the permutation are non-crossing.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the problem is generating all permutations of the bases. For R=10, that's 10! = 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, checking 45 pairs, each pair requiring a few calculations. In Python, that's manageable for small R (up to 10). Let's see:\n\nFor 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks. That's 162 million checks. Each check involves computing the orientation for four points. But given that the numbers are small, and the code is optimized, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nBut how to represent the points? Let's say that the spaceships are stored as a list, and the bases are stored as another list. For a permutation p (which is a list where p[i] is the index of the base assigned to spaceship i), then for each i, the spaceship at index i is connected to base p[i].\n\nWait, but the permutation is over the bases. So, for example, if there are R spaceships and R bases, then the permutation is of length R. So, for each spaceship (say, index 0 to R-1), we assign them to base p[0], p[1], etc.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the bases, we can generate all edges (spaceship i to base p[i]) and check for crossings between all pairs of edges.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships, then B bases.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships). For each permutation, check if all pairs of edges are non-crossing.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the bases. So, for example, if the bases are stored as a list called bases, then a permutation would be a reordering of the indices of the bases. For example, if the bases are [b0, b1, b2], then a permutation could be [1, 0, 2], meaning that spaceship 0 is assigned to base 1, spaceship 1 to base 0, spaceship 2 to base 2.\n\nSo, in code, for the bases list, we can generate all permutations of the indices 0..R-1 (since R=B). For each permutation, we can check the edges.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the bases? Well, using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for example, if the bases are stored as a list, then for each permutation in itertools.permutations(range(B)), which would be permutations of the indices of the bases.\n\nYes. So, for each permutation in permutations(range(B)), we can create the assignment.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges. For each pair of edges (i,j) and (k,l), check if they cross.\n\nWait, but for a permutation, the edges are (spaceship 0, base p[0]), (spaceship 1, base p[1]), etc. So, for each pair of edges (i, j) and (k, l), where i < k, check if the line segments between spaceship i and base p[i], and spaceship k and base p[k] cross.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the code would loop through all pairs of edges and check if any pair crosses.\n\nNow, the code for checking if two line segments cross.\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # a1 and a2 are endpoints of segment A, b1 and b2 endpoints of segment B.\n    # returns True if they intersect.\n    # using the orientation method.\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    # Check if the segments straddle each other.\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut what about the case where one of the segments is entirely contained within the other? Well, since no three points are colinear, that can't happen. Because if two segments are colinear, then they would have three points on the same line. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, which is handled by the above condition.\n\nWait, but suppose that two segments share an endpoint. But in our case, since each spaceship is connected to exactly one base, and each base is connected to exactly one spaceship, then two edges can't share an endpoint. Because if two edges are (spaceship i -> base x) and (spaceship j -> base x), then that would mean that base x is assigned to two spaceships. Which is not allowed in a perfect matching. So, in our permutations, each base is assigned exactly once. So, the endpoints of the edges are unique. Thus, two edges can't share an endpoint. Therefore, the segments can't share endpoints, so the only possible way they can intersect is if they cross each other in their interiors.\n\nTherefore, the helper function above is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments cross is as described.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, the orientation function.\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if counter-clockwise, 2 if clockwise, 0 if colinear.\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut since the problem says no three points are colinear, in our code, we can safely assume that val is not zero. However, in practice, when checking for the segments, the code may have to handle that. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, the code can ignore that case.\n\nSo, the helper function segments_intersect can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if segments a1a2 and b1b2 intersect.\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    # If the orientations are different for both segments, they intersect.\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges. So, for each permutation p, we generate all pairs (i, j) where i < j, and check if the segment between spaceship i and base p[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base p[j]. If any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for a given permutation, the code would be:\n\nvalid = True\nfor i in range(R):\n    for j in range(i+1, R):\n        a1 = spaceships[i]\n        a2 = bases[p[i]]\n        b1 = spaceships[j]\n        b2 = bases[p[j]]\n        if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        break\nif valid:\n    return True\n\nSo, if any permutation passes this check, then output 'Yes'.\n\nNow, considering that for R=10, 10! is 3.6 million permutations, and for each permutation, checking 45 pairs, each with 4 orientation checks. How long would this take in Python?\n\nWell, for small R (like up to 10), this is manageable. But for R=10, 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks, that's 162 million checks. Each check involves 4 orientation computations. But in Python, even with that, perhaps it's acceptable for the problem's constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, if the problem is to find a non-crossing matching, perhaps there's a way to model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross with others. But since the matching is dependent on the entire set of edges, not just individual ones, it's unclear. For example, adding an edge might block others. So, the problem is similar to finding a perfect matching in a graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross with any other edges in the matching. But since the allowed edges depend on the entire matching, it's hard to model this as a standard graph problem.\n\nThus, the brute-force approach seems the only way here.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the first permutation is [0,1,2], meaning spaceship 0 connects to base 0, spaceship 1 connects to base 1, spaceship 2 connects to base 2.\n\nCheck for intersections between each pair.\n\nBetween (0,0) and (-2,1) and (2,0) and (0,3). Do these cross?\n\nCompute the orientations.\n\nLet me compute that manually. But perhaps the code would handle it.\n\nIn any case, according to the sample, this is a valid matching.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n2 1\n\nWait, no, the second input in the example is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1', ...]\n\nWait, the first input in the example is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the first input is for the first example. The second input is for the second example. The second example has R=2 and B=1. Since R != B, the answer is 'No', which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code would first check if R equals B. If not, output 'No'.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print 'No'.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R spaceships (each as a tuple of integers).\n\nRead B bases (each as a tuple of integers).\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases (since R=B).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nCheck all pairs of edges for crossing.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output 'Yes'.\n\nElse, output 'No'.\n\nNow, in Python, itertools.permutations can generate all permutations of the bases' indices. For example, for R=3, permutations(range(3)) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases indices\n    for perm in permutations( range(B) ):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Check if the segment between spaceships[i] and bases[perm[i]] intersects with segment between spaceships[j] and bases[perm[j]]\n                a1 = spaceships[i]\n                a2 = bases[perm[i]]\n                b1 = spaceships[j]\n                b2 = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, for perm in permutations(range(B)), but since R = B, that's correct. For example, for R=3, B=3, permutations(range(3)) generates all possible orderings of the bases.\n\nBut in the code, the permutation is of the bases indices. So, for each spaceship i, it's connected to bases[perm[i]].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, spaceships = [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases = [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is [0,1,2], which would assign:\n\nspaceship 0 to base 0: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nspaceship 1 to base 1: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nspaceship 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck if any of these pairs cross.\n\nCheck between first and second edges: (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nFor segment A: (0,0) to (-2,1). Points are A1=(0,0), A2=(-2,1). Check for B1=(2,0) and B2=(0,3).\n\nOrientation of A1, A2, B1: (A1 to A2 vector is (-2,1). B1 is (2,0). So compute:\n\nval = ( (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) ) - ( (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) )\n\nWait, no. The orientation function is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\nSo p is A1 (0,0), q is A2 (-2,1), r is B1 (2,0).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(0 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) → (-2)(0) - (1)(2) = 0 - 2 = -2 → which is negative. So orientation returns 2 (clockwise).\n\nThen, orientation of A1, A2, B2 (0,3):\n\np = (0,0), q = (-2,1), r = (0,3).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (3 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (0 - 0) → (-2)*3 - 1*0 → -6 - 0 = -6 → negative → orientation 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same (both 2), so the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So segments don't cross.\n\nThen check between first and third edges. Let's see.\n\nSegment A: (0,0) to (-2,1). Segment B: (3,1) to (2,2). Are they crossing?\n\nCheck orientations.\n\nFor segment A, check B1 (3,1) and B2 (2,2). \n\nOrientation of A1, A2, B1: same as before, which was 2. Orientation of A1, A2, B2?\n\np=(0,0), q=(-2,1), r=(2,2).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(2 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) → (-2)(2) - 1*(2) = -4 -2 = -6 → orientation 2. So same as before. So o1 and o2 are same. So no crossing.\n\nSimilarly, between second and third edges: (2,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCheck orientations. For segment B (second edge) between (2,0) and (0,3), check points (3,1) and (2,2). \n\nOrientation of B1 (2,0), B2 (0,3), C1 (3,1):\n\nval = (0-2)*(1 - 0) - (3-0)*(3-2) → (-2)(1) - 3*(1) = -2 -3 = -5 → negative → orientation 2.\n\nOrientation of B1, B2, C2 (2,2):\n\nval = (0-2)*(2 - 0) - (3-0)*(2 - 2) → (-2)(2) - 3*(0) = -4 -0 = -4 → orientation 2. So same again. So no crossing.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid. So the code would find it and output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother example: when R=2, B=1. Then R != B, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when R=1 and B=1? Then, there is only one possible permutation. Check if there are any pairs of edges (there are none), so it's valid. Output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Suppose the spaceships are (0,0) and (1,1). Bases are (0,1) and (1,0). So possible permutations are [0,1] and [1,0].\n\nFor [0,1], the edges are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines, which don't cross. So valid.\n\nFor [1,0], edges are (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These are horizontal lines, which don't cross. So valid. So output is 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case where the two edges cross. For example, spaceships at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (1,1) and (3,3). Then, the only possible permutations are [0,1] and [1,0]. For [0,1], the edges are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3). These are colinear, but since the problem says no three points are colinear. Wait, but in this case, the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) are colinear. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So this input would not be allowed. So the code doesn't have to handle that case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three are colinear. So the code can assume that.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Spaceships are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (1,2), (1,0). So possible permutations:\n\npermutation [0,1]: connect (0,0) to (1,2), and (2,2) to (1,0). Do these cross?\n\nLet me check. The line from (0,0) to (1,2) and from (2,2) to (1,0). These two lines cross at (1,1). So the segments would cross. So this permutation is invalid.\n\nPermutation [1,0]: connect (0,0) to (1,0), and (2,2) to (1,2). These are two lines that don't cross. So this permutation is valid. So the code should output 'Yes'.\n\nIn this case, the code would generate both permutations and find that one of them is valid.\n\nSo, the code would work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code uses permutations(range(B)), but when R=B. So, for example, when R=3, B=3, the permutations are of the 3 bases. So, the code is correct.\n\n- The code reads input correctly. Let me check the input reading part. The code reads R and B, then reads R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases. That's correct.\n\nNow, the code may have to process multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But looking at the sample input, the first example input is given as a list of lines. However, the code reads from stdin, which for the problem is probably given as a single input. But the code is written for a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows two examples. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line. But in the code, the code is written to read from stdin. So, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's part of the example. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line. So, the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is a list of lines, which is for the first test case. The second is for the second test case. However, the code as written reads all the lines once, and processes a single test case. So, perhaps the code is written for a single test case. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So, the code is correct.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the code may have multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B...\n\nSo, the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's part of the example for the user to see. For example, the first example's input is given as a list of lines, and the output is 'Yes', and the second example's input is another list, output 'No'. But the actual code is supposed to process one test case. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code as written should handle the problem correctly.\n\nNow, testing for R=1, B=1. The code will generate one permutation. Then check for pairs (i=0, j starts from 1, which is out of range. So the loop for i in range(R) and j in i+1 ... will not run. Thus, valid remains True, and the code outputs 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2, with two permutations. One of them has crossing edges, the other not. The code would find the valid one and output 'Yes'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base, with the additional constraint that no two connecting paths intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: If R equals B, generate all possible permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of connecting paths (segments) intersect. This is done using a geometric method involving orientation checks to determine if two line segments intersect.\n4. **Determine Validity**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting paths, output \"Yes\". If none do, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    # Generate all permutations of the bases indices\n    for perm in permutations(range(B)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a1 = spaceships[i]\n                a2 = bases[perm[i]]\n                b1 = spaceships[j]\n                b2 = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Orientation Check**: The `orientation` function calculates the orientation of three points to determine if they are clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear. This helps in determining if two line segments intersect.\n- **Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation check to determine if two line segments intersect by verifying if their endpoints straddle each other.\n- **Permutations and Validation**: By generating all permutations of base assignments and checking each permutation for intersecting paths, the solution efficiently explores all possible valid configurations. If any configuration is found without intersections, the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it is \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we check all possible assignments while leveraging geometric properties to validate non-intersecting paths efficiently.",
