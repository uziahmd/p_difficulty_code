    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. The task is to choose an interval [l, r], reverse that part of the array, and then compute the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new array.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the array is made up of only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is essentially the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are in non-decreasing order. But since reversing a subarray can change the order, I need to find which reversal would help maximize this.\n\nBut considering all possible intervals [l, r] and checking each possibility would be O(n^2) possibilities. For each of these, we'd have to compute the LNDS, which for a general array is O(n^2) time. However, since n can be up to 2000, O(n^4) would be way too slow. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since the array only has 1s and 2s, the LNDS is just the total number of elements minus the number of inversions (places where a 2 comes before a 1). Wait, no. Because the LNDS can be calculated as the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the array is only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Or perhaps it's the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not right. Wait no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4, which is the entire array. But if the array is [2,1], the LNDS is 1. So the LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is equal to the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s? No, that's not correct. Because if you have 1s and 2s arranged in a way that they are non-decreasing, then the LNDS is the entire array. For example, if the array is [1,1,2,2], the LNDS is 4. But if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 as well. So the LNDS is not necessarily the count of 1s or 2s. Wait, but the maximum possible LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the total number of elements, because you can arrange them in non-decreasing order. But when you reverse a subarray, you might get a better arrangement.\n\nWait, the original array may not be non-decreasing, but after reversing a subarray, it could become non-decreasing. The problem is to find the maximum possible LNDS after any such reversal.\n\nBut how can I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: the LNDS of the array after reversal is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. Since the array is only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be found by counting the number of 1s and 2s in a way that allows them to be non-decreasing. For example, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Or perhaps, the LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Let's take an example: [1,2,1,2]. The LNDS is 4. The count of 1s is 2, 2s is 2. So the maximum is 2, but the LNDS is 4. So that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, the LNDS for an array of 1s and 2s is the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because, the maximum non-decreasing sequence can be formed by taking all 1s first and then all 2s. So, the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are not before any 1. Or perhaps the maximum possible is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not correct either.\n\nAlternatively, for any array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of inversions, where an inversion is a 2 followed by a 1. Because, each inversion is a place where the sequence decreases. So, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of inversions. But how?\n\nWait, for example, in [2,1], there is one inversion. The LNDS is 1, which is 2-1=1. In [1,2,1,2], the number of inversions is 1 (the 2 followed by 1 at positions 2-3). The total length is 4. So 4 - 1 = 3, but the actual LNDS is 4. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Since the array is only 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, plus the number of transitions between 1s and 2s? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Because once you have all the 1s first, then all the 2s. So for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the last 1 is at position 3. The number of 2s after that is 1. So total LNDS is 2 (number of 1s) + 1 (number of 2s after last 1) = 3. But the actual LNDS is 4, which is longer. So this approach is also wrong.\n\nWait, but in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4. How? Because the entire array is 1,2,1,2. The subsequence 1,2,2 is length 3, but there's a longer one. Wait, no. Wait, the subsequence can be 1 (position 1), 2 (position 2), 2 (position 4). That's length 3. Or maybe 1 (position 1), 1 (position 3), 2 (position 4). Also length 3. But the actual longest is 3? But the example given in the problem says that after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has a LNDS of 4. So the original array must have a LNDS of 3. So why does the example say that after reversing, the LNDS becomes 4. Which makes sense. So for the original array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3. But how?\n\nWait, let me think again. The LNDS is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. For the original array [1,2,1,2], the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be 1, 2, 2 (positions 1,2,4) or 1,1,2 (positions 1,3,4), etc. So the maximum is 3. But the example says that after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives a LNDS of 4. So that's the maximum possible. Therefore, the problem is to find the best reversal that maximizes this value.\n\nSo the key is to find which reversal of a subarray will result in the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nNow, how to model this. Since the array is only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be determined based on the count of 1s and 2s and their arrangement. Let's think about what happens when you reverse a subarray [l, r].\n\nReversing a subarray can affect the arrangement of 1s and 2s. For example, if the subarray has some 1s and 2s, reversing it might reduce the number of inversions (where 2 comes before 1) in the entire array.\n\nBut how can we compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider that the maximum LNDS after reversal is equal to the total number of elements minus the minimum number of inversions that can be achieved by reversing any subarray. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, think about the original array's LNDS. Then, find the best reversal that can increase the LNDS. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Since the array has only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Or wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Suppose there are x 1s and y 2s. The maximum possible LNDS is x + y if the array is non-decreasing. If the array is not, then the LNDS would be the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s plus the number of transitions between 1 and 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such pair is an inversion that breaks the non-decreasing sequence. But again, this seems like a possible approach.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. Take the original array [1,2,1,2]. The number of inversions (2 followed by 1) is 1 (the 2 at position 2 followed by 1 at position 3). The total elements is 4. So according to this hypothesis, the LNDS would be 4 - 1 = 3, which matches our previous analysis. If we reverse [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2]. There are zero inversions, so LNDS is 4 - 0 = 4. Which matches the example. Another example: [2,1]. The number of inversions is 1. So 2 -1 = 1. Correct. Another example: [1,1,2,2]. Number of inversions is 0. LNDS is 4. Correct. Another example: [2,2,1,1]. The number of inversions is 2 (each 2 is followed by a 1). So 4-2=2. But the LNDS is 2 (the two 2s or two 1s). Correct. So this seems to hold.\n\nSo the LNDS for the array is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of inversions (where a 2 is immediately followed by a 1). Wait, no. Because the number of inversions here refers to the count of pairs (i, j) where i < j and a_i = 2, a_j = 1. Because in that case, the sequence is decreasing. So the total number of such inversions would be the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. But in the array [1,2,1,2], there is one inversion (positions 2 and 3). But the LNDS is 3. So the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the maximum possible (total elements - number of inversions after reversal), then that would give me the maximum LNDS.\n\nBut how to compute the number of inversions after reversing any subarray [l, r]?\n\nThe original number of inversions is some value. Reversing a subarray [l, r] can change the number of inversions in three parts:\n\n1. The inversions inside the subarray [l, r].\n2. The inversions between elements inside the subarray and elements outside.\n3. The inversions between elements outside the subarray.\n\nBut when we reverse the subarray, the inversions inside the subarray will change. Also, the inversions between the subarray and the rest of the array will change.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps we can compute the original number of inversions, and then find the maximum possible decrease in the number of inversions by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut even that seems challenging.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the array is made up of only 1s and 2s, the number of inversions can be calculated as the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j, a_i = 2, a_j = 1.\n\nLet me denote the original number of inversions as inv. Then, when we reverse a subarray [l, r], the new number of inversions will be inv - delta + delta', where delta is the number of inversions removed by reversing, and delta' is the number of inversions added by reversing.\n\nBut how to compute delta and delta'?\n\nAlternatively, for any subarray [l, r], when reversed, the number of inversions inside [l, r] changes. Also, the inversions between the subarray and the elements before l, and between the subarray and elements after r.\n\nBut this seems complex. However, considering that the array is made of only 1s and 2s, perhaps there's a way to compute the effect of reversing a subarray [l, r] on the total number of inversions.\n\nLet me think about the original inversions. Let me denote the original array as A.\n\nFor any subarray [l, r], when reversed, the elements in positions l to r become A'[l..r] = reverse(A[l..r]).\n\nThe change in the total number of inversions can be broken down into:\n\n- The inversions that were entirely within [l, r] (call this C).\n- The inversions between elements in [l, r] and elements before l (call this D).\n- The inversions between elements in [l, r] and elements after r (call this E).\n- The inversions that are entirely outside [l, r] (these remain unchanged).\n\nSo when we reverse the subarray, the number of inversions in the entire array becomes:\n\ninv_total_new = inv_total_original - C - D - E + C' + D' + E'\n\nWhere C' is the number of inversions in the reversed subarray, D' is the number of inversions between the reversed subarray and elements before l, and E' is the number of inversions between the reversed subarray and elements after r.\n\nBut calculating this for all possible [l, r] seems computationally intensive. However, perhaps there's a way to precompute some values.\n\nBut with n up to 2000, O(n^2) algorithms are acceptable. Let's think about how to compute for each possible [l, r], the change in inversions.\n\nFirst, let's precompute the original number of inversions. Then, for each possible [l, r], compute how reversing that subarray affects the total number of inversions.\n\nBut how to compute C, D, E, C', D', E'?\n\nLet me think about C. The original number of inversions within [l, r] is the number of pairs (i, j) in [l, r], i < j, a_i = 2, a_j = 1.\n\nWhen we reverse the subarray, the new number of inversions within [l, r] is the number of pairs (i, j) in [l, r], i < j, a'_i = 2, a'_j = 1. But since the subarray is reversed, a'_i = a_{r - (i - l)}. So for the reversed subarray, the number of inversions is the same as the original number of inversions in the reversed subarray. Wait, no. Let me think: the original subarray has some number of inversions. When reversed, the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of inversions that were originally in the subarray, but reversed. For example, if the original subarray had x inversions, then reversing it would create (total possible pairs in the subarray) - x inversions? No, that's not correct. For example, consider a subarray [2, 1]. Original inversions is 1. Reversed to [1, 2], which has 0 inversions. The total possible pairs is 1. So original inversions is 1, reversed has 0. So the new number of inversions is (total_pairs - original_inversions_in_subarray) - something? Not sure.\n\nWait, the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) in the original subarray where i > j and a_i = 2 and a_j = 1. Because when reversed, the positions are swapped. So for each pair (i, j) in the original subarray where i < j and a_i = 2 and a_j = 1, when reversed, they become positions (r - j + l, r - i + l) in the reversed subarray. Now, if i < j, then in the reversed subarray, the new positions would be j' = r - j + l, i' = r - i + l. Since i < j, then r - i + l > r - j + l. So the pair (i', j') in the reversed subarray is (new_i, new_j) where new_i > new_j. So the original pair (i,j) contributes to an inversion in the original subarray, and in the reversed subarray, the same pair would be a non-inversion (since in the reversed subarray, new_i > new_j, but the original a_i was 2 and a_j was 1. After reversal, the new element at new_i is a_j (which is 1) and new_j is a_i (which is 2). So in the reversed subarray, the pair (new_i, new_j) is 1 followed by 2, which is not an inversion. Thus, the original inversion (i,j) in the subarray becomes a non-inversion in the reversed subarray. Similarly, any pair in the original subarray that was not an inversion (i.e., a_i <= a_j) would become a pair in the reversed subarray that may be an inversion or not.\n\nBut how to compute the number of inversions in the reversed subarray? Well, the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) in the original subarray where i > j and a_i = 2 and a_j = 1. Because when reversed, those pairs would be in positions where i < j in the reversed subarray, but with a_i = 2 and a_j = 1, leading to an inversion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of inversions in the original subarray. No, that's not the case. For example, the original subarray [2,1] has 1 inversion. Reversed, it becomes [1,2], which has 0 inversions. So the number of inversions is not preserved. But in another example, if the subarray is [1,2], which has 0 inversions, reversed to [2,1], which has 1 inversion. So the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of non-inversions in the original subarray minus something? Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute for a given subarray [l, r], the number of inversions in the original and the number after reversal. However, for each subarray, this could be O(n^2) time, which would be O(n^4) overall. Which is not feasible for n=2000.\n\nThis suggests that this approach may not be efficient enough.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the problem is to find the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal, and since the LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is equal to total elements minus the number of inversions (as per earlier hypothesis), then the problem reduces to finding the reversal that minimizes the number of inversions.\n\nSo the goal is to find the reversal that reduces the number of inversions as much as possible. Then, the maximum LNDS is total elements minus the minimum possible number of inversions after reversal.\n\nSo how can we find the minimal number of inversions possible after reversing any subarray?\n\nBut how to compute this minimal number of inversions?\n\nLet me think about how reversing a subarray affects the inversions.\n\nThe total inversions in the array can be split into:\n\n- Inversions entirely within [l, r].\n- Inversions between elements inside [l, r] and elements before l.\n- Inversions between elements inside [l, r] and elements after r.\n- Inversions entirely outside [l, r].\n\nReversing [l, r] affects the first three categories.\n\nLet me think about the inversions between elements inside [l, r] and elements outside. For example, for elements before l: each element x before l and element y in [l, r]. If x is 2 and y is 1, then this is an inversion. After reversing [l, r], the elements in [l, r] are reversed. So for each x before l and each y in [l, r], the contribution to the inversion count depends on whether x is 2 and y is 1. However, after reversing, the elements in [l, r] are still the same elements, just reversed. So for x before l and y in [l, r], the pair (x, y) is an inversion if x is 2 and y is 1. After reversal, the y's are the same elements, so the number of such pairs remains the same. So the inversions between elements before l and elements in [l, r] are unchanged. Similarly for elements after r and elements in [l, r]. Wait, that's interesting. Because reversing the subarray [l, r] doesn't change the elements in the subarray, just their order. Therefore, the number of inversions between elements inside [l, r] and elements outside [l, r] remains the same. Only the inversions within the subarray [l, r] are affected.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose there is an element x before l, and an element y in [l, r]. If x is 2 and y is 1, this is an inversion. After reversing [l, r], the y's are still the same elements. So x is still before l, and the y's are still in [l, r]. So the pair (x, y) is still an inversion. So the number of such inversions remains the same. Similarly, for elements after r and elements in [l, r], the number of inversions is the same. Therefore, the only change comes from the inversions within the subarray [l, r].\n\nAh! So that simplifies things. The number of inversions in the entire array after reversing [l, r] is equal to:\n\noriginal_inversions - original_inversions_in_subarray + new_inversions_in_subarray.\n\nBecause the other parts (inversions between the subarray and outside) remain the same.\n\nSo the problem now reduces to: find the subarray [l, r] such that (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray) is maximized. Because this difference is the amount by which the total inversions decrease. So the larger this difference, the smaller the total inversions after reversal, leading to a larger LNDS.\n\nThus, the maximum possible LNDS is original_total_inversions - (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray) + ... ?\n\nWait, original_total_inversions = inv_total.\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the new_total_inversions = inv_total - original_inversions_in_subarray + new_inversions_in_subarray.\n\nSo the change is (new_total_inversions - inv_total) = (new_inversions_in_subarray - original_inversions_in_subarray).\n\nTo minimize the new_total_inversions, we want to maximize (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray). Because that would subtract the most from the original inv_total.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum value of (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray) over all possible [l, r], and then subtract that from the original_total_inversions to get the minimal possible new_total_inversions. Then, the maximum LNDS is n - new_total_inversions.\n\nSo how do we compute original_inversions_in_subarray and new_inversions_in_subarray for a given [l, r]?\n\noriginal_inversions_in_subarray is the number of pairs (i, j) in [l, r], i < j, a_i = 2, a_j = 1.\n\nnew_inversions_in_subarray is the number of such pairs in the reversed subarray. Which is the same as the number of pairs (i, j) in the original subarray, i > j, a_i = 2, a_j = 1. Because when reversed, the positions are swapped. So for each pair (i, j) in the original subarray where i < j and a_i = 2, a_j = 1, this contributes to original_inversions_in_subarray. When reversed, this pair becomes (j', i') where j' is the new position of j, and i' is the new position of i. Since i < j, j' < i' in the reversed subarray. So the pair (j', i') is a pair where i' > j', and the elements are a_j and a_i. So if a_j is 1 and a_i is 2, then this is an inversion in the reversed subarray. So for each such original pair, it contributes to the new_inversions_in_subarray.\n\nBut what about other pairs? For example, pairs where i < j and a_i = 1, a_j = 1. These are not inversions in the original subarray, but after reversing, they are still not inversions. Similarly for other combinations.\n\nSo the new_inversions_in_subarray is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) in the original subarray where i > j and a_i = 2 and a_j = 1. Which is the same as the number of inversions in the original subarray, but counted in reverse.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, note that the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) in the original subarray where i < j and a_i = 1 and a_j = 2. Because when reversed, these pairs would become j' < i' with a_j' = 1 and a_i' = 2, which is not an inversion. Wait, no. This seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, think of the original subarray as a sequence S. The number of inversions in S is C. When reversed, the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of inversions in the reversed sequence. How does that relate to the original number of inversions?\n\nIn general, for any sequence, the number of inversions in the reversed sequence is equal to the total number of pairs (i, j) in the original sequence where i < j and a_i > a_j, which is the same as the original number of inversions. Wait, no. Because when you reverse the sequence, the number of inversions can be different. For example, [2, 1] has one inversion. Reversed to [1, 2], which has zero inversions. The total number of pairs is 1. The original number of inversions is 1. The reversed has 0. So the number of inversions in the reversed sequence is equal to (total_pairs_in_subarray - original_inversions_in_subarray) - something?\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of inversions in the reversed subarray. Let me denote the original subarray as S, and its reversed version as S'. The number of inversions in S' is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) in S' where i < j and S'[i] > S'[j]. But since S' is the reversed S, this is equivalent to the number of pairs (i, j) in S where i > j and S[i] > S[j]. Because for S', the element at position k is S[r - k + l].\n\nSo for S', the pair (k, m) where k < m corresponds to (i, j) in S where i = r - m + l, j = r - k + l. Since k < m, then i = r - m + l > r - k + l = j. So i > j. So the condition S'[k] > S'[m] is equivalent to S[i] > S[j], where i > j. Therefore, the number of inversions in S' is the number of pairs (i, j) in S where i > j and S[i] > S[j].\n\nBut for our case, since S is made of 1s and 2s, the condition S[i] > S[j] is equivalent to S[i] = 2 and S[j] = 1.\n\nSo the number of inversions in S' is the number of pairs (i, j) in the original subarray where i > j, S[i] = 2, S[j] = 1.\n\nSo for the original subarray, the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of such pairs.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me denote for a subarray [l, r], the number of 2s in the subarray as c2, and the number of 1s as c1. Then, the total number of pairs in the subarray is (c1 + c2) * (c1 + c2 - 1) / 2. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the number of pairs (i, j) where i > j, S[i] = 2, S[j] = 1 is equal to the number of 2s multiplied by the number of 1s that appear before them in the subarray. Or wait, for each 2 in the subarray, how many 1s are to the left of it in the subarray. Summing this over all 2s gives the number of such pairs.\n\nYes! Because for each 2 in the subarray, the number of 1s that are before it in the subarray (i.e., j < i, S[j] = 1, S[i] = 2) contributes to the count of pairs (i, j) where i > j, S[i] = 2, S[j] = 1.\n\nSo the number of inversions in the reversed subarray is equal to the sum for each 2 in the subarray of the number of 1s to the left of it in the subarray.\n\nSimilarly, the original_inversions_in_subarray is the sum for each 2 in the subarray of the number of 1s to the right of it in the subarray.\n\nBecause in the original subarray, for each 2, the number of 1s to the right of it is the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j, S[i] = 2, S[j] = 1.\n\nSo the original_inversions_in_subarray is the count of such pairs. And the new_inversions_in_subarray is the count of pairs (i, j) where i > j, S[i] = 2, S[j] = 1.\n\nSo the difference (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray) is equal to (sum for each 2 in the subarray of number of 1s to the right) minus (sum for each 2 in the subarray of number of 1s to the left).\n\nBut how can we compute this for all subarrays [l, r]?\n\nLet me think about this. For a given subarray [l, r], let’s denote:\n\nFor each 2 in the subarray, the number of 1s to the right of it in the subarray is R.\n\nThe number of 1s to the left of it in the subarray is L.\n\nThen, original_inversions_in_subarray is sum(R) for all 2s.\n\nnew_inversions_in_subarray is sum(L) for all 2s.\n\nSo the difference (original - new) = sum(R - L) for all 2s in the subarray.\n\nBut R - L is equal to (number of 1s to the right of the 2) minus (number of 1s to the left of the 2). Let’s denote the total number of 1s in the subarray as total_ones. For a particular 2, the number of 1s to the left is L, and the number of 1s to the right is R = total_ones - L - (if the 2 itself is counted? No, since the 2 is not a 1. So for the 2, the total_ones is the number of 1s in the subarray. So for a particular 2, the number of 1s to the left is L, and to the right is (total_ones - L). So R - L = (total_ones - L) - L = total_ones - 2L.\n\nSo the difference for each 2 is total_ones - 2L. Summing over all 2s in the subarray gives us:\n\nsum( total_ones - 2L ) for each 2 in the subarray.\n\nWhich is equal to (number_of_2s_in_subarray * total_ones) - 2 * sum(L for each 2 in subarray).\n\nBut what is sum(L for each 2 in subarray)? It's the total number of pairs (2, 1) where the 2 is in the subarray and the 1 is to the left of it in the subarray. Which is the same as the number of 1s to the left of each 2 in the subarray. Which is the same as the number of pairs (i, j) in the subarray where i < j, a_i is 1, a_j is 2. Because for each such pair, the 2 is counted once, and the 1 is to the left of it.\n\nWait, no. For each 1 to the left of a 2, that contributes 1 to the sum L for that 2. So the sum over all 2s of L is the total number of pairs (1, 2) in the subarray where the 1 is before the 2. Which is the same as the number of such pairs in the subarray. Let's call this value P.\n\nSo the difference (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray) is equal to (number_of_2s * total_ones) - 2P.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible subarrays?\n\nAlternatively, note that original_inversions_in_subarray is the number of (2,1) pairs in the subarray. new_inversions_in_subarray is the number of (2,1) pairs in the reversed subarray, which is the number of (1,2) pairs in the original subarray. Because when you reverse the subarray, the (1,2) pairs in the original subarray become (2,1) pairs in the reversed subarray. Wait, no. Let me think again. For the original subarray, the number of (1,2) pairs is the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j, a_i = 1, a_j = 2. When reversed, these pairs become (j', i') where j' is the new position of j, i' is the new position of i. Since i < j, j' < i' (because the subarray is reversed). So in the reversed subarray, the pair (j', i') has i' > j', and the elements are a_j = 2 and a_i = 1. So this is a (2,1) pair in the reversed subarray. So the number of (2,1) pairs in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of (1,2) pairs in the original subarray.\n\nTherefore, the difference (original_inversions_in_subarray - new_inversions_in_subarray) is equal to (original_inversions_in_subarray - number_of_1_2_pairs_in_subarray).\n\nBut original_inversions_in_subarray is the number of (2,1) pairs in the subarray. number_of_1_2_pairs_in_subarray is the number of (1,2) pairs in the subarray. So the difference is (C21 - C12), where C21 is the count of (2,1) pairs and C12 is the count of (1,2) pairs in the subarray.\n\nBut C21 + C12 is the total number of pairs in the subarray where the two elements are different. Because for any pair of elements in the subarray, if they are different, they are either (1,2) or (2,1). So the difference (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can reduce the number of inversions (pairs where a 2 precedes a 1), which in turn increases the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Inversions Count**: Calculate the number of inversions in the original array. An inversion is a pair (i, j) where i < j and the element at i is 2 while the element at j is 1.\n2. **Effect of Reversing Subarrays**: For each possible subarray [l, r], compute how reversing it affects the number of inversions. Specifically, we need to find the subarray that maximizes the reduction in inversions when reversed.\n3. **Optimal Subarray Calculation**: For each subarray, calculate the difference between the number of (2,1) pairs and (1,2) pairs. This difference indicates how much reversing the subarray reduces the total number of inversions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix sums for count of 1s and 2s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_twos[i+1] = prefix_twos[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    # Compute original number of inversions\n    original_inversions = 0\n    ones_count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == 1:\n            ones_count += 1\n        else:\n            original_inversions += ones_count\n    \n    max_diff = 0  # maximum (C21 - C12) over all subarrays\n    \n    # Iterate all possible subarrays [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        c1 = 0\n        c2 = 0\n        c21 = 0\n        c12 = 0\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            val = a[r]\n            if val == 1:\n                c1 += 1\n            else:\n                c2 += 1\n                c21 += c1  # current 2 has c1 ones before it in the subarray\n            # Now compute c12: number of (1,2) pairs in the subarray\n            # c12 is equal to the number of 2s so far multiplied by the number of 1s before them?\n            # Wait, no. c12 is the number of (1,2) pairs in the subarray.
