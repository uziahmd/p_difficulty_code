The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is iterative. Let me think about the structure. Let's take an example. For k=4, the smallest snowflake would have:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then connect to 4, making total 5 nodes. Then each of those 4 leaves (each connected to the center) must be connected to 4 new nodes. So each of the 4 leaves adds 4 new nodes. So total becomes 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding the first layer. Then, each leaf (which is connected to only one other node) is connected to k new nodes. So this step must be done at least once. So for the minimal case, after the initial step (which creates the first layer), we do this step once. So for the first step, the initial vertex is connected to k new ones. Then, each of those k vertices (which are leaves) is connected to k new vertices. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k * k = 1 + k + k². \n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem says that for k=4, the minimal snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 21 nodes. But according to the sample input, when n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input includes 13, output is YES. Let's see. Let's think about possible k and steps.\n\nFor example, let's say k=3. Suppose we have two layers. The initial step is 1 + 3 = 4 nodes. Then, the step is done once: each of the 3 leaves gets 3 new nodes. Total is 4 + 3*3 = 13. Which matches the sample. So yes, 13 is possible. Hence, the answer is YES.\n\nSo the general idea is that the snowflake can be built with m layers. Let me think about the structure. Let's model the number of nodes for different numbers of layers.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's denote the number of layers as m. The initial layer (layer 0) is just 1 node. Then, layer 1 adds k nodes. Then, each subsequent layer adds k times the number of nodes from the previous layer. Wait, no. Because each node in the previous layer (which is a leaf) adds k new nodes. So for each layer, the number of nodes added is k multiplied by the number of nodes added in the previous layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of nodes is:\n\nLet's think about the layers. Let's suppose that the construction is done for m steps. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial step (step 0) is 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes. Now total is 1 + k. These k nodes are leaves.\n\nStep 2: each of these k leaves is connected to k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nStep 3: each of the k^2 nodes added in step 2 is now a leaf, so each adds k new nodes. So adding k^3. Total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nAnd so on. However, the problem says that the step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of steps is 1 (so that after the initial step, we do the step once). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of steps (layers beyond the initial one). Wait, but how many steps?\n\nWait, the initial step is creating the first layer. Then, the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two layers (the initial and one more). So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. But in the sample input, n=13 is allowed. Let's see: for k=3, 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1+3+9=13. So that's correct. So for the snowflake, the number of nodes can be represented as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Because the steps after the initial step are done once or more. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe initial step is step 0: 1 node.\n\nThen, the first expansion (step 1) is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step (step 2, step 3, etc.) adds k times the number of nodes added in the previous step. However, the problem says that the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have one expansion step (step 1). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is the creation of the first node. Then, the first expansion is connecting the initial node to k new nodes. That's step 1. Then, the expansion step (as per the problem's third rule) is done at least once. So after step 1, we have to perform that expansion step. So that expansion step is adding new nodes to the leaves (the k nodes from step 1). So that's adding k * k nodes. So total nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut what if there are more expansion steps? Like, after adding k^2 nodes, we can again expand each of those leaves. So then adding k^3 nodes. So total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the expansion step is done once, which corresponds to adding k^2 nodes). Wait, but how does m relate to the number of expansion steps?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the initial step is 1, then the first expansion adds k (so m=1?), and then each expansion adds another term. Wait, perhaps the sum S is equal to (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1) - (k^0 - 1)/(k - 1) ? No. Wait, the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But in our case, the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. So that's the same as sum_{i=0}^m k^i. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when m=2: sum from i=0 to 2 is 1 + k + k^2. Because the initial step is 1, then the expansion step is done once (so adding k^2). Wait, perhaps I need to think of the number of expansion steps. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial setup is 1 node. Then, we add k nodes (so that's one expansion step?), then the expansion step (the third rule) is done at least once. So that expansion step is adding new nodes to the leaves. So the first expansion step (after the initial) is adding k nodes. Then, the third rule requires that we do the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) at least once. So that would be adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So for the snowflake, the number of nodes must be equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >= 2? Or m >= 1? Let me check with the example where n=13. For k=3, 1+3+3^2 =13. So that's m=2 terms (i=0 to 2, sum is 1+3+9=13). So the number of terms is m+1, where m is the number of expansion steps. So the problem requires that there is at least one expansion step (the third rule). So the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Because if m is 1, then the sum is 1 +k. But that would be the case where the initial step is done (1 node), then the first expansion (adding k nodes) but not doing the third step. But according to the problem statement, the third step must be done at least once. So the third step is the expansion step, which is adding new nodes to the leaves. So in the case of m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But that's after the initial step and the first expansion. However, the third rule says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the first expansion (adding k nodes) is part of the initial setup. Then, the third step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done once. So the sum must be at least 1 +k +k^2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (so the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^m, with m ≥ 1?), but no, because when m=1, the sum would be 1 +k. But that's not allowed. So perhaps the sum is S = 1 +k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) ), where m ≥1. Because the initial node is 1, and then each expansion step adds k times the number of nodes added in the previous step. Let me think again:\n\nThe first expansion (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, each subsequent expansion step adds k times the number of nodes added in the previous step. So:\n\nNumber of nodes added in step 1 (initial expansion): k\n\nStep 2: k * k = k^2\n\nStep 3: k * k^2 = k^3\n\nand so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + (k + k^2 + ... +k^m), where m ≥ 1 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Wait, but in that case, the sum would be 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Because the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut for example, if m=1, the sum is k, so total nodes is 1 +k. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k nodes (but that's part of the initial setup?), and then the expansion step (third rule) is done once. So perhaps the initial step is part of the setup, and the expansion steps are the steps that are done after. So the initial step is required, and then the expansion steps (third rule) must be done at least once. So the initial step is 1 node. Then, the first expansion (connecting to k nodes) is part of the setup. Then, the expansion step (third rule) must be done once. So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k^2. \n\nTherefore, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1? Let me think again. Let me rephrase the problem's rules:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step (third rule) is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. \n\nIf the expansion step is done more than once, then each time, all current leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous expansion step) are connected to k new nodes. So for example, after the first expansion step (adding k^2 nodes), the next expansion step would add k^3 nodes, etc.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (because the expansion step is done once, which adds k^2 nodes, so m is the number of expansion steps, and m ≥ 1). Wait, no. Let me think: the initial step adds k nodes (so that's 1 +k nodes). Then, the expansion step (third rule) is done once, which adds k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. If we do the expansion step again, adding k^3 nodes, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the sum is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m ≥ 1. Because the expansion step is done m times. Wait, but in the first expansion step (the initial one) is not considered part of the expansion steps. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe initial step is adding k new vertices. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is part of the setup, and then the expansion steps (third rule) are done once or more. So the expansion steps are the steps that add k^2, then k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k + (k^2 + ... +k^m), where m ≥1 (since the expansion steps are done once). \n\nSo the total is 1 +k + sum_{i=2}^m k^i ?\n\nNo, that's not right. Let's think again. The initial step adds k nodes. Then, the expansion step (third rule) is done once. That adds k^2 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2. If we do the expansion step again (second time), then we add k^3. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which is allowed. So the total number of nodes can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. And for m ≥ 2, this would mean that the expansion steps were done at least once (since m ≥2 implies that there are at least two terms after the initial 1: the k and k^2, which requires that the expansion step was done once).\n\nWait, but m is the highest exponent. Let me think: for example, m=2 gives sum from 0 to 2, which is 1 +k +k^2. Which is allowed. For m=1, the sum is 1 +k, which is not allowed. So the condition is that the number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥ 2, and k ≥2 (since k>1). \n\nBut how can we check for a given n if there exists some k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n?\n\nAlternatively, since sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). So for a given n, we need to check if there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nAlternatively, note that the sum can be rewritten as S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. For m ≥1, but with the constraint that the expansion steps are done at least once. So, the minimal case is when m=2, which gives S=1 +k +k^2. Also, for m=1, S=1 +k, but that's not allowed. So the allowed S are those that can be expressed as S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) where m ≥1 and k ≥2, but with the additional condition that m ≥1 and the expansion steps are done once. Wait, perhaps the original problem allows for m ≥1, but in that case, for m=1, S = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is 1 +k. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step (third rule) must be done at least once. So when m=1, that would correspond to the case where the initial step is done (adding k nodes) and then the expansion step is done once. Wait, no. Because the expansion step is done once, which would add k^2 nodes. So for m=1, the sum would be 1 +k +k^2? No, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-express the problem in terms of the steps. The initial setup is:\n\nStep 0: 1 node.\n\nStep 1: connect the initial node to k new nodes. Now, there are 1 +k nodes.\n\nThen, the third rule says that each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So this step is done once, adding k^2 nodes. Now total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nIf this step is done again, adding k^3 nodes, total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥2. Because m represents the number of terms after the initial 1. For example, m=2 gives 1 +k +k^2. m=3 gives 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the sum is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1), and m ≥2. \n\nWait, but if m is the number of terms, then for the sum 1 +k +k^2, the number of terms is 3, which is m+1=3, so m=2. So the formula is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m ≥2. \n\nBut how can I check for any n if there exists k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n?\n\nThis seems challenging, especially for large n up to 1e18. \n\nBut perhaps for each possible k, we can check whether there exists m ≥2 such that the sum equals n. However, since k can be up to something like sqrt(n), given that for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = n. For example, for k=2, m=2, the sum is 7. For larger k, the sum increases rapidly. So for each possible k, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible sum for varying m, and check if n is in that range.\n\nBut how to iterate over possible k?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of k. For a given n, the maximum possible value of k is such that 1 +k +k^2 ≤n. For example, for k^2 ≤n-1, so k ≤sqrt(n-1). So for each n, the possible k values are up to sqrt(n). Since n can be up to 1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9. But checking for each k up to 1e9 for t=1e4 test cases is impossible. So this approach would be too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible m, find if there exists a k such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. Since m can't be very large. For example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. For m=2, the minimal sum is 1 +2 +4=7. For m=3, the minimal sum is 1+2+4+8=15. For m=4, it's 31. And so on. So for each possible m, the minimal sum increases exponentially. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible m is around log_2(1e18) which is about 60. So m can be up to 60. So for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 up to say 60, and for each m, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck for all possible m ≥2 (up to log2(n)):\n\n   Check if there exists integer k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nIf for any m and k, this holds, then answer is YES. Else, NO.\n\nNow, the question is, for a given m and n, can we find k such that the equation holds?\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nsum_{i=0}^m k^i = n → (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n → k^{m+1} -1 = n(k-1) → k^{m+1} -n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is difficult. However, for fixed m and n, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for a fixed m, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^m k^i is strictly increasing with k. So for each m, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k ≥2 such that f(k) =n.\n\nBut what's the possible range for k?\n\nFor fixed m, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2: f(2) = 2^{m+1} -1/(2-1) = 2^{m+1} -1. So for example, for m=2, f(2)= 1+2+4=7. So for a given m, if n < f(2), then no solution for this m. Otherwise, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nWhat's the upper bound for k? Well, since for fixed m, f(k) = sum_{i=0}^m k^i = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. For k ≥2, this is less than or equal to (m+1)*k^m. So for n = (m+1)*k^m → k^m ≈ n/(m+1). So k is up to cube root or something of n. But for binary search, we can set the upper bound as n^(1/m) +1. Because for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m ≥k^m. So for the sum to be equal to n, k^m ≤n. Hence, k ≤n^(1/m). So the upper bound for binary search is n^(1/m) + 1. But since n can be up to 1e18, and m up to 60, computing n^(1/m) can be done via binary search or using logarithms. But for code purposes, perhaps we can use binary search with upper bound as something like 1e6 (but for larger m, the upper bound is small).\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the maximum possible k is such that k^m ≤n. So for example, for m=2, k can be up to sqrt(n). For m=60, k can be up to n^(1/60), which for n=1e18 is 1e18^(1/60) = (1e18)^(1/60) = e^( (18 * ln10)/60 ) ≈ e^( (18*2.3)/60 ) ≈ e^(0.69) ≈ 2. So for m=60, the upper bound is 2.\n\nSo for each m, the binary search for k can be done efficiently. \n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n is 1: output NO (since the minimal is 7?)\n\n   else:\n\n      check for m from 2 up to 60 (or until 2^{m+1} -1 >n):\n\n         compute the minimal possible sum for m and k=2. If this is larger than n, skip.\n\n         else, perform binary search for k in [2, upper] to see if sum equals n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n      also, check for m=1? Wait, no. Because for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the sum must be 1 +k +k^2 (for m=2). So m starts from 2.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the expansion steps are done once, but the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So m is the number of terms minus 1. For example, sum 1 +k +k^2 is m=2 (since it's sum_{i=0}^2 k^i). So for each m starting from 2, check.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the snowflake is constructed with more than one expansion steps. For example, m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So for each possible m ≥2, check.\n\nSo, in code, for each test case:\n\nLoop over m from 2 up to max_m (like 60). For each m, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\nNow, for each m, how to compute the sum for a given k?\n\nWell, for a given k and m, the sum is (k^(m+1) -1)/(k-1). However, calculating this for large exponents may be tricky. But since k can be up to say 1e6 for m=2 and n up to 1e18, but even then, for m=2, k^3 is up to (1e9)^3 which is 1e27, which can be stored in Python as integers.\n\nBut during the binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum incrementally to avoid overflow (though in Python, big integers are handled automatically). Alternatively, compute the sum step by step, adding each term until it exceeds n.\n\nWait, but for binary search, we need to compute the sum for a given k and m. Let me think about how to compute that.\n\nFor example, for m=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nBut for large m and k, calculating this directly could be computationally intensive. However, since we are doing binary search for k for each m, and m is up to 60, even for k up to 1e6, the sum can be computed step by step, and if during the computation the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo for a given k and m, compute the sum s = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. We can compute it iteratively:\n\ns = 0\n\nterm = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0..m:\n\n   s += term\n\n   term *=k\n\nBut for m up to 60, this is manageable. Also, if during the addition, s exceeds n, we can break early and return that the sum is larger than n.\n\nSo during the binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum and compare it to n.\n\nSo the code steps for each m:\n\nFor m in 2 to max_m:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = ?\n\n   find the maximum possible k for which sum_{i=0}^m k^i <=n.\n\n   So for high, we can start with 2, and double it until the sum exceeds n. Then set high to that value.\n\n   Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to find high? Alternatively, for binary search, set high to something like n^(1/m) + 1, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the minimal sum for k=2 is sum_2 = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. If this is larger than n, then no solution for this m. Else, the maximum possible k is such that k^m <=n. So for example, k_max = floor(n^(1/m)). But since we can't compute exact roots easily, perhaps during binary search, we can set high to n, but that might be too slow. However, since m is small (up to 60), and for each m, the binary search would take O(log n) steps, which for m=60 is manageable.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, even with m=60, log2(n) is about 60 steps. So for each m, binary search would take 60 steps, and for each step, the sum calculation takes O(m) steps. So total for each test case is O(60 * 60 * 60) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, for each test case, read n.\n\nIf n is 1: output NO.\n\nElse, check for all m from 2 up to some maximum (say 60). For each m:\n\n   compute the minimal possible sum for k=2. If that is larger than n, then skip this m.\n\n   else, perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal sum for k=2?\n\nFor m steps, the sum for k=2 is 2^{m+1} -1. For example, m=2: sum is 1 +2 +4 =7 = 2^3 -1 =8-1=7. So yes.\n\nSo for each m, compute min_sum = 2^{m+1} -1. If min_sum >n, then skip.\n\nElse, proceed with binary search for k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nNow, for the binary search:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nWe can start with high = 2, and keep doubling it until the sum for k=high and m exceeds n. Once we have high such that sum for high is >n, then the upper bound is high.\n\nOnce we have low and high, perform binary search.\n\nFor example, for a given mid between low and high, compute the sum. If it is equal to n, return True. If it is less than n, search higher. Else, search lower.\n\nSo in code, for each m, we can do:\n\ndef check(n, m):\n\n    # check if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i ==n\n\n    # compute minimal sum for k=2\n\n    min_sum = 2**(m+1) -1\n\n    if min_sum >n:\n\n        return False\n\n    # find upper bound for k\n\n    low =2\n\n    high =2\n\n    while True:\n\n        s = compute_sum(high, m)\n\n        if s >n:\n\n            break\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # now binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m)\n\n        if s ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, m)?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total =0\n\n    current_term =1 # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current_term *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for m steps, the loop runs m+1 times (from 0 to m). For example, m=2, 3 terms (i=0,1,2).\n\nYes.\n\nBut in code, for Python, this can be implemented as a helper function.\n\nBut for very large exponents, even with m=60, and k=2, the sum is 2^61 -1, which is about 2e18. Which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo, for each test case, for m from 2 to 60:\n\n   if compute_sum(2, m) >n: continue\n\n   else perform binary search for k between 2 and upper bound.\n\nBut also, for m up to what? Let's think about the maximum m for which 2^{m+1} -1 <=n. For example, for n=1e18, 2^{m+1} -1 <=1e18 → m+1 <= log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So m can be up to 59. So setting m up to 60 is sufficient.\n\nSo in code, for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 to 60.\n\nBut what about when m is larger than the maximum possible? For example, when m is 60, but the minimal sum for k=2 is already larger than n. Then, we can skip.\n\nOnce any of the m checks returns True, then the answer is YES.\n\nNow, what about the sample input?\n\nSample Input 13:\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nsum for k=3 is 1 +3 +9=13 → yes. So returns True.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. The output is NO. Let's see:\n\nCheck m=2: minimal sum is 7 (for k=2). 7>6 → no. So no solution for m=2. For m=1, but m starts from 2. So answer is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=2: 1 +k +k^2 =255 → k^2 +k +1 =255 →k^2 +k -254=0 → discriminant 1 + 4*254 = 1017 → sqrt(1017) is ~31.9, so k=(-1 +31.9)/2 ~ 15.4 → not integer. So no.\n\nCheck m=3: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =255.\n\nTry k=4: 1+4+16+64=85 <255.\n\nk=5: 1+5+25+125=156 <255.\n\nk=6: 1+6+36+216=259>255. So between 5 and 6. No solution.\n\nm=4: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4 =255.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9+27+81=121 <255.\n\nk=4: 1+4+16+64+256 = 341>255. So no.\n\nm=5: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4 +k^5.\n\nk=3: sum is 1+3+9+27+81",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed. The snowflake graph is defined by a specific construction process involving layers of nodes, and we need to check if there exists a valid configuration for any given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one node and then adds layers of nodes. Each layer adds `k` new nodes to every leaf node from the previous layer. This process must be done at least once.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of nodes in a snowflake graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m $, where `k > 1` and `m ≥ 2`.\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of `m` (number of layers) up to a reasonable maximum (60). For each `m`, perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n    total = 0\n    current_term = 1  # k^0\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        total += current_term\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current_term *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check_possible(n, m):\n    # Check if there's a k >= 2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i == n\n    # First check for k=2\n    min_sum = (2 ** (m + 1)) - 1\n    if min_sum > n:\n        return False\n    low = 2\n    high = 2\n    # Find upper bound for high\n    while True:\n        s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n        if s > n:\n            break\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search between low and high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n        if s == n:\n            return True\n        elif s < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n == 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        # Check for m from 2 to 60\n        for m in range(2, 61):\n            if check_possible(n, m):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `m`, stopping early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n- **check_possible**: For a given `m`, this function checks if there exists a `k` such that the sum of the series equals `n` using binary search.\n- **main**: Reads input, processes each test case, and checks all possible values of `m` (from 2 to 60) to determine if a valid snowflake configuration exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down possible configurations by leveraging the properties of geometric series and binary search, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ efficiently.",
