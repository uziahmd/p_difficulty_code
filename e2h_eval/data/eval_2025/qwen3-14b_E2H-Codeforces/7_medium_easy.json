The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me think about the structure of such a graph.\n\nSo according to the problem statement, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must have k new vertices connected to them. And this process must be done at least once. Wait, so the steps are:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n- Add k nodes connected to it. Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n- Then, each node that has degree 1 (the ones added in the previous step) must have k new nodes connected to them. This step must be done at least once. So after the first addition, we have to do this again. So for example, if we do this once, then each of the original k nodes gets k new nodes. So the total would be 1 + k + k*k. But wait, maybe the process can be repeated multiple times?\n\nWait, the description says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" So this step is done once or more. So the construction is like a tree where each level adds more nodes based on the k parameter.\n\nLet me model the number of nodes for different levels. Let's think about how the snowflake is built. Let's say the process is done m times. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is the first step. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of the leaves (those that are connected to only one node). But the problem says that this step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when this step is done once. Let's take an example.\n\nFor example, the minimal snowflake for k=4: initial node (1), then 4 nodes (total 5). Then each of those 4 nodes gets 4 new nodes. So that's 4*4 = 16 new nodes. Total is 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But the example input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait the example input includes n=13 as a YES. Let's think. How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think of possible k and steps. Let's consider m steps. Maybe the structure is such that the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m ?\n\nNo, because the initial step is adding k nodes. Then each of those k nodes adds k nodes. So for m steps, perhaps the total is 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) ?\n\nWait, maybe the process is like building layers. Let me think:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root).\n\nLayer 1: k nodes connected to root. So total nodes so far: 1 + k.\n\nThen, for each node in layer 1, we add k nodes. So layer 2 has k * k nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut the problem says that this step (adding new nodes to the leaves) must be done at least once. So in the minimal case, we have two steps: the initial step (adding layer 1) and then doing the step once (adding layer 2). So the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait but in that case, for example, if k=2, the total would be 1+2+4=7. For k=3, it would be 1+3+9=13. Oh! So that's why the example input has n=13 as YES. Because for k=3, m=2 steps (layer 0, 1, 2).\n\nSo the problem requires that the snowflake is constructed in such a way that there is at least one expansion step. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But also, perhaps there are other possibilities where the expansion is done more than once. For example, if you have three layers: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But then, how does that fit into the construction steps?\n\nWait the construction process is: start with one node. Then add k nodes. Then, each node that is a leaf (i.e., connected to only one other node) is expanded by adding k nodes. This step must be done at least once. So, after the initial step (adding the first k nodes), you have to perform the expansion step once. Which would mean that each of the k nodes in layer 1 gets k new nodes. Then, if you do the expansion step again, each of the nodes in layer 2 (which are leaves) would get k new nodes each. So the process can be done multiple times. So the total number of nodes depends on how many times you expand.\n\nSo, the snowflake can be constructed with any number of expansions, but at least once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, let's think again. Let me model the total number of nodes.\n\nLet me think of the expansion steps. Let's say that the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is considered as the first expansion. Then, each expansion step adds another layer. Or maybe not. Let me think:\n\n- Initial state: 1 node. No edges yet? No, the initial step is that the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. So that's the first expansion. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (the k nodes) is connected to k new vertices. That's the second expansion. Then, each of those new nodes (layer 2) are leaves, so they can be expanded again. So, the number of expansions can be any number ≥1. \n\nSo, for example, if there is 1 expansion step (the initial step plus one expansion), then the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. If there are two expansion steps (so after the initial step, we do the expansion step twice?), no. Let me think:\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step is adding k^2 nodes. Then, the second expansion step would add k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But how many expansion steps are there? The problem says that the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is required. Then, the expansion step (adding new nodes) must be done at least once. So, the minimal is that after the initial step, we do one expansion step. So for example, if we do one expansion step, then the total is 1 + k + k^2. If we do two expansion steps, then it's 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes (so 1 + k). Then, each expansion step adds k^i nodes. For example, after m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}? Wait no. Let me reindex.\n\nLet me think of the initial step as the first part. Then, the expansion steps are done m times, where m ≥ 1.\n\nSo for example, m=1: initial step (adding k nodes) and then one expansion step (adding k^2 nodes). So total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nIf m=2, then after initial step, two expansion steps. So the first expansion adds k^2 nodes, the second adds k^3 nodes. So total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1} }, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Let's think of the expansion steps as being m steps. The initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m) ?\n\nWait, the initial step adds k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k times the number of leaves from the previous step. Since each expansion step adds k new nodes per existing leaf. So, for example, the first expansion step (after initial step) has k leaves (the first layer), each adding k nodes. So that's k * k = k^2 nodes. Then the next expansion step would take those k^2 leaves (each of the nodes added in the first expansion step) and add k per node, so k^3 nodes. So the total number of nodes is:\n\n1 (initial) + k (first expansion) + k^2 (second expansion) + ... + k^{m} (m-th expansion). Wait, but the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k^2 nodes. Then the second adds k^3, etc. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^{i} } ?\n\nWait, sum_{i=1}^m k^i is k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). So total nodes would be 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m ≥ 1. So the total number of nodes can be written as 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m ≥ 1 and k ≥ 2. \n\nAlternatively, since sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i = sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Wait, but that would be if the sum starts from i=0. So the total nodes is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But that's only if the initial step is considered as adding k^0 = 1 node, but no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Which equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=1, it's 1 + k = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = (k-1)(k+1)/(k-1) = k+1. Correct. But according to our earlier example, when m=1, the expansion steps are done once. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2? No, that's when m=2. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-express. Let me think of the number of expansion steps. The problem says that the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So after the initial step (adding k nodes), which is required, we need to perform the expansion step once. So the total number of nodes would be 1 (initial) + k (from initial step) + k^2 (from first expansion step). So that's 1 + k + k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) - (k^0 + k^1 + k^2 + ... +k^m) ?\n\nWait, the formula (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) equals 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. So if m is the number of terms minus 1. So if I have m expansion steps, then what is the value of the total nodes?\n\nLet me think again. Let me define that the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step (after initial step) adds k^2 nodes. The second adds k^3, etc. So if there are m expansion steps, then the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}? No, because initial step is adding k nodes (so 1 + k), then m expansion steps add k^2, k^3, ..., k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo. Let me think for m expansion steps:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then add k nodes (so 1 + k). Then, each expansion step adds k^2 nodes (first expansion), then k^3 (second expansion), etc. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, that's not right. Because the first expansion step adds k^2 nodes. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, because the initial step is 1 + k (sum up to k^1). Then, adding m terms of k^2, k^3, ..., k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if m=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2. Which is sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So in this case, the exponent is m+1 = 2? No, m is 1, and the exponent is 3. So the formula would be (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think that the total number of nodes can be expressed as (k^{d} - 1)/(k - 1), where d is some integer ≥ 2. Because:\n\nIf the snowflake is built with d layers. Let me think of the layers:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root).\n\nLayer 1: k nodes.\n\nLayer 2: k * k nodes.\n\nLayer 3: k * k * k nodes.\n\n...\n\nLayer d: k^d nodes.\n\nThe total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But the problem requires that the expansion step is done at least once. Which means that the number of layers is at least 2. Because the initial step (layer 1) is required, and then the expansion step (layer 2) is done once. So d must be ≥ 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is (k^{d} - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2.\n\nWait, if d is the number of layers. For example, d=2: sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So yes, the formula for sum_{i=0}^d k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So in this case, the total is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), but with d ≥ 1? No, because for d=1, it's 1 +k = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is correct. But the problem requires that the expansion step is done at least once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two layers (layer 0 and layer 1, then layer 2). So the minimum d is 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 1, but with the constraint that d+1 ≥ 2 → d ≥ 1. Wait, no. Wait, if d is the maximum layer, then the expansion steps are done (d-1) times. Because for d=2, the expansion steps are done once (layer 1 → layer 2). So the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So d must be ≥ 2. Hence, the total number of nodes is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) for d ≥ 2. Or maybe I'm mixing variables here.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes can be written as S = (k^m - 1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 3. Because for m=3, S = 1 +k +k^2. Which is the minimal case. Because m is the exponent. Let me check:\n\nFor m=3, S = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case where the expansion step was done once. So m is the exponent in the formula. So for the snowflake to be valid, S must be equal to (k^m -1)/(k-1), where k ≥2 and m ≥3. Wait, but m can be 2? Let's see:\n\nIf m=2, then (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be the case of 1 +k. But this would require that the expansion steps were done zero times. Which is not allowed. So the problem requires that the expansion step is done at least once, which means that m must be ≥3. Because when m=3, S=1 +k +k^2, which is the case where expansion steps were done once. So the conclusion is that the possible n values are numbers that can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1), where k ≥2, m ≥3. Also, note that when m=2, (k^2-1)/(k-1) =k+1. But that would correspond to the case where the expansion steps were done zero times, which is invalid. Hence, the valid n's are those that can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) with k ≥2 and m ≥3.\n\nBut wait, what about when m=2 and k=2? Then S=(2^2-1)/(2-1)=3. But according to the problem's example, n=3 is output as NO. Let's check the example input. The sample input includes 3 as a test case, and the output is NO. So that's consistent. Because for n=3, the formula would require that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =3. Let's see possible k and m:\n\nIf m=3, then (k^3-1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =3. Solve for k. For k=1, which is invalid. For k=2, 4+2+1=7>3. So no solution. So n=3 cannot be represented in this form. Hence, output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is n=13. Let's see. For k=3 and m=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Yes. So this is valid, hence output YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. Let's check if 6 can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for k≥2, m≥3.\n\nTry m=3: (k³-1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =6. Solve for k. k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0. Discriminant is 1+20=21. sqrt(21) is ~4.58. k=(-1 + 4.58)/2 ≈ 1.79. Not integer. So no solution. Try m=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k³ +k² +k +1 =6. Try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15>6. k=1 invalid. No solution. So n=6 is invalid. Which matches the sample output (NO).\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1), for integers k≥2 and m≥3.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nThe approach is, for each test case n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nNote that (k^m -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nSo for example, m=3 gives 1 +k +k² =n.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given n, whether there exists k ≥2 and m ≥3 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, how to check this efficiently for large n?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m ≥3, we can check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n. For each m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to log_2(n). For example, for m=3, the minimal possible sum is 1+2+4=7. For m=3, the maximum possible sum for given k is ... Well, for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n. For a given n, we can binary search k between 2 and sqrt(n). Because k² is part of the sum, so k² <n → k < sqrt(n).\n\nSimilarly, for m=4, the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =n. For this, the maximum k is cube root of n.\n\nSo for each m ≥3, we can check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n), which for n=1e18 is about 60, this approach is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: output NO (since the minimal is 7 for m=3, k=2).\n\n- Else, iterate over possible m values from 3 up to log_2(n) (since for m=3, the minimal sum is 7, and for larger m, the minimal sum increases).\n\nBut how to find all possible m's?\n\nFor each m starting from 3, compute the maximum possible m such that 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{m-1} ≤ n. Since 1 + 2 + ... + 2^{m-1} = 2^m -1. So for m, the maximum possible is such that 2^m -1 ≤n → m ≤ log2(n+1). So for m up to 60, for n up to 1e18.\n\nSo for each m from 3 to 60:\n\n   Check if there exists a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i =n.\n\n   For each m, compute the sum for varying k. How?\n\n   For a fixed m, the sum is S = (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. Rearranged as k^m -1 =n(k-1) →k^m -n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\n   Solving this equation for integer k ≥2 is challenging, but for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\n   Let's think: for fixed m, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i is strictly increasing with k. So for each m, we can binary search k in [2, ... upper_bound], and check if f(k) equals n.\n\n   The upper bound for k can be determined as follows. Since f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i ≥k^{m-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{m-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nSo for each m, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... , floor(n^(1/(m-1)) ) ].\n\nBut how to compute this upper bound?\n\nWell, for each m, we can compute the maximum possible k as the integer part of n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nBut even better, during the binary search, we can compute the sum for a given k and m, and compare to n.\n\nSo for each m from 3 up to log2(n)+1:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = something like n^(1/(m-1)), but even better, we can set high to n (but that's not efficient, but for m up to 60, and n up to 1e18, binary search would be manageable).\n\nBut for example, when m is 3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For this sum to be equal to n, k^2 <=n →k <= sqrt(n). So high can be sqrt(n).\n\nBut for m=60, the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^59. For k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1, which is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each m in 3 to 60:\n\n   perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound], and check if the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and m?\n\nBut for large m and k, computing the sum directly could cause overflow, but since Python handles big integers, this isn't an issue. However, for very large exponents, even calculating k^m could be slow. But given that m is up to 60, and k is up to 1e9 (for m=3, sqrt(1e18) is 1e9), it's manageable.\n\nBut there's another problem: for large m and k, the sum could be larger than n, and we need to compute it without overflowing. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nBut calculating the sum directly may be computationally intensive for large m and k. However, since m is small (up to 60), and for each binary search step, it's O(m) operations. For each m, the binary search would take O(log (n^(1/(m-1))) ) steps, which is O( log n / (m-1) )) steps. For m up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the sum. Alternatively, during the binary search, for a given k and m, compute the sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nFor example, for a given k and m:\n\nsum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}\n\nWe can compute it as follows:\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nterm = 1\n\nfor i in 0 to m-1:\n\n   current_sum += term\n\n   term *=k\n\n   if current_sum >n:\n\n       break\n\nif current_sum ==n: return True\n\nThis way, even for large exponents, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nThis is important because for large k and m, the sum could be way larger than n, and we need to avoid unnecessary computations.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n is 1: output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 3 to max_m (like 60):\n\n          low = 2\n\n          high = ?\n\n          find the upper bound for k. Since the sum is at least 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{m-1} ≤n →k ≤n^(1/(m-1)).\n\n          So high can be set as n^(1/(m-1)) +1. But how to compute that?\n\n          In Python, we can use integer nth roots. For example, for m-1, the maximum k is the integer part of n ** (1/(m-1)).\n\n          However, since m can be up to 60, for m=3, the exponent is 1/2 (sqrt(n)), which for n=1e18 is 1e9.\n\n          So for each m, compute the upper bound for k as the integer part of n ** (1/(m-1)).\n\n          But in Python, we can compute this using something like int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2.\n\n          However, due to floating point inaccuracies, perhaps it's better to perform a binary search for k in [2, ... upper] where upper is something like 2e9 (but for m=3, upper can be up to 1e9 for n=1e18). But even for m=3, binary search over 1e9 is 30 steps, which is acceptable.\n\n          So for each m, perform a binary search for k between 2 and upper (say, 2e9 or something, but for m=3, upper is sqrt(n)), and check if the sum equals n.\n\n          For each candidate k during binary search, compute the sum as described above.\n\n          If for any m and k, the sum equals n, return YES.\n\n      After checking all m, if none found, return NO.\n\nBut what about cases where m is larger than log2(n)? For example, for n=7, m=3, k=2: sum is 1+2+4=7. For m=4, the sum would be 1+2+4+8=15. So for n=7, m can't be higher than 3.\n\nSo the maximum m to check is such that 1 + 2 + ... + 2^{m-1} ≤n. Which is 2^m -1 ≤n → m ≤ log2(n+1). So for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18).\n\nSo the code can loop m from 3 to 60.\n\nBut how to handle m=60 for n=1e18?\n\nFor example, for m=60, the minimal sum is 1+2 + ... + 2^59 = 2^60 -1. Which is about 1.1e18. So for n=1e18, this sum is larger than n. So for m=60, the minimal possible sum is already larger than n. Hence, for larger m, the minimal sum is larger than n, so we can stop checking m once the minimal sum (for k=2) exceeds n.\n\nSo the code can loop m from 3 up to max_m, where max_m is the maximum possible m for which 2^m -1 ≤n. Which can be calculated as log2(n+1). For example, for n=1e18, log2(1e18) is around 60.\n\nBut to avoid unnecessary iterations, perhaps we can compute for each m, the minimal possible sum (when k=2) and check if it's ≤n. If not, break the loop.\n\nSo for m starting from 3 upwards:\n\n   compute the minimal sum for k=2, which is 2^m -1.\n\n   if 2^m -1 >n → break, since for larger m, the minimal sum will be even larger.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nfor m in 3 to ...:\n\n   min_sum = 2^m -1\n\n   if min_sum >n → break\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper]\n\nSo this way, the loop for m can stop early.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\nif n ==1 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 3 to ...:\n\n      compute min_sum = 2^m -1. If min_sum >n → break.\n\n      else:\n\n         compute upper_bound for k as the integer part of n^(1/(m-1)) + 1.\n\n         perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\n         during binary search, for mid, compute the sum for k=mid and m steps. If sum equals n → return YES.\n\nOnce all m's are checked, if nothing found, return NO.\n\nNow, how to compute the upper bound for k?\n\nIn Python, for a given m, the upper bound for k can be found by taking the integer part of n ** (1/(m-1)), but due to floating point inaccuracies, perhaps we can compute it via binary search as well, but for the sake of time, perhaps we can use something like:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile (high ** (m-1)) <= n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nthen perform binary search between low=2 and high.\n\nBut for the purpose of binary search for k, perhaps we can just set high to n, since even if it's larger than needed, the binary search will still work. However, for large m, this may be inefficient. But given that m is up to 60, and for each m, the binary search steps are logarithmic, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, compute the upper bound as the integer part of n ** (1/(m-1)) + 2.\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, we can use math.pow, but for large exponents, this may not be accurate. Another approach is to use the pow function with exponents, but again, for the purposes of upper bound, perhaps we can use a binary search approach to find the maximum k where k^{m-1} ≤n.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of code, it's easier to set high to n, and proceed with the binary search. Even though for some m, the high is way larger than needed, but the binary search would still find the correct k quickly.\n\nSo the code outline for each m:\n\nlow =2\n\nhigh = n\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) //2\n\n   compute sum for m and mid.\n\n   if sum ==n → return YES.\n\n   elif sum <n → need to increase k → low = mid +1.\n\n   else → decrease k → high = mid -1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for m and mid?\n\nAs discussed earlier, compute the sum incrementally and break early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo, for a given k and m:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total =0\n\n    current_term =1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current_term *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for m steps, since the sum is sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i. So the loop runs m times, adding 1, k, k^2, ... up to k^{m-1}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, m=3, the loop adds 1, k, k^2.\n\nSo the code for compute_sum would be:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n +1 # something larger than n\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nSo during the binary search for k, for each mid, we call this function and compare to n.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=7 → m=3, k=2. sum is 1+2+4=7. So returns YES.\n\nCase 2: n=13 → m=3, k=3: 1+3+9=13. YES.\n\nCase 3: n=15. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=3: possible k?\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k +1 =15 →k² +k -14=0 →k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +56)]/2 → sqrt(57) is ~7.5 → k=( -1 +7.5)/2 ~ 3.25 → not integer. So no solution for m=3.\n\nCheck for m=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =15. Try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 → yes. So returns YES. Hence, n=15 is YES. Which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Let's see:\n\nFor example, m=3, k=?\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =255 →k² +k +1 =255 →k² +k -254=0 → discriminant 1 + 4*254 = 1017 → sqrt(1017) is ~31.89. So k=( -1 +31.89)/2 ≈ 15.44. Not integer. Try m=4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists a valid configuration for any $ k > 1 $ and at least two expansion steps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each layer adds $ k $ new vertices to each leaf node from the previous layer. The total number of vertices after $ m $ expansion steps can be represented as $ \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $ where $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ m \\geq 3 $.\n\n2. **Iterative Check for Valid Configurations**: For each test case, we check all possible values of $ m $ starting from 3 up to a maximum value where the minimum possible sum (using $ k = 2 $) exceeds $ n $. For each $ m $, we perform a binary search on $ k $ to see if there exists a valid $ k $ such that the sum equals $ n $.\n\n3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: For each candidate $ k $ and $ m $, we compute the sum incrementally to avoid overflow and early termination if the sum exceeds $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        # Check if the minimal sum for k=2 is <= n\n        min_sum = (2 ** m) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k in [2, ... upper]\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Valid Configurations**: For each test case, we iterate over possible values of $ m $ starting from 3. For each $ m $, we use binary search to find a valid $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The `compute_sum` function calculates the sum of the geometric series incrementally, ensuring early termination if the sum exceeds $ n $, thus optimizing performance.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations using mathematical insights and binary search, ensuring it handles very large values of $ n $ up to $ 10^{18} $ within feasible time limits.",
