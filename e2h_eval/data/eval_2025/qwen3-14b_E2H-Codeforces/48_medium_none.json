He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and we have to convert it to base b, which might be Roman.\n\nFirst, let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nStep 1: Parse the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Convert the input number c (base a) to a decimal integer.\n- Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be a regular base (like 2, 16, etc.) or Roman numerals.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Well, since c can be up to 10^3 digits long, but a can be up to 25. So for example, if a is 2 and c is 1000 digits long, that's a very big number. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so converting it directly should be manageable.\n\nWait, but how to convert the string c into decimal? For example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then that's 10 in decimal. So, each character in the string represents a digit in base a. So, for each character in c, we need to convert it to its numerical value, then compute the decimal value.\n\nBut how to handle letters? For example, in bases higher than 10, letters A, B, etc. are used. The problem says that in bases greater than 10, A is 10, B is 11, etc. So, the input c can have letters in it, but only if the base a is greater than 10. So, for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but the length is up to 10^3.\n\nSo, first, I need to process the input c as a string in base a, converting it to a decimal integer.\n\nLet me think about how to do that. For each character in the string, I need to find its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So, for a given character, if it's a digit, it's its integer value. If it's a letter, then it's (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10). But wait, the problem says that the input c is in base a. So, the digits in c must be valid for base a. For example, if a is 10, then digits are 0-9. If a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase). But the problem says that the input is correct, so I don't have to check for invalid digits.\n\nSo, for the conversion from base a to decimal:\n\nInitialize a variable, say num = 0.\n\nFor each digit in the string c:\n\ndigit_value = int(digit) if it's a digit, else (ord(digit) - ord('A') + 10)\n\nThen, num = num * a + digit_value.\n\nBut wait, the input c may have letters in lowercase? The problem says that the input is given as a string. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn the sample input, there's 'A' in one case. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters. So, the code should process uppercase letters. So, assuming that the input c is in uppercase letters for letters beyond 9. But the problem says that the input is correct, so we can assume that the letters are in uppercase.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal would be:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            val = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            val = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        num = num * base + val\n\n    return num\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the base is 10 and the input has letters? Well, according to the problem statement, the input c is valid for base a. So, if a is 10, then the input c can't have letters. So, the code can proceed safely.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b. However, if b is 'R', then we need to convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string.\n\nSo, the next part is converting from decimal to base b, or to Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, convert the decimal number to base b. The output should be a string with digits in base b, using letters for digits >= 10. Also, leading zeros must be omitted.\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, handling the conversion to base b (non-R).\n\nFor converting a decimal number to another base, the standard approach is to repeatedly divide by the base and collect remainders. However, we need to handle zero. But according to the problem statement, if Roman numerals are involved, the number is non-zero. Otherwise, the number can be zero?\n\nWait, the input says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\nSo, when converting to Roman, the number is non-zero. But when converting to other bases, the number can be zero? For example, if the input c is 0 in base a, then the output would be 0 in base b. But according to the problem statement, in the input, c may contain leading zeros but the length doesn't exceed 10^3. However, the problem says that for Roman cases, the number is not zero. So, in other cases, the number can be zero?\n\nBut the input says that the input c is a non-negative integer. So, for example, if c is \"0\" in base a, then the decimal value is zero. Then, when converting to base b (non-R), we have to output zero. But the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So, in our code, when converting to base b, we need to handle zero.\n\nSo, for the case when the decimal number is zero, the output is \"0\".\n\nBut for the case when converting to base b (non-R), the code needs to generate the digits in base b, without leading zeros. So, for example, if the number is zero, output \"0\".\n\nNow, for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\nFunction to convert decimal number to base b as a string.\n\nBut how to handle digits above 9. For example, base 16 would have digits 0-9, A-F. So, for each digit value, if it is less than 10, use the digit as a character. Else, use the corresponding letter.\n\nSo, for example, 10 becomes 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n\nSo, the code for this function would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        if rem < 10:\n\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n\n        else:\n\n            # rem is between 10 and base-1.\n\n            # For example, if base is 16, rem can be 10-15.\n\n            # So, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, ..., 'F' 15.\n\n            # So, the character is chr(ord('A') + rem - 10)\n\n            digits.append( chr(ord('A') + rem - 10) )\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    # digits are collected in reverse order.\n\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? Then, the code returns '0'. But in the case where the original number is zero, that's correct.\n\nBut for example, when converting 0 to base 2, the output is '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input c may be zero (but when Roman is involved, it's not allowed). So the code must handle that.\n\nNow, the other part is converting the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nThe Roman numeral conversion is a bit more complex. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nThe standard Roman numerals go up to 3999. But the problem says that when converting to Roman, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. So, the code can handle up to 3000.\n\nThe standard values are:\n\nM 1000\n\nCM 900\n\nD 500\n\nCD 400\n\nC 100\n\nXC 90\n\nL 50\n\nXL 40\n\nX 10\n\nIX 9\n\nV 5\n\nIV 4\n\nI 1\n\nSo, creating a list of tuples like [(1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), ... etc.]\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to Roman would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n        while n >= value:\n\n            res += symbol\n\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nBut this code works for numbers up to 3999. Since the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting all together:\n\nThe steps for solving the problem are:\n\nRead a and b (where b can be R), then read c.\n\nConvert c (base a) to decimal (n).\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert n to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert n to base b as a string (without leading zeros).\n\nBut need to handle the case when n is 0. For example, if the input is 0, then output is 0 in base b (non-R), but Roman is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: c is 0. For example, input is 10 2 and c is 0. Output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So, the code can assume that when b is R, the number is non-zero.\n\nAnother Edge Case: when converting to base b (non-R) and the number is zero. Output is 0.\n\nAnother Edge Case: when converting to base 10, but the input is zero. Output is 0.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the first line. Split into a and b. But note that the first line may have 'R' as the second element.\n\nSo, for example, the input lines can be:\n\nLike '16 R\\n5' as in the sample input. So, the first line is split into two parts. So, in code, perhaps:\n\na_part, b_part = input().split()\n\nBut in Python, for the first line, if the input is something like '10 2', then split into a and b. But if the first line is '16 R', then split into a_part = '16', b_part = 'R'.\n\nThen, the next line is the c string.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c, process.\n\nNow, converting c to decimal.\n\nBut wait, the input c may be '0' (as in the case where the input is 0 in base a). For example, if a is 10 and c is '0', then the decimal is 0.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then proceed.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (n).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert n to Roman.\n\nElse, convert n to base b as a string.\n\nNow, code for converting c to decimal.\n\nBut for the code, the function to_decimal(s, base) as discussed earlier.\n\nBut what about when the input c is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer. But the input says that the length of c does not exceed 10^3. However, the input can be zero, which is a single '0' in base a.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            val = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            val = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        num = num * base + val\n\n    return num\n\nBut what if the input is '0'? Then, returns 0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's take the first input:\n\nFirst line: a=10, b=2. c is '1' in base 10. So decimal is 1. Convert to base 2: 1. Output '1'.\n\nSecond input: a=16, b=R. c is '5' in base 16. Decimal is 5. Convert to Roman: V. Output 'V'.\n\nThird input: a=5, b=R. c is '4' in base 5. Decimal is 4. Convert to Roman: IV. Output 'IV'.\n\nFourth input: a=2, b=2. c is '1111001' in base 2. Let's convert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121. Then convert to base 2 again. Which is same as the input. So output is 1111001.\n\nFifth input: a=12, b=13. c is 'A' in base 12. Which is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13. 10 in base 13 is 'A', so output is 'A'.\n\nSo, the sample outputs match.\n\nNow, code for the problem.\n\nBut need to handle the case when the decimal number is zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base a, and converting to base b (non-R), output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the first line. Split into a and b. Then read the next line as c.\n\nBut how to read the input? Because the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input description. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a...\n\nSo, the input is two lines per test case. But the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, this seems like the input is multiple test cases, each with two lines. But the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input description. So, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo, the input is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, in programming competition problems, the input is usually one test case. However, in the sample input given, the user shows multiple test cases. But perhaps the actual problem expects that the code reads multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows a list of test cases, but in reality, the actual input is one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should process one test case per run.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs and outputs. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1' which represents two lines: the first line is '10 2', the second line is '1'.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, which for each test case, is two lines. However, perhaps the problem expects that the code is to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So, perhaps the actual input is one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's just for the example.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code is supposed to process each test case. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So, the code should read two lines from the input. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's perhaps for the purpose of the example. For example, the user may have provided multiple test cases in the sample, but the actual code should read a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, the input is given as two lines. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line a and b, second line c.\n\nBut why does the sample input have multiple test cases? Because the sample input is given as a list of test cases, each with their own input and output. But in the actual programming competition problem, the code is supposed to process a single test case. So, the code will read two lines from stdin.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. But the actual code should read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases? Or not?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input:\n\nThe sample input is written as a list of input lines, each representing a separate test case. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. The second input line is '16 R\\n5', etc. But the sample output is a list of outputs for each test case.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, the code is expected to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So, the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note, the sample input and output are given as lists. But perhaps the actual problem is that the code is supposed to read one test case. For example, the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the problem's input says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So, the code should read two lines from stdin.\n\nTherefore, the code will read two lines: first line is a and b, second line is c.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead first line as a and b (split into two parts).\n\nRead the second line as c.\n\nThen process as discussed.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\nRead the first line as a and b. But note that the first line may have 'R' as the second element.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            val = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            val = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        num = num * base + val\n\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        if rem < 10:\n\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n\n        else:\n\n            digits.append( chr(ord('A') + rem - 10) )\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n        while n >= value:\n\n            res += symbol\n\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Read input\n\n    # First line: a and b\n\n    # But in Python, input() reads until a newline.

Convert to base 2 → '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5: '12 13\\nA' → c_str is 'A' in base 12 → decimal 10. Convert to base 13 → 10 is 'A'.\n\nAll sample cases pass.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros?\n\nFor example, if c is '000' in base 10. Then, to_decimal returns 0. Then, converting to base 2 would return '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting 0 to base 10 → '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting 0 to Roman? But according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So, the code can assume that when b is R, the number is non-zero.\n\nWhat about when the input is zero and b is not R? For example, input is 10 10 and c is 0 → output is 0.\n\nNow, what about when the input is zero and converting to base 16? Output is '0'.\n\nAnother test case: input a=10, b=16, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal 255 → hex is FF → code returns 'FF'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_base: when n is zero, returns '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal number is zero, and the base is 2? The code returns '0', which is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is zero and the base is R? According to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed that in this case, the number is not zero. So, the code can safely assume that when b is R, the number is not zero.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is zero, and the code is converting to base 2, and the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in other cases (non-Roman), the number is not greater than 1e15. But that's not an issue for the code.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is '0' in base a=2, and converting to base 10. The code returns '0'.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when converting to base 1? Wait, but the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So, the code doesn't need to handle base 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is 'A' in base 11. Then, the decimal value is 10. Converting to base 12 would be 'A' (since 10 in base 12 is A). So, code returns 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: converting 10 to base 10 is '10'.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_base(10, 10) → returns '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: converting 10 to base 16 → 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal number is zero, and the code returns '0' for base 10. Correct.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer. So, the input c can't be empty. So, the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nAnother thing: the code for to_decimal can handle leading zeros. For example, c is '0001' in base 10. It converts to 1. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nSo, the code is written as above.\n\nBut in the code, the function decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero. However, the problem says that when converting to base b (non-R), the output must omit leading zeros. But when the number is zero, the output is '0', which is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base (a). We first convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals (R), convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a standard mapping of values to symbols.\n   - If the target base is a numerical base (b), convert the decimal number to the specified base, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    line1 = input[0].strip()\n    a_part, b_part = line1.split()\n    c_str = input[1].strip()\n    \n    a = int(a_part)\n    \n    if b_part == 'R':\n        n = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        b = int(b_part)\n        n = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(n, b)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two lines: the first line contains the original base (a) and the target base (b or 'R'), and the second line contains the number in base a.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `to_decimal` function converts the input number from base a to a decimal integer by iterating through each character of the input string and computing its value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The `decimal_to_base` function converts the decimal number to the target base (b), handling digits greater than 9 by using corresponding letters (A, B, etc.).\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The `decimal_to_roman` function converts the decimal number to Roman numerals by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution efficiently handles large numbers and correctly converts between different numeral systems as required.",
