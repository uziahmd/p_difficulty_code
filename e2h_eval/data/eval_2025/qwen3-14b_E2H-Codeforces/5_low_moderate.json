Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what compatibility means here. Two colors are compatible if either both are specific and the same, or one is a question mark (which can match any color). So, for example, a left boot with 'a' can pair with a right boot with 'a' or '?', and vice versa. A '?' on either side can pair with any other color, including another '?'.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nAn initial thought is that this is a bipartite graph matching problem. Each left boot is a node on one side, each right boot on the other. Edges exist between compatible pairs. Then, finding the maximum matching would give the answer. However, with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm might not be efficient enough. Because Hopcroft-Karp has a time complexity of O(E√V), but E here could be O(n²) in the worst case, which for 150,000 would be way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, we need an efficient way to compute the maximum matching without explicitly building the graph.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of grouping the colors. For example, let's consider the left and right boots with specific colors. For each color c (not '?'), we can count how many left boots have c, and how many right boots have c. The maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of these two counts. But then, the question marks complicate things.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be used as wildcards. So perhaps the strategy is to first pair up the specific colors, then use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nWe can first pair as many as possible specific colors. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can pair left boots with c with right boots with c. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those with '?'), we can pair them with any remaining boots (including those with '?').\n\nBut how to manage this efficiently?\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nStep 1: Pair all specific colors. For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), take the number of left boots with c (call it L[c]) and the number of right boots with c (R[c]). The maximum possible pairs here is min(L[c], R[c]). However, we need to assign which left and right boots are paired here. But since we can choose any, perhaps we can just track the counts and then pair them.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used? Because once a left boot is paired with a right boot, they can't be used again.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, maybe we can first process the specific colors, then handle the question marks.\n\nBut the problem is that the question marks can be used to pair with either specific or other question marks. So perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right boots of color c. Then, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired) and use the question marks to pair them.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAnother approach is to first pair the specific colors, and then use the question marks to pair with the remaining specific colors. For example, if there are left boots with color 'a' that weren't paired (because there were not enough right boots with 'a'), then those left boots can be paired with right boots that have '?', and vice versa.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as:\n\nWe can have two types of pairs:\n\n1. Specific pairs: left and right have the same specific color (non '?')\n2. Wildcard pairs: either left or right is '?', or both.\n\nBut since '?' can be used in multiple ways, perhaps the best way is to:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors (non '?') where possible. For example, for each color c, pair left c with right c. This would use up as many as possible of those.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those not paired yet), we can pair them using the '?'.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think about the remaining left and right boots after pairing specific colors. Let's say:\n\nLeft_remaining: left boots that are not yet paired. These may be either '?', or specific colors that couldn't find a match.\n\nSimilarly for Right_remaining.\n\nNow, for these remaining, we can pair them as follows:\n\nEach left '?' can",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be part of at most one pair, and compatibility is defined by specific colors matching or a wildcard (`?`) matching any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, we pair left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. This ensures that we use up as many specific color matches as possible.\n2. **Handle Wildcards**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots using wildcards. Left boots with `?` can pair with any remaining right boots (specific or wildcard), and similarly for right boots with `?`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # For each color, track the positions of left and right boots\n    left_color_pos = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_pos = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = l[i]\n        if c != '?':\n            left_color_pos[c].append(i)\n        else:\n            left_color_pos['?'].append(i)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = r[i]\n        if c != '?':\n            right_color_pos[c].append(i)\n        else:\n            right_color_pos['?'].append(i)\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n    \n    # For each color except '?'\n    for c in left_color_pos:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c not in right_color_pos:\n            continue\n        left_list = left_color_pos[c]\n        right_list = right_color_pos[c]\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            l_idx = left_list[i]\n            r_idx = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n            used_left[l_idx] = True\n            used_right[r_idx] = True\n    \n    # Now collect remaining left and right boots\n    remaining_left = []\n    remaining_right = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            remaining_left.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            remaining_right.append(i)\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair wildcards\n    # First, pair left '?' with right non-?\n    # Then pair remaining left '?' with right '?'\n    # Also, pair right '?' with left non-?\n    \n    # Create lists for left and right wildcards\n    left_wild = []\n    right_wild = []\n    for i in remaining_left:\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_wild.append(i)\n    for i in remaining_right:\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_wild.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair left wild with right non-wild\n    for i in left_wild:\n        for j in range(len(remaining_right)):\n            if not used_right[remaining_right[j]]:\n                pairs.append((i + 1, remaining_right[j] + 1))\n                used_left[i] = True\n                used_right[remaining_right[j]] = True\n                break\n    \n    # Now pair remaining right wild with left non-wild\n    for j in right_wild:\n        for i in range(len(remaining_left)):\n            if not used_left[remaining_left[i]]:\n                pairs.append((remaining_left[i] + 1, j + 1))\n                used_left[remaining_left[i]] = True\n                used_right[j] = True\n                break\n    \n    # Finally, pair remaining wild with wild\n    left_wild_remaining = []\n    right_wild_remaining = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n            left_wild_remaining.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n            right_wild_remaining.append(i)\n    \n    min_len = min(len(left_wild_remaining), len(right_wild_remaining))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        pairs.append((left_wild_remaining[i] + 1, right_wild_remaining[i] + 1))\n        used_left[left_wild_remaining[i]] = True\n        used_right[right_wild_remaining[i]] = True\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Position Tracking**: We track the positions of each color (including wildcards) in both left and right boots using dictionaries.\n3. **Specific Color Pairing**: We first pair left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color.\n4. **Wildcard Handling**: After handling specific colors, we use wildcards to pair remaining boots.
