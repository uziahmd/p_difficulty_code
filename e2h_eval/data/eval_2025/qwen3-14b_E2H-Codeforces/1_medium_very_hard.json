The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is calculated as 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8 cells, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. The second is two cells in, which would mean that the dimensions for the second ring's rectangle would be (original width - 4*(2-1)) = w -4*1, same for height. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so 2*2=4 from each dimension. So for each ring i, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut for each of these rings, the perimeter is 2*(width + height - 2). So for each i from 1 to k, compute that and sum all.\n\nBut I need to make sure that for each i, the dimensions are valid. Like, when i increases, the dimensions must be at least 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can only have one ring. For a 7x7 plate, min is 7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. Let's check that. For i=2, the dimensions would be 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. So 3x3, which is valid. So the code can safely assume that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the plan is: for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring and sum them all.\n\nSo the formula for each ring i is:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\nsum += perimeter\n\nSo the total sum is the answer.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: input 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h =3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: input 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: input 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9-2)=28. Second ring: i=2, current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k, then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current_w and current_h, calculate the perimeter, sum them all.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then initialize total =0. For each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor((3+1)/4) is 1, so k=1. For i=1, current_w and current_h are 3 and ... well, say w=3, h=5. Then for i=1, current_w=3, current_h=5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. Which is correct. So the code doesn't need to handle invalid cases because the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test another case. Let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7: perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Then loop for i in 1 to k:\n\nBut in Python, the loop can be for i in range(1, k+1):\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the input is something like w=3, h=3, k=1. Which gives 8, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nI think that's all. The code is simple and straightforward. No edge cases to handle beyond what the problem's constraints already ensure.\n",
