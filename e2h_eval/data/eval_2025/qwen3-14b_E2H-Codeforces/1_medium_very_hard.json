    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. The gilded rings are added starting from the edge. Each ring is 1 cell wide. The first ring is the outer edge. The second is two cells in, and so on. For the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that work? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle would be 2 less in width and height. But wait, the formula given is (w - 4*(i-1)) and similarly for h. Oh right, because for each ring, you subtract 2 from each side. So for the first ring (i=1), the rectangle is w x h. Then the next ring (i=2) would be (w-4) x (h-4), since each ring takes away 2 from each side. Wait, no. Wait, the first ring is the edge. The second ring is two cells away from the edge. So, for example, if the original plate is 7x9, then the first ring is the perimeter. Then the second ring would be a rectangle that's 7-4 = 3 in width and 9-4=5 in height. Wait, but 7-4 is 3? So for the second ring, the rectangle is 3x5. But how does that fit? Let me think: the original plate is 7 rows and 9 columns. The first ring is the outermost layer. The next ring is two cells in. So for the second ring, the inner rectangle would be (7 - 2*2) rows and (9 - 2*2) columns. Because each ring takes 2 cells from each side. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) ? Wait, no. Wait, the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w × h. For i=2, it's (w-4) × (h-4). For i=3, (w-8) × (h-8), etc. So each ring is a border around a rectangle that's 4 less in each dimension than the previous. Because each ring takes 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 4 less in width and height. So the formula makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the total number of cells in all these k rings. So for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all.\n\nWait, but how do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle? Well, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes. For example, a rectangle of 3x3 has a perimeter of 3*4 - 4 = 8? Wait, no. Let's think. The perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle that's W columns wide and H rows tall, the number of cells in the border is 2*H + 2*(W-2). Because the top and bottom rows contribute W cells each, and the left and right columns contribute (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). So yes. For example, a 3x3 rectangle: 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1, output 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i × h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and the perimeter is 2*( (w_i) + (h_i) - 2 ). So adding all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes zero or negative? Well, the constraints on k are given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So that ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. Because for the i-th ring, the minimum between w and h must be at least 4*(i-1) + 1. Let me think. For example, when i=k, the min(w, h) must be at least 4*(k-1) + 1. Because the rectangle for the k-th ring is (w - 4*(k-1)) × (h - 4*(k-1)). Since the minimum of w and h is >= 4*(k-1) + 1, then both w and h minus 4*(k-1) will be at least 1. So the rectangle is valid.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each ring i from 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current width: w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute current height: h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter: 2*(w_i + h_i - 2)\n\n   - add to total.\n\nSo sum all these perimeters.\n\nLet me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\ni=1: w_i=3, h_i=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. For i=1: 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9-2)=28. For i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the third example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, the task is to implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k from input. Then compute the sum for each i from 1 to k of 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 )\n\nSimplify the expression inside:\n\n(w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 = w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2.\n\nSo 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal perimeter is 2*( (w_i) + (h_i) - 2 ), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). So adding them gives (w + h - 8*(i-1)) - 2. So 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ?\n\nYes. So for each i, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute it as 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ), which is same as 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute for each i, the current width and height, then compute the perimeter.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for i=1, current_w is w, current_h is h. So yes.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nBut let's test with the third example. For i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. For i=2, current_w = 7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. 3+5-2=6, multiplied by 2 is 12. Sum 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, but that's 2*(0) = 0. So total 16 + 0 = 16. But wait, what's the actual number of cells?\n\nFor the second ring, the rectangle is 1x1. The perimeter is 4 cells? Wait, no. Wait, the perimeter calculation for a 1x1 rectangle would be 2*(1 + 1 - 2) = 0. But that's not correct. Because the perimeter of a 1x1 rectangle is 4 cells. Wait, but according to the formula, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). For 1x1, that's 2*(1 +1 -2) = 0. Which is wrong. Oh no! What's happening here?\n\nWait, this suggests a problem with the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle of width W and height H. How many cells are in the border?\n\nFor example, a 1x1 rectangle: the entire cell is the border. So the number of cells is 1. But according to the formula 2*(W + H - 2) = 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0. Which is wrong. So there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, so what's the correct formula for the number of cells in the border of a rectangle?\n\nLet me think again. For a rectangle with W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the border is:\n\nTop and bottom rows: each has W cells. So 2*W.\n\nLeft and right columns: each has (H-2) cells (since the top and bottom are already counted). So 2*(H-2).\n\nTotal: 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). Which works for the 3x3 case (2*(3+3-2) = 8). But for 1x1, this gives 2*(1+1-2) = 0, which is wrong. So why is that?\n\nBecause when W and H are 1, the formula is not correct. So what's the correct way to compute the perimeter?\n\nAh, the formula should be 2*(W + H) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has length W or H, but the four corners are counted twice. So for example:\n\nFor 1x1: 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. Which is still wrong. Wait, but the actual number of cells is 1. So clearly, the formula is not correct for W and H less than 2.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is:\n\nIf W == 1 and H == 1: 1 cell.\n\nElse, if W == 1: 2*H - 2 (since the top and bottom rows are same, but the left and right columns are same. Wait, for W=1, H=3: the border is the entire row, which has 3 cells. So formula 2*(W + H - 2) would be 2*(1+3-2) = 4, which is wrong. So the formula is incorrect for W=1 or H=1.\n\nSo this suggests that the original approach is wrong. Oh no! How to handle this?\n\nWait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). But for that rectangle to be valid, the constraints on k ensure that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 1. But how?\n\nThe constraints on k are given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let's think about that. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, the rectangle is w × h, which is 3×something. So for example, if w=3 and h=3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. Which is okay. But for i=2, the rectangle would be 3-4= -1, which is invalid. But the constraints on k prevent that.\n\nBut when the rectangle is 1x1, then the formula for the perimeter is wrong. However, according to the problem statement, the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle. So for a 1x1 rectangle, the border is the single cell. So how many cells are in that ring?\n\nIn that case, the ring is the entire rectangle. So the count is 1.\n\nSo, the formula 2*(W + H - 2) is not correct for W=1 and H=1. So how to adjust?\n\nSo the correct formula for the perimeter is:\n\nif W == 1 and H == 1: 1\n\nelse if W == 1: 2 * H - 2 (since the border is the entire row, but the top and bottom are same, but for W=1, it's just the row. Wait, for W=1 and H=3, the perimeter is 3 cells. But according to 2*H - 2: 2*3-2=4. Which is wrong. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: the perimeter is 2*(W + H) - 4. For 1x1, that's 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. Which is wrong. But for 1x3, it's 2*(1+3) -4 = 4, but the actual perimeter is 3 cells. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So maybe the formula is not correct for cases where either W or H is 1. How to find the correct formula?\n\nLet me think again. The perimeter of a rectangle is the number of cells in the border. For a rectangle with W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the border is:\n\nThe total number of cells in the rectangle minus the number of cells in the inner rectangle (without the border). So for example, the inner rectangle would be (W-2) × (H-2). So the number of cells in the border is W*H - (W-2)*(H-2) = W*H - (W*H - 2W - 2H +4) ) = 2W + 2H -4.\n\nAh! So that's the correct formula. So the number of cells in the border is 2W + 2H -4. Which for W=3, H=3: 2*3 + 2*3 -4 = 6 +6 -4 = 8. Which is correct. For W=1, H=1: 2*1 + 2*1 -4 = 0. Which is wrong. But according to the formula, that's the case. But for a 1x1 rectangle, the border is the entire cell, so the number of cells is 1. So why does this formula give zero?\n\nBecause the inner rectangle is (W-2) × (H-2) = (-1)x(-1) which is invalid. So the formula W*H - (W-2)(H-2) only works when W and H are >= 2. So for W and H >= 2, the formula is correct. But when W or H is 1, we need to handle it differently.\n\nSo, in our problem, when the current_w and current_h are 1x1, the number of cells in the border is 1. Otherwise, the formula 2*(current_w + current_h) -4.\n\nSo how can we adjust the code to handle this case?\n\nSo for each ring, compute current_w and current_h. If current_w == 1 and current_h == 1: add 1. Else, compute 2*(current_w + current_h) -4.\n\nBut wait, let's check for W=1 and H=3. The formula would be 2*(1+3) -4 = 4. But the actual number of cells is 3 (the entire row). So according to this formula, it's 4, which is wrong. So what's the problem here?\n\nBecause for W=1 and H=3, the inner rectangle would be (W-2) × (H-2) = (-1) × 1. Which is invalid. So the formula W*H - (W-2)(H-2) is not applicable here. So the formula is only valid when W and H are >= 2.\n\nSo how to correctly compute the number of cells in the border for any W and H?\n\nLet me think again. For a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the border is:\n\nIf W == 1 and H == 1: 1.\n\nElse if W == 1: the entire row is the border. So H cells. But wait, the border is the perimeter. For W=1 and H=3, the perimeter is the entire row, which has 3 cells. So the formula is H.\n\nBut according to 2*(W + H) -4: 2*(1 + 3) -4 = 4 -4 = 4? No, 2*(1+3) is 8, minus 4 is 4. Which is wrong. So the formula is not correct here.\n\nSimilarly, if H=1 and W=3: the border is 3 cells.\n\nSo, the correct formula is:\n\nif W == 1 and H == 1: 1\n\nelif W == 1: 2*H - 2 (but wait, for W=1 and H=3: 2*3 - 2 = 4, which is wrong. So that's not correct.)\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nThe perimeter is 2*(W + H) - 4, but only if both W and H are >= 2. Otherwise, if one of them is 1, then the perimeter is 2*max(W, H) - 2. Or something like that.\n\nLet me think:\n\nWhen W=1 and H=3: the perimeter is 3*1 = 3 cells. How to get that?\n\nIn general, for a rectangle with W and H, the perimeter is:\n\nif W == 1 and H == 1: 1\n\nelif W == 1: 2*H - 2 (since the top and bottom are the same, but the left and right are 1 cell each, but since W=1, the left and right are same. Wait, no. For W=1, the rectangle is a single column with H rows. The perimeter would be the entire column, which has H cells. But according to the formula 2*H - 2, that would be H + (H-2) ?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to think of the perimeter as follows:\n\nThe perimeter is the number of cells in the outermost layer. For a rectangle with width W and height H, the perimeter is:\n\n- If W == 1 and H == 1: 1 cell.\n\n- If W == 1: the entire row has H cells. But since it's a single column, the perimeter is H cells. But according to the formula 2*(W + H) -4, that would be 2*(1 + H) -4 = 2H +2 -4 = 2H-2. Which is different from H. So for example, when H=3, this formula gives 4, but the actual value is 3. So this suggests that the formula isn't applicable when W or H is 1.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nMaybe the correct formula is:\n\nperimeter = 2 * (W + H - 2) if W > 1 and H > 1 else ... ?\n\nAlternatively, for any W and H, the perimeter is:\n\nif W == 1 and H == 1: 1\n\nelif W == 1: 2 * H - 2 ?\n\nWait, for W=1, H=3: 2*3 -2 = 4. Which is not correct. So that's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter for W=1 and H is H * 2 - 2 ?\n\nNo, for W=1, H=3, the perimeter is 3 cells (the entire row). So how can that be calculated?\n\nLet me think again. For a rectangle of W columns and H rows:\n\nThe number of cells in the border is the sum of the top row (W cells), bottom row (W cells), and the left and right columns excluding the top and bottom. So for the left and right columns, each has (H-2) cells. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H -2). Which is the same formula as before.\n\nBut for W=1, H=3: 2*(1 + 3 -2) = 2*(2) = 4. But the actual number is 3. So this formula overcounts by one. Why?\n\nBecause when W=1, the left and right columns are the same. So adding 2*(H-2) would be adding 2*(H-2) cells for the left and right columns, but in reality, there are no left and right columns. So for W=1, the left and right columns are the same as the single column. Hence, the formula is not applicable here.\n\nSo, the formula 2*(W + H -2) is correct only when W and H are greater than or equal to 2. For cases where either W or H is 1, we need to adjust.\n\nSo, let's think of the formula as:\n\nperimeter = 2*(W + H - 2) if W >= 2 and H >= 2 else (W * H) if W == 1 and H == 1 else (W + H - 2) * 2 ?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem to help. Let me think of different cases:\n\nCase 1: W = 1, H = 1 → 1 cell.\n\nCase 2: W = 1, H = 2 → the border is 2 cells (the entire row).\n\nBut according to formula 2*(1+2-2) = 2*1 = 2 → which is correct.\n\nCase 3: W=1, H=3 → the entire row is 3 cells. According to formula 2*(1+3-2) = 2*2=4. Which is wrong. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nBecause when W=1, the left and right columns are the same. So when we compute the formula 2*W + 2*(H-2), for W=1, it's 2*1 + 2*(H-2) = 2 + 2H -4 = 2H-2. But for H=3, this is 2*3-2 = 4. Which is more than the actual 3. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, because when W=1, the left and right columns are the same column. So when we add 2*(H-2), we're counting the same column twice. So the formula is not applicable here.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nif W == 1 and H == 1: 1\n\nelif W == 1: 2 * H - 2 → but for H=3, this is 4, which is wrong.\n\nBut what is the correct way to calculate the perimeter for W=1 and H=3?\n\nThe perimeter is all the cells in the single column. There are 3 cells. So the formula should be H * 1 = H. But how to express that in terms of W and H?\n\nWait, for W=1, the perimeter is the entire rectangle, which is H * W = H*1 = H. So for W=1, perimeter is H. Similarly for H=1, perimeter is W.\n\nBut then, how to combine these cases?\n\nSo the formula for the perimeter is:\n\nif W == 1 and H == 1: 1\n\nelif W == 1 or H == 1: max(W, H) \n\nelse: 2*(W + H - 2)\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nCase W=1, H=3: max(W, H) = 3 → correct.\n\nCase W=1, H=2: max is 2 → correct.\n\nCase W=3, H=1: max is 3 → correct.\n\nCase W=1, H=1: 1 → correct.\n\nCase W=2, H=2: 2*(2+2-2) = 4 → correct (perimeter of square 2x2 is 4).\n\nCase W=3, H=3: 2*(3+3-2) = 8 → correct.\n\nCase W=1, H=4: max is 4 → correct.\n\nBut what about W=2, H=1? Then according to the formula, it's max(2, 1) = 2. Which is correct, since the perimeter is the entire row of 2 cells.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct formula.\n\nSo the perimeter for the current_w and current_h is:\n\nif current_w == 1 and current_h == 1 → 1\n\nelif current_w == 1 or current_h == 1 → max(current_w, current_h)\n\nelse → 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nSo this formula handles all cases.\n\nNow, the problem arises when the current_w or current_h is 1. For example, in the case where the current_w is 1 and current_h is 5, the perimeter is 5.\n\nSo, in the code, we need to handle this condition.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nfor each i in 1..k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1 or current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = max(current_w, current_h)\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nBut wait, let's test this for the earlier example where current_w=1 and current_h=3 → perimeter is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=1, current_h=1 → 1.\n\nAnother example: current_w=2, current_h=1 → perimeter is 2.\n\nAnother example: current_w=3, current_h=5 → perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Which is correct.\n\nSo now, the code would correctly calculate the perimeter for all cases.\n\nBut how does this affect our previous examples?\n\nLet's check the third example input again: 7 9 2.\n\nFor i=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. Neither is 1. So perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Correct.\n\nFor i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Both are >1. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Sum is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: say w=5, h=5, k=2. For i=1: 5x5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. For i=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. So perimeter is 1. Total is 16 + 1 = 17.\n\nBut what is the actual number of cells?\n\nThe first ring is the perimeter of 5x5 → 16 cells. The second ring is a 1x1 cell, which is 1 cell. So total 17. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: w=3, h=5, k=1. current_w=3, current_h=5. Neither is 1. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. But what is the actual perimeter? The border of 3x5. Top and bottom rows are 5 cells each. Left and right columns are 3-2=1 cell each. So total 5*2 + 1*2 = 10 + 2 = 12. Correct.\n\nAnother example: w=1, h=1, k=1. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: w=1, h=5, k=1. perimeter is max(1,5) =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo this formula seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be adjusted to account for these conditions.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1 or current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = max(current_w, current_h)\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the case where current_w=1 and current_h=3. The perimeter is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: current_w=2, current_h=1. Perimeter is 2.\n\nAnother case: current_w=2, current_h=2. perimeter is 2*(2+2-2) = 4. Correct.\n\nNow, let's test the case where the current_w is 1 and current_h is 1. For example, input w=3, h=3, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=3, current_h=3 → perimeter 8.\n\ni=2: current_w=3-4= -1? No, but according to the constraints on k, this shouldn't happen. Because for k=2, the min(w, h) is 3. So floor((3+1)/4) = 1. So k can't be 2. So the code would not receive such input.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nSo the code now should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is three integers w, h, k. So the code reads them from stdin.\n\nSo, for example, the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → output 8.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1 → output 28.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2 → output 40.\n\nWhich the code handles correctly.\n\nAnother test case: input 1 1 1 → output 1.\n\nAnother test case: input 1 5 1 → output 5.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 1 1 → output 5.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 5 2 → 16 + 1 = 17.\n\nAnother test case: input 2 2 1 → perimeter is 2*(2+2-2) = 4. Which is correct (the entire 2x2 square is the border, which has 4 cells).\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n\nThe code reads the input as three integers. Then loops from 1 to k, computes current_w and current_h, and adds the perimeter.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nThen compute total as described.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead from stdin, which can be done via input().split().\n\nSo:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1 or current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = max(current_w, current_h)\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → current_w=3, current_h=3. Not 1 and 1. So else clause: 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → first iteration 28, second iteration current_w=3, current_h=5 → 2*(3+5-2) = 12. Total 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 5 2 → first i=1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5-2) = 16. i=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1 → perimeter 1. total 17.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input 1 1 1 → returns 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 1 5 1 → returns 5. Correct.\n\nSo this should be the correct code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with specified dimensions and a given number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each ring is formed by the border of a rectangle that gets smaller with each subsequent ring. The first ring is the outermost border, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, we calculate the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle. The perimeter calculation must handle different cases:\n   - If both dimensions of the rectangle are 1x1, the perimeter is 1.\n   - If either dimension is 1, the perimeter is simply the maximum of the two dimensions.\n   - For all other cases, the perimeter is calculated using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Iterate through each ring from 1 to k, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle for that ring, and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n        perimeter = 1\n    elif current_w == 1 or current_h == 1:\n        perimeter = max(current_w, current_h)\n    else:\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width, height, and number of rings.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height of the rectangle after adjusting for the inward movement of the ring.\n- **Perimeter Calculation**: Depending on the dimensions of the current rectangle, apply the appropriate perimeter calculation:\n  - If both dimensions are 1, the perimeter is 1.\n  - If one dimension is 1, the perimeter is the maximum of the two dimensions.\n  - Otherwise, use the standard perimeter formula for rectangles.\n- **Accumulate Total**: Sum the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently and correctly, providing the accurate count of gilded cells for any valid input dimensions and number of rings.",
