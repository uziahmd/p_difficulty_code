Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me think about how to approach it.\n\nSo the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a nonzero boundary segment.\n\nHmm. The key here is modeling the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, each block can be thought of as a region defined by the arrangement of these lines. However, directly representing all regions isn't feasible because the number could be exponential in n.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since movement between blocks is allowed through shared boundaries, which implies that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Well, maybe each block can be represented by a unique identifier based on the signs of the equations of the roads. Because for each road, a point lies on one side or the other of the line. So, for each road, the sign of (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) determines which side of the line the point is on. \n\nFor example, if a point is not on any line, then for each line, it has a certain sign. The combination of all these signs for all lines would uniquely identify the block. Because two points in the same block will have the same sign for all lines. So, the state of a block can be represented by the signs of each line evaluated at that point.\n\nTherefore, the home and university positions can be represented by their sign vectors. Then, the problem becomes finding the minimal steps between these two sign vectors, where each step corresponds to flipping exactly one sign (since crossing a line changes the sign for that line). Wait, no. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road. So, when you cross a road, the sign of that road's equation changes. But for other roads, the sign remains the same. Therefore, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position (the road that you crossed). \n\nWait, but that's only if the two blocks are separated by exactly one road. However, in reality, two regions can be separated by multiple roads. But according to the problem's movement rules, you can move between two blocks if they share a common border. So, the adjacency is determined by whether they are separated by exactly one road. So, if two sign vectors differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. Because crossing that road would take you from one block to another. \n\nBut how to model this? So each block is represented by a binary vector (or a tuple of signs) of length n, where each element is +1 or -1. For each road, the sign of the evaluation of the equation at the point. \n\nThe home's sign vector is determined by evaluating each road's equation at (x1, y1). Similarly for the university's position. Then, the problem is to find the minimal number of steps between these two vectors, where each step allows flipping exactly one bit (i.e., changing the sign of exactly one road's evaluation). Because each step corresponds to moving across a road into an adjacent block.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because two blocks that are separated by a single road would have sign vectors that differ in exactly one position. Because when you cross that road, the sign for that road flips. However, if two blocks are separated by more than one road, their sign vectors would differ in multiple positions. However, the movement is allowed only between adjacent blocks, which are separated by exactly one road. Therefore, the adjacency graph is such that two nodes (sign vectors) are connected if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step is flipping exactly one bit. \n\nWait, but that's equivalent to the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Because each step can flip one bit. However, the minimal steps would be the number of differing bits. But wait, no. Because if two vectors differ in k bits, then the minimal steps would be k. Because each step can flip one bit. But that's only if you can flip them one by one. However, the problem is that when you flip a bit, you have to check if that's allowed. \n\nWait, but in this case, the movement is allowed between any two sign vectors that differ in exactly one bit. So the graph is a hypercube graph, where each node is connected to others that differ in exactly one bit. Therefore, the minimal steps between two nodes is the Hamming distance between them. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 2: 0x +1y +0=0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nLet's compute the sign vectors for home and university.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. Positive. So sign is +1.\n\nSecond road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. Positive. So sign vector is (+1, +1).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Negative. Sign -1.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Negative. So sign vector is (-1,-1). \n\nThe Hamming distance between these two is 2 (both bits differ). So the minimal steps is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSecond example input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 3:\n\nRoad1: 1x +0y +0 = 0 → x=0.\n\nRoad2: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\n\nRoad3: 1x +1y -3=0 → x + y = 3.\n\nHome (1,1):\n\nCheck each road:\n\nRoad1: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nRoad2: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nRoad3: 1+1 -3 = -1 → negative. So sign vector is (+1, +1, -1).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad1: -1 → negative.\n\nRoad2: -1 → negative.\n\nRoad3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative. So sign vector is (-1, -1, -1).\n\nComparing the two vectors:\n\nFirst two components differ (from +1 to -1), third is same. So Hamming distance is 2. Hence the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal steps required is equal to the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and the university. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step can flip exactly one bit. So, the minimal steps needed is the number of differing bits. Because each differing bit can be fixed by flipping it once. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that allows flipping each differing bit one by one? Because each flip corresponds to moving across a road. For example, if two sign vectors differ in k bits, then you can flip each differing bit one by one, each time moving across the corresponding road. \n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of home and university. \n\nBut wait, what if there are some dependencies? Like, suppose two sign vectors differ in two bits. However, flipping one bit might not be possible? No, because each bit corresponds to a road. For example, if you are in a block, and you want to cross a road, you can move to the adjacent block on the other side of that road. So regardless of other roads, flipping the sign of that road's equation is allowed. \n\nThus, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. \n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n- For the home and university positions, compute their sign vectors (for each road, compute the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i, and note its sign. Since the point is not on any road, the sign is either positive or negative.)\n\n- Count the number of positions where the signs differ between the home and university vectors. That count is the answer.\n\nWait, that's really simple. So the problem is just to compute the Hamming distance between the two vectors. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each differing bit represents a road that separates the home and university blocks. To cross that road, you need to flip that bit. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing bits. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where two differing bits can be resolved in fewer steps? For example, if two roads cross each other, and the home and university are separated by two roads. But maybe there's a path that crosses both roads in one step? No, because each step can only cross one road. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road. So each step can only change one bit. \n\nThus, the answer is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nSo the steps to code this are:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), then n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute for home and university the sign of (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i). \n\nThen compare the signs for each road. For each road, if the sign is different between home and university, increment the count. The total count is the answer.\n\nWait, but how to compute the sign? For each road, for home, compute a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. Since the home is not on the road, this value is non-zero. So the sign is positive or negative. Similarly for the university.\n\nSo for each road, we can compute the value for home and for university, and compare their signs.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nFor each road, compute val_home = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\nval_uni = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\nCheck if val_home and val_uni have the same sign. If not, increment the answer.\n\nSo the answer is the number of roads where the signs differ between home and university.\n\nWait, that's it? That's the solution?\n\nBut let me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\nRoad1: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → for home, 1*1 +0 = 1 → positive. For university: 1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. So signs differ. Count +=1.\n\nRoad2: 1x +0y +0 = 0. Home: 1*1 = 1 → positive. University: 1*(-1) = -1 → negative. So signs differ. Count +=1. Total is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\nRoad1: 1x +0y +0 → home: 1 → positive. uni: -1 → negative. differ. count +=1.\n\nRoad2: 0x +1y +0 → home: 1 → positive. uni: -1 → negative. differ. count +=1.\n\nRoad3: 1x +1y -3 → home: 1+1-3 = -1 → negative. uni: -1 + -1 -3 = -5 → negative. same sign. no count. total count is 2. Which matches sample.\n\nYes, so the answer is indeed the count of roads where the signs differ between home and university.\n\nThat's a very simple solution. So why is this the case? Because each differing sign indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. Therefore, to get from home to university, you need to cross that road. Each crossing is a step. However, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nBut why can't there be a situation where crossing one road allows you to cross another road in the same step? Well, because each step is moving from one block to another, which requires crossing exactly one road. So each step can only cross one road. Therefore, for each road that separates the home and university blocks, you need to cross it once. Thus, the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, compute for each road, the sign of the home and university, compare, and count the differences.\n\nBut how to compute the sign? For each road, for home, calculate a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. Similarly for university. Then check if their product is negative. If so, the signs differ. Because if val_home * val_uni < 0, then they are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nYes. Because if the product is negative, then one is positive and the other is negative. So that's a difference in sign. If the product is positive, they are on the same side (both positive or both negative).\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients\n\n    val_home = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val_uni = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nreturn count\n\nThat's the code.\n\nWait, but how about when the road is the same for both? For example, if the home and university are on the same side of a road, then their product is positive. So no count. But if they are on opposite sides, product is negative. So count increases by 1.\n\nYes. So this is the correct approach.\n\nThis is a very efficient solution. For each road, O(1) computation. So total O(n) time. Which is acceptable even for n=300.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test another example. Suppose there are 0 roads. Then the home and university are in the same block. So answer is 0. But according to the problem statement, n can be 1. But the input says that n is at least 1? Wait, no. The input says that the third line is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n can be 1. But the code would handle that.\n\nAnother example: home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same for others. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead the input lines. For each road, compute the values.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nThen for each of those, compute val_home and val_uni.\n\nCount how many times val_home * val_uni is negative.\n\nOutput that count.\n\nSo the code is simple.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first road, a=0, b=1, c=0.\n\nval_home = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1.\n\nval_uni = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nval_home: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1.\n\nval_uni: 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1. product -1 → count +=1. total 2 → output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nRoad 1: a=1, b=0, c=0 → val_home: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. val_uni: 1*(-1) + ... = -1. product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: a=0, b=1, c=0 → val_home is 1, val_uni -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad3: a=1, b=1, c=-3.\n\nval_home: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.\n\nval_uni: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. total count 2 → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about when home and university are on the same side of all roads? Then the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if there are 3 roads, and home and university differ in two of them. Then answer is 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. That's the answer.\n\nSo the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input lines, process as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input. Then x2, y2. Then n. Then read n lines.\n\nIn Python, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1... etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. However, in the problem statement, it's implied that the code should process a single test case. The sample input seems to have two test cases, but the user provided it as a list of inputs. But in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin once. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of showing two examples. The actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nSo the code above is correct.\n\nThus, the code is as written. So the answer is to compute the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nThis is a very clever observation. The problem seems complex but the solution is straightforward once you realize that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university.\n\nI think this is the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each block can be represented by the signs of the values obtained by plugging the coordinates of a point into the equations of the roads. Two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads for which the home and university points lie on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university points are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Calculation:** For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university points.\n3. **Opposite Sides Check:** If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road, meaning this road separates them.\n4. **Count Differences:** The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each such road must be crossed once.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
