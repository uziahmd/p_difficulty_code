Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads (lines) in a plane. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to university. Each step allows moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks via a line segment (not just a point) are considered connected.\n\nThe key here is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between blocks that are adjacent (sharing a common border). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n lines, the number of regions can be up to something like O(n²), but with n up to 300, that's way too big to handle directly. So enumerating all possible blocks isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. Because each move is across a line, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the regions based on their position relative to each line.\n\nAnother idea: For each line, the plane is divided into two half-planes. The position of a point (home or university) relative to each line can be determined. So, for each line, the point is either on one side or the other. The combination of these signs (for all lines) defines which region the point is in. However, since the lines can be overlapping, but the problem says no two roads are the same. But even then, the regions are determined by the arrangement of all lines.\n\nBut how do I model the regions? Well, for each line, the sign of the value a_i x + b_i y + c_i tells us which side of the line the point is on. So, for the home and university points, we can compute for each line whether they are on the positive or negative side. The difference between the home and university's sign vectors will determine how many lines separate them. But how does that relate to the minimal steps?\n\nWait, here's a thought: Each step can cross one line. So, moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one line. So, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the home and university regions. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a graph where each node represents a region. But again, enumerating all regions is impossible. So perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph where the nodes are the lines, and edges represent adjacency? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAnother approach: The problem is similar to finding the minimal number of hyperplanes (lines) that separate the two points. But since each step can cross a line, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of lines that you have to cross to get from home to university.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWait, here's an important observation. The minimal number of steps needed is equal to the number of lines that separate the home and university points. Because each step crosses one line, and if two points are separated by k lines, then you need at least k steps. But how to determine this?\n\nWait, no. Because the lines can be arranged such that crossing one line may change the region, but the separation between the two points is determined by the number of lines that separate them. For example, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a single line, then you can cross that line once. But if they are separated by two lines, you need to cross both, but maybe in two steps.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps? Maybe the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. But how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think. For each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, then that line separates them. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed. But since each step crosses exactly one line, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. Suppose there are two lines that separate the home and university. Then, you can cross one line and then another. So, two steps. But if those two lines are parallel, then maybe the home and university are on opposite sides of both lines, but you can cross one line and then the other. So steps would be two. But perhaps there's a case where you can cross one line that separates them, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, but how can two points be separated by multiple lines? For example, imagine two lines that cross each other. The home is in one quadrant, and the university is in another. Then, the two lines separate them. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both lines. So steps would be two. But if there's a path that crosses one line first, then another, then that's two steps.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. How can I compute that?\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\nFor each line, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. The number of such lines is the minimal steps required. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause each such line is a separator. To move from home to university, you have to cross each of these lines once. Because if you don't cross a line that separates them, you can't get to the other side. So, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nTake the first example:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nThe home is (1,1), the university is (-1,-1). The two lines are x=0 and y=0. Let's check for each line:\n\nFor line 0 1 0: equation is 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y = 0. The home (1,1) gives 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0. The university (-1,-1) gives 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0. So they are on opposite sides. So this line is a separator.\n\nFor line 1 0 0: x=0. Home is x=1, which is positive. University is x=-1, negative. So again, opposite sides. So two lines separate them. So the answer is 2 steps. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n3\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 -3\n\nThe three lines are x=0, y=0, and x + y -3 = 0. Let's check for each line:\n\nHome (1,1) and university (-1,-1).\n\nLine 1: x=0. Home is positive, university negative → opposite → count 1.\n\nLine 2: y=0. Same as above → count 1.\n\nLine 3: x + y -3 = 0. For home: 1+1-3 = -1 <0. University: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Both are on same side (negative). So not a separator. So total of 2 lines separating. Answer is 2 steps, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause each time you cross a line that separates the two points, you can get closer. But how to ensure that there's a path that crosses exactly those lines.\n\nBut how can we be sure that the minimal steps is exactly the count of lines that separate them?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose there are two lines that are parallel. The home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the number of separating lines is 2. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both lines. So steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose two lines intersect. The home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Because you can cross one line, then cross the other. But perhaps there's a way to cross both in one step? No, because each step crosses exactly one line.\n\nSo this seems to fit. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of lines for which the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each line, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then the line separates the two points. Count the number of such lines.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that neither the home nor the university lies on any road. So, the values for the home and university for each line are non-zero. So, the product can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the count of lines where (value1 * value2) < 0.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because when the product is negative, the two points are on opposite sides of the line. So, that line is a separator. And the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut why is that the minimal steps? Because each step can cross one line. So, for each line that separates the two points, you have to cross it once. So, the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those lines?\n\nWell, imagine that the home and university are in regions that are separated by k lines. Then, there exists a path that crosses each of those k lines once, leading to the minimal steps of k.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to simply counting how many lines have the home and university on opposite sides.\n\nThat's a very simple solution. So, the code would be:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), then read n lines. For each line, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 * f2 < 0, increment the count. Output that count.\n\nWait, but let me test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two lines.\n\nLine 1: 0 1 0 → equation 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. For home: 1*1 + 0 = 1? Wait, the formula is a_i x + b_i y + c_i. So for line 0 1 0, it's 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 → y = 0. For home (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1. Product is 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 1 0 0 → x=0. Home: 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1. University: 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1. Product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → output 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three lines.\n\nLine 1: 1 0 0 → x=0. Home: 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1. University: 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nLine 2: 0 1 0 → same as before. Product -1 → count +=1.\n\nLine 3: 1 1 -3 → equation x + y -3 = 0. For home: 1 + 1 -3 = -1. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total 2 → output 2. Correct.\n\nSo the samples work. What about other cases?\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two lines that are not separating. So home and university are on same side of all lines. Then the answer is zero steps. Which makes sense because they are in the same block.\n\nAnother case: suppose there's one line that separates them. Then answer is 1 step. Which is correct.\n\nBut how can that be? Let's say there's one line. The home and university are on opposite sides. Then, they are in two different blocks. So moving across that line is one step. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the problem is really that simple. The minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. And since the steps can cross each line once, the minimal steps is exactly that count.\n\nThis seems to be the case. Thus, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe need to read the input, process each line, compute for each line the value for home and university, check if their product is negative, count it.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each line:\n\ncompute val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nWait, but why is this correct?\n\nBecause each line that separates the two points contributes to the count. And the minimal steps is exactly the count.\n\nBut why is that? Because the regions are divided by the lines, and each such line is a boundary between two regions. So, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line must be crossed once.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nBut let me think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=0. But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The third line says n is given as an integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. So no, n can't be zero. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the two points are in the same region. So no lines separate them. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: when there are multiple lines, but some are redundant. For example, two lines that are parallel and both separate the two points. Then, the count is 2, and steps is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples. But in the problem description, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for the purpose of showing two different test cases. The actual code needs to read one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, perhaps the user provided two separate test cases, but the actual code should process one test case. So the code is supposed to read from standard input, which for each run is one test case.\n\nSo the code should read the input as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n from third line.\n\nThen read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nThen compute the count.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input lines. However, sometimes the input may be given as multiple lines. So, for example, in Python, we can read all lines at once.\n\nBut for code submission, the code should read from stdin. So, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but that's the code. Let me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nval1 for first line: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count 1.\n\nSecond line: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1. val2: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 → product -1 → count 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1, val2=1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1 → product -1 → count 1.\n\nThen 0 1 0 → same as before, count becomes 2.\n\nThird line: 1 1 -3 → val1 is 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nBut why is this the correct approach? Because the minimal steps is the number of lines separating the two points.\n\nBut why is that? Let me think of another example where there are two lines that cross each other, and the home and university are separated by both. So the code returns 2 steps. Which is correct, because you need to cross both lines. But how?\n\nImagine two lines crossing. The home is in one quadrant, and the university is in the opposite quadrant. So, to get from home to university, you need to cross both lines. So two steps. Which is the count given by the code.\n\nBut what if there is a path that crosses one line, then another line. But how?\n\nYes, that's exactly two steps. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: three lines. The home and university are separated by two lines. But the code counts two, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo this is the solution. The code is straightforward and efficient, even for n=300.\n\nSo, the code is as written above. Now, write it in Python.\n\nBut note that in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block to a target block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero length boundary.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each line road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the starting point and the target point lie on opposite sides of a line, that line acts as a separator between the blocks containing these points. The minimum number of steps required to move from the starting block to the target block is equal to the number of such separating lines.\n\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the coordinates of the starting point, target point, and the number of line roads.\n2. **Check Separation**: For each line road, compute the values of the linear equation at the starting and target points. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the line, thus the line is a separator.\n3. **Count Separators**: Count the number of such separating lines, which gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the starting point (home) and target point (university) are read first, followed by the number of line roads.\n2. **Line Equation Evaluation**: For each line defined by coefficients (a, b, c), evaluate the linear equation at both the starting and target points.\n3. **Check Opposite Sides**: If the product of the evaluated values at the two points is negative, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the line, hence the line is a separator.\n4. **Count Separators**: The count of such separators is printed as the result, which represents the minimum number of steps needed to move from the starting block to the target block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their separation of the plane, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of line roads.",
