There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain rule. The rule says that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to model this and find the maximum possible games for the winner.\n\nLet me think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But why is that allowed? Because when the first game is played, the winner has 1 game, and the next opponent (player 3) has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that works. For n=4, the answer is 2. The note says that the optimal way is to split into two matches first, then the winners play. So the winner plays two games. But why can't they play three? Well, maybe because to get to three games, the winner would need to have played three matches, but that would require opponents that have played 2, 1, or 0 games. But with four players, perhaps the structure doesn't allow that.\n\nSo the question is, given n players, what's the maximum number of games the winner can play?\n\nHmm. Let's think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time they play, they must have an opponent that has played either the same number of games as them, or one less. So, for the winner to play their first game, they have 0 games, opponent also 0. Then after winning, they have 1 game. For their next game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. So, perhaps the structure of the tournament is such that the winner's path requires that each time they play, they can find an opponent with the right number of games.\n\nBut how to model this for any n?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a binary tree. Each game is a node, and the winner's path is the longest possible path from the root to a leaf. Wait, but the structure of the tournament depends on the arrangement of matches. The problem is to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible, under the given constraints.\n\nWait, the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the structure of the tournament. Let's think of the problem as trying to find the maximum k such that the number of players required to allow the winner to play k games is <= n.\n\nFor example, for k=1, we need 2 players. For k=2, we need 3 players (as in the example). For k=3, how many players are needed?\n\nLet me think: To have a winner play 3 games, they must have opponents in each round. Let's think of the structure. Let's say the winner plays in each round against someone who has played either the same number of games or one less.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for the winner to play k games, the number of players needed is f(k). How to compute f(k)?\n\nIn the first game, the winner plays one game. So, that requires one opponent. Then, for the second game, the winner has played 1 game. The opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has played 1 game. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to a Fibonacci sequence. Let me think: For the winner to play k games, he needs to have in each step a certain number of players.\n\nLet me think of the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games. Let's call this m(k).\n\nFor k=0, m(0)=1 (the winner hasn't played any games, but that's not possible since the tournament starts with n≥2). For k=1, m(1)=2. For k=2, m(2)=3. For k=3, how?\n\nTo get to 3 games, the winner must play three matches. Let's think about the structure:\n\nThe third game requires that the winner has played 2 games already, and the opponent has played 1 or 2 games. But how did the winner reach 2 games?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nGame 1: Winner plays against someone (player A), wins. Now he has 1 game.\n\nGame 2: He plays against someone else (player B). For this to be allowed, player B must have played 0 or 1 games. Let's say player B has played 0 games (so he just entered the tournament). But then, how did he get here? Well, maybe he was in a previous match. Wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be reduced to finding the largest number `k` such that the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This problem can be approached using a recursive method similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each step builds upon the previous steps to determine the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play an additional game.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # We need to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n\n    # Where f(k) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games\n    # f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n    # Base cases: f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    k = 0\n    a, b = 1, 2  # f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2\n    while b <= n:\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Recursive Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires opponents who have played either the same number of games or one less, leading to a structure where each step depends on the sum of the previous two steps.\n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - For `k=0`, only 1 player is needed (though this is not applicable as the tournament starts with at least 2 players).\n   - For `k=1`, 2 players are needed.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Using a loop, we iteratively calculate the minimum number of players required for increasing values of `k` until the number exceeds `n`. The maximum valid `k` is then determined by how many steps we can take before exceeding `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result even for very large values of `n` (up to $10^{18}$) by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence and iterating until the constraint is met.",
