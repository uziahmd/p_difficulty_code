You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits to make it as large as possible. The input is a number a and a sequence of digits s. Each element in s can be used once, and I can choose which positions to replace. The goal is to maximize the number after replacements.\n\nHmm. So the approach here is probably to replace the leftmost possible digits with the largest possible digits from s. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the original number is 1024 and s is 010. Then the digits in s are ['0','1','0']. Wait, but the example output is 1124. Oh right, because we can replace the second digit (0) with 1. But the s has 0,1,0. So the best is to take the 1 and replace the first 0 in the original number. Wait, the original number is 1024. The digits are 1, 0, 2, 4. So the first digit is 1, then 0. If we can replace that 0 with a 1, then the number becomes 1124, which is larger than if we replaced other digits. So the idea is to go through each digit of a from left to right, and for each position, if there's a digit in s that's larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s. And once we use a digit from s, we can't use it again.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the largest possible digits in s? Well, maybe we can sort the s digits in descending order. Then, for each position in a, starting from the left, check if the current digit can be replaced with the next largest digit in s. If so, replace it and proceed. Otherwise, move on.\n\nWait, but the s digits can be used once. So, for example, if s is sorted in descending order, then for each position in a, we check if the current digit is less than the next available digit in s. If yes, replace it and take that digit from s. Otherwise, skip.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Sort the s digits in descending order. Let's call this sorted_s.\n\n- Then, iterate through each digit of a from left to right.\n\n- For each digit in a, check if there's a digit in sorted_s that's larger than the current digit. If so, replace it with the largest possible available digit (which would be the first element in sorted_s that's larger than current digit). Once replaced, remove that digit from sorted_s (since it can't be used again).\n\n- If not, leave the digit as is.\n\nBut how to efficiently check this? Since sorted_s is sorted in descending order, for each digit in a, we can check if the first element in sorted_s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace it. Then remove that element from sorted_s. Otherwise, move on.\n\nWait, but if we have multiple digits in s, perhaps the first digit in sorted_s is larger than the current digit. So for example, sorted_s is [9,8,7,6,...], and the current digit is 1. So replacing it with 9 would be the best option.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nSort s in descending order. Then, for each position in a, from left to right:\n\nIf the current digit is less than the first element in sorted_s, replace it with that first element, and remove that element from sorted_s. Else, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, what if the first element in sorted_s is larger than the current digit? Then replacing it would be optimal. Because the leftmost digits have higher weight. So even if there's a larger digit later, replacing the leftmost possible digits gives maximum gain.\n\nYes. So for example, if a is 1024 and sorted_s is [1,0,0], then the first digit is 1. The first element in sorted_s is 1, which is equal. So we don't replace. Then the next digit is 0. The first element in sorted_s is 1, which is larger. So replace 0 with 1. Now sorted_s is [0,0]. Then the next digits are 2 and 4. The next elements in sorted_s are 0 and 0, which are smaller than 2 and 4. So no replacement. The result is 1124.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example: if a is 987 and s is 1234567. Then sorted_s is [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. The original digits are 9,8,7. For the first digit (9), the first element in sorted",
