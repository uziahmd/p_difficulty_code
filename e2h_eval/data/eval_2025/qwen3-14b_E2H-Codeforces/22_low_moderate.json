After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the marks for student 1 in subjects 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. For each subject (each column in the gradebook), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how to process the data? Let's think about the data structure. Let's say we have a 2D list, where each row is a student, and each column is a subject.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0 has 2 in subject 0 (which is max), 2 in subject 1 (not max), 3 in subject 2 (max). So he is successful because of subject 0 and 2.\n\nStudent 1 has 2 in subject 0 (max), 3 in subject 1 (max), 2 in subject 2 (not max). So successful.\n\nStudent 2 has 1 in all subjects. None are max. So not successful. Hence total is 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the maximum for each subject.\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in a subject equals the max for that subject. If yes, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nSo, for example, for the first input, the lines after the first are '223', '232', '112'.\n\nWe can process each of these strings into a list of integers. So for each student, we have a list of integers. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nOnce we have the max values for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. Convert each line into a list of integers. So, for example, the first line '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each subject (column index from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value across all students.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max for that subject. If yes, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each subject. Let's think: for each column j, iterate through all students' j-th mark and find the max.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample, for column 0:\n\nstudents[0][0] = 2, students[1][0] = 2, students[2][0] = 1. Max is 2.\n\nSimilarly for other columns.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line as a string. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So, for example, for the first line, it's [int(c) for c in line].\n\nOnce we have the data as a 2D list, then for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( data[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student i, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to max_marks[j] for that j.\n\nSo for student i, loop through each j",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert each row of the gradebook into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    gradebook.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers to form the gradebook matrix.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This is stored in an array `max_marks` where each index corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Identifying Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students and move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum marks for each subject and then check each student against these maxima, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
