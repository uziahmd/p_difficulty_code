Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where either ri < lj or rj < li (so they don't overlap). Also, the sum of their durations must be exactly x. And find the minimal sum of their costs.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is big. So O(n^2) approaches are out of the question. Need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher that doesn't overlap with it and whose duration is (x - duration of current voucher). Then find the minimum cost for such pairs.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find for each voucher, the minimal cost of a voucher that doesn't overlap and has the required duration?\n\nLet me think about pre-processing.\n\nFirst, for each possible duration d, we can keep track of the minimum cost of vouchers with that duration. But then, for a voucher with duration d, we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d), and that don't overlap with it.\n\nBut how to check for non-overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can split the problem into two parts. For each voucher, consider it as the first part (say, voucher A), and look for vouchers B that come after it (i.e., end before A starts) or before it (start after A ends). But how to efficiently find those B's with the required duration?\n\nWait, but for each voucher A with duration d, we need to find vouchers B with duration (x -d) that either end before A starts (so B's ri < A's li) or start after A ends (so B's li > A's ri). So for each voucher A, we can check for B's that are before A (end before A starts) and have duration (x -d), and also B's that are after A (start after A ends) and have duration (x -d).\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimum cost for those B's?\n\nIdea: Preprocess for each duration d, a sorted list of the vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (for the before case) and start time (for the after case). Then, for a given voucher A, when looking for B's that end before A's li, we can query the min cost in vouchers of duration (x -d) that end before li. Similarly, for B's that start after A's ri, query min cost in vouchers of duration (x -d) that start after ri.\n\nBut how to perform these queries efficiently?\n\nFor example, for the before case: For vouchers of duration t = x -d, we need those that end before A's li. So for all such vouchers, we can have their end times sorted. Then, for a given li, find the earliest end time <= li-1 (since ri < li implies that B's ri is at most li-1). Then, among those vouchers, find the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the after case: vouchers of duration t that start after A's ri. So their li is >= ri + 1. So for these vouchers, we can have their start times sorted, and for a given ri, find the minimal cost where li >= ri + 1.\n\nBut how to store this data?\n\nMaybe for each duration t, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimum cost up to that point. So for the before case, we can binary search the maximum end time that is <= (li - 1), and get the minimal cost in that prefix.\n\n- Similarly, a sorted list of start times, along with the minimum cost from that point onwards. For the after case, we can binary search the first start time >= (ri + 1), and get the minimal cost in that suffix.\n\nWait, but how to compute the minimal cost for a range? For example, if I have a sorted list of end times, and for each position, I have the minimum cost up to that position. Then, when I find the largest end time that is <= target, I can take the min cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times, if the list is sorted, and for each index, I have the minimum cost from that index to the end. Then, when I find the first start time >= target, I can take the min cost from that index onwards.\n\nThis seems feasible. Let's think about how to pre-process this.\n\nFor each duration t, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers with that duration. For each such voucher, we can collect their end times, and sort them. Then, create a prefix minimum array. For example, sorted_ends = sorted list of end times. prefix_min[i] = min of cost from 0 to i. So when you find the latest end time <= target, you can take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for start times: sorted_starts = sorted list of start times. suffix_min[i] = min of cost from i to end. So when you find the first start time >= target, you can take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nBut how to build these structures?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration t, we have a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n2. For each duration t, we process the vouchers in that list to create:\n\n   a. A sorted list of end times (sorted_ends), along with a prefix_min array.\n\n   b. A sorted list of start times (sorted_starts), along with a suffix_min array.\n\nOnce this is done, for any voucher A with duration d, we can compute t = x -d. If t is not present in the duration map, then no possible B. Otherwise, for the current voucher A, we check for B's with duration t that end before A's li, and B's with duration t that start after A's ri.\n\nSo for each voucher A:\n\n- Compute d = duration of A. Check if x -d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the map). If not, skip.\n\n- For the case where B ends before A starts (B's ri < A's li):\n\n   - Look into the sorted_ends of duration t. Find the largest end time <= (A.li -1). If such exists, then the minimal cost for those B's is the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n- For the case where B starts after A ends (B's li > A's ri):\n\n   - Look into the sorted_starts of duration t. Find the first start time >= (A.ri + 1). If such exists, then the minimal cost for those B's is the suffix_min from that index.\n\nThen, for each voucher A, we can get the minimal possible cost for B's in both cases, and take the minimum between them (if any), and then overall track the global minimum.\n\nBut how do we handle this efficiently?\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this approach. Let's think about how to code this.\n\nFirst, let's process all vouchers and group them by duration. For each duration, we have the list of vouchers. Then, for each such list, we need to sort their end times, and compute prefix minima. Similarly, sort their start times, and compute suffix minima.\n\nFor example, for a duration t, the list of vouchers is vouchers_t. Then:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted([voucher.ri for voucher in vouchers_t])\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ] where prefix_min[i] = min( cost of vouchers_t[0], ..., vouchers_t[i] )\n\nWait, but the sorted_ends is sorted, but the original vouchers may not be sorted. However, when building the prefix_min, we need to take the min of the costs of vouchers that have end time <= target. But since the sorted_ends is sorted, the order of the vouchers in the sorted_ends list is based on their end times. However, the cost of each voucher in that list is not necessarily ordered. So the prefix_min array would track the minimum cost up to that position in the sorted_ends list.\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_starts list. For each voucher in the duration t, sorted_starts is sorted by their li. The suffix_min array for sorted_starts would track the minimum cost from that position to the end.\n\nSo for each duration t, we can precompute these two structures.\n\nNow, during processing each voucher A, we can do the following:\n\nCompute d = ri - li + 1. Then, t = x -d. If t is not in the map, skip. Else:\n\nCheck for B's in duration t that end before A's li.\n\nTo find the max end time <= (A.li - 1), we can binary search in the sorted_ends list of duration t. Let's say we find the index 'idx'. Then, if idx >=0, the prefix_min[idx] is the minimal cost for B's that end before A's li.\n\nSimilarly, check for B's in duration t that start after A's ri. So, find the first start time >= (A.ri + 1) in the sorted_starts list of duration t. Let's say the index is 'idx'. If idx < len(sorted_starts), then the suffix_min[idx] is the minimal cost for those B's.\n\nNow, for each such voucher A, we can collect the possible candidates (from before and after) and take the minimum of them, and then track the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping vouchers? Because the B's are in the duration t, and we have ensured that they either end before A's li or start after A's ri. So they don't overlap with A.\n\nBut what about overlapping between B's themselves? No, because we are considering for each A, possible B's that are non-overlapping with A, but B's can be anything else. However, since we are considering all possible A and B pairs, this approach should capture all possible valid pairs.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut how to handle the binary searches?\n\nFor the first case (B ends before A's li):\n\nIn the sorted_ends list for duration t, we can perform a binary search to find the largest value <= (A.li -1). The bisect module in Python can help here. For example, using bisect_right to find insertion point and then subtract 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (B starts after A's ri), we can use bisect_left to find the first element >= (A.ri +1).\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each duration t in duration_dict, we process the list of vouchers:\n\nFor sorted_ends:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted(voucher.ri for voucher in duration_dict[t])\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ] where prefix_min[0] = min_cost of first voucher, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost).\n\nSimilarly for sorted_starts:\n\nsorted_starts = sorted(voucher.li for voucher in duration_dict[t])\n\nsuffix_min = [ ... ] where suffix_min[-1] = last voucher's cost, and suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current voucher's cost).\n\nWait, but how to get the cost for each entry in sorted_ends and sorted_starts? Because sorted_ends is just a list of ri's. But we need the corresponding cost. Oh right, I think that approach is not sufficient. Because when we sort the end times, we need to track the cost of the voucher that has that end time. So perhaps the sorted_ends list is not just a list of end times, but a list of (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time. Then, the prefix_min can be computed as the minimum up to that index.\n\nSame for the sorted_starts list, which is a list of (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time.\n\nWait, but for the sorted_ends, we need to sort the vouchers by their end time. So for each voucher in duration_dict[t], we can collect (ri, cost), sort them by ri. Then, the prefix_min array can be built based on the cost.\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_starts: collect (li, cost), sort by li, then build suffix_min array.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each duration t, we can have:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted list of (ri, cost) for vouchers of duration t, sorted by ri.\n\nsorted_starts = sorted list of (li, cost) for vouchers of duration t, sorted by li.\n\nThen, for the prefix_min array for sorted_ends:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_ends)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_ends[0][1]\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_ends)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ends[i][1])\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix_min array for sorted_starts:\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_starts[-1][1]\nfor i in len(sorted_starts)-2 downto 0:\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_starts[i][1])\n\nOnce these structures are built, for a given voucher A, we can check for the two cases.\n\nNow, for the first case (B ends before A's li):\n\nWe need to find in the sorted_ends list (for duration t) the largest ri that is <= (A.li - 1). If such exists, then the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost for B's in this case.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (B starts after A's ri):\n\nWe need to find in the sorted_starts list (for duration t) the first li that is >= (A.ri + 1). If such exists, then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost for B's in this case.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can compute d = duration, t = x -d. Then check if t exists in the duration_dict. If yes, proceed.\n\nNow, for each voucher A, we can do the following steps:\n\nCase 1: B is before A (B's ri < A's li)\n\nCheck if there are vouchers of duration t. If so:\n\nIn the sorted_ends list of duration t, find the largest ri <= (A.li -1). How?\n\nWe can extract the list of end times (sorted_ends_ri) from sorted_ends. For example, sorted_ends_ri = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_ends]. Then, using bisect_right to find the insertion point of (A.li -1) in sorted_ends_ri. The index would be insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then no such B exists.\n\nOnce we have the index, if it is >=0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[index].\n\nCase 2: B is after A (B's li > A's ri)\n\nIn the sorted_starts list of duration t, find the first li >= (A.ri + 1). Again, extract the list of start times (sorted_starts_li) from sorted_starts. Use bisect_left to find the insertion point. If insertion_point is within the list length, then the minimal cost is suffix_min[insertion_point].\n\nOnce we have the possible minimal costs for both cases, take the minimum between them (if any) and compare with the current global minimum.\n\nBut what about the same voucher being considered twice? Like, if voucher A and voucher B are the same voucher? But since the problem says i != j, but when we check for B's, they are different vouchers. However, in our approach, when processing voucher A, we are looking for other vouchers (B) in the duration t. So even if there is a voucher B with same duration t and non-overlapping with A, but it's the same voucher, but since the problem requires i != j, but in that case, the code would have to ensure that. However, in our approach, the duration_dict[t] includes all vouchers of duration t, including the current voucher A if t is x -d. Wait, but in this case, when we process voucher A, and t is x -d, then the duration of voucher A is d. So t = x -d. So if the voucher A has duration d, and t is x -d, then the duration of B is t. So if voucher A is in the list of vouchers of duration t, then it's possible that during processing voucher A, the code considers B as voucher A. But that would be invalid (i and j must be different).\n\nWait, but how can that happen?\n\nSuppose voucher A has duration d, and t = x -d. So the voucher A's duration is d, and the B's duration is t. So if d + t = x, then x = d + t. But if t = x -d, then x = d + (x -d) = x. Which is always true. So the voucher A's duration is d. So for voucher A, the B's have duration t = x -d. So if voucher A has duration t, then d = x -d => x = 2d. So for example, if x is even, and voucher A's duration is x/2, then when we process voucher A, we look for B's with duration t = x -d = x -x/2 = x/2. So B's duration is same as A's. So during processing, if the voucher A is in the list of vouchers with duration t (x/2), then the code could find voucher A itself as a possible B. But since i and j must be different, we need to make sure that when we find a B, it's not the same voucher as A.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because for example, if there's only one voucher with duration t, and that is voucher A itself. Then, when we process A, we would consider B as A, which is invalid.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nHmm. So during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B's, we need to make sure that the B is not the same as voucher A. But how?\n\nBut the way we have grouped the vouchers into duration_dict, each voucher is in the list for its own duration. So for example, when processing voucher A (duration d), and looking for B's with duration t = x -d, which could be same as d (if x is even). So in that case, the list of vouchers for duration t includes voucher A. So during the processing, when looking for B's, the code may pick voucher A itself as a candidate. Which is invalid.\n\nSo how to avoid that?\n\nWell, when checking for B's, we need to make sure that the B is not the same as voucher A. However, since in the duration_dict[t], we have all vouchers of duration t, including voucher A (if applicable), how can we check if the minimal cost comes from a different voucher?\n\nThis complicates things. Because the code would need to check if the minimal cost for B's is from a different voucher than A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAlternative idea: For each voucher A, when we are looking for B's with duration t, we can check if there exists at least one voucher in the duration t list that is not A. If yes, then proceed. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nBut during the processing of voucher A, when we look for B's in the duration t, the minimal cost could be from voucher A itself. So in that case, we need to ignore it.\n\nSo, for example, in the case where the duration t is same as d (x is even), and the voucher A is the only voucher with that duration. Then, when we process voucher A, the code would look for B's in that same duration, but there's only one voucher (A itself). So the code would find that the minimal cost is A's cost, but since B must be a different voucher, this is invalid. So in that case, the code should not consider that.\n\nTherefore, during the processing, when looking for B's, we need to make sure that there is at least one voucher in the duration t list that is not A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nHmm. This seems complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: For each voucher A, when considering B's in duration t, during the binary search steps, we can check if the found B's include voucher A. But how?\n\nBut since the sorted_ends and sorted_starts lists contain all vouchers of duration t, including voucher A (if applicable), perhaps when we find the minimal cost in the prefix_min or suffix_min arrays, we need to check if that minimal cost comes from a different voucher.\n\nBut that's not straightforward, because the prefix_min array is just the minimal cost up to that index, but we don't know which voucher it comes from.\n\nSo perhaps, during the preprocessing, for each duration t, we need to have the list of vouchers, and for each voucher, when we process it, we can check if the B's found are not the same as A.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to separate the processing. For each voucher A, when looking for B's in duration t, we can consider all vouchers in duration t except voucher A. However, this would complicate the data structures.\n\nBut perhaps, during the initial grouping, we can have for each duration t, a list of vouchers. Then, when processing voucher A, which has duration d, and looking for B's of duration t, we can check if there are other vouchers in the duration t list besides A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, suppose the duration t has multiple vouchers. Then, even if one of them is A, there are others. But if the duration t has only one voucher (A), then no.\n\nBut how to check that during the processing?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps during the processing of voucher A, when we find a candidate B (like the minimal cost in the prefix_min or suffix_min), we can check if that B is not A. But how?\n\nBut since the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays only track the minimal cost, not the specific vouchers, we can't directly know if the minimal cost comes from A or not.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to allow the code to consider the possibility that the minimal cost is from A, and then check whether there's at least another voucher in the duration t list. If so, then proceed. Otherwise, ignore.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, during the first case (B ends before A's li), after finding the minimal cost in the prefix_min, we need to check if there is at least one voucher in the duration t list that is not A. If the duration t list has more than one voucher, then even if the minimal cost is from A, there could be another voucher with same cost, or lower. But if the duration t list has only one voucher (A), then the minimal cost is from A, which is invalid.\n\nSo perhaps during the processing, for each voucher A, when checking the duration t, we can:\n\nIf t is equal to d (so x is even), then the duration t is same as d. So during the processing, when looking for B's, we need to ensure that there are at least two vouchers in the duration t list (since A is one of them). Otherwise, if the duration t list has only one voucher (A), then no possible B.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher A, when checking for B's in duration t, we can check if the duration t list has at least one voucher that is not A. But how to do that quickly?\n\nPerhaps, during the processing, when we have the duration t list, we can check if the number of vouchers in that list is greater than 1. But that's not sufficient. For example, if the duration t list has two vouchers, but both are A (but that's impossible since each voucher is unique). Or, if the duration t list has multiple vouchers, but the minimal cost in the prefix_min is from A, but there are other vouchers.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search steps, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if that minimal cost is from a different voucher than A.\n\nBut again, without knowing which voucher it's from, this is difficult.\n\nAn alternative idea: For each voucher A, during the processing, when looking for B's in duration t, we can first check if the duration t list has at least one voucher. Then, during the binary search steps, if the minimal cost is found, but the voucher that gives that cost is A, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the duration t list. If yes, then find the next minimal cost (excluding A). But this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps, given the time constraints, the problem can be handled by allowing the code to consider the possibility of A being selected as B, and then during the final answer calculation, check if there exists at least two vouchers in the duration t list. However, this seems error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice, but since the problem requires i != j, this is not allowed. Therefore, during the processing, when we find a B, we need to ensure that it's not the same voucher as A.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each voucher A, during processing, we can check if there exists another voucher in the duration t list. For example, if the duration t list has more than one voucher, then even if the minimal cost comes from A, there might be another voucher. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, when we find the minimal cost for the B's, we can check if that minimal cost can be achieved by a voucher that is not A. For example, during the binary search steps, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if the voucher that contributes to that cost is not A.\n\nBut again, without knowing which voucher it is, this is not possible.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is a problem that can be handled by allowing the code to consider the voucher A as a possible B, but then during the final answer, if the minimal cost is found by pairing A with itself, we can ignore it.\n\nBut how to detect that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B's in duration t, we can check whether the B's are in the duration t list and not equal to A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have voucher A (li=1, ri=3, cost=4, duration 3). And x=6. So d=3, t=x-d=3. So the code looks for vouchers of duration 3 that end before A's li (which is 1) or start after A's ri (which is 3).\n\nIn this case, for the first case (B ends before A's li=1), the B's must end before 1. So ri < 1. But voucher A ends at 3, which is not. So no B's in this case. For the second case, B's must start after 3. So li>3. So if there are vouchers with duration 3 that start after 3, then they are valid. But voucher A starts at 1, which is not after 3. So in this case, if there's another voucher B with duration 3 and starts after 3, then it's valid.\n\nBut if there's no such voucher, then no pair.\n\nBut during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B's in duration t=3, the code would check if there are vouchers in the duration t list. If there are, but all are A, then no. So in this case, the code would find that the minimal cost is from A, but since there's only one voucher (A), it's invalid.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nMaybe during the processing of voucher A, when we find the minimal cost in the prefix_min or suffix_min, we can check if there is at least one voucher in the duration t list that is not A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, when processing voucher A, and looking for B's in duration t, the duration t list may contain voucher A. So, if the duration t list has size 1, then no. If the duration t list has size more than 1, then even if the minimal cost is from A, there are other vouchers. So, in that case, the code can proceed.\n\nBut how to check if the duration t list has more than one voucher?\n\nBut that's not sufficient. Because even if the duration t list has more than one voucher, the minimal cost could be from A. But there may be another voucher with the same cost. So the code would still be valid.\n\nBut how to ensure that there's at least one voucher other than A in the duration t list?\n\nWell, if the duration t list has more than one voucher, then even if the minimal cost is from A, there's at least one other voucher. So the code can proceed, because there exists another voucher with the same or lower cost.\n\nWait, but what if the duration t list has more than one voucher, but all other vouchers have higher cost than A? Then, the minimal cost would be from A. However, since there are other vouchers, but they have higher cost, then the code would select the minimal cost (from A), but that's invalid because the B must be different from A.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would wrongly consider a pair (A and A) which is invalid.\n\nThus, this approach would fail in such cases.\n\nHmm. So this seems like a problem. How to handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each voucher A, during the processing, when we find a candidate B's in the duration t list, we can check if the minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not A. But how?\n\nMaybe during the preprocessing, for each duration t, we can have the sorted_ends and sorted_starts lists, but for each entry in those lists, we can track the voucher's index in the original list. But that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search steps, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if that cost is achievable by a voucher that is not A. For example, if the duration t list has multiple vouchers, and the minimal cost is from A, but there's another voucher with the same cost, then it's okay. However, if the minimal cost is only from A, then it's invalid.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps, given the time constraints, the problem can be solved by assuming that the duration t list has multiple vouchers, and during the processing, we can check if the duration t list has more than one voucher. But this would not handle the case where the duration t list has multiple vouchers, but the minimal cost is from A.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, such cases are rare, and the code would pass the test cases. However, this is not acceptable for a correct solution.\n\nAnother Idea: When processing voucher A, during the checking for B's in the duration t, we can exclude voucher A from consideration. For example, when looking for B's that end before A's li, we can look for vouchers in the duration t list, excluding A. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nBut this would require modifying the data structures for each voucher A, which would be expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each voucher A, during processing, when looking for B's in duration t, we can check if the duration t list contains at least two vouchers. If yes, then proceed. Otherwise, skip. But this is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher A, during the processing, when we find a minimal cost in the prefix_min or suffix_min arrays, we can check if there exists at least one voucher in the duration t list that is not A. But how?\n\nFor example, during the first case (B ends before A's li), after finding the minimal cost in the prefix_min, we can check if the number of vouchers in the duration t list is more than one. If yes, then there exists at least one other voucher, and thus, even if the minimal cost is from A, there may be another voucher with same or higher cost. But how to know if the minimal cost is from A?\n\nAlternatively, for the first case, when we have the sorted_ends list of vouchers for duration t, and we find that the minimal cost is from the prefix_min. We can check if the voucher A is in that list. But how?\n\nBut the voucher A is in the duration t list only if d = x -d → x = 2d. So during the processing of voucher A, if t = x -d equals d, then the duration t list contains voucher A. So in that case, during the processing of voucher A, we need to check whether the voucher A is in the list of vouchers for duration t.\n\nBut how to know if the voucher A is in that list?\n\nWell, the voucher A's duration is d. t = x -d. So if t = d, then x = 2d. And the voucher A's duration is d, so it is in the duration t list.\n\nSo during the processing of voucher A, when t = d, then the duration t list contains voucher A.\n\nIn this case, during the first case (B ends before A's li), we need to ensure that the B is not A. So, for example, if the voucher A is the only one in the duration t list, then no. If there are other vouchers, then we need to make sure that the minimal cost is not from A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems very complicated. Perhaps, given the time constraints, it's better to proceed with the initial approach, and then during the final answer, if the minimal cost is found by pairing A with itself, we can ignore it. But how to detect that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher A, when checking for B's in duration t, we can check if the voucher A is in the list of B's. For example, during the first case, when we find the minimal cost in the prefix_min, we can check if the voucher A's ri is <= (A's li -1). Which is not possible, since A's ri >= A's li. So the B's in the first case cannot be A. Because B's ri must be < A's li, but A's ri >= A's li. So for the first case, the B's cannot be A. So this case is safe.\n\nAh! That's an important observation. In the first case, B's must end before A's li. Since A's ri is >= A's li (because li <= ri), then B's ri < A's li implies that B's ri < A's li <= A's ri. So B's ri < A's ri. Hence, B cannot be A. Because A's ri is not less than itself. So the first case (B ends before A's li) will never include voucher A itself.\n\nSimilarly, in the second case (B starts after A's ri), B's li must be > A's ri. Since A's li <= A's ri, B's li > A's ri implies that B's li > A's ri >= A's li. So B's li > A's ri. Hence, B cannot be A, because A's li is <= A's ri. So B's li > A's ri implies that B's li > A's ri >= A's li. So B's li > A's li. Hence, B cannot be A.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, the B's are not the same as A. Hence, during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B's in the first or second cases, the B's are guaranteed to be different from A. Thus, the earlier concern about the same voucher being considered twice is not a problem. Because in the first case, B's ri < A's li, which is not possible for A itself. In the second case, B's li > A's ri, which is not possible for A itself.\n\nWow, that's a crucial insight. So during the processing of voucher A, the B's found in both cases are different from A. So no need to worry about overlapping with A.\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. So the initial approach is correct, and there's no need to worry about the same voucher being selected twice.\n\nThat's great! So now, the code can proceed with the initial plan.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the steps again:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read n vouchers, storing li, ri, cost.\n\n3. Group vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store a list of vouchers (each voucher is represented as (li, ri, cost)).\n\n4. For each duration d in the duration_dict, preprocess the sorted_ends and sorted_starts lists, along with prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nFor example, for each duration d:\n\n   a. sorted_ends = sorted list of (ri, cost) for vouchers of duration d, sorted by ri.\n\n   b. sorted_starts = sorted list of (li, cost) for vouchers of duration d, sorted by li.\n\n   c. Compute prefix_min for sorted_ends: for each index i, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from 0 to i.\n\n   d. Compute suffix_min for sorted_starts: for each index i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\n5. Initialize the answer as infinity.\n\n6. For each voucher in the original list:\n\n   a. Compute its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b. Compute t = x - d.\n\n   c. If t is not in the duration_dict, continue.\n\n   d. Else, process both cases:\n\n      i. Case 1: find B's with duration t that end before this voucher's li.\n\n         - Get the sorted_ends list for duration t.\n\n         - Extract the list of end times: ends = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_ends]\n\n         - target = voucher's li - 1.\n\n         - Use bisect_right to find the insertion point of target in ends. idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends, target) - 1.\n\n         - if idx >=0:\n\n             - current_min = prefix_min[idx]\n\n             - update",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals a given value `x` and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently checking for valid voucher pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access all vouchers of a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Preprocess Sorted Lists**: For each duration, we maintain sorted lists of vouchers based on their end times and start times. We also compute prefix minimums for the end times and suffix minimums for the start times. This helps in efficiently finding the minimum cost of valid vouchers during the search phase.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a complementary duration (i.e., `x - duration`). Using binary search, we determine if there are valid non-overlapping vouchers before or after the current voucher and calculate the minimum cost for these valid pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess for each duration\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        lst = duration_dict[d]\n        # Prepare sorted_ends and prefix_min\n        sorted_ends = sorted([(ri, cost) for (li, ri, cost) in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        ends = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_ends]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for entry in sorted_ends:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, entry[1])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Prepare sorted_starts and suffix_min\n        sorted_starts = sorted([(li, cost) for (li, ri, cost) in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_starts]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_starts))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_starts[i][1])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ends, ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Case 1: B ends before li\n        sorted_ends, ends, prefix_min = preprocessed[t][0], preprocessed[t][1], preprocessed[t][2]\n        target = li - 1\n        idx_end = bisect.bisect_right(ends, target) - 1\n        if idx_end >= 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx_end]\n            if current_min + cost < min_total:\n                min_total = current_min + cost\n        # Case 2: B starts after ri\n        sorted_starts, starts, suffix_min = preprocessed[t][3], preprocessed[t][4], preprocessed[t][5]\n        target_start = ri + 1\n        idx_start = bisect.bisect_left(starts, target_start)\n        if idx_start < len(starts):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx_start]\n            if current_min + cost < min_total:\n                min_total = current_min + cost\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick access during the search phase.\n- **Preprocessing**: For each duration, sorted lists of end times and start times are created along with prefix and suffix minimum arrays to quickly determine the minimum cost of valid vouchers.\n- **Binary Search**: For each voucher, we use binary search to find valid non-overlapping vouchers with the required complementary duration, ensuring efficient lookup and comparison of costs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible valid voucher pairs while maintaining optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
