Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If it's impossible, output -1.\n\nSo, the input is n vouchers, each with li (start day), ri (end day), and cost. The duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where the sum of their durations is exactly x, and they don't overlap. Also, i and j must be different.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently, given that n can be up to 2e5. A brute-force approach checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow for that size.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For two vouchers to not overlap, one must end before the other starts. So for voucher A and voucher B, either A ends before B starts, or B ends before A starts.\n\nThe key is to find pairs where the durations sum to x. Let's denote the duration of voucher i as d_i. So for each voucher, we need another voucher with duration x - d_i, and that they don't overlap.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find for each voucher, the minimal cost of a voucher with duration (x - d_i) that doesn't overlap with it?\n\nHmm. Let's think about pre-processing. For each possible duration, we can keep track of the minimal cost vouchers. But since the duration can be up to 2e5, maybe that's manageable.\n\nWait, but for each voucher, we need to check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d_i), and that they don't overlap. But how to find the minimal cost for that?\n\nLet me think: For each voucher i with duration d, we need to find a voucher j with duration (x - d) that ends before li (so that j ends before i starts) or starts after ri (so that i ends before j starts). And among all such j's, find the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to efficiently find these j's?\n\nAn idea is to process vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary where for each duration value, we have a sorted list of vouchers (sorted by their end day, perhaps), and also for each duration, we have some structure that allows us to quickly find the minimum cost voucher that ends before a certain day, or starts after a certain day.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration k, we can pre-process the vouchers with that duration. For example, for all vouchers with duration k, we can have them sorted by their end day. Then, for a given voucher i with duration d, and looking for vouchers of duration (x - d), we can check two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Find a voucher j with duration (x - d) that ends before li. So j's end day is <= li - 1. For this, if we have the vouchers of duration (x - d) sorted by their end day, we can perform a binary search to find the earliest end day that is <= li-1. But wait, we need the minimal cost among those. However, if we have the vouchers sorted by end day, and also for each end day, track the minimal cost up to that point, then we can find the minimal cost for vouchers ending before a certain day.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: find a voucher j with duration (x - d) that starts after ri. So j's start day is >= ri + 1. For this, if we have the vouchers of duration (x - d) sorted by their start day, we can find the minimal cost among those starting at or after ri+1.\n\nBut how to manage these data structures?\n\nLet me think. For each duration k, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end day (ri), and for each position, we can have the minimum cost up to that point. So for example, if we have vouchers sorted by end day, and for each voucher in the list, we have a prefix min array. Then, for a query of \"what's the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that end <= some value\", we can binary search the end day, and then take the prefix min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the start day. For vouchers of duration k, sorted by start day. Then, for a query of \"find minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that start >= some value\", we can binary search the first start day that is >= that value, and then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nBut how to build these structures?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration. For each duration k, store a list of vouchers. For each such list, we can sort them by their end day, and also sort them by their start day.\n\nBut perhaps even better, for each duration k, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end day (ri), and for each position, we have a prefix minimum cost. So when you want to find the minimal cost for vouchers ending before a certain day, you can binary search the end day and then get the prefix min up to that index.\n\n- Sorted by start day (li), and for each position, a suffix minimum cost. So when you want to find the minimal cost for vouchers starting after a certain day, you can binary search the start day and then get the suffix min from that index.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nFor each voucher, compute its duration d = ri - li + 1. Then, for each duration k, we have:\n\n- A list of vouchers with duration k, sorted by their end day. Along with a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the sorted list.\n\n- A list of vouchers with duration k, sorted by their start day. Along with a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from i to end of the list.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher i with duration d, we can check if (x - d) is a valid duration. If it is, then we look into the group of vouchers with duration (x - d).\n\nFor voucher i, we need to find:\n\na) The minimal cost of vouchers in the (x -d) group that end before li. This would allow the voucher i to start after that voucher ends.\n\nOR\n\nb) The minimal cost of vouchers in the (x -d) group that start after ri. This would allow voucher i to end before that voucher starts.\n\nThen, take the minimum between a and b, and combine with the cost of voucher i, and keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose voucher i has duration d, and we need to find vouchers of duration k = x -d. So for each voucher i, we check if k is present in our groups.\n\nIf k is not present, then this voucher can't form a pair with any other voucher. So skip.\n\nElse, for the group of vouchers with duration k:\n\nCheck for case a: find the minimal cost of vouchers in the group that end before li. How?\n\nWe have the sorted list of vouchers in the group by end day. So we can binary search the largest end day that is <= li -1. Once we find that index, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost. If there are no such vouchers, then case a is invalid.\n\nSimilarly for case b: find the minimal cost of vouchers in the group that start >= ri +1. Since the list is sorted by start day, we can binary search for the first start day >= ri +1. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nOnce we have the minimal cost for case a and case b, we take the minimum between them (if any exist), and add it to the current voucher's cost. Then, we track the overall minimum across all vouchers.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says i != j. So, when we process voucher i, we have to check if the voucher j found in the group is not the same as i. However, since the group for duration k may include voucher i itself (if x -d = d, i.e., x is even and d = x/2). But in that case, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? For example, suppose x is 4, and voucher i has duration 2. Then, looking for vouchers of duration 2. If the voucher i is part of that group, but when processing voucher i, we look for vouchers in the same group. However, the voucher j must be different from i.\n\nSo, in that case, when we find the minimal cost in the group, we need to check if the voucher j is different from i. However, if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and same start/end days, but different costs, then perhaps the minimal cost is achieved by another voucher.\n\nBut how to handle this? Well, during the preprocessing, for each duration group, when we process a voucher, we can't just take the minimal cost in the group, because that might be the same voucher. So, for example, when voucher i is in the group of duration k, and we are looking for a voucher j in the same group, we have to make sure that j is not i.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nHmm. For example, suppose voucher i is in the group of duration k. When considering case a, the voucher i could be part of the group. However, during the binary search, if the voucher i's end day is <= li-1 (which is possible only if li-1 >= ri of voucher i, which would imply that voucher i's end day is <= li-1. But voucher i's end day is ri, and li is the start day of voucher i. So ri >= li. So ri <= li-1 would imply that ri < li, which is impossible. Therefore, voucher i cannot be part of the group of vouchers that end before li. Because for voucher i's own end day, which is ri, to be <= li-1, we need ri <= li-1, which is impossible because ri >= li. So voucher i can't be in case a when checking against itself. Similarly, for case b, the voucher i's start day is li. So for j's start day >= ri +1. But voucher i's start day is li, which is <= ri. So ri +1 > ri >= li. So voucher i's start day is not >= ri +1. Therefore, when processing voucher i, the cases a and b will not include voucher i itself. Therefore, we don't have to worry about the same voucher being selected. Because when we process voucher i, the case a and b look for vouchers that end before i's start (so they can't be i) or start after i's end (so they can't be i). Therefore, when we look for j in the group, it's guaranteed that j is different from i.\n\nThat's a relief. So, we don't have to worry about that case. Thus, during the processing, for each voucher i, we can check the two cases and proceed.\n\nSo the steps for the algorithm are:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration. For each duration, we have:\n\n   a. A list of vouchers sorted by end day (ri), along with a prefix_min array.\n\n   b. A list of vouchers sorted by start day (li), along with a suffix_min array.\n\n2. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d = duration of voucher i.\n\n   b. Check if x -d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the groups). If not, skip.\n\n   c. Let k = x -d. Now, look into the group for duration k.\n\n   d. For case a: find the minimal cost of vouchers in group k that end before li. How?\n\n      - Take the sorted list of vouchers in group k by end day.\n\n      - Binary search for the maximum end day <= li -1.\n\n      - If found, get the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n   e. For case b: find the minimal cost of vouchers in group k that start after ri.\n\n      - Take the sorted list of vouchers in group k by start day.\n\n      - Binary search for the first start day >= ri + 1.\n\n      - If found, get the suffix_min from that index.\n\n   f. For both cases, collect the minimal possible cost (if any) and add it to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the overall minimum.\n\n3. After processing all vouchers, if any valid pair was found, output the minimal total cost. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement these steps efficiently.\n\nFirst, let's think about the preprocessing.\n\nFor each duration k, we can have:\n\n- sorted_by_end: a list of vouchers (each represented by their end day and cost?), sorted by end day. Then, we can create a prefix_min array where each element is the minimum cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start: list of vouchers sorted by their start day. Then, a suffix_min array where each element is the minimum cost from that index to the end.\n\nSo for example, for the sorted_by_end list:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers with duration k, key=lambda v: v.end_day)\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_by_start:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers with duration k, key=lambda v: v.start_day)\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\nfor i in len-2 downto 0:\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these structures are built, for a given query, we can perform binary search on the sorted lists.\n\nNow, for each voucher i, when checking case a, we need to find the largest end_day in the group k's sorted_by_end list that is <= li -1.\n\nHow to do this? Using bisect_right.\n\nFor example, sorted_end_days is a list of the end days of the vouchers in the group sorted by end day. For the voucher i's li -1, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point, then subtract 1 to get the last index where end_day <= target. If the insertion point is 0, then there are no such vouchers.\n\nOnce we have the index, if it's >=0, then the prefix_min at that index gives the minimal cost for case a.\n\nSimilarly for case b: find the first start_day in the group k's sorted_by_start list that is >= ri +1. Using bisect_left. The index gives the first occurrence where start_day is >= target. If the index is within the list, then the suffix_min at that index gives the minimal cost for case b.\n\nSo, for each group, we need to have the sorted lists and the prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, we can create a dictionary, say, duration_groups, where keys are the durations, and the values are tuples containing (sorted_by_end_list, prefix_min_list, sorted_by_start_list, suffix_min_list).\n\nBut for each duration k, we need to generate these structures.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n up to 2e5, and per voucher processing, this is manageable.\n\nBut how to handle the sorted lists and the prefix/suffix mins.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read all n vouchers, storing li, ri, cost.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute d = ri - li + 1.\n\nThen, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration k, collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nOnce all vouchers are grouped, for each group (each duration k), process the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher in the original list, check if x - d exists in the duration_groups. If so, proceed to check case a and case b.\n\nNow, for each voucher i:\n\nd = ri - li + 1\n\nk = x -d\n\nif k not in duration_groups, continue.\n\nElse:\n\ngroup = duration_groups[k]\n\nFor case a:\n\nWe need to find vouchers in group with end_day <= li -1.\n\nThe sorted_by_end list for the group is sorted by end_day. So we can extract the list of end_days, and perform a binary search.\n\nBut to do that, perhaps for each group, we can precompute a list of end_days, sorted, and the prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for the start_days.\n\nSo, for example, for the group's sorted_by_end list, we can have:\n\nsorted_ends = [voucher.ri for voucher in sorted_by_end]\n\nBut perhaps during the processing of the group, we can create a list of end_days, and then use bisect on that list.\n\nBut for each group, during preprocessing, we can create:\n\nsorted_ends = [v.ri for v in sorted_by_end]\n\nSimilarly for sorted_starts = [v.li for v in sorted_by_start].\n\nSo, for case a:\n\ntarget = li - 1\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, target) to find the insertion index. The number of elements <= target is the insertion index. If it's 0, no such vouchers. Else, the prefix_min at index (insertion_index -1) is the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case b:\n\ntarget = ri + 1\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, target) to find the first index where start_day >= target. If the index is within the list, then the suffix_min at that index is the minimal cost.\n\nOnce we have these values, we can take the minimum between case a and case b (if any exist), and add to the current voucher's cost. Then track the global minimum.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, what about the time complexity?\n\nFor each voucher, the processing of case a and case b is O(log m), where m is the number of vouchers in the group for duration k. Since for all groups, the sum of m across all groups is n, the total time is O(n log n).\n\nSo overall, the algorithm is O(n log n), which should be acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: x is 0. But according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no, the input says x can be as low as 2? Wait, the input says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x is at least 2.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers have durations adding up to x, but overlapping. So they can't be chosen.\n\nAnother case: when there are multiple vouchers with same duration and different start/end times.\n\nAnother case: when x is such that x -d is zero. But since d is at least 1 (since li ≤ ri, duration is ri - li +1 ≥ 1). So x -d can be zero only if x =d. But since x is at least 2, and d can be 1. So for example, if x is 2, and d is 1, then x -d is 1. So that's okay.\n\nNow, what about when x -d is negative? Well, since d is the duration of voucher i, which is ≥1. So x -d can be negative if x is less than d. But since x is the total duration required, and we need two vouchers with durations adding to x. So, for a voucher with duration d, x -d must be ≥1. Because the other voucher must have duration ≥1. So, if x -d is less than 1, then there is no possible voucher j. So during processing, for each voucher i, we can check if k = x -d is ≥1. Otherwise, skip.\n\nSo in code, for each voucher i:\n\nd = ri - li + 1\n\nk = x -d\n\nif k <1: continue\n\nif k not in duration_groups: continue\n\nSo that's important. Otherwise, for example, if x is 2 and d is 3 (but that's impossible since x is 2 and d is 3, but then x -d is -1, which is invalid).\n\nSo, adding that check is important.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. For each voucher, check if there's a voucher with duration 5 -d.\n\nFor the first voucher, d is 3. So k is 5-3=2. So look for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nIn the group for duration 2, there are three vouchers: the second, third, fourth.\n\nProcessing the first voucher (li=1, ri=3, cost=4). For case a: find vouchers in duration 2 group with end_day <= li-1 = 0. Which is impossible. So case a gives nothing. For case b: find vouchers in duration 2 group with start_day >= ri +1 = 3 +1 =4. The vouchers in the duration 2 group are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2 → duration 2\n\nvoucher 4: li=1, ri=2 → duration 2\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, ri=6 → duration 2.\n\nSo the sorted_by_start list for duration 2 is sorted by li. So vouchers 2 and 4 have li=1, voucher 3 has li=5. So sorted_starts would be [1,1,5]. So for target 4, bisect_left finds the first index where start_day >=4. Which is 2 (since 5 is the first element >=4). The suffix_min for index 2 is the cost of voucher 3, which is 1. So case b gives 1. So total cost is 4+1=5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother voucher in the group: for example, the third voucher (duration 2). For this voucher, d is 2. So k is 5-2=3. So look for vouchers with duration 3. There is one voucher (the first one). So for case a: check if there's a voucher with duration 3 that ends before li of voucher 3 (li is 5). The voucher with duration 3 ends at 3. So 3 <=5-1=4? Yes. So case a would find that voucher. So the cost is 4. Then case b would check for vouchers with duration 3 that start after 6 (voucher 3's ri is 6). So no such vouchers. So total is 4 +1=5. Which is same as before.\n\nSo the code should capture that.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's think about data structures.\n\nWe can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Then, for grouping, we can use a defaultdict to map durations to a list of vouchers.\n\nOnce grouped, for each duration, we process the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, and their respective prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nIn Python, for each duration k in the groups:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1]) → sorted by ri.\n\nsorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nsorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\nsuffix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSo for each group, we can precompute these.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each with li, ri, cost. Store as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, create a dictionary (say, from collections import defaultdict) called duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers (tuples).\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the sorted lists and precompute prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher in the original list, compute d, check if k = x -d is >=1 and exists in duration_dict.\n\nIf yes, then process case a and case b.\n\nNow, for case a:\n\ngroup = duration_dict[k]\n\nsorted_ends = [voucher's ri for each in group's sorted_by_end]\n\nprefix_min array.\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_right on sorted_ends with target li -1.\n\nIf the insertion index is 0, then no vouchers. Else, the minimal cost is prefix_min[insertion_index -1].\n\nFor case b:\n\nsorted_starts is [voucher's li for each in group's sorted_by_start]\n\ntarget is ri + 1.\n\nUse bisect.bisect_left on sorted_starts with target. If the index is within the length of the list, then the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nSo, during the preprocessing for each group, we need to have:\n\nsorted_by_end list, sorted_ends, prefix_min.\n\nsorted_by_start list, sorted_starts, suffix_min.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python:\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict:\n\nvouchers_in_group = duration_dict[k]\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nsorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2])\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nsorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2])\n\nThen, for each group, we can store these four things: sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can store a tuple of (sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to store that? For example, for the duration_dict, we can have for each key k, a dictionary with entries for 'sorted_ends', 'prefix_min', etc.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can create a structure that holds all these.\n\nBut perhaps for code clarity, we can create for each duration k, a tuple (sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min).\n\nSo, during the preprocessing:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_info = defaultdict(lambda: None)  # Or some structure.\n\nBut perhaps:\n\nduration_data = {}\n\nfor k in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers = duration_dict[k]\n\n    # process sorted by end\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    sorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n    prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\n    # process sorted by start\n\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    sorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\n    suffix_min = [ ... ]\n\n    duration_data[k] = (sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min)\n\nOnce that is done, during the processing of each voucher, for case a and b, we can access these arrays.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nBut for the duration_dict, perhaps we need to precompute the groups. Let me think.\n\nBut during the initial grouping, the duration_dict is built as follows:\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li +1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nOnce that is done, for each key in duration_dict, we process the data.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut in Python, for each group, the code would be:\n\nOnce the duration_dict is built, create a new dictionary, say, preprocessed_data, where for each duration k, we have the sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min.\n\nNow, for each voucher in the original list:\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li +1\n\n    k = x -d\n\n    if k <1 or k not in preprocessed_data:\n\n        continue\n\n    # process case a and case b\n\n    # get the preprocessed data for k\n\n    sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min = preprocessed_data[k]\n\n    # case a: find vouchers with end <= li -1\n\n    target_a = li -1\n\n    # use bisect on sorted_ends\n\n    import bisect\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, target_a)\n\n    min_cost_a = infinity\n\n    if idx >0:\n\n        min_cost_a = prefix_min[idx-1]\n\n    # case b: find vouchers with start >= ri +1\n\n    target_b = ri +1\n\n    idx_b = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, target_b)\n\n    min_cost_b = infinity\n\n    if idx_b < len(sorted_starts):\n\n        min_cost_b = suffix_min[idx_b]\n\n    # now, current total is cost + min(min_cost_a, min_cost_b)\n\n    current_min = min( min_cost_a, min_cost_b )\n\n    if current_min is not infinity:\n\n        global_min = min( global_min, cost + current_min )\n\nSo, in code, we need to initialize the global_min to something like infinity, and after processing all vouchers, if it's still infinity, output -1 else output the global_min.\n\nBut what about when both case a and case b have valid options? We take the minimum between them.\n\nBut what if one is valid and the other is not?\n\nSo, in code, for each voucher, we check both cases, and take the minimum possible.\n\nNow, what about the case when there are multiple vouchers in the same group, and the minimal cost is found in either case a or case b?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample, when processing the first voucher (d=3, k=2), the preprocessed_data for k=2 would have:\n\nsorted_ends is the list of ri's of vouchers with duration 2. The vouchers are (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). When sorted by ri, they are sorted as (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1) ? No. Wait, the ri for the first voucher is 2, second is 2, third is 6. So sorted by ri, they are ordered as (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). Wait, no. The ri is 2, 2, 6. So when sorted by ri, the first two are same. So sorted_by_end would be the two vouchers with ri=2 (their order depends on their li, but since the key is ri, they are considered equal. So the sorted_by_end would be sorted in any order. But for the prefix_min, the order may affect the prefix_min. However, since we take the minimum, it's okay. For example, if two vouchers have same ri, but different costs, the prefix_min would take the minimum between them.\n\nIn the sample, the three vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5)\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4)\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1)\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by ri. So the first two have ri=2, the third has ri=6. So sorted_ends is [2, 2, 6]. The prefix_min array would be:\n\nprefix_min[0] = 5\n\nprefix_min[1] = min(5,4) =4\n\nprefix_min[2] = min(4, 1) =1.\n\nSo for case a, target_a is li-1 =1-1=0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. So idx=0, which is not >0. So case a is invalid.\n\nFor case b, target_b is ri +1 =3+1=4. The sorted_starts for the group is sorted by li. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, voucher4: li=1, voucher3: li=5. So sorted_starts is [1,1,5]. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. So idx_b=2. suffix_min[2] is 1. So case b gives 1. So total is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to handle the preprocessed_data?\n\nNow, in Python, for each duration, during preprocessing, we need to compute these arrays.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li +1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\npreprocessed_data = dict()\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process sorted_by_end\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    sorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2] )\n\n    # process sorted_by_start\n\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    sorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n\n    # store in preprocessed_data\n\n    preprocessed_data[d] = (sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min)\n\n# Now, process each voucher to find the minimal total cost\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li +1\n\n    k = x - d\n\n    if k <1 or k not in preprocessed_data:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the preprocessed data for k\n\n    sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min = preprocessed_data[k]\n\n    # case a: find vouchers with end <= li-1\n\n    target_a = li -1\n\n    idx_a = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, target_a)\n\n    min_cost_a = float('inf')\n\n    if idx_a >0:\n\n        min_cost_a = prefix_min[idx_a -1]\n\n    # case b: find vouchers with start >= ri +1\n\n    target_b = ri +1\n\n    idx_b = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, target_b)\n\n    min_cost_b = float('inf')\n\n    if idx_b < len(sorted_starts):\n\n        min_cost_b = suffix_min[idx_b]\n\n    current_min = min( min_cost_a, min_cost_b )\n\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n\n        total = cost + current_min\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n\n    print(-1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but in the code above, for the preprocessed_data, the key is d. So for each voucher's k, which is x -d, we check if it's in preprocessed_data.\n\nBut what if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration, but the preprocessed_data for that duration is stored once.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nvouchers:\n\n(1,3,4) → duration 3.\n\n(1,2,5) → duration 2.\n\n(5,6,1) → duration 2.\n\n(1,2,4) → duration 2.\n\nSo duration_dict has keys 3 and 2.\n\npreprocessed_data for 2 is computed as discussed.\n\nProcessing each voucher:\n\nFirst voucher: (1,3,4) → d=3, k=5-3=2. k is in preprocessed_data.\n\nsorted_ends for k=2 is [2,2,6], prefix_min [5,4,1].\n\nsorted_starts for k=2 is [1,1,5], suffix_min [1,1,1].\n\ncase a: target_a =1-1=0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) → returns 0. So no.\n\ncase b: target_b =3+1=4. sorted_starts is [1,1,5]. bisect_left finds first element >=4 → index 2. suffix_min[2] is 1. So current_min is ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, x, and whose total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible pairs of vouchers using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in quickly accessing vouchers that could potentially form valid pairs with other vouchers.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by end day with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by start day with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with a duration that complements the current voucher's duration to sum up to x. Use binary search on the preprocessed lists to efficiently find the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed_data = {}\n    \n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted by end day\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2])\n        \n        # Process sorted by start day\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        \n        preprocessed_data[d] = (sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        k = x - d\n        if k < 1 or k not in preprocessed_data:\n            continue\n        \n        sorted_ends, prefix_min, sorted_starts, suffix_min = preprocessed_data[k]\n        \n        # Case a: find vouchers ending before li\n        target_a = li - 1\n        idx_a = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, target_a)\n        min_cost_a = float('inf')\n        if idx_a > 0:\n            min_cost_a = prefix_min[idx_a - 1]\n        \n        # Case b: find vouchers starting after ri\n        target_b = ri + 1\n        idx_b = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, target_b)\n        min_cost_b = float('inf')\n        if idx_b < len(sorted_starts):\n            min_cost_b = suffix_min[idx_b]\n        \n        current_min = min(min_cost_a, min_cost_b)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookups.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start days.
