They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion of a tournament based on the given string s that dictates the rules for each phase.\n\nFirst, let's understand the tournament structure. There are 2^n teams, and each round halves the number of teams until there's one champion. Each phase corresponds to a round. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), there are 2^(n-1) games. Then phase 2 has 2^(n-2) games, and so on until phase n, which has 1 game.\n\nThe string s tells us for each phase whether the higher or lower skill team wins. For phase i (starting from 1?), if s[i-1] is '0', then in that phase's matches, the lower skill team wins. If it's '1', the higher skill team wins.\n\nOur goal is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. How do we model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, but the tournament results are determined by the rules in s. So for a given x, can we arrange the permutation such that x wins through all the rounds?\n\nWait, but the permutation p determines the initial arrangement of teams. But the problem says that the tournament is structured in a certain way. For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial order matters. However, since p is a permutation, perhaps we can arrange the initial positions of the teams such that x can win through the rounds based on the rules given by s.\n\nBut how do we model the possible paths that x can take through the tournament? Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each round is a level of the tree. For example, in the first round, each pair of teams plays, and the winner proceeds to the next round. The structure of the tournament is fixed, but the initial positions of the teams affect which matches they have to go through.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen freely, maybe we can arrange the teams in such a way that x can reach the final by following the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for x to be the champion.\n\nLet me think for each phase. For example, in phase 1 (the first round), the rules are determined by s[0]. Suppose s[0] is '1', then in each match, the higher skill team wins. So, if x is to survive this phase, it must be that in its initial match, it's the higher skill team. But since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can arrange x's initial match to be against a team with lower skill, so that x wins. But then, in the next phase, the rules change based on s[1], etc.\n\nBut the problem is that the tournament's structure is fixed. For example, in the first round, the teams are paired in order. So the initial arrangement of the teams in the permutation p determines which matches they are in. However, since we can choose any permutation, maybe we can arrange the initial positions so that x can proceed through the tournament according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find for each x, what is the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have in each round.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For x to be the champion, during each phase i, when it's playing in that phase, it must be able to win according to the rule of that phase. But how do we model the required conditions for x to survive each phase?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to be the champion, it must pass through each round. Let's think about the constraints for each round.\n\nLet's think of the tournament as a binary tree. The champion must win log2(2^n) = n rounds. Each round corresponds to a level in the tree. For example, the first round (phase 1) is the first level, and the last round (phase n) is the final match.\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n), during that phase, the rule is given by s[i-1]. Let's consider that during phase i, the team x is in a match. Depending on the rule (s[i-1] is 0 or 1), x needs to be either higher or lower than its opponent in that match.\n\nBut since the opponents depend on the structure of the tournament and the initial arrangement, how can we model the possible opponents x would face in each phase?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x to be the champion, in each phase i, x must be the best or worst in some way, depending on the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion of a tournament based on the given string `s` that dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament. The key insight is to simulate the tournament structure and determine the possible winning skill levels based on the given rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `2^n` teams and `n` phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until a single champion remains.\n2. **Rules per Phase**: Each phase is governed by a rule from the string `s`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', the team with the lower skill level wins; if it is '1', the team with the higher skill level wins.\n3. **Determine Winning Ranges**: For each team skill level `x`, we need to determine if there exists a permutation of teams such that `x` can win all phases according to the rules specified by `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    min_val = 1\n    max_val = 2 ** n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            min_val = (min_val + 1) // 2\n        else:\n            max_val = (max_val - 1) // 2 + 1\n    \n    result = list(range(min_val, max_val + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values for `n` and the string `s`.\n2. **Determine Bounds**: We initialize `min_val` and `max_val` to represent the range of possible winning skill levels. These values are adjusted based on the rules from the string `s`.\n3. **Adjust Bounds**: For each phase in the string `s`, we adjust `min_val` and `max_val`:\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), `min_val` is updated to ensure that the team must be among the top half of the remaining teams.\n   - If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), `max_val` is updated to ensure that the team must be among the bottom half of the remaining teams.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The valid skill levels that can be champions are those within the adjusted range `[min_val, max_val]`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible winning skill levels by iteratively adjusting the bounds based on the tournament rules, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n).",
