They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament proceeds in phases, and each phase's outcome depends on the given string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the matches are decided by whether the higher or lower skill level wins. Our task is to find all integers x that can be the champion given some permutation p of the skill levels.\n\nHmm. Wait, the key here is that the permutation p can be chosen in any way, but the results of the tournament are determined by the string s. So for a given x, we need to determine if there exists a permutation p where x ends up as the champion.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament structure? Let's think recursively. The tournament is a binary tree structure. Each round halves the number of teams. For example, for n=3, there are 8 teams. The first round has 4 games, then 2, then 1.\n\nThe string s tells us for each phase (which corresponds to rounds) whether the matches are decided by higher or lower skill. For example, if s is \"101\", then:\n\n- Phase 1 (first round, 4 games) is determined by higher skill (s[0] is '1').\n- Phase 2 (second round, 2 games) is determined by lower skill (s[1] is '0').\n- Phase 3 (third round, 1 game) is determined by higher skill (s[2] is '1').\n\nSo the question is, for each possible x, can we arrange the permutation p such that x wins all its matches in each phase according to the rules.\n\nBut how do we model the path that x must take through the tournament?\n\nLet me think. For x to be the champion, it must win each of the n rounds. Each round corresponds to a level in the tournament tree. For each round, the way the match is decided depends on the phase.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), each team is paired with another. The winner moves on to phase 2. Then, in phase 2, they are paired again, etc.\n\nBut the exact structure of the pairings depends on the initial arrangement. However, since we can choose any permutation p, perhaps we can arrange the teams in such a way that x can win each round according to the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial order of the teams. For example, the first round pairs team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But the actual skill levels of these teams depend on p. So for x to be the champion, we need to arrange the initial positions so that in each round, when x is in a match, it wins according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's possible values?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for each round (phase), we have some constraints on the possible values of x. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), x must be able to beat its opponent. In phase 2, it must be able to beat another opponent, etc.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model for each round what is the minimal or maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules of the phases.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, depending on the phase's rule (s[i]), x must be either the maximum or minimum in its group of teams that reach that round.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think about the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round i (from 1 to n), the phase is determined by s[i-1] (since the string is 0-based). For example, for the first round (i=1), it's phase 1, which uses s[0].\n\nIn each round, the number of teams is halved. So for round k (where k ranges from 1 to n), the number of teams is 2^{n - k + 1}.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think: for n=3, the first phase (phase 1) has 2^3 / 2 = 4 games, which is 2^(3-1) games. Then phase 2 has 2^(3-2) games, and phase 3 has 2^(3-3) = 1 game.\n\nSo for each phase i (from 1 to n), the number of games is 2^{n - i}.\n\nBut how does this relate to the rounds? Each phase is a round. So the first phase is the first round, the second phase is the second round, etc.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion of a playoff tournament based on given rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure is such that teams are paired in each phase, and the winner of each match advances to the next phase. The winner is determined by either the higher or lower skill level depending on the phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament has $2^n$ teams and consists of $n$ phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' for lower skill wins or '1' for higher skill wins) specified by the input string.\n3. **Determine Winning Skill Levels**: For each possible skill level $x$, we need to check if it can be the champion. This involves ensuring that $x$ can win each phase according to the rules provided.\n\nThe key insight is to model the constraints for each phase recursively. For each phase, we determine the range of possible values that $x$ must fall into to ensure it can win all matches up to that phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # Initialize the range of possible x values\n    low = 1\n    high = 2 ** n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # In this phase, higher skill wins; x must be the maximum in its group\n            # So, the minimum possible value for x in this round is the current low\n            # But to be the max, it needs to be as large as possible.

So, in each phase, we need to ensure that x is larger than all other teams in its bracket.\n            # Therefore, in each such phase, the lower bound is increased to the midpoint + 1.\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            # For '0' (lower wins), x must be the minimum in its group. So, the upper bound is set to mid.\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            high = mid\n    \n    # After processing all phases, the valid x's are from low to high inclusive\n    result = list(range(low, high + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the full range of possible skill levels from 1 to $2^n$.\n2. **Iterate Through Phases**: For each phase, adjust the range of possible values for $x$ based on the rule (higher or lower skill wins).\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), the lower bound of possible values for $x$ is adjusted upwards to ensure it can be the maximum in its bracket.\n   - If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), the upper bound of possible values for $x$ is adjusted downwards to ensure it can be the minimum in its bracket.\n3. **Determine Valid Ranges**: After processing all phases, the valid skill levels that can be champions are those within the final range determined by the adjustments.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible skill levels using a binary search-like technique, ensuring that each adjustment is made in logarithmic time relative to the number of teams, leading to an overall efficient solution.",
