Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from one block (region) to another, where each step involves crossing a road (i.e., moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block here. Each block is a region divided by the roads. The key is to model the regions and find the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region.\n\nBut how do we represent the regions? Since there are n roads, each road divides the plane into two parts. But with multiple roads, the regions are determined by the arrangement of all these lines. However, directly modeling all regions is impossible because the number can be exponential in n. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the movement between regions is allowed if they share a common border. So, each time you cross a road, you move to an adjacent region. The problem reduces to finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph where each node is a region, and edges exist between regions that share a border.\n\nBut how do we model this graph without explicitly knowing all regions?\n\nAlternative idea: For each region, its position can be determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For example, for a line ax + by + c = 0, a point (x,y) will be on one side or the other. So, the region can be represented by a vector of signs, each element corresponding to the sign of the evaluation of the road equation for that point. However, since two regions can be adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign (since crossing that road would flip the sign), but only if they are adjacent along that road.\n\nWait, but maybe the regions can be represented by the signs of each road. For example, if you have two roads, then each region is determined by which side of each road the point is on. So, for each road, the sign of ax + by + c tells us which side of the road the point is on. \n\nSo, the key idea is to model each region as a binary vector (or a tuple) of signs for each road. However, since two regions that differ in exactly one sign are adjacent (because they share a border via that road), but perhaps not always. Wait, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they must be adjacent across that road. Because the road is the boundary between them. Therefore, two regions are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. \n\nBut wait, maybe not. Because two regions could differ in more than one road's sign but still be adjacent? No, I think that's not possible. Because each road is a line, and two regions that share a common border must be separated by exactly one road. So, their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to building a graph where each node is a sign vector (for the home and university points), and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one sign. Then, the minimal steps needed is the minimal number of sign changes required to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. \n\nBut how do we compute that? Well, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed. Since each step corresponds to changing one sign. So, the problem becomes similar to finding the minimal number of differing bits between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector, but considering that each step can flip exactly one bit. However, this is only true if the regions are connected through such steps. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the sign vectors may not be unique. For example, two different regions might have the same sign vector. Wait no, each region is uniquely determined by the signs of all the roads. Because each road divides the plane into two parts, and the combination of all these signs defines a unique region. However, that's only true if the roads are in general position. But even if they are not, each region is uniquely determined by the sign vector. So, the sign vector of a point is unique per region. \n\nTherefore, the home and university are in two regions, each represented by their sign vectors. The minimal steps between them is the minimal number of sign differences between the two vectors. Wait, no. Because each step can change one sign. So, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each differing bit represents a road that needs to be crossed once. \n\nWait, for example, if the home's sign vector has a certain set of signs, and the university's sign vector differs in k positions, then the minimal steps is k. Because you can cross each of those roads once. But is that correct? Let me think.\n\nSuppose there are two roads. Home is in a region where for both roads, the sign is positive. The university is in a region where the first road is positive and the second is negative. Then the Hamming distance is 1. So you can cross the second road once. But how? Because the two regions are adjacent via the second road. So yes, the minimal steps is 1. \n\nAnother example: if the Hamming distance is 2. Then, you need to cross two roads. But can you go through two roads in two steps? Like, cross road A, then cross road B. But perhaps there's a path that requires two steps. \n\nSo, the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step can flip one bit (crossing a road), and the minimal steps is the number of differing bits. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a case where two regions differ in two bits, but there's a path that requires only one step? No, because if they differ in two bits, then they are not adjacent. Because adjacent regions differ in exactly one bit. So to get from one to the other, you need to cross one road, which changes one bit. So, if the Hamming distance is k, the minimal steps is k. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the problem is simply to compute the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's take the sample input. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x + 0y +0 = 0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 → positive. So sign is +.\n\nSecond road (x=0): 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 → positive. Sign is +. So the sign vector is (+, +).\n\nFor university (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: y is -1 → 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. So sign is -.\n\nSecond road: x is -1 → 1*(-1) + 0 +0 = -1 → negative. So sign vector is (-,-). \n\nThe Hamming distance is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSecond sample input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1), three roads: x=0, y=0, and x + y -3 = 0. \n\nLet's compute the sign vectors. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 3: 1 + 1 -3 = -1 → negative. So sign vector is (+, +, -).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x is -1 → -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 2: y is -1 → -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative. So sign vector is (-, -, -). \n\nComparing the two vectors: first two positions differ, third is same. Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the solution is to compute for the home and university points, their sign vectors for each road, count the number of differing positions, and that's the answer. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips one sign. So, the minimal number of steps is the number of differing signs. \n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? For example, suppose two regions differ in two signs. Then, you need to cross two roads. But perhaps there's a way to cross two roads in one step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance. \n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors of the home and university points. \n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For each of the home and university points, compute their sign vector. For each road, compute the value a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. The sign of this value determines the sign in the vector. \n\n2. Compare the sign vectors of the two points. For each road, check if the sign is the same or different. The total number of differing signs is the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if the home and university are in the same region? Then the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither is on a road, but they could be in the same region. However, the problem says that the university is located in some block. So, the code should handle that. \n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. \n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read the input. Then, for each of the two points (home and university), compute for each road the sign of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. \n\nBut how to compute the sign? For each road, compute the value. If it's positive, then the sign is +1, else -1. Or, we can just store whether it's positive or negative. \n\nBut for comparing between home and university, we can compare the sign of each road's evaluation for the two points. \n\nFor example, for each road, compute for home: s1 = sign( a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i ), and for university: s2 = sign( a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i ). If s1 != s2, then that road contributes to the Hamming distance. \n\nBut how to compute the sign? Well, for a given value, we can check if it's positive or negative. Since the problem states that the home and university are not on any road, so the value can't be zero. \n\nSo, for each road, compute the value for home and for university, then check if they have the same sign. \n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1 (home)\n\nRead x2, y2 (university)\n\nRead n, then read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nThen, for each of the two points, compute for each road the value (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i). Then, for each road, check if the signs of the two points are different. Count the number of roads where this is true.\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because each differing sign implies that the two points are on opposite sides of that road. So, to get from home to university, you need to cross that road. But how does that relate to the minimal steps?\n\nWell, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Because each such road must be crossed once. And since each step can cross one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. \n\nBut why is that? Suppose that the home and university are in regions that differ in k roads. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because each step can cross one road. But how can you cross the roads in any order? Because each crossing takes you to a new region. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to cross roads in a way that you can reach the target in fewer steps. For example, if two roads are crossed in a way that their combined effect is equivalent to crossing one road. But no, because each road is a line, and crossing a road flips the sign of that road's equation. So, if the home and university differ in k roads, then you need to cross each of those roads once, regardless of the order. \n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is indeed the number of roads where the signs differ. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n0 1 0 → y = 0.\n\nFor home, 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 → positive. For university: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. So this road contributes 1 to the count.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x = 0. For home: 1*1 + 0 +0 = 1 → positive. For university: 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 → negative. So this contributes another 1. Total 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x + y -3 = 0.\n\nFor the third road, home: 1 + 1 -3 = -1 (negative). University: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 (negative). Same sign. So this road doesn't contribute. The first two roads contribute 1 each. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code implementation. \n\nRead the input. For each of the two points, compute for each road the value. Then compare the sign of each road for the two points.\n\nBut how to compute the sign? For each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. Then, check if val1 and val2 have the same sign. If not, increment the count.\n\nBut how to check if they have the same sign? Well, the product of val1 and val2 must be positive. If it's negative, then the signs are different. \n\nBut since the problem says that the home and university are not on any road, val1 and val2 are not zero. So, for each road, we can compute (val1 * val2) < 0. If so, then the signs differ. \n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nreturn count\n\nYes! That's the code. \n\nWait, but why? Because if val1 and val2 have opposite signs, then the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. So, that road is part of the boundary between the two regions. Therefore, the minimal steps must cross this road. \n\nBut why is the count of such roads equal to the minimal steps? Because each step can cross one road. So, if there are k roads that separate the two regions, then you need to cross each of them once, hence k steps. \n\nBut why can't there be a path that crosses some roads multiple times, leading to a shorter path? For example, suppose that there are two roads that separate the regions. But maybe there's a way to cross one road, then cross another, but then cross back? But that would require more steps than the Hamming distance. \n\nBut the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. Because the Hamming distance is the minimal number of crossings required. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nThis seems too easy for a programming competition problem. But perhaps that's the case. Let's think again. \n\nWhat if there are multiple roads that are overlapping? But the problem says that no two roads are the same. So, each road is unique. \n\nBut the code doesn't care about the arrangement of roads. It just counts the number of roads where the two points are on opposite sides. \n\nBut why is that the minimal steps? Let's think of a scenario where two points are separated by two roads. But the minimal steps is 2. \n\nFor example, imagine two perpendicular roads, dividing the plane into four regions. Suppose home is in the top-right quadrant, and university is in the bottom-left. Then, the two points are separated by both roads. The minimal steps is 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, arranged in a way that the home and university are separated by two roads. Then, the minimal steps is two. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    a, b, c = ... \n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that the answer is 2 for the first case. Which is exactly the count. \n\nYes. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut why can't there be a situation where two roads are crossed in a way that allows you to reach the destination in fewer steps? For example, if two roads are crossed in a way that the two steps can be done in one? \n\nNo, because each road is a line. Crossing a road moves you to a different region. But if two roads are crossed, then the minimal steps is two. \n\nBut perhaps the two roads are arranged in such a way that the regions are connected through another road. But the code counts the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nBut how does that relate to the minimal steps? \n\nLet me think of a scenario where the two points are separated by two roads, but there is a path that requires only one step. \n\nBut that's impossible. Because each step can cross exactly one road. So, if the two regions are separated by two roads, then you need to cross both roads. \n\nBut how can you cross two roads in two steps? \n\nYes. For example, suppose you have two roads, x=0 and y=0. Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The two points are separated by both roads. So you need to cross x=0 and y=0. So, the minimal steps is 2. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nSo, the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's test for the case when the home and university are in the same region. For example, if there are no roads, then the answer is 0. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, n can be 1. For example, if there is one road, but the home and university are on the same side of that road. Then the answer is 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nSo the code is very simple. Now, implement it in Python. \n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the examples, but looking at the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, but that's two test cases. But the actual input is given as per the problem description. The user's code should read from stdin. \n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, the code should read from standard input. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as a string that seems to be two test cases. But perhaps the original problem is that the input is one test case. \n\nWait, the sample input shows two different inputs, each with their own output. But the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. \n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as per the first example. So, the code should read the input as per the problem description. \n\nSo, the code should read the home coordinates, university coordinates, n, then n lines of roads. \n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nThen compute the count as discussed.\n\nSo, the Python code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nBut wait, the sample input for the first case is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives output 2. Which the code would compute correctly.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives output 2. Which the code would compute correctly. \n\nBut why is that? For the third road in the second sample:\n\na=1, b=1, c=-3.\n\nFor home (1,1): 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.\n\nFor university (-1,-1): 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. \n\nval1 * val2 is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. \n\nSo the code returns 2. Which is correct. \n\nThus, this code should work. \n\nBut why is this problem considered hard? Maybe because the initial thinking is complex, but the actual solution is simple. \n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says that the movement is allowed between two blocks if they share a common border. But the code counts the number of roads that separate the two points. However, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. But why is that?\n\nBecause each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. However, what if there's a road that is not separating the two points, but the path requires crossing it?\n\nNo. Because if the two points are in regions that differ in k roads, then the minimal steps is k. \n\nBut how to prove that? \n\nImagine that the home and university regions are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because each step crosses a road. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there exists a path that crosses each of those roads once? \n\nBecause each road that separates the two points is part of the boundary between the regions. So, the home region and the university region are in different regions. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to cross roads that are not separating them. For example, if you cross a road that doesn't separate them, but then cross another road. But that would not help. \n\nBut how can you cross a road that doesn't separate them? Because that would take you to a region that is on the same side of that road. But then, you would have to cross other roads. \n\nBut the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nSo, the code is as simple as that. \n\nThus, the Python code as written above should work.\n",
