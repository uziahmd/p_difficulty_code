Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads in a plane. The home and university are each in their own blocks. We need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block if they share a nonzero boundary segment. \n\nThe key here is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, the number of blocks can be huge, but maybe we don't need to represent all of them. Instead, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, perform BFS from the home block to find the shortest path to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Well, since each block can be identified by the sign of the equations of the roads. For example, each road divides the plane into two regions. For each road, the block is on one side or the other. So, for each road, the block can be represented by a binary value (like +1 or -1) indicating which side of the line it's on. However, with n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations, which is way too big for n=300. That's impossible.\n\nWait, but that approach isn't feasible for n=300. So there must be another way. Let's think again.\n\nAnother idea: The problem is similar to a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges connect regions that are adjacent. But how do we compute the adjacency without knowing all regions?\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block is on one side of the line. So, for each road, we can determine whether the home is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut how do we model the transitions between blocks? Because moving across a road changes the sign of exactly one equation. So, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Wait, but that's only if the two regions share a common border. Because crossing a single road would take you from one region to another adjacent one. However, if two regions differ by more than one road's sign, then they might not be adjacent. But how do I know?\n\nWait, the problem says that moving between two blocks is allowed if their common border has a non-zero length. Which implies that they are separated by exactly one road. Because if two blocks are separated by multiple roads, they might not be adjacent. So, the adjacency is when two blocks differ by exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's region to the university's region.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let me think. The home's region can be represented by a vector of signs (for each road, whether the home is on the positive or negative side). Similarly for the university. The question is: what's the minimal number of roads where the signs differ between the home and university's vectors. Because each step can change one sign. Wait, but that's only if the two regions are adjacent via that road. But maybe there's a way to model this as a graph where each node is a state of signs, and edges connect states that differ by exactly one sign. But with n=300, that's impossible to store all possible states.\n\nBut wait, the home and university are fixed points. So maybe we can model this as a BFS where each state is the set of roads that have been crossed. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: For each road, compute whether the home is on one side or the other. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem becomes: find the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped (i.e., the signs differ between home and university) such that the home's sign vector can reach the university's sign vector by flipping one sign at a time. But that's equivalent to the Hamming distance between the two vectors. However, that's not correct because the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits, but each step can flip one bit. So the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. But wait, no. Because if the home and university have a Hamming distance of k, then the minimal steps would be k. Because each step flips one road. But why?\n\nWait, suppose that the home's sign vector is S and the university's is T. The Hamming distance between S and T is the number of roads where S and T differ. Let's say that's k. Then, the minimal number of steps needed is k. Because each step can flip one road's sign. But why is that possible? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, if you need to flip k roads, you can do it in k steps. However, is there a case where you can't do it in k steps? For example, if some roads are redundant. Or maybe not. Because each step is crossing a road, which changes the sign of exactly one road.\n\nBut this seems too simplistic. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1)\nn=2 roads: 0x+1y+0=0 → y=0, and 1x+0y+0=0 → x=0.\n\nSo, the home (1,1) is above y=0 (so sign for first road is +1?), and to the right of x=0 (sign for second road is +1). The university is (-1,-1): below y=0 (so sign -1 for first road), left of x=0 (sign -1 for second road). So the home's sign vector is (+1, +1), university's is (-1, -1). Hamming distance is 2. So steps needed is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1), n=3 roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nLet's compute the signs for home and university.\n\nFor road 1: x=0. Home (1,1) is x>0 → sign +1. University x=-1 <0 → sign -1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0. Home y=1>0 → +1. University y=-1 <0 → -1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → sign -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → same sign. So the sign vectors for home and university differ in first two roads. Hamming distance is 2. So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the answer is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But why is that?\n\nBecause each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign of exactly one road. So, if you need to change k signs, you can do it in k steps. But why can't there be a shorter path? Because each step changes exactly one sign. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing signs. Because each differing sign must be flipped once.\n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping roads? Like, if two roads are parallel, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the Hamming distance would be 2. But can you cross one road and then cross another? But that would require two steps. So yes, the minimal steps is 2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: for each road, compute whether the home is on the positive or negative side, same for the university. Then, count the number of roads where the signs differ between home and university. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the sign for each road for home and university?\n\nFor a given road equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For a point (x0, y0), compute the value s = a_i x0 + b_i y0 + c_i. If s > 0, then the point is on one side; if s <0, on the other. Since the home and university are not on any road, s can't be zero.\n\nSo for each road, compute the sign of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) for home, and same for university. Then, compare for each road if the signs are different. The total count is the answer.\n\nWait, that's it? Then why the problem is considered hard? Because maybe there's some mistake in this reasoning.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that the home and university are in the same block. Then, the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither home nor university is on a road. But they could be in the same block. So, the code would check for that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimal steps to get from home's block to university's block. So, if they are in the same block, the answer is zero. Otherwise, the answer is the number of roads where the signs differ between home and university.\n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nBecause each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing roads. Because you can cross each differing road once, and that would take you from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads?\n\nFor example, imagine that there are two roads, and the home and university differ in both roads. So, the Hamming distance is 2. So, the answer is 2. But how can you cross both roads? Because each step crosses a road. So, you can cross the first road, then cross the second. But each crossing changes the sign of that road. So, after crossing two roads, you end up with the opposite signs for both roads. Thus, the minimal steps is indeed 2.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where the Hamming distance is k, but the actual minimal steps is less than k?\n\nSuppose that the home and university differ in two roads. But there's a way to cross one road and reach the university's block. How?\n\nNo, because each step changes exactly one road's sign. So, after one step, you have a sign vector that differs in one road from the home. But the university's sign vector differs in two roads. So, you can't reach it in one step. Hence, the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the number of roads where the sign of the home and university differ.\n\nBut wait, what if there are some roads that are not crossed? For example, suppose that the home and university differ in two roads. But maybe there's a way to cross one road and then cross another, but the two roads are arranged in such a way that crossing them in sequence leads to the university's block. But that would require two steps, which is the Hamming distance.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. If they are different, increment the count. The answer is that count.\n\nBut why does this work? Because each step allows you to cross one road, changing the sign for that road. So, the minimal number of steps is the number of differing roads. Because each differing road must be crossed once.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where you cross a road that's not in the differing set? For example, suppose that the home and university are in the same block, but the code counts zero. Which is correct. But if there's a road that is not in the differing set, but crossing it would somehow allow you to reach the university's block. But that's impossible, since the university's block is determined by the signs of all roads. So, if you cross a road that's not in the differing set, then you would change the sign of that road, which would make the sign vector differ from the university's in that road. So, that would not help.\n\nThus, the answer is indeed the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, but this seems too easy. But the sample inputs match this approach. Let me think of some test cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (1,1). Then, the answer is zero. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home is on one side of a single road, university on the other. Answer is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: home and university are on opposite sides of two roads. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nBut why is the problem considered hard? Maybe there's a mistake in this reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nWhat if there are two roads that are parallel. Suppose home is on one side of both roads, and university is on the other side of both. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But can you cross one road and reach the university's block? No, because crossing one road would take you to a region that's on the other side of that road, but still on the same side of the other road. So, you need to cross both roads. Hence, the answer is 2. Which matches the Hamming distance.\n\nAnother case: two roads that intersect. Suppose the home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both. So, the Hamming distance is 2. The minimal steps would be two steps, crossing each road once. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the home and university are in regions that differ in three roads, but there's a way to cross two roads and reach the university's region? How?\n\nNo, because each step flips exactly one road's sign. So, to reach the university's region, you need to flip all roads where the signs differ. So, the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing roads.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n- For each road, calculate the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) for home and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i) for university.\n\n- For each road, check if the signs of these two values are different. Count the number of such roads.\n\n- Output this count.\n\nWait, but why? Because each such differing road requires crossing once.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1).\n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → equation is 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0.\n\nFor home: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0. For university: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So signs differ. Count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. Home: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0. University: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1 <0. Differ. Count becomes 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. For home: 1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0. University: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1 <0. Differ.\n\nRoad 2: 0 1 0 → y=0. Home: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0. University: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Differ.\n\nRoad 3: 1 1 -3 → equation x + y -3 =0. For home: 1 +1 -3 = -1 <0. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Same sign. So no difference. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the problem is actually easier than it seems. The key insight is that the minimal steps required is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nSo the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 and s2 have different signs, increment the count. Finally, output the count.\n\nBut wait, how to check if s1 and s2 have different signs? Well, if s1 * s2 < 0, then they have different signs. Because if one is positive and the other negative, their product is negative. If they are same sign, product is positive. So for each road, check if (s1 * s2) < 0. If yes, count +=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, that's all? That's the code?\n\nYes. Because the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is exactly that number.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the home and university are in different regions. Each time you cross a road, you change the sign for that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThis seems to be the case. But why didn't the problem mention anything about this approach? Because perhaps the problem is designed to trick people into thinking it's a BFS problem, but the actual solution is simple.\n\nBut let's think again. What if the home and university are in regions that are separated by k roads, but there's a way to cross some roads and reach the university's region in fewer steps?\n\nBut how? Because each step can cross exactly one road. So, if the home and university differ in k roads, then you need to cross each of those roads once. So, the minimal steps is k. Because each step can cross one road. So, the answer is indeed k.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nLet me check another example. Suppose that there are three roads, and the home and university differ in two roads. So the answer is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct. Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Let me write it.\n\nNow, considering that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains two integers for home. Second line for university. Third line is n, then n lines for the roads.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the first example. So, the code must read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but in the actual problem, the input is one test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich outputs 2.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich outputs 2.\n\nBut the code must read one test case. So the code is written for a single test case.\n\nSo the code will read:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute count as explained.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, reading from stdin can be done with input().split(), but sometimes for multiple lines, we need to read properly.\n\nBut the code must read the input correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n from third line.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\ns1 for first road: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. s2: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. s2: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count becomes 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nx1=1, y1=1. x2=-1, y2=-1. n=3.\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\ns1: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. s2: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0 1 0 → s1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. s2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count becomes 2.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → s1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. s2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3= -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no increment. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where home and university are on same side of all roads. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, problem says n is given as 1<=n<=300. So no, n can't be zero.\n\nAnother case: a road where home is on positive side, university on positive side. So no count.\n\nAnother case: a road where home is positive, university negative. Counted once.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is as simple as that.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university blocks can be identified by their positions relative to these roads. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate these two blocks. Specifically, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed once. Thus, the solution involves counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Calculation:** For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates. This value determines which side of the road the point lies on.\n3. **Opposite Sides Check:** If the product of the values calculated for the home and university coordinates is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road. This road must be crossed, so we increment our count.\n4. **Output Result:** The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
