Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem statement first.\n\nSo, the problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are rounded down. We need to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear on both progress bars at the same time.\n\nHmm. So for each byte copied, there's a moment when the progress bars update. But since each byte is processed one after another, we need to check for every possible byte copied (for each file) what the two percentages are and see if they match.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for each file i, and for each byte x (from 1 to a_i), we can calculate the current percentage for the first bar as floor(100 * x / a_i). For the total percentage, it's floor(100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x) / total_sum).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all files is fixed. Let's call total_sum = sum(a_1 ... a_n). Then, for each byte copied in the process, the total bytes copied so far is sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of all previous files (before current file i) and x is the current byte in the current file.\n\nSo the approach would be to simulate each byte being copied, compute both percentages, and track when they are equal. But since the number of bytes could be up to 1000 per file and n up to 100, the total bytes could be up to 100*1000 = 10^5. Which is manageable, right?\n\nWait, but for each byte, we have to process it. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFor each file i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum of a_1 ... a_{i-1}\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_byte_total = sum_prev + x\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n       total_percent = (100 * current_byte_total) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut also, we need to consider the initial state (before any bytes are copied) where both are 0. Because the problem says that at the beginning, both show 0. So 0 is always present. Also, when the last byte is copied, the total percent is 100, and the current percent for the file is 100. So 100 is also always present.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement: after copying each byte, the progress bars update. So for the initial state (before any bytes are copied), the bars are 0. But when the first byte is copied, then the bars are updated. However, the problem says that the initial state counts as 0. So we need to include 0 in the output if it's present. But how?\n\nBecause the initial state is before any bytes are copied. But according to the note in the first example, when there's one file, the bars are always the same. So for the first example, the output includes 0 and 100. So the initial 0 is considered, and the final 100 is considered.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is considered as a moment where both are 0. And after the last byte is copied, the total is 100% for both.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nWell, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. But the initial state (0%) is considered as a valid moment. So we need to check that 0 is included. Similarly, after all bytes are copied, the total is 100% for both. So 100 is included.\n\nBut how to capture those moments?\n\nIn our simulation, when processing each byte, we have the current percent and the total percent. However, the initial state (before any bytes) is not covered by this. So we need to add 0 to the set if it's possible. But in the case where the first byte is copied, the initial state is 0, and during the simulation, when x=0? Or maybe not. Wait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the first byte is copied, and after that, the progress bars are updated. But the initial state is before that. So perhaps the initial 0 is a separate case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial state shows 0. So we need to check if 0 is a valid value. Similarly, after all bytes are copied, the total is 100% for both. So the 100% is also a valid value.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set to collect all valid percentages.\n\n- Check if 0 is a valid value. Since at the very start, both are 0. So 0 is definitely in the set.\n\n- Then, simulate each byte being copied. For each such byte, compute the current and total percentages. If they are equal, add to the set.\n\n- Also, check if 100 is present. Because when all bytes are copied, the total is 100% for both. So after the last byte is copied, the total is 100. But during the simulation, when x is a_i (the last byte of the last file), the current percent for that file is 100. The total is 100. So during the simulation, that moment will be captured. However, in some cases, maybe the total is 100% before all bytes are copied? No, because total_sum is the sum of all files. So when all bytes are copied, the total is exactly 100%.\n\nBut during simulation, for the last byte, the total is 100. So that case is handled. So perhaps 100 is already included in the simulation.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input, which is 1 file of size 6. The total_sum is 6. So when x is 6, the total bytes copied is 6, so total_percent is 100*6/6 = 100. So floor(100) is 100. So during the simulation, that case is captured. Therefore, the code would include 100 in the set.\n\nBut in the first sample output, 0 and 100 are included. So the initial 0 is added, and the 100 is captured during simulation.\n\nSo, the initial 0 is a special case. So the code needs to check for 0. But how?\n\nWait, in the simulation, when x is 0? Well, no. Because x starts from 1. So the initial 0 is not covered by the simulation. So we need to add 0 to the set if it's possible. But in the problem statement, the initial state is considered as a moment where both are 0. So regardless of anything else, 0 is always present. So the code should add 0 to the set.\n\nSimilarly, the final 100% is captured during simulation.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize a set with 0.\n\nThen, simulate each byte being copied, adding any matching percentages to the set.\n\nAdditionally, check if 100 is in the set. Well, during simulation, when the last byte is copied, the total is 100. So that case is covered.\n\nBut wait, let's take the first sample input. The first sample has n=1, a_1=6. So the total_sum is 6. For each x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/6, floored.\n\ntotal_percent = (100*(x))/6, floored. So they are the same. So for each x, the two percentages are same. So all the percentages from 0 to 100 (but only integer values) are included. But in the sample output, the first case is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100. Wait, why is that?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For x from 1 to 6:\n\nx=1: 100*1/6 = 16.666..., floored to 16. So both bars show 16. So 16 is added.\n\nx=2: 33.333... → 33.\n\nx=3: 50.\n\nx=4: 66.666 → 66.\n\nx=5: 83.333 → 83.\n\nx=6: 100 → 100.\n\nSo during simulation, the percentages 16,33,50,66,83,100 are added. Then, the initial 0 is added. So the set is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}, which matches the first sample output. So the code must include 0 as a starting point.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n- Compute total_sum.\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- For each file i, compute sum_prev (the sum of all previous files).\n\n- For each x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   current_byte_total = sum_prev + x\n\n   current_percent = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n   total_percent = (100 * current_byte_total) // total_sum\n\n   if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nOnce all these steps are done, collect all the elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when all bytes are copied. For example, in the first sample, when x=6, the total is 100. So that is included. But what if the total_sum is not divisible by 100? For example, if total_sum is 101, then the total_percent after all bytes is 100 * 101 / 101 = 100, so yes. So the code captures that.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all the bytes, and for each, check the two percentages. So the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n, then list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result, and add 0 to it.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_byte_total = sum_prev + x\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_percent = (100 * current_byte_total) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result.\n\nOnce all done, collect the sorted list of elements in result.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev for each i? Well, we can precompute the prefix sums.\n\nFor example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So for the i-th file (0-based?), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nWait, for example, for the first file (i=0), sum_prev is 0. For the second file (i=1), sum_prev is a[0], etc.\n\nSo, in Python, we can compute prefix_sums as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev = prefix_sums[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can proceed like that.\n\nNow, considering that the maximum number of bytes is 100 * 1000 = 1e5, which is manageable. For each byte, the calculations are O(1), so the total time is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\ntotal_sum = 6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6].\n\nFor i=0, sum_prev is 0.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_byte_total = 0 + x = x.\n\ncurrent_percent = 100x//6.\n\ntotal_percent = 100x//6.\n\nSo same as current_percent. So for x=1, 16; x=2, 33, etc. All added. So the result set is {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample is the second input:\n\n2\n\n100 500 → total_sum is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor the first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, size 100).\n\nx runs from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_byte_total = 0 + x = x.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/100 = x → floored as x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100x)/600 → floor.\n\nSo for x=1, current is 1, total is 0.166... → 0. So not equal.\n\nOnly when current_percent equals total_percent.\n\nLet's see for x= 600 * k / 100 ?\n\nNot sure. But during simulation, for each x, we check.\n\nBut the sample output for this input is 0,95,96,...,100.\n\nBut according to the note, the first progress bar goes ahead, then resets and catches up again. So during the first file, the first bar is x percent, and the total is (x / 600)*100. So for x=100, the first bar is 100% (current file done), but the total is (100/600)*100 = 16.666... → 16. So after the first file is done, the total is 16.666... So during the first file, the first bar is higher than the total bar, but after the first file is done, the total bar is 16.666, and the first bar is 100% (but then the next file starts).\n\nBut when the second file (size 500) is being copied, the sum_prev is 100. For x in 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_byte_total = 100 + x.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 500.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nWe need to find when these two are equal.\n\nFor example, when x is 500, the current percent is (100*500)/500 = 100, and total is (100*(100 + 500 )) / 600 = (600 * 100)/600 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut during the second file's processing, there might be some x where the two percentages are equal.\n\nThe sample output for this case is 0, 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo 95 is present. How?\n\nLet me think for the second file. Let's say x is such that (100x)//500 = (100*(100 + x )) // 600.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x) // 500 = floor( (x/5) )\n\ntotal_percent = floor( ( (100 + x ) * 100 ) / 600 )\n\nWe need to find x where these are equal.\n\nLet me take x= 475.\n\ncurrent_percent = (475 * 100)/500 = 95.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 + 475) * 100 / 600 = 575 * 100 / 600 = 57500 / 600 = 95.833... → floor is 95. So equal. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, x=480:\n\ncurrent_percent = 480 * 100 / 500 = 96.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 + 480) * 100 / 600 = 580 * 100 / 600 = 58000 / 600 = 96.666... → floor 96. So equal. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=485:\n\ncurrent is 97, total is (585 * 100)/600 = 97.5 → 97. So equal.\n\nx=490: current is 98, total is (590 * 100)/600 = 98.333 → 98. So equal.\n\nx=495: current is 99, total is 595 * 100 / 600 = 99.166 → 99. Equal.\n\nx=500: current is 100, total is 600*100/600=100. So added.\n\nSo those x's in the second file contribute 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Also, the initial 0. So the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen loop through each file, for each x in 1 to a[i], compute the current and total percentages, and if equal, add to the set.\n\nOnce all done, collect the elements in the set, sort them, and print them each on a new line.\n\nBut in Python, the input is read from stdin. Let me think about the input format.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: n.\n\nSecond line: n integers a_1 ... a_n.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSo the code can read it as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual code, it's read from stdin.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}.\n\nThen for i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_byte_total = sum_prev + x\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_percent = (100 * current_byte_total) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce all done, collect the sorted list of the elements in result.\n\nThen print each element in order, separated by newlines.\n\nBut how to compute prefix_sums?\n\nIn Python:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is zero? Well, the constraints say that each a_i is at least 1, so sum is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nNow, code:\n\nTesting for the first sample:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. total_sum=6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6].\n\nThen, for i=0, sum_prev=0, current_file_size=6.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_byte_total = 0 + x = x.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 6.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * x) // 6.\n\nSo same. So all those percentages are added. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the third input in the examples is:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998 → sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nThe output is 0,50,99,100.\n\nLet me think: during processing, when is the current and total percent equal?\n\nFor example, during the first file (size 1000), sum_prev is 0. For x= 1000, current percent is 100, total is (0 + 1000) * 100 / 2002 = 100000 / 2002 = approx 49.95... → floor is 49. So not equal. So 100 is not added here. But during the processing of the other files?\n\nBut the output includes 50. How?\n\nLet me think. For example, when the first file is being copied, x= 1000 * 50 / 100 = 500. So current percent is 50. Total percent is (500 * 100) / 2002 = 50000 / 2002 ≈ 24.975 → 24. So not equal. So not added.\n\nBut maybe during the fourth file?\n\nLet me think. The fourth file is 998 bytes, and sum_prev is 1000 + 2 + 2 = 1004. So during processing this file, current_byte_total is 1004 + x, where x ranges from 1 to 998.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 998.\n\ntotal_percent is (100 * (1004 + x )) // 2002.\n\nLet me see when x is 998: current_percent is (100 * 998) // 998 = 100. total_percent is (100 * (1004 + 998 )) // 2002 → (100 * 2002) / 2002 → 100. So 100 is added.\n\nWhat about when x is 1001? No, because x is up to 998. Hmm.\n\nBut the output includes 50. How?\n\nMaybe during the second or third file?\n\nLet me think. The second file is 2 bytes. sum_prev is 1000. For x=1, current_byte_total is 1000 + 1 = 1001. current_percent is (100 * 1)/2 = 50. total_percent is (100 * 1001) / 2002 = 100100 / 2002 = 50.0... exactly? Let's compute:\n\n2002 * 50 = 100100. So yes. So 100100 / 2002 = 50. So the total_percent is 50. So current_percent is 50. So 50 is added. That's why 50 is in the output.\n\nAh! So during the second file, when x=1, current_percent is 50, total_percent is 50. So that's added. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code implementation:\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, then a.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize result as a set containing 0.\n\nThen loop through each file, and for each x in 1 to a[i], compute the two percentages and add if equal.\n\nFinally, sort the result and print each element.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_byte_total = sum_prev + x\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_percent = (100 * current_byte_total) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but the sample outputs have the numbers separated by newlines. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is each on a separate line.\n\nBut in the code, the code prints each number in sorted_result on a separate line. So the code is correct.\n\nBut let's check the sample input 2:\n\nInput is 2, 100 500. Output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. Which the code would generate.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the same percentage is generated multiple times? The set takes care of duplicates.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, check for the case when the total_sum is 100. For example, n=1, a=[100]. Then during x=100, the current percent is 100, total is 100. So 100 is in the set. Also, during x=50, current is 50, total is (50 * 100)/100 = 50. So added. So the code would generate 0, 50, 100, etc.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum is 1. For x=1, current_percent is 100*1//1 = 100. total_percent is (1 * 100)/1 = 100. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nBut during the simulation, x runs from 1 to 1. So for x=1, the code adds 100. So the output is 0, 100.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[1,1]. total_sum = 2. For each byte:\n\nFirst file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 = 100. total_percent = (1 * 100) // 2 = 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_byte_total = 1 + 1 = 2. current_percent = (100 * 1) // 1 = 100. total_percent = (2 * 100) // 2 = 100. So added. So the result is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum is 4.\n\nFirst file:\n\nx=1: current_percent is 50. total is (1 * 100)/4 = 25. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current is 100. total is (2 * 100)/4 = 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file:\n\nsum_prev = 2.\n\nx=1: current_byte_total = 3. current_percent is 100*1//2 = 50. total is (3*100)/4 = 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_byte_total is 4. current_percent is 100. total is 100. So added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nBut during the second file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is 50. total is 75. Not equal.\n\nBut during the first file, x=1, current is 50, total is 25. Not equal.\n\nBut what about when the total is 50?\n\nIs there any moment when both are 50?\n\nFor example, during the second file, x= 2:\n\ncurrent_byte_total is 2 + 2 =4. total is 100. current is 100. Not 50.\n\nBut in the first file, when x=2, current is 100, total is 50. Not equal.\n\nBut what about during the second file, x=1: current is 50, total is 75. No.\n\nSo the code returns 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[3, 3]. total_sum = 6.\n\nFirst file:\n\nx=3: current is 100, total is (3 * 100)/6 = 50.\n\nSecond file: sum_prev is 3.\n\nx=3: current_byte_total is 3 + 3 =6. current_percent is (3 * 100)/3 = 100. total is (6 * 100)/6 = 100.\n\nBut during the second file, x=2:\n\ncurrent_byte_total is 3+2=5. current_percent is (2*100)/3 = 66.666 → 66. total is 5*100/6 = 83.333 → 83. Not equal.\n\nBut during the first file, x= 2:\n\ncurrent_percent is (2*100)/3 = 66. total is (2 * 100)/6 = 33.333 → 33. Not equal.\n\nBut is there any moment where both are 50?\n\nLet me see. For example, when current_byte_total is 3 (first file x=3), total is 50. current_percent is 100. Not equal.\n\nBut during the second file, when current_byte_total is 3 (sum_prev=3, x=0? No. So no. So no.\n\nBut what about when the current_byte_total is 3 (sum_prev=0, x=3) → current_percent is 100, total is 50. Not equal.\n\nSo no 50 in the result. Only 0 and 100.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar indicates the percentage of the current file copied, while the second indicates the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files processed up to each file.\n3. **Progress Tracking**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate both the current file progress and the overall progress. Check if these values are equal and collect such values.\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensure the initial state (0%) and the final state (100%) are included in the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_byte_total = sum_prev + x\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_percent = (100 * current_byte_total) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their sizes. These are read and stored in a list.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums array helps in quickly determining the cumulative size of files processed before the current file, which is essential for calculating the overall progress.\n3. **Simulating Copy Process**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file's progress and the overall progress. If these values match, they are added to the result set.\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The initial state (0%) is explicitly added to the result set. The final state (100%) is naturally captured when the last byte of the last file is copied.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently track both progress bars and check for matching values, leveraging prefix sums for quick calculations and a set to avoid duplicates. The final result is sorted and printed as required.",
