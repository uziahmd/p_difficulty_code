Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when we remove one element, we want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and track the minimum instability. However, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. For n=1e5, that would be 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, I need a more efficient way. Let's think about the sorted array. If the array is sorted, then the instability is simply the last element minus the first. But when we remove an element, how does that affect the min and max?\n\nIf the array is sorted, then removing an element from the ends might have a bigger impact. For example, if the array is sorted, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove the first element, the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. But if I remove an element from the middle, the min and max remain the same. Wait, no. Because if the array is sorted, the min is a[0], max is a[-1]. If I remove any element except the first or last, the min and max remain the same. So, the instability would be the same as the original. Therefore, the only cases where the instability changes are when we remove the first or last element of the sorted array.\n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. Let me think again. Suppose the array is sorted. Then, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove the first element, the new array's min is a[1], max is a[-1], so instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. If I remove any other element, say a[i], then the min is still a[0], max is a[-1], so instability remains the same. So, the minimal instability after removing one element would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], original instability (if we remove some middle element)).\n\nBut wait, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If we remove a middle element, the instability remains the same. So, the minimal instability would be the minimum between the two options: removing the first element or the last element. But wait, what if there are duplicates? Like in the example given, where the array is [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. The original instability is 6. If you remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If you remove the last element (7), the instability is 3-1=2. Which is better. But in this case, the minimal is achieved by removing the last element. So, the answer is 2.\n\nSo, for the sorted array, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1]). But what if there are multiple elements? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If we remove the first element, instability is 4-2=2. If we remove the last element, instability is 3-1=2. So the minimal is 2. But if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5], then removing the first element gives 5-2=3, removing the last gives 4-1=3. But if you remove the 4, then the instability is 5-1=4, which is worse. So the minimal is 3. So in this case, the minimal is min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has duplicates? Like [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then removing any element gives instability 0. So the answer is 0. So in this case, the min between a[-2] - a[0] (which is 1-1=0) and a[-1] - a[1] (1-1=0) is 0. Which is correct",
    "response": "To solve the problem of minimizing the instability of an array after removing exactly one element, we can use the following approach:\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. If we sort the array, the instability becomes the difference between the last and first elements. Removing any element from the middle of the sorted array does not change the instability (since min and max remain unchanged). Therefore, we only need to consider removing the first or last element in the sorted array.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting allows us to efficiently calculate the instability by considering the extremes.\n2. **Evaluate Options:**\n   - If we remove the first element, the new instability is `a[-1] - a[1]`.\n   - If we remove the last element, the new instability is `a[-2] - a[0]`.\n3. **Return the Minimum:** The result is the minimum of the two options above.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of **O(n log n)** due to sorting, which is suitable for large input sizes up to $10^5$.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    # Calculate instability if we remove the first element or the last element\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    \n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\n#### Input:\n```\n4\n1 3 3 7\n```\n\n#### Sorted Array:\n```\n[1, 3, 3, 7]\n```\n\n- Option 1: Remove first element → instability = `7 - 3 = 4`\n- Option 2: Remove last element → instability = `3 - 1 = 2`\n\n**Output:** `2`\n\n---\n\nThis solution handles edge cases efficiently and ensures optimal performance.",
