He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about splitting a list of problems into exactly k days, each day solving consecutive problems from the start. Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems, and we need to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find the optimal way to split the array into k parts such that the sum of the maxima of each part is as large as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to think about dynamic programming. Because for each position and each number of days, there might be an optimal way to split up to that point.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach. Let's say dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days. Then, the recurrence would involve considering where to split the previous day.\n\nFor example, to compute dp[i][j], we can look at all possible m < i where the j-1th day ends at m, and then take the max of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut with n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this approach would have O(n^2 * k) time complexity. Let's see: for each i (up to 2000), for each j (up to 2000), and for each m (up to i). That's 2000^3 operations, which would be 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. Not feasible.\n\nSo we need a better approach. Wait, but maybe k is up to n, but for some constraints. For example, if k is small, like up to 100, then maybe it's manageable. But given that n can be 2000, and k can be up to 2000, this approach isn't going to work.\n\nHmm. So what's another way? Let's think about the problem again. Since each day must take a consecutive block starting from the beginning, the splits are partitions into k parts, each part being a consecutive segment. For example, for the first day, you take some number of problems (say t_1), then the next day takes t_2, etc., such that sum t_i = n.\n\nThe problem is similar to partitioning the array into k segments, each segment's max contributes to the total sum. We need to maximize the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nNow, thinking about the DP approach again. Let's think of dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i elements split into j days. Then, for dp[i][j], we can look back to some m < i, and take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is computing the max(a[m+1..i]) for all possible m. If we can precompute these ranges, that would help. For example, for each i, and for each possible m < i, we can compute the max from m+1 to i. However, even with that, the DP would still be O(n^2k) time.\n\nWait, but for n=2000 and k=2000, that's 2000*2000*2000=8e10 operations. That's way too big. So this approach is not feasible. So maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints are not that tight. Let's check the sample input. For example, when k is equal to n, each day has exactly one problem. Then the total profit is sum of all a_i. So that's easy. Similarly, when k=1, the answer is the max of the entire array.\n\nBut for general cases, how can we optimize the DP?\n\nWait, perhaps for the DP transitions, we can find a way to compute the max in O(1) per transition. Let's think. For each i and j, when considering the j-th day, we can consider that the j-th day starts at some m+1 and ends at i. So for the j-th day, the maximum of a[m+1..i] is needed. But if we can compute this maximum efficiently for all possible m.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, and for each j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1 (since each day must have at least one problem). And during this iteration, we can track the current maximum.\n\nFor example, when computing dp[i][j], we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1. For each m, the segment from m+1 to i. So, when moving from m to m-1, the segment is m to i. So the max would be max(a[m], previous_max). So for each i and j, we can compute the max for each possible m in O(1) time per step, by keeping track of the current max as we move m from i-1 down to j-1.\n\nThis way, the time complexity becomes O(n^2k). But with n=2000 and k=2000, that's 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. Which is way too big. But maybe in practice, the constraints for the problem are not that bad. Or perhaps there's a way to optimize further.\n\nWait, but what is the actual maximum value of k? Since k can be up to n. But for n=2000, even O(n^2k) would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. Which is way beyond the time limit. So this approach is not feasible. Therefore, we need to think of another way.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be approached greedily. However, greedy approaches are tricky here. For example, in the sample input, the best choice is to take the first three elements (max 5), then two elements (max 6), then three elements (max 9). But how would a greedy approach decide this? It's unclear.\n\nAnother thought: since each day's segment must be contiguous and in order, the problem resembles the problem of splitting the array into k segments to maximize the sum of their maxima. This is similar to some other dynamic programming problems.\n\nBut how to optimize the DP. Let's think about the possible optimizations.\n\nLet me think again. Let's think of the DP[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i elements split into j days. Then:\n\nDP[i][j] = max(DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])) for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nThe key is to compute this max efficiently. For each i and j, we can compute the max for all possible m. However, for each i and j, the max(a[m+1..i]) can be computed incrementally. For example, for fixed i and j, when we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, we can keep track of the current maximum. Let's see:\n\nFor example, when considering m = i-1, the segment is [a[i]], so the max is a[i]. For m = i-2, the segment is a[i-1], a[i], so the max is max(a[i-1], a[i]). And so on. So, for each i, and for each j, when we loop m from i-1 down to j-1, we can track the current maximum as we go. So for each i and j, the inner loop is O(i) steps. So the total time complexity is O(n^2k). \n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, this would be O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second. So even if we optimize the code, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, we need to find another way. Let's think about the problem again.\n\nWhat if we note that when k is large, the optimal strategy is to split the array into as many segments as possible where each segment's max is as large as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution requires that each day's segment includes the next maximum element. For example, if there are several peaks, we can split between them. But how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the maximum total profit is the sum of the maximums of each segment. To maximize this sum, we want each segment to capture as high a maximum as possible.\n\nBut since the segments are contiguous and in order, the maximum for each segment is determined by the highest element in that segment. So, if there's a very high element, we would want to have it in its own segment. But if there are multiple high elements, perhaps we need to split the array in such a way that each high element is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to balance that with the number of days k.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the problem as choosing k-1 split points between the elements. The splits must be in order, so that each segment is non-empty. The total profit is the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting k-1 split points such that the sum of the maxima of the resulting segments is maximized.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum possible sum is achieved when each of the k segments contains the largest possible elements. For example, if there are k elements that are the top k elements in the array, then we can split the array so that each of those elements is in a separate segment. But how to arrange that.\n\nBut this depends on the positions of those elements. For instance, if the top k elements are spread out, we can split between them.\n\nBut how to model this in code.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the maximum for a segment is determined by the highest element in that segment. So, for any split into k segments, the sum of the maxima will be the sum of the maximums of each of the k segments.\n\nNow, considering that each time we split, we can take the maximum of the current segment. So, the problem is similar to the problem where we have to choose k-1 splits to maximize the sum of the maxima.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the case when k=2. Then, we need to split the array into two parts. The first part is from 1 to m, and the second part from m+1 to n. The total profit is max(a[1..m]) + max(a[m+1..n]). We need to choose m such that this sum is maximized.\n\nHow to compute this? Well, for each possible m (from 1 to n-1), compute the sum. But for large n, that would be O(n) time. But for general k, this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nBut perhaps for the DP approach, we can find a way to optimize the transitions. Let's think again about the DP[i][j] approach.\n\nLet me consider that for each j, the value of j can be up to k. For each i and j, we can compute DP[i][j] as follows:\n\nFor j=1, DP[i][1] = max(a[1..i]).\n\nFor j>1, DP[i][j] = max over m in [j-1, i-1] of (DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nNow, for each i and j, the inner loop is m from j-1 to i-1. And for each m, we need to calculate the max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute the maximums for all ranges. For example, using a 2D array max_range where max_range[l][r] is the maximum of a[l..r]. Then, for any l and r, we can get the max in O(1) time.\n\nBut precomputing this for all l and r would take O(n^2) time and space. For n=2000, that's 4 million entries. Which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions can be done as:\n\nDP[i][j] = max( DP[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i] ) for m in [j-1 ... i-1]\n\nBut even with that, the time complexity is O(n^2k), which is still 8e10 for n=2000 and k=2000.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the constraints are not that bad. Wait, the problem says that n can be up to 2000. Let's think about the worst case scenario where k is 2000. Then, for each i and j, the inner loop runs for O(i) steps. So for j=2000, the i must be at least 2000 (since j days require at least j elements). So for i=2000 and j=2000, the inner loop is for m from 1999 to 1999 (only one step). So maybe the actual number of operations is manageable?\n\nWait, but for j=2, the i can be up to 2000, and for each i, the inner loop runs from m=1 to i-1. So for j=2, the total number of operations is O(n^2). Similarly for higher j. So overall, the total number of operations is O(k*n^2). For n=2000 and k=2000, this is O(2000 * 2000^2) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too big.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Therefore, we need to find a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: since the splits are contiguous and in order, perhaps the problem can be viewed as choosing the positions where the splits occur. Let's think about the maximum elements in the array.\n\nSuppose that the array has some elements that are larger than their neighbors. For example, if there's a peak, it's better to split before and after it. But again, how to use this for the general case.\n\nAnother observation: the maximum total profit is the sum of the maximum elements in each of the k segments. So, if we can select k segments such that each segment contains exactly one of the top k elements, and these elements are as large as possible.\n\nBut how to arrange that.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input, the array is [1, 2000, 2000, 2]. When k=2, the optimal is to split into [1,2000] and [2000,2], giving sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000. So the two largest elements are both in separate segments.\n\nSo, if there are k elements that are the top k elements, and they are placed in such a way that we can split the array to have each of them in their own segment, that would give the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nBut how to model this in code.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the sum of the maxima will be the sum of the maxima of the k segments. Each of these maxima is at least as large as the maximum of the entire array divided by k? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the problem is similar to the problem of finding k-1 split points to maximize the sum of the maxima of the segments. So, for each split, we want to capture the maximum elements.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nWait, for the DP approach, perhaps we can find a way to reduce the time complexity. Let's think again about the DP[i][j] formula. For each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] based on DP[m][j-1] plus the max from m+1 to i.\n\nBut for each j, the value of DP[i][j] depends on the previous j-1 layer. So, perhaps for each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] in a way that avoids recomputing the max_range[m+1][i] for all m.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for a fixed j and i, when we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and keep track of the current maximum. For example, when considering m, the segment is m+1 to i. So, as we decrease m, the segment increases in length. For example, when m decreases by 1, the segment becomes m+1 to i, which is the previous segment (for m+1) plus a new element a[m+1].\n\nSo, the max for the segment m+1 to i is the maximum between a[m+1] and the max of the segment m+2 to i. So, if we track this as we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, we can keep track of the current max.\n\nThis way, for each i and j, the inner loop for m can compute the max in O(1) time per step. Thus, the total time complexity remains O(n^2k), but with a lower constant factor.\n\nBut again, for n=2000 and k=2000, it's still O(8e10) operations. Which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe in practice, the problem allows for some optimizations. Let's think about the constraints again. The problem says that n is up to 2000, and k is up to n. But in practice, for k=2000, each day must consist of exactly one problem. So, the answer is the sum of all elements. So for this case, the code can be handled specially.\n\nSimilarly, for cases where k is close to n, the code can be optimized.\n\nBut for general cases, how else can we proceed?\n\nAlternative approach: notice that the maximum number of days is k, and for each day, the maximum of the segment is at least the maximum of the previous segments. No, that's not necessarily true.\n\nAnother idea: think of the problem as a variation of the problem where you have to split the array into k segments and maximize the sum of the maxima. This problem is similar to the problem of splitting the array into k parts to maximize the sum of the minima, which is a known problem. But I don't recall the exact solution for that.\n\nWait, for the problem of splitting into k parts to maximize the sum of the maxima, the DP approach seems to be the standard approach. However, with n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, the DP approach is not feasible unless we find a way to optimize it.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For example, for the DP[i][j], the value of j can't be larger than i. So for i < j, DP[i][j] is invalid. So, for each j, we only need to process i >= j.\n\nMoreover, for j=1, DP[i][1] is the maximum of the first i elements. For j=2, DP[i][2] = max over m from 1 to i-1 of (DP[m][1] + max(m+1 to i)).\n\nBut how to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think for j=2. For each i, we need to find m in 1..i-1 such that DP[m][1] + max(m+1 to i) is maximized. DP[m][1] is the max of the first m elements. So for each i, the value is max_{m} (max_first_m + max_{m+1..i}).\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nBut for each i, the max_{m+1..i} can be computed as the maximum between the previous max and a[i]. Wait, but for varying m.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, and for j=2, we can iterate m from 1 to i-1, and compute the max of the segment m+1 to i. But that's O(n^2) for j=2, which is acceptable for n=2000.\n\nBut for j up to 2000, this would still be O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps, the problem requires us to implement the DP approach with the optimization of tracking the max during the inner loop, and see if it passes within the time constraints.\n\nLet me try to estimate the time. Let's assume that for n=2000 and k=2000, the worst case is when k=2000 and i=2000. For j=2000, the inner loop for m is from 1999 to 1999 (only one step). So for j=2000, the total number of operations is O(n).\n\nFor j=1, it's O(n) operations.\n\nFor j=2, the number of operations is O(n^2).\n\nFor j=3, O(n^2) again.\n\nSo overall, the total number of operations is O(k * n^2) in the worst case. But when k is 2000, this is O(2000 * 2000^2) = 8e10 operations, which is way too much for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize this. Let's think about the following: for a given j, the value of j can't exceed i. Also, for j > i, it's invalid. So for j from 1 to k, and for i from j to n.\n\nBut even with that, the time complexity is still O(n^2k).\n\nWait, but what if k is small? For example, if k is up to 100, then for n=2000, the total operations are 100 * 2000^2 = 4e8 operations. Which is manageable in C++ but may be tight in Python.\n\nBut given that the problem requires a solution, perhaps we have to proceed with this DP approach, and hope that with optimizations, it can pass.\n\nLet's proceed with implementing this DP approach, and see if we can find a way to optimize it.\n\nFirst, precompute the max_range array. For that, we can create a 2D array where max_range[l][r] is the maximum of a[l..r], with 1-based indices (assuming that the array is 0-based or 1-based). For example, for l from 1 to n, and r from l to n.\n\nBut for Python, with n=2000, this is 2000*2000 = 4 million entries. Precomputing this can be done with dynamic programming. For each l, r:\n\nif l == r: max_range[l][r] = a[l]\n\nelse: max_range[l][r] = max( max_range[l][r-1], a[r] )\n\nBut this would take O(n^2) time and space. Which is acceptable.\n\nOnce that is precomputed, then the DP can proceed.\n\nBut even with this, the time for the DP is O(n^2k), which is too slow for large k.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can find that for j >= some value, the DP[i][j] can be computed in a certain way. For example, when j is larger than some value, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: since the maximum possible sum is when we have as many large elements as possible in their own segments. So, for example, if there are k elements that are larger than all others, we can split the array to have each of them in their own segment.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array, provided that they can be separated into different segments. However, this is only possible if there are at least k elements, which there are. But the arrangement must allow for splitting between them.\n\nFor example, if the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], the top 3 elements are 9, 6, 5. But in the sample input, the sum is 5 + 6 +9 = 20. But the top three elements are 9,6,5. Their sum is 20. So yes, this matches.\n\nIn the third example, the top two elements are 2000 and 2000, sum 4000, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this suggests that the maximum possible sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array, provided that we can split the array in such a way that each of these elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to ensure that. For example, if the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], and k=3. The top three elements are 5,5,5. We can split the array into [5], [1,5], [1,5], which gives sum 5 +5 +5=15. Or [5,1,5], [1,5], [ ]? No, because each day must have at least one problem. So it's possible.\n\nSo the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the k largest elements.\n\nBut how to confirm this.\n\nBut what if the array is [3, 1, 2], and k=2. The two largest elements are 3 and 2. But to split into two segments, the options are [3,1], [2] (sum 3+2=5) or [3], [1,2] (sum 3+2=5). Which is the sum of the two largest elements. Another option: [3], [1], [2] would be for k=3, which is not allowed here.\n\nBut what if the array is [3, 2, 1], and k=2. The two largest elements are 3 and 2. Sum is 5, which is achieved by splitting [3], [2,1]. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], k=3. The top three elements are 5,4,3. The sum is 12. How to split: [5], [4], [3,2,1]. Sum is 5+4+3=12. Correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 3, 4, 2, 1], k=3. The top three elements are 5,4,3. But how to split them into separate segments. The array is [5,3,4,2,1]. So, possible splits: [5], [3,4], [2,1]. Sum is 5+4+2=11. But the sum of the top three elements is 5+4+3=12. How to achieve that? We need to have 3 in its own segment. But the array is 5,3,4,2,1. So to have 5, 3, and 4 in their own segments. But that would require splitting into [5], [3], [4,2,1]. Sum is 5+3+4=12. Yes. So it's possible.\n\nSo the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the k largest elements. So the problem reduces to selecting the k largest elements, and splitting the array such that each of these elements is in a separate segment. But how to do that?\n\nIf this is true, then the solution becomes easier. We can collect the k largest elements, and split the array such that each of them is in its own segment. However, the problem is to find the positions of these elements and split around them.\n\nBut how to ensure that the splits are made between these elements.\n\nBut this seems promising. Let me think again.\n\nAssume that the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements. How to prove this?\n\nLet's consider that for any split into k segments, the sum of the maxima of the segments is equal to the sum of the maximum elements in each segment. Now, each segment contributes its maximum. But each maximum is an element of the array. So the sum of the maxima is the sum of some elements of the array, with the condition that each element is counted once if it is the maximum of its segment.\n\nBut how to maximize this sum. The best way is to have as many as possible of the largest elements in the array as the maxima of the segments.\n\nSo, for example, if there are k elements that are the top k elements, and we can split the array so that each of these is the maximum of its segment, then the sum would be the sum of those k elements.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nThe key is that each of these elements must be in a segment that contains no larger elements. For example, if we have the elements sorted in descending order, say x_1 >= x_2 >= ... >= x_k >= ... x_n, then to include x_1, x_2, ..., x_k as the maxima of their respective segments, we need to split the array so that each x_i is in a segment where there are no elements larger than x_i.\n\nBut since x_1 is the largest, it can be in any segment. For x_2, we need to ensure that it's in a segment that doesn't contain x_1. But since x_1 is the first element, perhaps we can split before x_2.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, the earlier examples suggest that this is possible.\n\nIf this is true, then the problem becomes to find the k largest elements and split the array so that each of them is in its own segment. However, how to do that.\n\nBut how to determine the splits. For example, in the sample input, the k=3 largest elements are 9, 6, 5. The splits are made so that each of these elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to find the splits. One possible way is to find the positions of the k largest elements, and then split between them.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nAlternatively, the problem reduces to selecting k elements, and splitting the array into k segments such that each segment contains exactly one of these elements, and that element is the maximum in its segment.\n\nBut how to find this selection and the splits.\n\nBut even if this is true, the problem requires not only to compute the maximum sum but also to output the splits. So, how to implement this.\n\nBut perhaps this line of thinking is not leading us anywhere. Let's return to the DP approach, and try to find a way to implement it in Python with optimizations.\n\nLet's proceed with implementing the DP approach, with the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute the max_range array.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for n=2000, a 2D array of size 2000x2000 is manageable. Let's proceed.\n\nThen, for the DP table, since n can be 2000, and k can be up to 2000, we need a 2D array of size (n+1) x (k+1). For n=2000, this is about 4 million entries.\n\nBut for each entry, we need to store the maximum value. Also, we need to track the path to reconstruct the splits.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the DP.\n\nLet's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] = 0. But for i >=1 and j >=1.\n\nFor j=1, dp[i][1] = max of a[0..i-1] (assuming 0-based array).\n\nFor j>1, for each i >= j, dp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max of a[m..i-1]).\n\nWait, the indices need to be carefully handled. Let's assume that the array is 0-based. So, the first i elements are from index 0 to i-1.\n\nSo for the range from m to i-1, the max_range[m][i-1] is the maximum of that segment.\n\nBut for the precomputed max_range, we need to have max_range[l][r], which is the maximum of a[l..r], inclusive.\n\nSo, for the segment from m to i-1, l = m, r = i-1.\n\nThus, the max is max_range[m][i-1].\n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1] ), for m in [j-1 ... i-1].\n\nBut for each i and j, this requires iterating m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, for the implementation:\n\nWe can precompute the max_range as follows:\n\nn = len(a)\nmax_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\nfor l in range(n):\n    current_max = a[l]\n    max_range[l][l] = current_max\n    for r in range(l+1, n):\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[r])\n        max_range[l][r] = current_max\n\nOnce this is done, the DP can proceed.\n\nBut with n=2000, this precomputation is O(n^2), which is 4 million steps. Acceptable.\n\nNow, for the DP:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1). Because for i from 0 to n, and j from 0 to k.\n\nBut since j can't exceed i, for j > i, dp[i][j] is invalid.\n\nNow, for the base case:\n\ndp[0][0] = 0.\n\nFor j=1, dp[i][1] = max_range[0][i-1], for i >=1.\n\nThen, for j >=2, and i >= j:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1] ), for m in [j-1 ... i-1]\n\nBut how to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nn=8, k=3, a=[5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]\n\nmax_range for l=0, r=2 is max(5,4,2)=5.\n\nFor the DP:\n\ndp[3][1] = max of first 3 elements =5.\n\ndp[3][2] would be max over m=1 to 2:\n\nm=1: dp[1][1] (max of first 1 elements, which is 5) + max of a[1..2] (4,2 → 4) → 5+4=9.\n\nm=2: dp[2][1] (max of first 2 elements →5) + max of a[2..2] (2) →5+2=7. So the max is 9.\n\nSo dp[3][2] =9.\n\nBut this is just an example.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this DP and then backtrack to find the splits.\n\nBut for large n and k, this approach may be too slow in Python. However, perhaps with some optimizations, like using a 1D DP array, or using the fact that for each j, we can compute the current layer based on the previous layer, and using the incremental max calculation for the inner loop.\n\nLet me think about optimizing the inner loop. For each i and j, instead of looking up max_range[m][i-1], which is O(1), but for the inner loop, we can compute the max incrementally.\n\nFor example, for a fixed i and j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1. For each m, the segment is from m to i-1. As we decrease m by 1, the segment becomes m to i-1, which is adding the element at position m to the previous segment (which was m+1 to i-1).\n\nSo, for each i and j, we can initialize current_max as a[i-1], and for m = i-1 downto j-1:\n\ncurrent_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\nthen, dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nSo this way, we avoid looking up the max_range for each m, and instead compute it on the fly. This may save some time, especially since the max_range array takes O(n^2) space, which could be a problem for memory. For n=2000, the max_range would be 4 million entries. Which is manageable, but for Python, it's better to avoid it if possible.\n\nSo, combining these ideas, the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (k+1), filled with -infinity or something. Then, set dp[0][0] = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n   for j from 1 to min(k, i):\n\n      if j == 1:\n\n          dp[i][j] = max of a[0..i-1]\n\n      else:\n\n          current_max = a[i-1]\n\n          dp[i][j] = -infinity\n\n          for m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n              current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\n              if dp[m][j-1] + current_max > dp[i][j]:\n\n                  dp[i][j] = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n\nThis way, we avoid the precomputed max_range array, and compute the max on the fly for each m. This might save some memory and computation time.\n\nBut for j=1, how to compute the max of the first i elements? Well, we can precompute a prefix_max array, where prefix_max",
