            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling the case when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (where b could be R), second line has the number c in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then, convert that decimal integer to base b. If b is R, convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as usual.\n\nSo the main steps are parsing the input, converting to decimal, then converting to the target base or Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input for c can have letters if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. Wait, but the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used. So, for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that represents 10 in decimal.\n\nBut the input c is given as a string. So for converting from base a to decimal, I need to process each character of the string, treating it as a digit in base a. For example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, it's 10 in decimal. But how do I handle letters? Well, the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. So I need to process the input c's characters as digits, with letters being uppercase? Or lowercase? The input examples show that in the case of input 'A' in base 12, the output is 'A' when converting to base 13. So probably the input c's digits are in uppercase letters, but maybe the problem allows lowercase? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros. But the input is given as a string. So, perhaps the input c's characters are digits (0-9) and uppercase letters (A-Z) for bases larger than 10. So during conversion, I need to parse each character as a digit in base a.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then its value is 10 in decimal.\n\nSo first, I need a function to convert a string in base a to decimal. Let's think about that function.\n\nFunction to convert from base a string to decimal:\n\nFor each character in the string, convert it to its numerical value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. Then, compute the value as sum (digit * a^position), but processing from left to right. Wait, but for numbers, it's easier to process each digit, multiplying the current total by the base and adding the digit's value. For example, for the string '123' in base 10, it's 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0. But processing left to right, you can do:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nfor digit in string:\n\n    value = value * a + digit_value\n\nYes. So that's the way to go.\n\nSo, for the input c, which is a string, I need to process each character into its corresponding value. For example, if the character is 'A', then it's 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for each character in the string, I can check if it's a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z). Then, convert to its numerical value. But the problem says that the input c is a valid number in base a. So we don't need to handle invalid inputs.\n\nNow, the next step is converting the decimal value to base b, which could be Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, let's handle the case when b is not R. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to base b. For example, if the decimal is 5 and base is 2, then it's 101.\n\nBut for bases larger than 10, letters are used. So for example, if the decimal number is 10 in base 12, it would be 'A'.\n\nSo for converting decimal to base b (when b is not R), the steps are:\n\n- Handle 0? Well, the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input can be zero",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can be a Roman numeral. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b` or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert from Base `a` to Decimal**: \n   - Parse the input string representing the number in base `a` into a decimal integer. This involves converting each character of the string to its corresponding numerical value, considering both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n\n2. **Convert from Decimal to Target Base `b`**:\n   - If `b` is not 'R', convert the decimal integer to the specified base `b`, using letters for bases greater than 10.\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using the standard Roman numeral rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while num >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            num -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = parts[2]\n        \n        a = int(a_part)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            b = 'R'\n        else:\n            b = int(b_part)\n        \n        # Convert c_str from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        \n        # Now convert decimal_value to target\n        if b == 'R':\n            result = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n        else:\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_value, b)\n        \n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion from Base `a` to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value and accumulating the result by multiplying the current value by the base and adding the new digit's value.\n\n2. **Conversion from Decimal to Base `b`**: The function `from_decimal` converts a decimal number to a specified base, using letters for bases greater than 10. This function handles the conversion by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros, different bases, and Roman numeral conversions.",
