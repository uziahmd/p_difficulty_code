For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. For a major triad, there should be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3. For a minor triad, it's 3 and then 4 semitones. The total distance between X and Z would be 7 in both cases, but that's probably not needed here.\n\nThe challenge is to compute the distances between the notes correctly, considering the cyclic nature of the scale. The notes are arranged in a cycle of 12, so each note can be represented as an index from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, H is the 12th note? Wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, that's 12 notes. Let me count:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H — yes, 12. So H is the last one. Then, after H comes C again.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its position in this list. Let's create a list or a dictionary that maps each note to its index. For example:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's the order. So each note's index is their position in this list. Then, the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note, perhaps we need to compute the difference in the order. Wait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2 semitones. But when you go from C to E, that's 4 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? No, because if Y is after X, then it's (Y - X), but if Y is before X, then (Y + 12 - X). But the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper note. So for example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E to C, you have to go E -> F (1), F->F# (2), ..., up to C. Which is 8 steps. But in the problem statement, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So the distance is calculated as the minimal number of steps moving forward in the scale. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones along the scale from X to Y. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference in their indices. But if X is higher than Y, then it's (Y's index + 12 - X's index)? Or perhaps the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but that would give a value between 0 and 11. However, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see: if X is E (index 4?), and Y is C (index 0). Then the distance from E to C is (0 - 4) mod 12? That would be 8. So yes, that's correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, no. Because if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. Which is (4 - 0) mod 12 = 4. Correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 - 4) mod 12 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: First, we map each note to its corresponding index in the sequence of 12 musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the difference in their indices modulo 12. This accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Check Triads**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note, match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_notes = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    \n    # Define the note order\n    note_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to map note names to their indices\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n    \n    # Get the three notes\n    notes = input_notes\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of the three notes\n    from itertools import permutations\n    perms = permutations(notes)\n    \n    # Check each permutation for major or minor\n    for perm in perms:\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        \n        # Calculate distances\n        dist_xy = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        dist_yz = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        \n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    \n    # If none found, it's strange\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The notes are mapped to indices from 0 to 11 based on their position in the given sequence. This allows easy calculation of distances using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are checked for both major and minor triad conditions.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly from the end of the scale back to the beginning.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes, ensuring that we correctly identify the type of triad or determine that it is strange.",
