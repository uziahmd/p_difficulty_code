For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position in this list. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the sequence. For example, distance from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if the notes are in reverse, like E to C, the distance would be 8 semitones because you have to go through all the notes after E until you reach C again. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So when considering X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the difference. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (total semitones in the scale) minus the difference? Or maybe the distance is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? No, wait the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones along the scale from X to Y. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because if you start at E and go up to C, you have to loop around. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if Y is after X, then it's Y - X. If Y is before X, then it's (12 - (X - Y))? Let me think. Let's take X as E (position 4), Y as C (position 0). Then the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones. Which is (0 - 4 + 12) = 8. So the formula for the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) if y_pos >= x_pos, else (y_pos - x_pos + 12). Or more simply, (y_pos - x_pos) % 12? Wait, no. Because (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12 gives the difference in semitones when moving forward. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then (4-0) =4 mod12 is 4. Correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), (0-4) is -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. So, for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. Otherwise, it's 12 - (X - Y). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y's position - X's position) mod 12. But since the problem says that for a major triad, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and between Y and Z is 3. So the order of the notes matters here. But the triad is unordered. So the three notes can be arranged in any order, and we need to check if any permutation of them satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (since order matters for checking the distances). For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major triad. Similarly, check for minor triads where the distances are 3 and 4.\n\nBut how do I generate all permutations? Well, since there are three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each of these permutations, check the conditions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the total",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific semitone distance criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Position Mapping**: Map each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic sequence of 12 notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three given notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Classification**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, classify the chord accordingly. If none do, classify it as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_position(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(x, y):\n    return (y - x) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    if distance(x, y) == 4 and distance(y, z) == 3:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    if distance(x, y) == 3 and distance(y, z) == 4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    positions = [note_to_position(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(positions):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Position Mapping**: The `note_to_position` function maps each note to an index in the list of 12 notes, which helps in calculating distances.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function computes the number of semitones between two notes using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The `classify_chord` function generates all permutations of the three notes and checks each permutation against the conditions for major and minor triads.\n4. **Classification**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if the distances between the notes in a permutation meet the criteria for major or minor triads, respectively. If no permutation meets the criteria, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
