He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo, the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the string must have a certain structure. Let me break down the conditions:\n\nFirst, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because A and B made sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b', and C adds 'c's. So if there are no 'c's, it's invalid. Wait, but the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the string must have at least one 'c' as well. So the first check is that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Let me recheck. The problem says that after A and B, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C adds some 'c's. So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. So the input string must have all three characters. Otherwise, it's automatically invalid. For example, if the string has only 'a's and 'b's but no 'c's, then it's impossible. So first, check that the counts of a, b, c are all at least 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is something like 'aabbc'? Then the counts are a:2, b:2, c:1. But according to the process, C added 'c's equal to the number of a's or b's. Let's see. Let's think about the steps.\n\nOriginal string after A and B: some number of a's and b's, with at least one each. Let's say the count of a's is a_count, b_count. Then C appends c_count equal to either a_count or b_count. So the total c's in the final string is equal to a_count or b_count. So the total number of c's must be equal to the original a_count (before adding c's) or original b_count (before adding c's). But the original a_count and b_count are the counts in the string before adding the c's. So in the final string, the count of a's is the same as original a_count, same for b's. The count of c's is equal to either original a_count or original b_count.\n\nSo, for the final string:\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in the string\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in the string\n\nThen, the following must hold:\n\ncount_c must equal count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the order of the characters must be such that all a's come first, followed by b's, followed by c's. Because A's string is all a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's. So the string must consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo for example, the string 'aaabccc' is valid. But 'bbacc' would have a's after b's, which is invalid. So the order is important.\n\nSo the steps for checking are:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So any occurrence of a character that comes after a previous character in the sequence (like a 'b' followed by an 'a') would invalidate this.\n\n2. Check that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\n3. Also, since B added some b's, after A's a's. So the original a's and b's must have at least one each. But since the final string has count_a >= 1, count_b >=1, and count_c >=1, then that's already covered by the first check. Because the original string after A and B had at least one a and one b. Then C added c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So if the input string has any of these counts as zero, it's invalid.\n\nSo putting this together, the steps to check:\n\nFirst, check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. How to do that?\n\nWe can check that the string does not have any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, and no 'b's after 'c's. So for example, once we see a 'b', there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once we see a 'c', there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, for the string S:\n\nCheck that all a's are before any b's, and all b's are before any c's. So the string can be divided into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nHow to check this? One way is to iterate through the string and ensure that once we see a 'b', there are no more 'a's. Similarly, once we see a 'c', there are no more 'a's or 'b's.\n\nAnother way is to check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts. So for example, the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, let's think of the string as having three sections. Let's check that the first occurrence of 'b' is after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' is after all b's.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the order a < b < c. So each character is not less than the previous. For example, 'a' is allowed, then 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. So the entire string must be in order where each character is not earlier than the previous. So for example, 'aabbc' is okay, but 'abba' is not.\n\nSo, for the string S:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        return invalid\n\nBut this is only true if the string is in the order a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because 'a' is less than 'b' which is less than 'c'. So, if the string is in the order a's, then b's, then c's, then the characters are non-decreasing. However, if there's a 'b' followed by an 'a', then that would be a decrease. So checking that the entire string is non-decreasing in terms of the characters would ensure that the order is correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. So for example, the string 'aaabccc' is non-decreasing. The string 'bbacc' would have 'b' followed by 'a' which is a decrease, so invalid. So that check would work.\n\nSo step 1: check that the string is non-decreasing in terms of the characters. If not, return NO.\n\nStep 2: check that the counts of a, b, c are all at least 1. Because the original string after A and B has at least one a and one b, and C adds at least one c. So the final string must have at least one of each. So if any of the counts is zero, return NO.\n\nStep 3: check that the count of c is equal to count of a or count of b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then return YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but let me think about the example given.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c equals count_a (3). So that's valid.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. So count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So valid.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the order is 'bbacc' → the third character is 'a', which is after 'b's. So the string is not non-decreasing. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother example: 'abbbc' → counts are a:1, b:3, c:1. So count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1). So that's valid. Also, the order is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So c equals a and b. So valid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → counts a:2, b:2, c:1. So c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So invalid. So even though the order is correct, the counts don't match. So output is NO.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing (order a's, then b's, then c's).\n\nCheck that counts of a, b, c are all ≥1.\n\nCheck that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all three conditions are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck the order: for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any violation, then invalid.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf any of them is zero, return NO.\n\nThen check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, return YES else NO.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So count_c equals a. So YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → order is b, b, a → which is a decrease. So invalid. So output NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c. Correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. So YES.\n\nAnother example: 'ab' → no c's. So invalid. Output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. All conditions met. YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2. c equals a. So yes.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. c is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nAnother example: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So c equals a and b. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So yes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc' → counts are a=2, b=2, c=1. So c is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck for order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        invalid.\n\nThen count a, b, c.\n\nif any of the counts is zero → no.\n\nelse check if count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen:\n\nvalid_order = True\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        valid_order = False\n\n        break\n\nif not valid_order:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the order is correct, but the counts are not?\n\nLike 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c equals a and b. So yes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nBut what about 'aabcc' → a=2, b=1, c=2. So yes.\n\nBut what about 'abccc' → a=1, b=1, c=3. So c is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nBut the order is correct. So code would check that, and then check counts.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nLet me test the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nFirst case: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. c equals a. So yes.\n\nSecond case: 'bbacc' → order is 'b', 'b', 'a' → which is a decrease. So invalid. So output no.\n\nThird case: 'aabc' → order correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. So yes.\n\nSo code works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → no (no c).\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → no (since there's no b). So code checks count_b is zero → no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nWhat about 'aabbc' → counts are a=2, b=2, c=1. So c is not equal to a or b. So code returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2, which equals a and b. So yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nWhat about 'aaaabbbbcccc' → yes.\n\nWhat about 'aaaabbbbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 4, count_b is 4. So no. So code returns no.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the count_c is equal to both count_a and count_b?\n\nLike 'aabbcc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 2. So yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nBut wait, the code must read a single string from input. Wait, the input is given as a single line. For example, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list, but in reality, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S. So in the sample input, perhaps the examples are given as a list, but in reality, when you run the code, the input is a single string. For example, in the sample input, the first input is 'aaabccc', and the output is 'YES'.\n\nSo the code must read a single string from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nvalid_order = True\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        valid_order = False\n\n        break\n\nif not valid_order:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? Then count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbaacc'? Then the order is not correct. Because after the 'b's, there's a 'a' again. So the code would detect that during the order check.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → order check fails (the third character is 'b' which is after 'a', but then the fourth is 'a' which is less than 'b'. So code returns no.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let me check the sample input again. The second example is 'bbacc' → the order is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The third character is 'a' which is less than the previous 'b', so the order check fails. So code returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabc' → order is a,a,b,c. So valid. counts are a=2, b=1, c=1. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'bbaacc' → order is 'b', 'b', 'a', ... which is invalid. So code returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → order is correct. counts a=1, b=1, c=2. So c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So code returns no.\n\nBut if the string is 'abbbc', then count_c is 1, which equals a (1). So yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must be formed by first appending some number of 'a's, then some number of 'b's, and finally some number of 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order Validity**: The string must be composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's and then a block of 'c's. This ensures the characters are in non-decreasing order.\n2. **Check Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Check Count Validity**: The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nvalid_order = True\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        valid_order = False\n        break\n\nif not valid_order:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Validity Check**: We iterate through the string to ensure that each character is not less than the previous character.
