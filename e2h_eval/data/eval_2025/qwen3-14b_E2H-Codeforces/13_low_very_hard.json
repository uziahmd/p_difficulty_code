For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of semitones when moving from the lower to the higher note. But since they are cyclic, I need to calculate the distance properly.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the notes. Maybe assign each note a numerical value. Like, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Wait, but in the problem statement, the order is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's correct. So each note can be mapped to an index from 0 to 11.\n\nSo first, I need a way to convert a note string like 'C' or 'B' into its corresponding index. Let's create a list or a dictionary for that. For example, the list would be in order: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']. Then, each note can be mapped to its index. But wait, what about the note names? Like, for example, the note after H is C again. So the distance between H and C is 1 semitone, right?\n\nNow, the problem says that the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check that. C (0) to C# (1) is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). So yes, 4 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait no. Because if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher, then it's (Y + 12 - X). But since the distance is measured from the lower to upper, so for example, if we have E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because E is 4, C is 0. So the distance from E to C would be (0 + 12 -4) = 8? Wait, but that's the distance when moving upwards. Wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Because you go from E to F (1), F to F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). So yeah, 8 semitones. So the way to calculate the distance between two notes is (y - x) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Or perhaps (y - x + 12) % 12? Wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12? Let me see: for example, X is E (4), Y is C (0). Y - X is -4. Adding 12 gives 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, but mod 12 would give 8 in that case. So yes. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % 12. But wait, if Y is higher than X, then (Y - X) is positive. So for example, X is C (0), Y is E (4): 4-0=4. Which is correct. So the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the distance is always positive, that's the way to compute it.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X).",
