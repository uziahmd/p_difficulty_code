There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the maximum height in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. I have to find the maximum possible profit under all these constraints.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nConstraints are small: n, h, m up to 50. So maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even 50^50 possibilities is way too big. So brute force isn't feasible. Need another approach.\n\nWait, but with n up to 50, maybe we can model this as some kind of optimization problem with constraints. However, how to model the constraints?\n\nAnother thought: For each position, the maximum possible height is limited by the restrictions that apply to it. For example, if there's a restriction on a range that includes a particular spot, then the maximum height of that spot can't exceed the minimum of all applicable restrictions. Wait, no. Because the restriction is on the maximum in the range. So for example, if a restriction says that in [1,3], the max is <= x, then each individual house in that range can be up to x, but at least one of them must be exactly x (if we want to maximize the sum). But maybe not. Wait, no. The restriction says that the maximum in the range is <= x. So each house in that range can be up to x. But if you have multiple overlapping restrictions, each house's maximum height is constrained by the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover it. But no, because a restriction applies to a range. For example, if a house is in multiple ranges, each of which has their own x_i. The maximum height of that house can't exceed the minimum of all x_i's from the restrictions that include it. Because if any restriction that covers that house requires that the maximum in that range is <= x_i, then the house's height can't be higher than x_i. Because if the house's height is higher than x_i, then the maximum in that range would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction.\n\nWait, no. Suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2. Then the maximum in that range must be <=2. So each house in that range can be at most 2. So for any house in that range, its height can't be more than 2. Similarly, if there's another restriction on [2,4] with x=3. Then house 2 can be up to 3, but since it's in [1,3], it can't be more than 2. So the maximum allowed for house 2 is min(2,3) = 2. So for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their [l_i, r_i] range. But wait, is that correct?\n\nYes. Because any restriction that includes a house in its range imposes an upper bound on that house's height. Because if the house's height is higher than x_i, then the maximum in that range would be higher than x_i, which violates the restriction. Therefore, for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that cover that house. However, there's also the global h limit. So the actual maximum for each house is min(h, min of x_i's from applicable restrictions).\n\nWait, but what if there are no restrictions that cover a house? Then it can be up to h. So for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their [l_i, r_i] range.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily correct. Because some restrictions may not directly cover the house, but their ranges could overlap with other ranges. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says that in [1, 2], the max is 3. And another restriction that says in [2,3], the max is 2. Then for house 2, the maximum allowed is 2. But for house 1, the maximum allowed is 3. However, if house 1 is 3, then in the range [1,2], the max is 3, which is allowed by the first restriction. But if house 2 is 2, then the max in [1,2] is 3, which is okay. So for house 1, the maximum is 3. But suppose there's another restriction on [1,3], which says the max is 2. Then house 1 can't be higher than 2. So the idea is that for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover that house in their range. Because any restriction that covers the house's position would impose that the house's height can't exceed x_i. So the minimal x_i across all such restrictions is the maximum allowed for that house.\n\nSo if we can compute for each house the maximum allowed height, then we can set each house to that maximum, and sum the squares. But is that correct?\n\nWait, let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 3 3 3, with restrictions on each individual house. For house 1, the restriction is 1. So max is 1. For house 2, restriction is 3. So max is 3. For house 3, restriction is 2. So max is 2. So the sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 14, which matches the example. So that approach works here.\n\nAnother example: the second input. The restrictions are on [2,3] with x=8, and [3,4] with x=7. So for house 1: no restrictions, so max is h=10. House 2 is covered by the first restriction (so x=8), but not the second. So max is 8. House 3 is covered by both restrictions. So the min between 8 and 7 is 7. House 4 is covered by the second restriction, so max 7. So the heights are 10,8,7,7. Sum is 10² + 8² +7² +7² = 100+64+49+49= 262, which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the problem reduces to: for each house i, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Then, the maximum height for house i is min(h, that minimal x_i). Then, the total profit is the sum of squares of these maximum heights.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because each restriction requires that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. If for each house in that range, the maximum allowed is <= x_i, then the maximum in the range is <= x_i. So all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nBut how do we compute for each house the minimal x_i from all restrictions that cover it?\n\nYes. So the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each house i (from 1 to n):\n\nmax_height[i] = h\n\nfor each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   if l <= i <= r:\n\n       if x < max_height[i]:\n\n           max_height[i] = x\n\nthen, the total profit is sum of (max_height[i]^2) for all i.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for a restriction (l, r, x), the maximum in the range [l, r] must be <= x. However, if we set all houses in [l, r] to be <= x, then that's sufficient. So for each house in [l, r], their maximum allowed is min(current value, x). So yes, the approach above would capture that.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where even after setting each house to the minimal x_i of their restrictions, there's a restriction that is violated?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there is a restriction that [1,3] must have maximum <= 5. Suppose that for house 1, the minimal x_i is 5. For house 2, the minimal x_i is 4. For house 3, the minimal x_i is 3. Then, the maximum in [1,3] is 5 (house 1). Which is allowed, since the restriction says that the maximum must be <=5. So that's okay.\n\nBut suppose another scenario. Suppose there's a restriction [1,3] with x=3. Then, for each house in 1-3, their max is 3. So the maximum is 3, which satisfies the restriction. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two restrictions. One on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [2,3] with x=2. For house 2, the minimal x is 2. For house 1, it's 3. For house 3, it's 2. Then, the maximum in [1,2] is 3 (house 1) which is allowed. The maximum in [2,3] is 2 (house 2 or 3) which is allowed.\n\nSo the approach works. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing for each house the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover it, then take the minimum between that and h, and sum the squares.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize an array max_height for each house, initially set to h.\n\nFor each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i):\n\n   for each house position in l_i to r_i:\n\n       if x_i < max_height[position], then set max_height[position] = x_i.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares of each max_height[i].\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, suppose there is a restriction that says [1,3] must be <= 5, and another restriction [2,2] must be <= 3. Then, for house 2, the maximum allowed is 3. But the first restriction allows up to 5. However, the max in [1,3] would be 5 (if house 1 is 5, house 2 is 3, house 3 is 5). Then the max is 5, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nBut according to our approach, the max_height for house 1 would be 5 (if no other restrictions), house 2 is 3, house 3 is 5. So the maximum in [1,3] is 5, which is allowed. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the problem can be solved by processing each restriction and for each position in the range, taking the minimum x_i. Then the sum of squares is the answer.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_height as [h] * (n+1) (assuming 1-based index).\n\nThen for each of m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n   for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n       if max_height[i] > x:\n\n           max_height[i] = x\n\nThen, compute the sum of squares of max_height[1..n].\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping restrictions? For example, if there are two restrictions on the same range. For example, [1,3] with x=2 and [1,3] with x=3. Then, for each position in 1-3, the x is min(2,3) = 2. So the code will process both restrictions, and the first one sets the max to 2, then the second one checks if x=3 is smaller than current max (2) which is not, so no change. So the code is correct.\n\nYes. So this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for position 1, set to 1.\n\n2 2 3 → position 2 set to 3.\n\n3 3 2 → position 3 set to 2.\n\nSo max_height is [3, 1, 3, 2]. Sum 1² +3² +2² = 14. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → positions 2 and 3 are set to 8.\n\n3 4 7 → positions 3 and 4 are set to 7.\n\nSo for position 2, it's 8. Position 3 is min(8,7) =7. Position 4 is 7. Position 1 is 10. So sum 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a restriction is on a range that includes multiple positions, but some of them have already been restricted by previous ones.\n\nFor example, n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nFirst restriction: 1-2 with x=3.\n\nSecond restriction: 1-1 with x=4.\n\nAfter processing first restriction, positions 1 and 2 are 3.\n\nProcessing second restriction: for position 1, x=4 is larger than current 3. So no change. So the max_height is [3,3]. Sum 3² +3² = 18. Which is correct, since the first restriction requires that the max in 1-2 is <=3. So even though the second restriction allows position 1 to be up to 4, the first restriction limits it to 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when there are multiple overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions: 1-2 x=3, and 1-2 x=4. Then, for each position, the min is 3. So the sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead the input. The input can be multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the example input given, the first line shows that the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but the actual input for the program is from stdin. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the standard input.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\nThen m lines follow with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples, but in the problem statement, perhaps the user is supposed to read a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says, \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, which for the sample input would be, for example, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich outputs 14.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of two examples. However, that's probably part of the problem's sample input, but for the actual code, the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. Because in competitive programming problems, each test case is handled by the code. So the code should read the input once, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nThen read m lines of restrictions.\n\nThen process as described.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l, r, x.\n\nInitialize max_height as [h] * (n+1) (since spots are 1-based).\n\nThen for each restriction, loop through l to r and update max_height[i] to min(current value, x).\n\nFinally, compute sum of (max_height[i]^2 for i in 1..n).\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_height = [h] * (n + 1)  # indexes 0..n, but 0 unused.\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_height[i] > x:\n            max_height[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += max_height[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich would give max_height for 1: 1, 2:3, 3:2. Sum 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second example input:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nmax_height starts as [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8. So positions 2 and 3 are set to 8. Now max_height is [10, 8, 8, 10, 10].\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7. So for i=3: current value 8, set to 7. i=4: current 10, set to 7. So max_height becomes [10,8,7,7,7]. Then sum is 10^2 +8^2 +7^2 +7^2 = 100+64+49+49= 262. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, check edge cases.\n\nCase where there are no restrictions. Then all houses are h. Sum is n * h².\n\nAnother case: when a restriction is on the entire range. For example, n=2, h=5, m=1, restriction 1-2 with x=3. Then sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, m=2. Restriction 1-2 x=3, then restriction 1-1 x=2. Then the first restriction sets both positions to 3. Then the second restriction sets position 1 to 2. So the sum is 2² +3² = 4+9=13. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when x_i is larger than h. For example, h=3, and a restriction on a range with x=5. Then, since the max allowed is h, which is 3. So the code would set the max_height[i] to min(3, 5) which is 3. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the code, the initial max_height is set to h. Then, for each restriction, the code checks if x is less than current max_height. So if x is larger than h, then the code will not change the max_height[i], which is h. Which is correct.\n\nYes. Because the restriction says that the maximum in the range must be <=x. But since the max allowed is h, which is <=x, the restriction is automatically satisfied. So the code does not need to do anything. So the code handles that correctly.\n\nAnother case: multiple restrictions on the same range. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions (1-2, x=3) and (1-2, x=4). The code will first set positions 1 and 2 to 3. Then, for the second restriction, x=4 is larger than current 3. So no change. So the sum is 3² +3² = 18. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house's height contributes to the profit as the square of its height, and we must ensure that all zoning restrictions are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the maximum possible height for each house to the global maximum height `h`.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each zoning restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each house within the specified range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Sum the squares of the allowable heights for all houses to determine the maximum profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_height = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_height[i] > x:\n            max_height[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += max_height[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The array `max_height` is initialized with the global maximum height `h` for each of the `n` spots.\n2. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, we iterate through the specified range of houses and update their maximum allowable height to ensure it does not exceed the restriction's limit. This ensures that the tallest house in any restricted range does not exceed the specified height.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: After applying all restrictions, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the allowable heights for each house, which gives the maximum possible profit under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each restriction and ensures all constraints are met while maximizing the profit using straightforward iteration and updates. The complexity is manageable due to the small constraints (up to 50 houses and restrictions), making this brute-force approach feasible.",
