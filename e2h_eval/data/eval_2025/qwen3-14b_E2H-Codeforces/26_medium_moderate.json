    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D values. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, since the triangle is non-degenerate, the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values that meet the constraints and check if x + y > z. However, given that the maximum value for D is 5e5, a brute-force approach would be way too slow. For example, if B and C are 5e5, then the number of combinations could be (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1), which would be way too big for a triple loop. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The variables are ordered as x ≤ B, y ≥ B, but since B ≤ C, and y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. Wait, the problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be from A to B, y can be from B to C (since B ≤ y ≤ C), and z can be from C to D. But also, since y is at least B, and x is at most B, so x ≤ B ≤ y. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z? Not exactly. Because x can be up to B, and y starts at B. So for example, x can be B, y can be B, and z can be C. So x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x is up to B, y is at least B, so x ≤ y. And y is up to C, z is at least C, so y ≤ z. Therefore, the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle inequality reduces to x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides x ≤ y ≤ z, the only condition needed is x + y > z. Because z is the largest side.\n\nSo our problem reduces to counting the number of triples (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, for each possible x and y, find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. Because z has to be at least C and at most D, and also less than x + y. So for each (x, y), the valid z's are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But we have to make sure that this interval is valid. For example, if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no such z's. Otherwise, the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nBut then, the problem becomes iterating over all x and y, and for each pair, calculate the count of z's. But even that might be expensive. Let's see the ranges:\n\nx can be from A to B (so up to 5e5 elements),\n\ny can be from B to C (up to 5e5 elements as well). So total pairs are O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which in worst case is (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too big for Python to handle in time. So this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nSo we need to find a way to compute the total number of valid (x, y, z) without iterating all possible x and y.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each z, what is the range of x and y that can satisfy x + y > z. But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible z, the number of (x, y) pairs such that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, y ≤ C, and x + y > z. Then sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nBut again, for each z, how do we compute the number of (x, y) pairs?\n\nBut z can be up to 5e5, and for each z, we need to compute the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z. Let's consider that.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. Let me denote:\n\nFor each z, compute the number of pairs (x, y) with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nThen, the total answer is the sum over all z in [C, D] of this count.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me first think about for a fixed z, what is the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z. Since x and y have their own ranges.\n\nLet me think about the variables x and y. Since x can be from A to B, and y can be from B to C. Let me note that for each x, y can be from max(B, ...) ?\n\nAlternatively, for each x, the minimum y is B and maximum is C. So for a fixed x, the minimum value of x + y is x + B, and the maximum is x + C.\n\nBut for a given z, the condition x + y > z can be rewritten as y > z - x. Since y is at least B, the lower bound for y is max(B, z - x + 1). And the upper bound is C.\n\nSo for each x, the number of valid y is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut again, for each z, iterating over all x in [A, B] would take O(B - A + 1) time per z, which again is O( (B - A + 1) * (D - C + 1) ) time. Which is again potentially O( (5e5)^2 ) operations, which is too slow.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need to find a way to compute the total count for all z in [C, D], by considering the possible ranges of x and y.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that for x and y, since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C, then x can be from A to B, and y can be from B to C. Let me think of the sum x + y. For each possible sum s = x + y, how many pairs (x, y) have that sum?\n\nBut even that seems complicated, but perhaps we can find for a given z, the number of pairs (x, y) where x + y > z. Which is equal to the total number of (x, y) pairs minus the number of pairs where x + y <= z.\n\nThe total number of (x, y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Let's call this total_pairs.\n\nSo for each z, the count is total_pairs - count_pairs_leq(z), where count_pairs_leq(z) is the number of (x, y) pairs with x + y <= z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing for each z, the count_pairs_leq(z), and then summing over z in [C, D] (total_pairs - count_pairs_leq(z)).\n\nBut how to compute count_pairs_leq(z) efficiently?\n\nLet me think about how to compute count_pairs_leq(z). For each x in [A, B], the minimal y is B, and the maximum is C. So for a given x, the maximum y that satisfies x + y <= z is min(C, z - x). But since y has to be >= B, the valid y's are in [B, min(C, z - x)].\n\nBut for this to be valid, z - x must be >= B. So the condition is that z - x >= B → x <= z - B. Otherwise, there are no valid y's for this x.\n\nSo for each x, the number of y's is:\n\nif z - x >= B → then the upper bound is min(C, z - x), and the count is max(0, min(C, z - x) - B + 1).\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo for count_pairs_leq(z), the sum over x from A to B of max(0, min(C, z - x) - B + 1) if z - x >= B, else 0.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently for all z?\n\nLet me consider that for a given z, the sum is over x in [A, B], and for each x, the contribution is the number of y's that are between B and min(C, z - x).\n\nLet me define for each x, the value of y_max = min(C, z - x). Then, the number of y's is y_max - B + 1, provided that y_max >= B. Else zero.\n\nSo the condition is that z - x >= B → x <= z - B.\n\nSo x can range from A to min(B, z - B). Let me think of the x's that satisfy x <= z - B. Let me denote x_max = min(B, z - B). Then, for x in [A, x_max], the y_max is min(C, z - x). For x > x_max, there are no contributions.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nFor x in [A, x_max], the contribution is min(C, z - x) - B + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly?\n\nLet me think about z - x. Let me denote t = z - x. Then, for x in [A, x_max], t ranges from z - x_max to z - A. But since x_max is min(B, z - B), perhaps we can find ranges where z - x is larger than C or not.\n\nSo for a given x, min(C, z - x) is:\n\nif z - x >= C → then it's C.\n\nelse → it's z - x.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\nif z - x >= C → C - B + 1.\n\nelse → (z - x) - B + 1 = z - x - B + 1 = z - B - x + 1.\n\nSo, for x in [A, x_max], the contribution depends on whether z - x >= C.\n\nLet me find for which x values this holds. z - x >= C → x <= z - C.\n\nSo for x in [A, x_max], we can split into two parts:\n\nx <= z - C → contribution is C - B + 1.\n\nx > z - C → contribution is (z - B - x + 1).\n\nSo the sum over x in [A, x_max] can be broken down into two parts:\n\nsum1: x in [A, min(x_max, z - C)] → contribution is (C - B + 1) multiplied by the number of x's in this interval.\n\nsum2: x in [max(A, z - C + 1), x_max] → contribution is sum (z - B - x + 1) over x in this interval.\n\nSo, the problem now is to compute these two sums efficiently.\n\nBut how can we find these intervals for each z?\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each z, we can compute:\n\nx_low = A.\n\nx_high = x_max = min(B, z - B).\n\nIf x_high < x_low, then sum is zero.\n\nElse:\n\nthreshold_x = z - C.\n\nThe first interval is x in [x_low, min(x_high, threshold_x)].\n\nThe second interval is x in [max(x_low, threshold_x + 1), x_high].\n\nBut how do I compute these ranges and their contributions?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for a given z, compute x_max = min(B, z - B). If z - B < A, then x_max < A → no contribution. So sum_pairs_leq(z) is zero.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nCompute threshold_x = z - C.\n\nNow, the first interval is x in [A, min(x_max, threshold_x)].\n\nLet me denote x1_start = A.\n\nx1_end = min(x_max, threshold_x).\n\nIf x1_start > x1_end → then sum1 is zero.\n\nElse, the number of terms is x1_end - x1_start + 1. Multiply by (C - B + 1) → that's sum1.\n\nThen, for sum2:\n\nx2_start = max(A, threshold_x + 1).\n\nx2_end = x_max.\n\nIf x2_start > x2_end → sum2 is zero.\n\nElse, sum2 is the sum from x = x2_start to x2_end of (z - B - x + 1) = sum ( (z - B + 1) - x )\n\nWhich is equal to (z - B + 1) * (number of terms) - sum x from x2_start to x2_end.\n\nThe sum x from a to b is (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)*a)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, for each z, we can compute count_pairs_leq(z) in O(1) time once we have these ranges.\n\nBut how do we handle this for all z in [C, D]?\n\nThe problem is that for each z in [C, D], we need to compute this sum_pairs_leq(z) and then subtract it from total_pairs and add to the answer.\n\nBut with D up to 5e5, and for each z, this is O(1) operations, then the total time would be O(D - C + 1) * O(1) = acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nThen, for each z in [C, D], compute count_pairs_leq(z), and the answer is sum over all z in [C, D] of (total_pairs - count_pairs_leq(z)).\n\nSo the total answer is (number of z's) * total_pairs - sum_over_z (count_pairs_leq(z)).\n\nBut how to compute sum_over_z (count_pairs_leq(z))?\n\nBut for each z, we need to compute count_pairs_leq(z) as discussed above.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this logic correctly.\n\nLet me think about some test cases.\n\nTake the first example input: 1 2 3 4.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ntotal_pairs = (2-1+1) * (3-2+1) = 2*2=4.\n\nFor each z in [3,4], compute count_pairs_leq(z).\n\nLet's compute for z=3:\n\nx_max = min(2, 3 - B) = min(2, 3 - 2) = 1. So x ranges from 1 to 1.\n\nthreshold_x = z - C = 3 -3 = 0.\n\nSo x1_end = min(1, 0) → 0. Since x1_start is 1, which is > x1_end → sum1 is zero.\n\nsum2: x2_start is max(1, 0+1)=1. x2_end is 1.\n\nSo sum2 is sum from x=1 to 1 of (3 - 2 -x +1) → (3-2 is 1, so 1 -x +1 = 2 -x. For x=1, 2 -1 =1. So sum is 1.\n\nThus, count_pairs_leq(z=3) is 1. So for z=3, the contribution to the answer is total_pairs - 1 = 4 -1 =3.\n\nFor z=4:\n\nx_max = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2. So x ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nthreshold_x = 4 -3 = 1.\n\nx1_end is min(2, 1) = 1. x1_start is 1. So sum1 is (1-1+1) * (C-B+1) → 1 * (3-2+1) = 1*2=2.\n\nsum2: x2_start is max(1, 1+1) = 2. x2_end is 2. So sum from x=2 to 2 of (4 -2 -x +1) → (4-2 is 2, so 2 -x +1 = 3 -x. For x=2: 3-2=1. So sum is 1. Total count_pairs_leq(z=4) is 2+1=3. Thus, contribution is 4-3=1.\n\nSo for z=3 and z=4, the contributions are 3 and 1. Summing them gives 4, which matches the first example's output. So this approach works.\n\nAnother example: second input is 1 2 2 5. Output is 3.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ntotal_pairs = (2-1+1) * (2-2+1) = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nz ranges from 2 to 5.\n\nFor each z in [2,5]:\n\nLet's compute count_pairs_leq(z) for each z.\n\nFor z=2:\n\nx_max = min(2, 2 - B) = min(2, 2-2=0) → 0. Since x starts at 1, no contribution. So count_pairs_leq(z=2) is 0. Contribution is 2-0=2.\n\nz=3:\n\nx_max = min(2, 3 - 2) = 1. So x ranges from 1 to 1.\n\nthreshold_x = 3 - 2 =1.\n\nx1_end is min(1, 1) =1. sum1 is (1-1+1) * (2-2+1) = 1 *1=1.\n\nsum2: x2_start is max(1, 1+1=2) → 2, which is > x_max (1). So sum2 is 0. Total count_pairs_leq(z=3) is 1. Contribution 2-1=1.\n\nz=4:\n\nx_max = min(2, 4 - 2) = 2.\n\nthreshold_x =4 -2=2.\n\nx1_end = min(2, 2) =2. sum1 is (2-1+1) * (1) → 2*1=2. sum2: x2_start is max(1, 2+1=3) → 3 > x_max 2. So sum2 is 0. count_pairs_leq(z=4) is 2. contribution is 2-2=0.\n\nz=5:\n\nx_max = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2.\n\nthreshold_x =5-2=3.\n\nx1_end = min(2,3) → 2. sum1 is (2-1+1)*1=2. sum2: x2_start is max(1, 3+1=4) →4>2 → sum2=0. count_pairs_leq(z=5)=2. contribution 2-2=0.\n\nSo sum over z=2 to 5: contributions are 2 (z=2) +1 (z=3) +0 (z=4) +0 (z=5) → total 3, which matches the sample output. So this approach works.\n\nSo the plan is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python. Let's outline the steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nCompute the answer as sum over z in [C, D] of (total_pairs - count_pairs_leq(z)).\n\nNow, the key is to compute count_pairs_leq(z) for each z in [C, D].\n\nImplementing count_pairs_leq(z):\n\ndef count_pairs_leq(z):\n\n    x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\n    if x_max < A:\n\n        return 0\n\n    threshold_x = z - C\n\n    # compute sum1 and sum2\n\n    x1_start = A\n\n    x1_end = min(x_max, threshold_x)\n\n    if x1_start > x1_end:\n\n        sum1 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count_x1 = x1_end - x1_start + 1\n\n        sum1 = count_x1 * (C - B + 1)\n\n    x2_start = max(A, threshold_x + 1)\n\n    x2_end = x_max\n\n    if x2_start > x2_end:\n\n        sum2 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        # compute sum (z - B - x + 1) for x in [x2_start, x2_end]\n\n        # which is sum ( (z - B + 1) - x )\n\n        # = (z - B +1) * (x2_end - x2_start + 1) - sum_x\n\n        n_terms = x2_end - x2_start + 1\n\n        sum_x = (x2_end * (x2_end + 1) // 2) - ((x2_start - 1) * x2_start // 2)\n\n        sum2 = ( (z - B + 1) * n_terms ) - sum_x\n\n    return sum1 + sum2\n\nBut wait, the sum for sum2 is (z - B - x + 1) = (z - B +1 - x). So yes.\n\nNow, for each z in [C, D], compute this count_pairs_leq(z), and accumulate the sum.\n\nOnce that is done, the answer is (number_of_z) * total_pairs - sum_count_pairs_leq.\n\nBut how to compute the number_of_z? It's (D - C + 1).\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, the code needs to loop through all z from C to D, compute count_pairs_leq(z), sum them, then subtract from total_pairs multiplied by the number of z's.\n\nBut for large D and C, say D is 5e5 and C is 1, that's 5e5 iterations. Each iteration is O(1), which is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, even 5e5 iterations are acceptable.\n\nNow, edge cases to consider:\n\nCase when C is larger than z - B. For example, when z is small. Like in the first example, z=3, which is C=3. For x_max = min(B, z-B) = min(2, 3-2=1) = 1.\n\nAnother edge case is when A=B=C=D. For example, the third sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000. Then:\n\ntotal_pairs = (1) * (1) =1.\n\nz is 500000. For count_pairs_leq(z):\n\nx_max = min(500000, 500000 - 500000) = 0. Since A=500000, x_max < A → returns 0. So contribution is 1 - 0 =1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when z is very small, like C=3 and z=3, but x_max is 0. Then count_pairs_leq(z) is 0.\n\nAnother case: when threshold_x is less than A. For example, z is such that threshold_x = z - C is less than A. Then x1_end is min(x_max, threshold_x) which is less than A. So sum1 is 0. Then x2_start is max(A, threshold_x +1). If threshold_x +1 is less than A, then x2_start is A, but x_max may be less than A. So sum2 is zero.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut let's think about possible integer overflows. But in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no problem.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is four integers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut in the actual problem, the input is one line with four integers. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. But the sample shows multiple lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin, and output to stdout. So the code should read one line (for one test case) and output the answer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should process one input line. Or perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So the code should read one line of input, split into four integers.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nIn the first example, the input is ['1 2 3 4', ...], but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But the original problem statement says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is three lines, each being a separate test case. The output is three lines. So the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem description says that the input is four integers. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines, each with four integers. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input format is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line. However, the problem says \"the first line contains four integers...\" which implies a single test case. But perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description may be incorrect. But given the sample input and output, it's more likely that the code should read multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement may be ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the user's instruction:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, the code must read from stdin. For example, in programming contests, sometimes the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the code should read a single test case. But the sample input shows three lines. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first example's input is '1 2 3 4' and output is '4'. The second input is '1 2 2 5' and output '3', etc. So the code must read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case. Hence, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding result for each.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is four integers. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given the sample input and output, the code must read multiple lines, each with four integers.\n\nSo the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo, in Python, the code will read all lines from stdin, process each line as a test case.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code.\n\nThe code outline is:\n\nRead each line from stdin.\n\nFor each line:\n\nSplit into A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nCompute sum_count_pairs_leq = 0.\n\nFor z in range(C, D+1):\n\n   compute count_pairs_leq(z) and add to sum_count_pairs_leq.\n\nanswer = (D - C + 1) * total_pairs - sum_count_pairs_leq.\n\nPrint answer.\n\nNow, implement count_pairs_leq(z) as discussed.\n\nBut for large D and C, say D=5e5, and C=5e5, then the loop runs once. But if C=1 and D=5e5, then the loop runs 5e5 times. Which is acceptable in Python?\n\nWell, 5e5 iterations in Python are manageable, but perhaps we can optimize further.\n\nBut given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut first, handling the input.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, the code must read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    ... compute answer ...\n\nBut for the sample input, each line is a separate test case.\n\nNow, the code for count_pairs_leq(z) is as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_pairs_leq(z, A, B, C):\n\n    x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\n    if x_max < A:\n\n        return 0\n\n    threshold_x = z - C\n\n    # compute sum1\n\n    x1_start = A\n\n    x1_end = min(x_max, threshold_x)\n\n    if x1_start > x1_end:\n\n        sum1 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count_x1 = x1_end - x1_start + 1\n\n        sum1 = count_x1 * (C - B + 1)\n\n    # compute sum2\n\n    x2_start = max(A, threshold_x + 1)\n\n    x2_end = x_max\n\n    if x2_start > x2_end:\n\n        sum2 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        n_terms = x2_end - x2_start + 1\n\n        sum_x = (x2_end * (x2_end + 1) // 2) - ((x2_start - 1) * x2_start // 2)\n\n        sum2 = ( (z - B + 1) * n_terms ) - sum_x\n\n    return sum1 + sum2\n\nBut wait, in the parameters, the function needs to know A, B, C. So inside the code, for each test case, we pass A, B, C.\n\nNow, in the code for each test case:\n\nA, B, C, D = ... \n\ntotal_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n\nsum_count = 0\n\nfor z in range(C, D+1):\n\n    sum_count += count_pairs_leq(z, A, B, C)\n\nans = (D - C + 1) * total_pairs - sum_count\n\nprint(ans)\n\nBut for large D, like 5e5, and C=1, this loop would take 5e5 iterations. Let's see for D=5e5, that's 5e5 iterations. Each iteration involves some calculations, but in Python, this may be tight for time constraints.\n\nBut for 5e5 iterations, each with O(1) operations, it's manageable. Let's think: 5e5 iterations in Python can be done in about 0.1-0.5 seconds, depending on the operations. But perhaps with some optimizations.\n\nBut for the worst case, when D is 5e5 and C is 1, the code will run 5e5 iterations. Let's see if we can find a way to optimize this.\n\nBut given that the code passes the sample inputs, let's proceed.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → output 4.\n\nLet's compute:\n\ntotal_pairs = (2-1+1)*(3-2+1) = 2 * 2 =4.\n\nsum_count for z=3 and z=4:\n\nFor z=3:\n\ncount_pairs_leq is 1.\n\nfor z=4: count_pairs_leq is 3.\n\nsum_count = 1 +3 =4.\n\nans = 2 *4 -4 = 4 → correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 1 2 2 5 → output 3.\n\ntotal_pairs = (2-1+1) * (2-2+1) = 2*1=2.\n\nz ranges from 2 to 5 (4 values).\n\nsum_count for each z:\n\nz=2:\n\nx_max = min(2, 2 - 2) = 0 → <1 → 0.\n\nz=3:\n\nx_max = min(2, 3-2=1) →1.\n\nthreshold_x =3-2=1.\n\nsum1: x1_start=1, x1_end=1 → count_x1=1 → sum1=1*(2-2+1)=1*1=1.\n\nsum2: x2_start = max(1, 1+1=2) →2. x2_end=1 → no. sum2=0. total 1.\n\nz=3 contributes 1.\n\nz=4:\n\nx_max = min(2, 4-2=2) →2.\n\nthreshold_x =4-2=2.\n\nsum1: x1_start=1, x1_end = min(2,2)=2. count_x1=2 → 2 * (1) =2.\n\nsum2: x2_start = max(1, 2+1=3) →3. x2_end=2 → no. sum2=0. total 2.\n\nz=4 contributes 2.\n\nz=5:\n\nx_max = min(2, 5-2=3) →2.\n\nthreshold_x =5-2=3.\n\nsum1: x1_end = min(2,3) →2. sum1 is 2 terms *1=2.\n\nsum2: x2_start = max(1,3+1=4) →4>2. sum2=0. total 2.\n\nsum_count =0 (z=2) +1 (z=3) +2 (z=4) +2 (z=5) → total 5.\n\nans = (5-2+1)*2 -5 → (4)*2 -5 =8-5=3 → correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\ntotal_pairs is (1) * (1) =1.\n\nz ranges from 500000 to 500000 (only one value).\n\ncount_pairs_leq(z=500000):\n\nx_max = min(500000, 500000 - 500000) → min(500000, 0) →0. Which is <A=500000 → returns 0. So sum_count is 0.\n\nans = 1 *1 -0 =1 → correct.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for large D and C, the loop for z in range(C, D+1) may be slow. Let's think about optimizing.\n\nBut for the constraints, D can be up to 5e5. So 5e5 iterations are acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_pairs_leq(z, A, B, C):\n    x_max = min(B, z - B)\n    if x_max < A:\n        return 0\n    threshold_x = z - C\n    # compute sum1\n    x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints based on given integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The constraints are $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we can simplify the triangle inequality check to $x + y > z$ since $x \\leq y \\leq z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ must lie within specific ranges. We need to count valid triangles efficiently without iterating through all possible combinations, which would be computationally infeasible for large values.\n2. **Total Valid Pairs**: Calculate the total number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs, which is $(B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)$.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: For each possible value of $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, compute the number of invalid $(x, y)$ pairs where $x + y \\leq z$. Subtract this from the total valid pairs to get the count of valid triangles for each $z$.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Sum the contributions of valid triangles across all valid $z$ values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_pairs_leq(z, A, B, C):\n    x_max = min(B, z - B)\n    if x_max < A:\n        return 0\n    threshold_x = z - C\n    \n    # Compute sum1\n    x1_start = A\n    x1_end = min(x_max, threshold_x)\n    if x1_start > x1_end:\n        sum1 = 0\n    else:\n        count_x1 = x1_end - x1_start + 1\n        sum1 = count_x1 * (C - B + 1)\n    \n    # Compute sum2\n    x2_start = max(A, threshold_x + 1)\n    x2_end = x_max\n    if x2_start > x2_end:\n        sum2 = 0\n    else:\n        n_terms = x2_end - x2_start + 1\n        sum_x = (x2_end * (x2_end + 1) // 2) - ((x2_start - 1) * x2_start // 2)\n        sum2 = ((z - B + 1) * n_terms) - sum_x\n    \n    return sum1 + sum2\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.split())\n        total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n        sum_count = 0\n        for z in range(C, D + 1):\n            sum_count += count_pairs_leq(z, A, B, C)\n        num_z = D - C + 1\n        ans = num_z * total_pairs - sum_count\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines of input, each containing four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Total Valid Pairs Calculation**: The total number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs is calculated once per test case.\n3. **Counting Invalid Pairs**: For each $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, the function `count_pairs_leq` calculates the number of invalid $(x, y)$ pairs where $x + y \\leq z$ using efficient range calculations and arithmetic series sums.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result for each test case is derived by subtracting the sum of invalid pairs from the product of total valid pairs and the number of valid $z$ values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles without iterating through all possible combinations, making the solution feasible even for large input values.",
