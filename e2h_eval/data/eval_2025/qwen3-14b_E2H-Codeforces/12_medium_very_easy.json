The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the time between current_pos and a_i depends on their positions.\n\nWait, the movement is clockwise. So if current_pos is 1 and a_i is 3, then moving clockwise takes 2 steps. But if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 1, then moving clockwise would take (n - 3 + 1) steps? Like for n=4, moving from 3 to 1 clockwise is 2 steps (3→4→1). So the time between two positions is (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if a_i is greater than current_pos, then it's a_i - current_pos steps. If it's smaller, then (n - current_pos + a_i) steps. So the total steps between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (n - current_pos + a_i). Alternatively, we can compute it as (a_i - current_pos) % n, but wait, if a_i is less than current_pos, then (a_i - current_pos) is negative, and mod n would give the correct positive value. Wait, for example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 1, n=4. (1-3) = -2. mod 4 would be 2, which is correct. So yes, the time between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if positive, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which can be calculated as (a_i - current_pos) % n, but wait, no. Because if a_i is less than current_pos, (a_i - current_pos) is negative. For example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 1, n=4. (1-3) is -2. mod 4 is 2. Which is correct. So the formula is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (1-3) %4 is 2. So yes, that gives the correct number of steps.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input: 4 3, tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nThe initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. So movement from 1 to 3: steps are 2 (1→2→3). Which is (3-1) = 2. Correct.\n\nThen, current position is 3. Next task is 2. So movement from 3 to 2. Since it's clockwise, she has to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. (2 -3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. Correct. Then, current position is 2. Next task is 3. Movement from 2 to 3: 1 step. Total steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\nCalculate the steps needed to get from current_pos to a_i, add that to total_time.\n\nUpdate current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the movement time between them is zero. So the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of a_i's, and for each one, calculate the distance from the current position to a_i, add that to the total, and update the current position.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   delta = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nReturn total_time.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first sample:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2 → total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond a_i is 2: (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3 → total is 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird a_i is 3: (3-2) mod4=1 → total is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '4 3\\n2 3 3' → output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1 → total is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond a_i is 3: (3-2)=1 → total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird a_i is 3: (3-3)=0 → total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop over each a in the list:\n\n   delta = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input description, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the time is (1-1) mod2 =0. So total is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. The first step is 0 (current is 1, a is 1). Then next step is (2-1) mod2 =1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. First step is (2-1) mod2 =1. Then (1-2) mod2 = ( -1 ) mod2 =1. Total is 2.\n\nWhich makes sense: 1 →2 (1 step), then 2 →1 (1 step). Total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the problem is to read the input correctly. The input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list a has exactly m elements. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of m integers.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time =0.\n\nLoop through each element in a:\n\n   compute delta = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   add delta to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nAs we saw.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when the tasks are all in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1]. The total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: when moving around the ring multiple times.\n\nLike n=5, m=3, a = [3, 5, 1]. Let's compute:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 3: (3-1) =2 mod5 is 2 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a_i is 5: (5-3) =2 → total 4. current is 5.\n\nThird a_i is 1: (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 = 1 → total 4+1=5. Which is correct: 5→1 is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case where the movement wraps around.\n\nFor example, n=5, m=2, a = [1, 5]. The steps are:\n\nFrom 1 to 1: 0. Then from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. Total is 4. Which is correct: moving 1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. Steps: from 1 to 5 is 4 steps. Then from 5 to 1 is 1 step. Total 5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, process as described.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen the second line as list of m integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → code returns 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → code returns 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house number 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the house where the task needs to be completed.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Use modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement. The time to move from the current position to the target house is calculated as `(target_house - current_position) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This ensures that moving clockwise around the ringroad is correctly accounted for.\n4. **Update Position**: After computing the time for each move, update the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house number 1 and initialize the total time to zero.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. This ensures that moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered one (clockwise) is correctly calculated.\n- **Update Total Time**: Accumulate the time taken for each move and update the current position to the target house after each move.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the total time required by iterating through each task exactly once, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(m), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
