The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For the first input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Start at 1. First task is at 3. How long does that take? From 1 to 3 clockwise. Since it's a circle, moving clockwise, the distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But since she's at 3, how to get there? Well, moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then she does task 2. Then task 3 is at 3 again. So from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to process the tasks in order, and for each consecutive pair of tasks, compute the time needed to move from the current position to the next task's position, considering the circular nature.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's think. Suppose Xenia is currently at position current_pos, and needs to move to next_pos. Since movement is clockwise, the time taken is (next_pos - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if next_pos is larger than current_pos, then the distance is next_pos - current_pos. But if next_pos is smaller, then it's (n - current_pos + next_pos). For example, current_pos is 3, next_pos is 2. The distance is (4-3 + 2) = 3 steps? Wait, n is 4 here. So yes. So the formula for the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (n - current + next). Alternatively, (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. Let's take example current is 3, next is 2. (2-3) is -1. Mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is 2, current is 3, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the distance is (next - current) % n? But wait, if next is current, then the distance is zero. So yes.\n\nWait, but for example, when current is 1 and next is 3, (3-1) is 2 mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes. So the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n. But wait, in the case where next is 2 and current is 3, (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So that formula works. So for each consecutive tasks, we can calculate the distance between the previous position and the current task's position, and sum them all up.\n\nBut what about the initial position? Xenia starts at 1. So the first task's position is a_1. The distance from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Or maybe not. Because if a_1 is 1, then the distance is 0. If a_1 is 2, then it's 1. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1.\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the distance from current position to a_i, add it to the total time.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the distance between them is zero. So the code should handle that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n ?\n\nWait, no. Because (a_i - current_pos) could be negative. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers. Let me check.\n\nFor example, (2-3) %4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, (-1) %4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, using (a_i - current_pos) %n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, let's take the first example. The first task is 3. current_pos is 1. (3-1) is 2 mod4 is 2. Correct. Then current_pos is 3. Next task is 2. (2-3) is -1 mod4 is 3. Which is correct. Then current is 2. Next task is 3. (3-2) mod4 is 1. So total is 2+3+1=6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3 and the tasks are 2,3,3. Output is 2. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is (2-1) mod4=1. Current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. Total now 2.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor each ai in a:\n\n    time += (ai - current) % n\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but why does that work? Because for each consecutive task, we compute the time to get from the previous position to the current task's position, and sum them all.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nBut let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then time is (1-1) mod2=0. Correct.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Time is (1-1) mod2=0, then (2-1) mod2=1. Total 1. Which is correct: start at 1, do task 1 (no movement), then move to 2 (1 step).\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Time is (2-1) mod2=1, then (1-2) mod2=1. Total 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). So total 2.\n\nYes. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward. Now, considering that n and m can be up to 1e5, but the code is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input correctly is important. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two examples given. However, the user probably wants to read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin, not from a file. So for example, in the sample input, the first example is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and a list [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen process as per above.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of a's.\n\nBut in Python, for reading input, sometimes people use input().split(), but for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the purposes of code submission, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    total += (num - current) % n\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check for the first example. The first example's input is 4 3, then 3 2 3. So the code would process:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code works for that case.\n\nAnother example: input 4 3, and the list is 2,3,3. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod4 is 1. total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total 2. current 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0. total 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about if the list has multiple tasks in the same house?\n\nLike n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. Then the total time is 0. Because each step is (1-1) mod5=0. So total is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[1,2,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1. First step is 1-1=0. current 1. Then 2-1=1 mod5=1. total is 1. Then 1-2 mod5 is ( -1 ) mod5=4. So total is 1+4=5. So the steps are: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (4 steps). So total 5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin. Also, note that in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead n and m, then the list a. Then process as above.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n    total += diff\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6. Which the code produces.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2. Which the code produces.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and moves clockwise. Each task must be completed in the specified order, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses in a circular arrangement can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. For any two positions `current` and `next`, the distance is `(next - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This handles both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements efficiently.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in the sequence, compute the distance from the current position to the task's position, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the task's position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1, initialize total time to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's position using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. Accumulate this distance into the total time and update the current position.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required time in linear time, O(m), which is optimal given the problem constraints.",
