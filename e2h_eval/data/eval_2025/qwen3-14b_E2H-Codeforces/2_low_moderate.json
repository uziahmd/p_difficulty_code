Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to check:\n\n1. Check all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char != o_char.\n\nBut how to check for the diagonals and non-diagonals?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the grid.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- It's on a diagonal if i == j (main diagonal) or i + j == n - 1 (other diagonal). Because for a 0-based index, the sum of i and j for the other diagonal would be n-1. For example, in a 3x3 grid, positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) sum to 2 (which is 3-1).\n\nSo for each cell, check if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals and check they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize two variables: diag_char and other_char.\n\nBut wait, for the diagonals, all elements must be same. So first, collect all elements from the diagonals. Then check if all are same. Similarly for the non-diagonal elements.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think for the first part.\n\nFor each row i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for each column j in 0..n-1:\n\n       if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n           add to diagonals set.\n\n       else:\n\n           add to others set.\n\nWait, but for the diagonals, all elements must be same. So the diagonals set should have only one unique character. Similarly for others set.\n\nBut what if the diagonals have more than one character? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCheck that all elements on the diagonals are same. Then check that all non-diagonal elements are same. Then check that the two are different.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nStore this as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\nCollect all the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut for the diagonals, we can check each cell. Let's collect all the diagonal characters into a set. If the size of that set is not 1, then return NO.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal characters. Collect them into another set. If size is not 1, return NO.\n\nThen check that the two sets are different.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the non-diagonal characters are same as the diagonal ones? Then the answer is NO.\n\nSo, for example, if all cells are same, then diagonals are same, but others are same as diagonals. So that would not satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCheck:\n\n- All diagonals have same character (d_char)\n- All non-diagonals have same character (o_char)\n- d_char != o_char\n\nIf all three are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, how to collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            # part of diagonal\n        else:\n            # part of others\n\nSo, collect all diagonal characters into a set. Let's collect them in a list, then check if all are same.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can check as we go.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Separate the characters on the diagonals from those not on the diagonals.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Ensure all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Ensure all characters not on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check that the characters on the diagonals are different from those not on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(other_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != other_chars:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the size of the grid `n`. The subsequent `n` lines are read into a list called `grid`.\n2. **Separating Characters**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (i.e., `i == j` or `i + j == n - 1`), its character is added to `diag_chars`. Otherwise, it is added to `other_chars`.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - If `diag_chars` has exactly one unique character, it means all diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Similarly, if `other_chars` has exactly one unique character, all non-diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Finally, we check that the characters on the diagonals are different from those not on the diagonals by comparing the sets `diag_chars` and `other_chars`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and correctness in determining if the grid forms an \"X\".",
