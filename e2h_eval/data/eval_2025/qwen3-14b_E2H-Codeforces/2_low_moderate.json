Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n, the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). But wait, for odd n, these two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So, that cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo, for all cells in the diagonals, they must be the same. Let's say the diagonal character is 'd'. Then, all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same character 'o', and 'd' != 'o'.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform:\n\n1. Check all cells on the two diagonals. They must all be the same. Let's collect all these cells and check their values.\n2. Check all other cells (not on the diagonals) and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to check for the diagonals?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal, each cell (i, i) where i ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, each cell (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since the center cell is part of both diagonals, when collecting the diagonal characters, I need to make sure that I don't have duplicates. But for checking, if all the cells in both diagonals are same, then even if there's overlap, it's okay.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but for example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the (1,1) cell is part of both. So when collecting all diagonal cells, the (1,1) is counted once. But for the check, all the cells in the two diagonals must be same. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti has some other character, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first step is to collect all the cells that are on either diagonal, and check that all of them are the same.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal cells and check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n- For each cell in the grid, check whether it's on a diagonal or not.\n\nBut how to check if a cell (i,j) is on a diagonal?\n\nA cell is on the main diagonal if i == j.\n\nA cell is on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. Else, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect all the characters in the diagonals. Let's take the first cell (0,0) as the reference. All other diagonal cells must be equal to this one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the first cell is part of the main diagonal. But for example, if the main diagonal has all same characters, and the anti-diagonal also has same characters, but the two diagonals have different characters. Then, the entire diagonals are not same. So, the code needs to check that all the cells in the diagonals are same.\n\nSo, for example, in the first step, collect all the characters in the diagonals. Let's collect them into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. But also, the non-diagonal characters must be same and different.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals? For example, in a 3x3 grid, the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0), (0,2), (1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all cells on both diagonals of the square must contain the same character, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same character different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters from both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Ensure all these characters are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters not on the diagonals. Ensure all these characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Validation**: If both checks pass, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1:\n    if diag_chars.pop() != non_diag_chars.pop():\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Collecting Characters**: We use two sets to collect characters from the diagonals (`diag_chars`) and non-diagonal cells (`non_diag_chars`).\n3. **Checking Uniformity**: \n   - The set `diag_chars` should have exactly one unique character, ensuring all diagonal elements are the same.\n   - The set `non_diag_chars` should also have exactly one unique character, ensuring all non-diagonal elements are the same.\n4. **Validation**: If both sets have one unique character each and they are different, the grid forms an \"X\", so we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and correctness.",
