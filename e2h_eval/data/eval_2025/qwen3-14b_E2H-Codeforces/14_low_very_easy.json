He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me consider the example given. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. The count for 5! is 1 (since 5/5=1). For 6!, same as 5! multiplied by 6, which doesn't add another 5. So the count remains 1. Similarly up to 9. Then 10! would add another 5 (from 10), so count becomes 2. So between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers here.\n\nBut how to find these numbers for any m?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers that also give m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But sometimes, like when n is a multiple of 25, it increases by 2. So the count is not strictly increasing by 1 each time. Therefore, for some m, there might be multiple n's that give the same count.\n\nWait, but for example, when you have m=5. Let's see:\n\nn=24: count is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. n=25: 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. Wait, so between 25 and ...? So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros? Or maybe there's a range where the count is 5?\n\nWait, let's compute for n=25: 6 zeros. For n=24: 4. So what about numbers between 25 and ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me recheck. For example, for n=25, the count is 5 (from 25/5) plus 1 (from 25/25) = 6. So how do we get a count of 5? Let's think of n=24: 24/5 is 4.8 → floor is 4. 24/25 is 0. So total 4. So between 25 and ... ?\n\nWait, maybe for numbers between 25 and 29, the count is 6? Let's see for n=25: 6. n=26: same as 25, since 26/5 is 5.2 → floor 5. 26/25 is 1. So 5+1=6. Similarly for 27, 28, 29. Then n=30: 30/5=6, 30/25=1.2 → 1. Total 7. So between 25-29, the count is 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. So for m=5, the answer is zero?\n\nBut how does that fit into the problem? So for some m, there may be no solution. Like in the sample input where m=5, the output is 0. Wait, in the example given, the second input is 5, output is 0. So that's the case.\n\nSo the problem requires that for a given m, we find all n's such that their factorial has exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find them?\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\nFirst, find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must list these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and higher powers (like 25, 125, etc.) contribute more than one. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is **non-decreasing** as $ n $ increases. However, it does not increase by exactly 1 every time, especially when $ n $ is a multiple of higher powers of 5 (e.g., 25, 125, etc.).\n\nBecause of this, there may be ranges of $ n $ values where the number of trailing zeros remains constant, or there may be no $ n $ for which the count is exactly $ m $.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: We can use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m $.\n2. **Check for Valid Range**: Once we find this $ n $, we check if $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) == m $. If not, then no such $ n $ exists.\n3. **Determine Range of Valid $ n $**: If $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) == m $, we can increment $ n $ until the count increases, and collect all valid $ n $'s in that range.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- Use a helper function `count_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- Use binary search to efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m $.\n- From this starting point, iterate forward while the count remains equal to $ m $.\n\n---\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lower bound of n with count_zeros >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # Now low is the smallest n with count_zeros >= m\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        return []\n    # Now find all n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    res = []\n    while count_zeros(low) == m:\n        res.append(low)\n        low += 1\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_values = [int(x) for x in input.split()]\n    for m in m_values:\n        n_list = find_n_values(m)\n        print(len(n_list))\n        if len(n_list) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, n_list)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFor input:\n```\n1 5\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n0\n```\n\n- For $ m = 1 $: There are 5 values of $ n $ (5 through 9) whose factorials end in exactly one zero.\n- For $ m = 5 $: No such $ n $ exists, so the output is `0`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles large values of $ m $ (up to 100,000) and correctly identifies the number of $ n $'s and their values.",
