He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, for a given m, I need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how?\n\nThe key here is to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. However, there's a catch. For some m, there might be no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, if m is 5, let's see: Let's compute for n=24. The trailing zeros would be 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → total 4. For n=25, it's 25//5=5 + 25//25=1 → total 6. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the first step is to find for a given m, whether there exists n such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. And then find all such n's.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think. Let's say I can find the lower and upper bounds for n that would produce exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count. So for example, when n increases, the count either stays the same or increases.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's where f(n) = m. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers where the count remains m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (maybe? Wait, no, perhaps more). Wait, for example, in the sample input m=1. Let's see:\n\nn=5: 5//5=1 → 1 zero. Then n=6, 7, 8, 9: each of these will have 1 zero. Because 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So total 1. So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo why does this happen? Because when you add numbers that are not multiples of 5, the count of zeros doesn't change. So for example, when n increases from 5 to 6, since 6 is not divisible by 5, the count remains same. But when you reach 10, which is divisible by 5, the count increases again.\n\nSo the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros are consecutive numbers. So the problem reduces to finding the lower bound and upper bound of n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, we can find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there are any numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of n's that satisfy f(n) = m is either 0, 1, or 5. Wait, no. Wait, for example, let's take m=2. Let's see:\n\nFor n=10: 10//5 + 10//25 = 2 + 0 = 2. Then n=11, 12, 13, 14. All of them will have the same count. So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14. So again 5 numbers. So why?\n\nBecause when you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases. So between two multiples of 5, the count is same. So for example, between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Between 10 and 14, it's 2. Between 15 and ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the range of `n` values that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of `n` values that produce exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in determining the smallest and largest `n` values that yield exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n3. **Check Validity**: After determining the range, we check if the count of trailing zeros for the found values actually equals `m`. If not, there are no valid `n` values for the given `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Find the lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    lower = low\n\n    # Check if count is exactly m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Find upper bound\n    low = lower\n    high = 5 * m + 5\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    upper = low - 1\n\n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by summing the integer divisions of `n` by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **find_n_values(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest `n` (lower bound) and the largest `n` (upper bound) such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeros. If no such `n` exists, it returns an empty list.\n3. **main()**: Reads the input value `m`, computes the valid `n` values using `find_n_values`, and prints the results in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency by leveraging binary search to quickly narrow down the possible values of `n`, making the solution suitable even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
