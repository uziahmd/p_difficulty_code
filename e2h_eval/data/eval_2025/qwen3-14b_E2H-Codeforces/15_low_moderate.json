They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion of a playoff tournament given certain rules for each phase of the tournament. \n\nSo, the setup is that there are 2^n teams, and each phase halves the number of teams until one remains. Each phase has specific rules: for phase i (starting from 1?), if s[i] is 0, then in each match of that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's 1, the higher-skilled team wins. And we need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. The key here is to model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x whether it's possible for it to reach the end by following the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think recursively. For a given x, can we simulate its path through the tournament?\n\nWait, but the permutation p is not given. So the problem is to find all x such that there exists some arrangement of the other teams' skill levels (as a permutation) where x can win the tournament according to the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how to model the possible ranges of x in each round?\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. The tournament is a binary tree. Each round, teams are paired, and based on the rules of that round, the winner proceeds. So for each round, depending on the rule (higher or lower skill), the winner is determined.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary except for being a permutation, perhaps we can model for each possible x, what is the minimum and maximum possible skill levels that x can have in order to win the tournament, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, we can model the possible range of values it must have in each round to survive. Let me think.\n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), the rules are determined by s[0]. Suppose s[0] is '1', meaning higher skill wins. Then, in each match, the higher-skilled team wins. So, for x to survive the first phase, it must be that in its initial match, it's the higher-skilled team. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the other teams in such a way that x can win.\n\nBut how do we model the possible x's that can make it through each phase?\n\nAnother approach: think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to be the champion, it must win in each of the n rounds. For each round, depending on the rule (s[i]), x must be able to win its matches in that round.\n\nBut how do we model the possible opponents x could face in each round?\n\nLet's consider the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first round, the teams are paired into 2^{n-1} matches. The winners proceed to the next round. In the second round, they are again paired into 2^{n-2} matches, etc.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be any permutation, we can arrange the opponents in each round such that x can win according to the rules of that round. However, the opponents in each round must be such that they are the ones that x would have faced based on the structure of the tournament.\n\nWait, but the structure of the tournament is fixed. For example, the initial pairing is (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. But since the permutation p is arbitrary, the actual skill levels of the teams can be arranged in any way. However, the structure of the tournament (which teams meet each other in which rounds) depends on their initial positions. But since the permutation can be chosen arbitrarily, maybe the initial positions can be arranged in a way that allows x to be in a certain path through the tournament.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the permutation p is given, and the string s determines the outcome of each phase. However, our task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion. So, the permutation p can be arranged in any way as long as it's a permutation, and we need to find all x that can be champions under some p.\n\nSo, the question is: for a given x, can we arrange the permutation p such that x wins all the rounds according to the rules of each phase?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. For example, in a 3-round tournament (n=3), there are 8 teams. Each round, the number of teams halves. The champion must have won in each round.\n\nIn each round, the rule determines whether the winner is the higher or lower skill. For x to be the champion, in each round, x must be able to beat the opponent it faces in that round according to the rule of that round.\n\nBut since we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion of a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves simulating the tournament structure and determining possible ranges of skill levels that can win based on the given rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree with `2^n` teams. Each round halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Rules per Phase**: Each phase (round) has a rule (either '0' or '1') indicating whether the lower or higher skill level team wins.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each possible skill level `x`, determine the minimum and maximum values it can have in each round to ensure it can win according to the given rules. This is done using a recursive approach where we maintain intervals of possible values that can win from a given round onwards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    def get_winning_values(n, s):\n        # We will use a recursive approach to compute the possible ranges\n        # For each round, we track the min and max possible value of x that can win\n        # We'll use memoization to avoid redundant calculations\n        \n        from functools import lru_cache\n\n        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n        def dfs(round_idx, depth):\n            # round_idx is 0-based, from 0 to n-1\n            # depth is the current depth in the tree, starting from 0 (root is depth n-1)\n            if depth == 0:\n                # Only one team left, so any value is valid\n                return (1, 2**n)\n            else:\n                current_rule = s[round_idx]\n                # The number of teams in this round is 2^(n - round_idx)\n                # Each match reduces the number of teams by half\n                # For this round, we need to find the possible range of x that can win this round\n                # Given that in the next rounds, the x must be able to win further\n                # So, we need to find the min and max values that x can have such that:\n                # in this round, it can beat its opponent, and then in the next rounds, it can also proceed\n                # Let's consider the possible opponents\n                # For the current round, the opponent's skill level depends on the rule\n                # We need to find the range of x such that x can beat the opponent, and the opponent is from the other half\n                # So, for the current round, we have two groups: the group that x is in, and the group that the opponent is in\n                # The opponent's possible range is determined by the other half of the bracket\n                # So, the idea is that in the current round, the x must be either the min or max in its group, depending on the rule\n                # But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can choose the opponents such that x can win\n                # Therefore, the possible range for x in this round is based on the next round's possible range\n                next_min, next_max = dfs(round_idx + 1, depth - 1)\n                if current_rule == '0':\n                    # In this round, the lower skill level wins\n                    # So, x must be the lower one in its match.

So, for x to be able to proceed, it must be that in this round, x is the lower one. So the opponent must be higher than x.\n                    # So the minimal x can be is 1, and the maximal x can be is next_max - 1.\n                    # However, the opponent must be able to reach the next round. So the opponent must be in the range [next_min, next_max].\n                    # Therefore, the x can be in the range [1, next_max - 1], but also, the opponent can be any value in [next_min, next_max] that is greater than x.\n                    # However, since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponent to be the minimal possible (next_min), so x can be up to next_min - 1. But if next_min is 1, then x can't be less than that. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n                    # Maybe another approach: for the current round, the x must be able to beat the opponent. The opponent must be in the other half of the bracket, and must be able to proceed to the next round. So the opponent's skill level must be in the range of the next round's possible values. Thus, the x must be such that there exists a value y in [next_min, next_max] where x < y (for rule '0'). Therefore, x can be any value less than next_max.

So the range is [1, next_max - 1].\n                    # So yes, the range would be [1, next_max - 1].\n                    return (1, next_max - 1)\n                else:\n                    # Rule is '1': higher skill wins\n                    # So x must be higher than the opponent.

Then the opponent can be 2, 3, or 4. x must be higher than the opponent.
