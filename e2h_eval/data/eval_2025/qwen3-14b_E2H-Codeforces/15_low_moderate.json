They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament proceeds in phases, and each phase's matches are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the matches are decided based on whether s[i-1] is 0 or 1. If it's 0, the lower skill level wins; if 1, higher skill wins. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x becomes the champion.\n\nHmm. So the key is to determine for each possible x, whether there's a way to arrange the initial permutation p so that x ends up as the winner of the tournament.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think recursively. The tournament is a binary tree structure. Each round halves the number of teams. For each round, depending on the rule (s[i] for that phase), the winners are determined.\n\nWait, the phases are structured as follows. The first phase is when there are 2^n teams, and they play 2^{n-1} games. Then the next phase has 2^{n-1} teams, and so on until the final phase which has 2 teams.\n\nThe string s has length n. For example, for n=3, the string is of length 3. The first phase (i=1) has 2^{n - i} = 2^2 =4 games. Then the second phase (i=2) has 2^{n-2} = 2 games, and third phase (i=3) has 1 game. So each phase corresponds to the rounds of the tournament.\n\nSo for each phase, the matches are determined by the rule in s. For example, during phase i, when the teams are grouped into pairs, the winner is chosen based on the s[i-1] value (since the string is 0-based).\n\nThe challenge is to find all x that can be the champion given some permutation p. But how do we model the possible paths that x could take through the tournament?\n\nAn approach could be to model the possible ranges of values that can reach the final. For example, in each round, depending on the rule, the team must be either the maximum or minimum in its bracket.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that in order for a team x to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. For each round, depending on the rule (s[i]), the team must have been the best (if the rule is 1) or worst (if the rule is 0) in its group during that phase.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps we can find for each x, the minimal and maximal constraints that x must satisfy in each round.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each round, the tournament can be viewed as a binary tree. For example, in the first round (phase 1), the teams are split into pairs, and each pair produces a winner. Then in the next phase, those winners are split into pairs again, etc.\n\nBut how do we model the possible candidates for the final? Let's think about the possible ranges of values that can reach each round.\n\nFor example, suppose in the first phase (phase 1) the rule is '0' (lower skill wins). Then, in each match, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for a team to proceed to the next round, it must be the lower-skilled in its pair. However, since the permutation can be arranged, maybe we can choose which teams are in which positions.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps the problem is to find for x, what constraints must hold on the other teams in order for x to be able to win each round.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of layers. Each layer corresponds to a phase. For example, the first phase (layer 1) reduces the number of teams from 2^n to 2^{n-1}, then layer 2 reduces to 2^{n-2}, etc., until layer n, which is the final.\n\nIn each layer, the rule determines whether the winner is the higher or lower skill in each match.\n\nSo, for x to reach the final, it must have passed through each of these layers. For each layer, depending on the rule, x must be the minimum or maximum in its bracket during that layer.\n\nBut how do we model the brackets? For example, during layer i (the i-th phase), the teams are grouped into pairs, and each pair's winner moves on. But the grouping depends on the previous rounds.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange the teams such that x is placed in positions that allow it to win each round according to the rules.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can model for",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can potentially win a playoff tournament given the rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure is such that each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains. The rules for each phase dictate whether the higher or lower skill level team wins each match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament has `2^n` teams and consists of `n` phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase's rule (either higher or lower skill level wins) is given by the string `s`. For each phase, we need to determine the possible range of skill levels that can win based on these rules.\n3. **Recursive Range Calculation**: For each phase, starting from the final round and moving backwards, we compute the minimum and maximum values that a team must have to win under the given rules. This helps in determining the valid skill levels that can reach the final.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # We'll compute for each round i (from 1 to n), the min and max possible value that can be champion\n    # Starting from the last round and working backwards\n    # Initially, for the last round (i = n), the range is [1, 2^n]\n    # Then for each previous round, we adjust the range based on the rule (s[i-1])\n    \n    size = 2 ** n\n    # Initialize the possible range as [1, size]\n    min_val = 1\n    max_val = size\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        current_rule = s[i]\n        if current_rule == '1':\n            # In this phase, higher skill wins. So to reach the next round, the team must be the maximum in its bracket\n            # So the new min is the previous min, and the new max is the previous max * 2\n            # Wait, no. Let's think again: when the rule is '1', the team must be the maximum in its group of two in this phase.\n            # So in the previous round, the team must be the maximum in its pair. Therefore, in the previous round's bracket, it must be the maximum of two elements.\n            # So the new range is [previous_min, previous_max * 2]?\n            # No, perhaps the logic is that for each phase, we need to find the possible range of values that can be the winner of that phase's matches.\n            # For example, during the i-th phase (counting from 0?), the current rule determines how to combine the ranges from the next phase.\n            # Let me think recursively:\n            # Suppose after processing the i-th phase (starting from the end), we have a range [lo, hi]. Then, for the previous phase, depending on the rule, we adjust the range.\n            # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then in this phase, the team must be the maximum in its pair. So, to be the maximum in a pair, it must be larger than the other team. However, since the other team can be anything smaller, the possible values for the current phase are those that can be the maximum of two values from the previous range.\n            # So, the new range would be [lo, hi * 2] ? Or something else?\n            # Wait, here's a better approach inspired by some research: For each phase, depending on the rule, the possible range of values that can reach the next phase is determined by combining two ranges from the previous phase.\n            # For example, if the current rule is '1' (higher wins), then in each match, the higher of the two teams proceeds. To have a team x proceed, there must exist a team y < x in the same bracket. Since the permutation can be arbitrary, the minimum and maximum possible values for x are determined by the previous ranges.\n            # So, for the current phase, if the rule is '1', the new range is [prev_min, prev_max * 2], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the following approach is used:\n            # For each phase, starting from the last one (the final match), we compute the minimum and maximum possible values that can be champions.\n            # If the rule is '1', then the current range is [min_prev, max_prev * 2]\n            # If the rule is '0', then the current range is [min_prev * 2, max_prev]\n            # Wait, let's think with an example. For the last phase (phase n), the range is [1, 2^n].\n            # Now consider phase n-1. Suppose the rule for phase n-1 is '1' (higher wins). So, during phase n-1, each match has two teams, and the higher one proceeds. To get to the final, the team must be the higher of two teams in its bracket. The two teams in the bracket could be any two teams from the previous round's possible range. But since we can arrange the permutation, the team x must be able to be the maximum of two teams from the previous range. Thus, the new range for the previous phase is [min_prev, max_prev * 2], because the team x could be as low as the previous minimum (if paired with a lower team) up to twice the previous maximum (since the previous max could be paired with another team, and x could be higher than that).\n            # Similarly, if the rule is '0', then the team must be the minimum of two teams. So the new range is [min_prev * 2, max_prev], because the minimum of two teams from the previous range could be as low as twice the previous min (if both teams are higher than that) up to the previous max.\n            # So the idea is to start from the last phase and work backward, updating the min and max ranges based on the rules.\n            # Let's try this logic with the example given:\n            # Example 1: Input n=3, s='101'\n            # Output: 4 5 6 7\n            # Let's process step by step:\n            # Initial range after phase 3 (final) is [1, 8]\n            # Now, phase 2 (i=2, which is the third character in the string? Wait, the string is of length n, and for each phase i (starting from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. So for n=3, the phases are 1,2,3, and the rules are s[0], s[1], s[2].\n            # So in the loop, for i from n-1 downto 0 (since for n=3, the indices are 0,1,2). So the first iteration is for phase 3 (i=2 in the string, which is '1'), then phase 2 (i=1, which is '0'), then phase 1 (i=0, which is '1').\n            # Let's see:\n            # Start with min_val=1, max_val=8.\n            # Phase 3 (rule '1'): since it's the last phase, nothing to do here. Wait, maybe the loop starts from the second last phase.\n            # Maybe I should reindex. Let me think again:\n            # We start from the last phase (phase n) and go back to phase 1.\n            # For example, for n=3, the phases are 1, 2, 3. We start from phase 3 (the final) and then process phase 2 and then phase 1.\n            # So the loop is over the phases in reverse order. For each phase, we update the min and max based on the rule.\n            # Let's rework the code:\n            # Initialize min_val and max_val as 1 and 2^n\n            # Then for each phase from n-1 downto 1 (since phase n is the last one, already considered)\n            # Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to iterate through the string from the last character to the first, and for each step, update the min and max.\n            # For example, for the initial range [1, 2^n], and then for each rule in s reversed (starting from the last phase to the first), we adjust the min and max.\n            # Let's take the first example: n=3, s='101'\n            # The string is '1','0','1' (indexes 0,1,2). We process from index 2 down to 0.\n            # Initial range: min=1, max=8\n            # Process phase 3 (rule is '1')? No, phase 3 is the final, so the loop starts with phase 2 (i=1 in the string, which is '0'), then phase 1 (i=0, '1').\n            # Wait, perhaps the code should process the rules in reverse order. Let me think again.\n            # The tournament has n phases. The first phase is the first round, then the second phase is the next round, etc. The last phase is the final between two teams.\n            # To compute the possible ranges, we start from the final (phase n) and work backwards to phase 1.\n            # For each phase i (from n downto 1), we need to compute the possible range of values that can reach the next phase (i+1).\n            # Wait, maybe the correct way is to start with the final phase (which requires the champion to be in the range [1, 2^n]), then for each previous phase, adjust the range based on the rule.\n            # For example, for phase k (from n downto 1), we adjust the range based on the rule of phase k.\n            # Let me think with the first example:\n            # n=3, s = '101' (phases 1: '1', phase 2: '0', phase 3: '1')\n            # Starting from the final (phase 3), the range is [1,8].\n            # Now, move to phase 2, which has rule '0' (lower wins).\n            # For phase 2, in each match, the lower skill team wins. So, to reach the final, the team must be the lower of two teams in its bracket. Thus, during phase 2, the team must be the minimum of two teams from the previous range (which was [1,8]).\n            # How does this affect the range? The new range for the previous phase (phase 2) is [min_prev * 2, max_prev]. Because the minimum of two teams from [1,8] can be as low as 1 (if paired with a higher team), but since we're going backward, the possible values that can be the minimum of two teams from the previous range is [min_prev * 2, max_prev]? Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.\n            # When the rule is '0' (lower wins), to be the winner of a match in this phase, the team must be the lower of two teams. So, in the next phase (phase 3), the team must be part of a group where it is the lower. However, since we are working backwards, we need to determine what values can be in the previous phase (phase 2) such that they can be the lower of two teams in their bracket (which will be processed in phase 2).\n            # So, during phase 2 (rule '0'), the team must be the minimum of two teams. So, for the team to be the minimum, there must be another team in the same bracket that is higher. So, the minimum value in the bracket is x, and the other is y > x. Since the permutation is arbitrary, the possible x can be from the range [min_prev, max_prev], but to ensure that there exists a y > x in the same bracket, x must be at most max_prev - 1. However, since we are working backwards, the range for the previous phase (phase 1) would be adjusted based on the rule.\n            # This seems complex, but there's a known approach for this problem. The key idea is that for each phase, depending on the rule, the range of possible values that can reach the next phase is updated as follows:\n            # - If the rule is '1' (higher wins), the new range is [current_min, current_max * 2]\n            # - If the rule is '0' (lower wins), the new range is [current_min * 2, current_max]\n            # This is because, for a higher win rule, the team must be the higher of two teams, so it can be as small as the previous minimum (if paired with a lower team) and as large as twice the previous max (since the previous max could be paired with another team and the current team could be the higher one). Similarly, for lower win, the team must be the lower of two teams, so it can be as large as the previous max (if paired with a higher team) and as small as twice the previous min (since the previous min could be paired with another team and the current team could be the lower one).\n\n            # So applying this logic:\n\n            if current_rule == '1':\n                # higher wins, so new min is min_val, new max is max_val * 2\n                min_val = min_val\n                max_val = max_val * 2\n            else:\n                # lower wins, new min is min_val * 2, new max is max_val\n                min_val = min_val * 2\n                max_val = max_val\n        else:\n            # current_rule is '0'\n            min_val = min_val * 2\n            max_val = max_val\n    \n    # After processing all phases, the valid x's are those in [min_val, max_val]\n    result = list(range(min_val, max_val + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution starts by initializing the range of possible values for the champion as `[1, 2^n]`. It then iterates through the phases in reverse order, adjusting the range based on the rule for each phase.

So the first iteration is for phase 3 (i=2 in the string, which is '1'), then phase 2 (i=1, which is '0'), then phase 1 (i=0, which is '1').\n            # Let's see:\n            # Start with min_val=1, max_val=8.\n            # Phase 3 (rule '1'): since it's the last phase, nothing to do here. Wait, maybe the loop starts from the second last phase.\n            # Maybe I should reindex. Let me think again:\n            # We start from the last phase (phase n) and go back to phase 1.\n            # For example, for n=3, the phases are 1, 2, 3. We start from phase 3 (the final) and then process phase 2 and then phase 1.\n            # So the loop is over the phases in reverse order. For each phase, we update the min and max based on the rule.\n            # Let's rework the code:\n            # Initialize min_val and max_val as 1 and 2^n\n            # Then for each phase from n-1 downto 1 (since phase n is the last one, already considered)\n            # Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to iterate through the string from the last character to the first, and for each step, update the min and max.\n            # For example, for the initial range [1, 2^n], and then for each rule in s reversed (starting from the last phase to the first), we adjust the min and max.\n            # Let's take the first example: n=3, s='101'\n            # The string is '1','0','1' (indexes 0,1,2). We process from index 2 down to 0.\n            # Initial range: min=1, max=8\n            # Process phase 3 (rule is '1')? No, phase 3 is the final, so the loop starts with phase 2 (i=1 in the string, which is '0'), then phase 1 (i=0, '1').\n            # Wait, perhaps the code should process the rules in reverse order. Let me think again.\n            # The tournament has n phases. The first phase is the first round, then the second phase is the next round, etc. The last phase is the final between two teams.\n            # To compute the possible ranges, we start from the final (phase n) and work backwards to phase 1.\n            # For each phase i (from n downto 1), we need to compute the possible range of values that can reach the next phase (i+1).\n            # Wait, maybe the correct way is to start with the final phase (which requires the champion to be in the range [1, 2^n]), then for each previous phase, adjust the range based on the rule.\n            # For example, for phase k (from n downto 1), we adjust the range based on the rule of phase k.\n            # Let me think with the first example:\n            # n=3, s = '101' (phases 1: '1', phase 2: '0', phase 3: '1')\n            # Starting from the final (phase 3), the range is [1,8].\n            # Now, move to phase 2, which has rule '0' (lower wins).\n            # For phase 2, in each match, the lower skill team wins. So, to reach the final, the team must be the lower of two teams in its bracket. Thus, during phase 2, the team must be the minimum of two teams from the previous range (which was [1,8]).\n            # How does this affect the range? The new range for the previous phase (phase 2) is [min_prev * 2, max_prev]. Because the minimum of two teams from [1,8] can be as low as 1 (if paired with a higher team), but since we're going backward, the possible values that can be the minimum of two teams from the previous range is [min_prev * 2, max_prev]? Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.\n            # When the rule is '0' (lower wins), to be the winner of a match in this phase, the team must be the lower of two teams. So, in the next phase (phase 3), the team must be part of a group where it is the lower. However, since we are working backwards, we need to determine what values can be in the previous phase (phase 2) such that they can be the lower of two teams in their bracket (which will be processed in phase 2).\n            # So, during phase 2 (rule '0'), the team must be the minimum of two teams. So, for the team to be the minimum, there must be another team in the same bracket that is higher. So, the minimum value in the bracket is x, and the other is y > x. Since the permutation is arbitrary, the possible x can be from the range [min_prev, max_prev], but to ensure that there exists a y > x in the same bracket, x must be at most max_prev - 1. However, since we are working backwards, the range for the previous phase (phase 1) would be adjusted based on the rule.\n            # This seems complex, but there's a known approach for this problem. The key idea is that for each phase, depending on the rule, the range of possible values that can reach the next phase is updated as follows:\n            # - If the rule is '1' (higher wins), the new range is [current_min, current_max * 2]\n            # - If the rule is '0' (lower wins), the new range is [current_min * 2, current_max]\n            # This is because, for a higher win rule, the team must be the higher of two teams, so it can be as small as the previous minimum (if paired with a lower team) and as large as twice the previous max (since the previous max could be paired with another team and the current team could be the higher one). Similarly, for lower win, the team must be the lower of two teams, so it can be as large as the previous max (if paired with a higher team) and as small as twice the previous min (since the previous min could be paired with another team and the current team could be the lower one).\n\n            # So applying this logic:\n\n            if current_rule == '1':\n                # higher wins, so new min is min_val, new max is max_val * 2\n                min_val = min_val\n                max_val = max_val * 2\n            else:\n                # lower wins, new min is min_val * 2, new max is max_val\n                min_val = min_val * 2\n                max_val = max_val\n        else:\n            # current_rule is '0'\n            min_val = min_val * 2\n            max_val = max_val\n    \n    # After processing all phases, the valid x's are those in [min_val, max_val]\n    result = list(range(min_val, max_val + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
