    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find all the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. \n\nSo, first, I need to understand how the progress bars work. Let me rephrase the problem. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the total progress. Both are calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file, and floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_sum) for the total. And these values are updated after each byte is copied. Also, initially, both are 0 before any bytes are copied. \n\nWait, but when exactly do these values update? The problem says after copying each byte. So for example, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. But after the first byte, they might change.\n\nSo the approach here is to simulate each byte being copied and check for each moment if both progress bars show the same value. However, given that the files can be up to 1000 bytes each and n up to 100, the total number of bytes could be up to 100*1000 = 100,000. So for each byte, we can compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. Then collect all such percentages.\n\nBut wait, even that might be manageable. Let's think: for each of the n files, for each byte in the file (from 1 to a_i), we can calculate the current progress for that file and the total progress. But how to track the total bytes copied so far?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nTotal sum of all files is total_sum = sum(a_1 ... a_n). \n\nFor each file i, and for each byte x in 1..a_i:\n\ncurrent_progress = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x\n\ntotal_progress = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\nWe need to check if current_progress equals total_progress. If yes, then add that value to our set of answers.\n\nBut also, we have to consider the initial state where both are 0. Because before any bytes are copied, both are 0. So 0 is definitely part of the answer. However, according to the note in the first example, when there's one file, all the percentages are same. So for each byte, the current progress and total progress are same. So for the first example, the output includes 0, 16, etc. Wait, but the first example's input is 1 and 6. Let me think. The total sum is 6. So for each byte x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent progress is floor(100x/6). Total progress is floor(100x/6). So they are same. So all those values are included. But the output includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Wait, why?\n\nAh, because the initial state is 0% (before any bytes are copied). Then after each byte, the progress is computed. For example, when x=1, 100*1/6 is ~16.666, floored to 16. So the first time the progress bar shows 16. Then for x=2, 200/6 is 33.333, floored to 33. And so on. So the output includes 0 (the initial state) and all the values that appear during the process. But how does the initial 0 get included? Because the problem says that the initial state is 0% for both. So we need to include 0 in the answer if there exists a moment where both are 0. Which is the start. So the initial 0 is always present. However, in the first example, the output includes 0, which is correct.\n\nBut how do we model that initial state? Because during the simulation, when we process each byte, we check after that byte is copied. However, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So perhaps we need to include 0% as a possible value. So the steps would be:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0 (since initially both are 0).\n\nThen, for each byte copied, check whether the current progress and total progress are same, and if so, add that value to the set.\n\nBut wait, what about the final state when all bytes are copied? For example, after the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100% (since total_bytes_so_far is total_sum, so 100 * total_sum / total_sum = 100, floored to 100). Similarly, the current progress for the current file is 100% (since x = a_i, so 100 * a_i / a_i = 100). So that's 100. So the 100 is added. But how is that handled in the simulation?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For each file i from 1 to n:\n\n   - For each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\n      - compute current progress (for the current file i, x bytes copied)\n\n      - compute total progress (sum of all previous files plus x bytes)\n\n      - check if current progress equals total progress. If yes, add that value to the set.\n\nAdditionally, the initial 0 is already in the set. However, what about the case when after all bytes are copied, the progress bars are both 100%? That would be handled when x is the last byte of the last file. So the code would capture that.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the 0 is present. However, during the simulation, when x=0? No, because the simulation starts with x=1. So perhaps the initial 0 is not captured in the simulation. Therefore, we need to add 0 to the set, but also check if during the simulation, the 0 is generated again. For example, in the second example input, the output includes 0. Let me look at the sample input.\n\nIn the second example, input is 2 files of 100 and 500. The output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. So the initial 0 is included. But during the simulation, after the first file (100 bytes) is copied, the total progress is 100/(100+500) = 100/600 = 1/6 ≈ 16.666, floored to 16. But the current progress for the first file is 100% (when x=100). So during the simulation, when x=100, the current progress is 100, but the total progress is 16. So they are not same. But after that, when the second file is being copied, the total progress is (100 + x)/600 * 100. For example, when x is 1 (second file), total is 101/600 *100 = 16.833... floored to 16. The current progress is 1/500 *100 = 0.2 floored to 0. So during this time, the two progress bars are 0 and 16. Not same. But the initial 0 is included in the answer.\n\nSo the initial 0 must be considered. However, in the simulation, the initial 0 is not captured by checking each byte. So we need to make sure that 0 is added to the set. But how?\n\nWell, the initial state is when no bytes are copied. At that moment, both progress bars are 0. So regardless of anything else, 0 is a valid value. So the code should add 0 to the set. But what if during the simulation, there's another moment when both are 0 again? For example, suppose a case where after some bytes, both progress bars are 0 again. But that's unlikely. However, according to the problem statement, the initial 0 is a valid moment. So we need to include 0 in the output.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize a set S with 0.\n\nThen, for each file i, for each x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   compute current_progress = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n   compute total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}\n\n   total_progress = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n   if current_progress == total_progress, add it to S.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect all elements in S, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the entire copy is done? For example, after the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100, and current progress is 100. So that would be added. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total_sum = sum of all a_i.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen, for each file i (from 0 to n-1?), and for each x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   compute current_progress.\n\n   compute total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x.\n\n   compute total_progress.\n\n   if current_progress == total_progress, add to the set.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect all elements in the set, sort, and output.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute sum_prev for each file. For example, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second, sum_prev is a_1. For the third, sum_prev is a_1 + a_2, etc.\n\nSo we can precompute the prefix sums. Let's say prefix_sums is an array where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a_1, prefix_sums[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. Then for the i-th file (assuming 1-based index?), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i-1].\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can compute it as follows:\n\nsum_prev = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}.\n\nSo, for each file in the list, we can keep a running total. Let's say we have a variable called sum_prev, which starts at 0. Then for each file in the list:\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       compute total_progress.\n\n   then, sum_prev += a_i.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a as integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set S with 0.\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n        current_progress = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_progress = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_progress == total_progress:\n\n            S.add(current_progress)\n\n    sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nOnce done, collect all elements in S, sort them, and print them line by line.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the total_sum is zero? No, since each a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1.\n\nBut in the code, when total_sum is sum(a), which is positive.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 1 followed by 6.\n\ntotal_sum is 6.\n\nsum_prev starts at 0.\n\nFor the first file (size 6), x runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x, current_progress = (100 * x) // 6.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 0 + x = x.\n\ntotal_progress is (100 * x) // 6.\n\nSo current_progress equals total_progress. So for each x, the value is added. So the set S will have 0, and all the values from (100x//6) for x=1 to 6.\n\nLet's compute those:\n\nx=1: 100*1/6 = 16.666... → 16\n\nx=2: 200/6 = 33.333 → 33\n\nx=3: 300/6 = 50 → 50\n\nx=4: 400/6 = 66.666 → 66\n\nx=5: 500/6 = 83.333 → 83\n\nx=6: 600/6 = 100 → 100\n\nSo the set S will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one: 2 files, 100 and 500. So total_sum is 600. sum_prev starts at 0.\n\nFirst file is 100. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_progress = (100x)/100 → x. So current_progress is x.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 0 + x = x. total_progress is (100x)/600 → x/6.\n\nSo for each x, current_progress is x, total_progress is floor(x/6). So when is x equal to floor(x/6)?\n\nOnly when x is 0, which is not in the loop. So during this phase, none of the values would be added except possibly when x is 0. So during this phase, no additions. Then, after processing this file, sum_prev becomes 100.\n\nThen for the second file (size 500), x runs from 1 to 500.\n\ncurrent_progress = (100x)/500 = (x/5) → floor(x/5).\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + x. total_progress = floor( (100*(100 + x)) / 600 )\n\nWhich simplifies to floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 ) = floor( (100 + x) / 6 )\n\nSo we need to find x where floor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nSo for example, let's see when x=500. Then:\n\ncurrent_progress is 500/5 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 + 500 = 600. total_progress is 600*100 / 600 = 100. So 100 is added. So the set includes 0 and 100.\n\nBut the sample output for the second input is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. How does that happen?\n\nAh, maybe during the processing of the second file, there are some x's where current_progress equals total_progress. Let's see.\n\nLet me think about the second sample input. The output includes 95, 96, etc. So during the second file's processing, there are some x where floor(x/5) equals floor( (100 + x)/6 ). Let me try to find for x in 1 to 500.\n\nLet me take x= 575? Wait no, the second file is 500 bytes. So x ranges from 1 to 500.\n\nLet me think of solving floor(x/5) = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nLet me denote k = floor(x/5) = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nLet me denote that:\n\nk ≤ x/5 <k+1\n\nk ≤ (100 +x)/6 <k+1\n\nSo combining these inequalities.\n\nBut perhaps trying to find x where these are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for certain ranges of x, the two expressions are equal.\n\nLet me think of when (100 + x)/6 is equal to x/5.\n\nSolving 100 +x = (6/5)x → 100 = (1/5)x → x=500. Which is the case when x=500, which gives 100 for both.\n\nBut what about other values?\n\nLet me take x= 575? No, x can't be more than 500.\n\nLet me take x= 499:\n\ncurrent_progress = 499 /5 = 99.8 → floor 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 +499 = 599. 599 *100 /600 = 99.833..., floor is 99. So 99 equals 99. So this would be added. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, x= 498:\n\ncurrent_progress = 498/5 = 99.6 → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 598. 598 * 100 /600 = 598/6 = 99.666... → 99. So same. So 99 is added again.\n\nSimilarly, for x from 495 to 499?\n\nLet me check x= 495:\n\ncurrent_progress: 495 /5 = 99 → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far: 100 +495 = 595 → 595 *100 /600 = 595 /6 = 99.166... → 99. So same. So 99 is added.\n\nSo for x from 495 to 500, the current_progress is 99 (for x=495-499) and 100 (for x=500). The total progress for x=495 is 595/6 = 99.166..., floor 99. For x=499, 599/6 is 99.833, floor 99. For x=500, 600/6 is 100. So during this range, the current_progress is 99 for x=495-499, and the total progress is 99. So those x's would add 99 to the set. Also, x=500 adds 100.\n\nSo in this case, 99 is added. Similarly, what about other values?\n\nWhat about when x is 595? No, because x is up to 500. So let's think of other possibilities.\n\nFor example, let's say k=95. So looking for x where current_progress is 95 and total progress is 95.\n\ncurrent_progress is 95 → x/5 ≥95 and <96 → x is between 95*5=475 and 96*5-1=479. So x ranges from 475 to 479.\n\nFor these x, total progress is floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nLet me take x=475:\n\ntotal is (100 +475) = 575 → 575 *100 /600 = 575/6 = 95.833... → 95. So yes, 95 equals 95. So this x would add 95.\n\nSimilarly, x=475, 476, 477, 478, 479:\n\nfor x=475: 575/6=95.833 → 95.\n\nx=476: 576/6 = 96 → 96. Oh wait, 100 + x is 576. 576/6 is exactly 96. So floor is 96. So for x=476, the total progress is 96, while current progress is 476/5= 95.2 → 95. So they are not equal. So only x=475 would be in this case?\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nx=475:\n\ncurrent_progress = 475 /5 = 95.\n\ntotal progress = (100 +475) * 100 /600 = 575 *100 /600 = 575/6 = 95.833... → floor 95. So 95 equals 95 → yes. So added.\n\nx=476:\n\ncurrent_progress is 476/5 = 95.2 → 95.\n\ntotal progress is (100 +476) = 576 → 576/6 = 96 → 96. So 95 != 96. Not added.\n\nx=474:\n\ncurrent_progress is 474/5 = 94.8 → 94.\n\ntotal progress is 574/6 = 95.666 → 95. Not same.\n\nSo for x=475, it's added. What about x= 475 + 6 = 481? Let's see. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\nSo for k=95, there's x=475. For k=96, what x would make current_progress=96 and total_progress=96?\n\ncurrent_progress is 96 → x is in [96*5, 97*5 -1] → 480 ≤ x ≤ 484.\n\ntotal progress is floor( (100 +x)/6 ) = 96 → 96 ≤ (100 +x)/6 <97 → 576 ≤ 100 +x < 582 → 476 ≤x < 482.\n\nSo x must be between 476 and 481 (inclusive).\n\nSo the intersection between x ∈ [480,484] and x ∈ [476,481] is x ∈ [480, 481].\n\nSo for x=480 and 481:\n\nCheck for x=480:\n\ncurrent_progress = 480/5 = 96 → 96.\n\ntotal progress: (100+480) = 580 → 580/6 = 96.666... → floor 96. So yes. So added.\n\nx=481:\n\ntotal progress is 581/6 = 96.833... → 96. current_progress is 481/5 = 96.2 → 96. So same. So added.\n\nx=482:\n\ncurrent_progress is 482/5 = 96.4 → 96. total progress is 582/6 = 97 → 97. Not same.\n\nSo for x=480 and 481, added 96.\n\nSimilarly, for k=97:\n\ncurrent_progress is 97 → x ∈ [97*5, 98*5 -1] → 485 ≤x ≤489.\n\ntotal progress is 97 → (100 +x)/6 >=97 and <98 → 582 ≤ 100 +x < 588 → 482 ≤x < 488.\n\nSo x must be in [485,487] (since 482 ≤x <488 and x ≥485).\n\nSo for x=485, 486, 487:\n\nCheck x=485:\n\ncurrent_progress is 485/5=97. total progress: 100 +485=585 → 585/6 = 97.5 → floor 97. So yes. Added.\n\nx=486: 586/6 = 97.666... → 97. current_progress is 486/5=97.2 → 97. So yes.\n\nx=487: 587/6 = 97.833... → 97. current_progress 487/5= 97.4 → 97. So added.\n\nx=488: 100+488=588 → 588/6=98. So total progress is 98. current_progress is 488/5=97.6 → 97. Not same.\n\nSo for x=485, 486, 487, added 97.\n\nSimilarly, for k=98:\n\ncurrent_progress is 98 → x ∈ [490, 494].\n\ntotal progress is 98 → 588 ≤ 100 +x < 594 → 488 ≤x < 494.\n\nSo intersection is x ∈ [490, 493].\n\nCheck x=490: total progress is 590/6 = 98.333 → 98. current progress 490/5=98 → yes. So added.\n\nx=491: 591/6=98.5 → 98. current progress 491/5=98.2 → 98. yes.\n\nx=492: 592/6= 98.666 → 98. current progress 492/5=98.4 → 98. yes.\n\nx=493: 593/6=98.833 → 98. current progress 493/5=98.6 → 98. yes.\n\nx=494: current progress 494/5=98.8 → 98. total progress is 594/6=99 → 99. Not same.\n\nSo for x=490-493, added 98.\n\nSimilarly for k=99:\n\ncurrent_progress is 99 → x ∈ [495, 499].\n\ntotal progress is 99 → 594 ≤ 100 +x < 600 → 494 ≤x < 500.\n\nSo x ∈ [495, 499].\n\nFor these x, total progress is (100 +x)/6 → for x=495, 595/6=99.166... → 99. current progress is 99. So added.\n\nSame for x=495 to 499: current progress is 99. total progress is floor((595 + (x-495))/6) ?\n\nYes, for x=495 to 499, 100 +x is 595 to 599. 595/6=99.166, 599/6=99.833. All floored to 99. So all these x's would add 99.\n\nSo during the second file processing, the values 95 (for x=475), 96 (x=480, 481), 97 (x=485-487), 98 (x=490-493), 99 (x=495-499), 100 (x=500) are added. So the set S includes 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code needs to simulate all these steps. Now, considering that n can be up to 100 and each a_i up to 1000, the total number of iterations is up to 100 * 1000 = 1e5, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_progress = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_progress = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_progress == total_progress:\n\n            add to the set\n\n    sum_prev += file_size\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nRead n from stdin, then the list a.\n\nBut note that the input is given as per the examples, but in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then the second line has n integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\ns = set()\n\ns.add(0)\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            s.add(current_p)\n\n    sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_list = sorted(s)\n\nfor num in sorted_list:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is exactly the sorted list of the set {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}.\n\nBut in the code, the first sample would generate that.\n\nBut let's check for the second sample input. The code would generate 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example:\n\nInput is 4 files: 1000, 2, 2, 998. Output is 0, 50, 99, 100.\n\nLet me think.\n\nTotal_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002?\n\nWait 1000 + 2 is 1002, plus 2 is 1004, plus 998 is 2002.\n\nSo during the processing of the first file (1000 bytes):\n\nfor x from 1 to 1000:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/1000 = x/10 → floor.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 0 + x = x. total_p is (100x)/2002 → floor.\n\nSo when is x/10 equal to (100x)/2002 ?\n\nLet me solve x/10 = (100x)/2002 → 1/10 = 100/2002 → 200.2 = 1000 → no. So probably no solutions here except maybe x=0 (but not in this loop). So during the first file, no additions.\n\nThen, after first file, sum_prev is 1000.\n\nSecond file is 2 bytes. For x=1 and 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *1)/2 = 50.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 1000 +1 = 1001. total_p = (100 *1001)/2002 = 100100 / 2002 = 50.0... ?\n\nWait 2002 * 50 = 100100. So yes. So 100100 divided by 2002 is exactly 50. So total_p is 50. So current_p is 50. So added. So 50 is added to the set.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ncurrent_p = (200)/2 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 1000 +2 = 1002. 100 *1002 /2002 = 100200 /2002 = 50.0... ? Let me calculate 2002 * 50 = 100100. 100200 - 100100 = 100. So 100200 /2002 = 50 + 100/2002 = 50.049... → floor is 50. So current_p is 100, total_p is 50. Not same. So no addition.\n\nSo during the second file, 50 is added.\n\nAfter processing second file, sum_prev is 1000+2=1002.\n\nThird file is 2 bytes. For x=1 and 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *1)/2 = 50.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1002 +1 = 1003. 100 * 1003 /2002 = 100300 / 2002. Let me compute 2002 * 50 = 100100. 100300 - 100100 = 200. So 100300 / 2002 = 50 + 200/2002 = 50.099... → floor 50. So current_p is 50, total_p is 50. So added again. So 50 is already in the set.\n\nFor x=2: current_p is 100. total_bytes_so_far is 1002 +2 = 1004. 100 *1004 /2002 = 100400 / 2002 = 50.149... → floor 50. So current_p is 100, total_p 50. Not same.\n\nSo during third file, 50 is added again (but already in the set).\n\nAfter processing third file, sum_prev is 1002+2=1004.\n\nFourth file is 998 bytes. For x from 1 to 998.\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *x)/998.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 1004 +x.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(1004 +x))//2002.\n\nWe need to find when these are equal.\n\nLet me think about when x=998:\n\ncurrent_p = 100 *998 /998 = 100 → 100.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 1004 +998 = 2002 → 100 * 2002 /2002 = 100. So yes. So added.\n\nWhat about other values?\n\nFor example, when x= 998 - 2 = 996?\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *996)/998 → 99600 / 998 = approx 99.799 → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1004 + 996 = 2000. 100*2000 /2002 = 200000 / 2002 ≈ 99.900... → floor 99. So same. So 99 is added.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. The progress bars update after each byte is copied, showing the percentage of the current file copied and the total percentage of all files copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input values for the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined to determine the total progress.\n3. **Progress Tracking**: Use a set to keep track of all valid percentages that appear simultaneously on both progress bars.\n4. **Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current progress percentage for the file and the total progress percentage. If these percentages match, add them to the set.\n5. **Edge Cases**: Ensure the initial state (0%) is included as both progress bars start at 0%.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    s = set()\n    s.add(0)\n    sum_prev = 0\n    for file_size in a:\n        for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n            current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_p == total_p:\n                s.add(current_p)\n        sum_prev += file_size\n    sorted_list = sorted(s)\n    for num in sorted_list:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line gives the number of files, and the second line provides the sizes of these files.\n- **Total Sum Calculation**: The total size of all files is computed once to facilitate the calculation of the total progress percentage.\n- **Set Initialization**: A set is used to store unique percentages that match on both progress bars.\n- **Simulation Loop**: For each byte copied in each file, the current progress and total progress are calculated. If they match, the value is added to the set.\n- **Output**: The set of valid percentages is sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check every possible moment during the file copying process, leveraging the constraints to simulate each byte's impact on both progress bars. The use of a set ensures uniqueness, and sorting the result provides the required output format.",
