Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses them all, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. Using that adds 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make any more because 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6: 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 burned. But 2 <3, so no more. Wait, but 2 isn't enough. But the total would be 6+2=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of candles he has, and each time he burns them, collect the remainders and see how many new ones he can make.\n\nBut how to model this? Well, maybe we can use a loop. Let's think:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0.\n\nWe have current_candles = a.\n\nWhile current_candles >= b:\n\n   total_hours += current_candles // b * 1 ?\n\nWait, no. Because each time he uses the current_candles, they burn, and then he can make new ones.\n\nWait, the process is:\n\nEach time, he can burn all the current candles. Each of those adds 1 hour. Then, from the burned ones (which is equal to the number of candles he burned), he can make new ones.\n\nWait, but the number of burned candles is equal to the number of candles he used. So, for example, if he has current_candles = x, he burns them all, adding x hours. Then, he can make (x // b) new candles. But then, the new candles can be added to the current_candles for the next iteration.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, current_candles = a.\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nwhile current_candles >= 1:\n\n   total_hours += current_candles\n\n   burned_candles = current_candles\n\n   current_candles = 0\n\n   new_candles = burned_candles // b\n\n   current_candles += new_candles\n\nWait, no. Because after burning all current_candles, you get burned_candles equal to current_candles. Then, you can make new_candles from them. Then, the new_candles become the new current_candles. But this is only possible if new_candles >= 1?\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nStart with a=4, b=2.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ncurrent_candles = 4.\n\ntotal_hours += 4 (total is 4).\n\nburned_candles = 4.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. current_candles becomes 2.\n\nNext iteration: current_candles is 2 >= 1.\n\ntotal_hours += 2 (total is 6). burned_candles is 2. new_candles is 2//2=1. current_candles is 1.\n\nNext iteration: current_candles is 1. Add 1 to total (total 7). Burned is 1. new_candles is 1//2=0. current_candles becomes 0. Now, loop ends.\n\nSo total is 7. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\nFirst iteration: add 6 (total 6). new_candles is 6//3=2. current_candles is 2.\n\nSecond iteration: add 2 (total 8). new_candles is 2//3=0. So loop ends. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nwhile current_candles >= 1:\n\n   total_hours += current_candles\n\n   new_candles = current_candles // b\n\n   current_candles = new_candles\n\nBut wait, what about the case where after making new_candles, there's some remainder?",
