The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So we have n+2 towns arranged on a line from 0 to n+1. For towns 1 to n, each has a 50% chance of having a radio tower. Then, after building these towers, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe have to find the probability that such an assignment is possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what configurations of towers allow this. Because the signal power can be set as needed, but the constraints are that each town is covered exactly once, and the ends are not covered.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For n=2, the answer is 1/4. The only valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then, each can have power 1. That way, town 1 covers itself and town 0 (but wait, town 0 shouldn't be covered. Oh right, the signal from town 1 with power 1 reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for p=1, the range is from i - p +1 to i + p -1? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe signal from tower at i with power p reaches every city c where |c - i| < p. So for p=1, |c -i| < 1 implies that c must be equal to i. Because it's strictly less than 1. So, for example, if a tower is at position i with power 1, it covers only town i. So in the first example, when n=2, towns 1 and 2 have towers. Assigning power 1 to each: town 1 covers itself, town 2 covers itself. Then town 0 and 3 (n+1 is 3) are not covered. So that's valid. So that's why that case works.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets of towers (each subset is a selection of towns 1..n with 50% chance each) that can be arranged in such a way that the coverage meets the constraints.\n\nNow, how do we model the valid subsets of towers?\n\nLet me think about the conditions that the subset must satisfy. Let's imagine that the towers are placed in some positions. For the coverage to be possible, each town from 1 to n must be covered by exactly one tower. Also, town 0 and n+1 must not be covered.\n\nLet me think of the coverage. For any tower at position i, when you set its power p, it covers the interval (i - p +1, i + p -1) ? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is |c - i| < p. Which is equivalent to c ∈ (i - p, i + p). But since c is an integer, that's equivalent to c being in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. For example, if p=2, then |c -i| < 2 → c can be i-1, i, i+1. So the length is 2p - 1? Well, maybe not important here.\n\nBut for the coverage to be exactly one per town, perhaps the towers must be arranged in a way that each tower's coverage area is non-overlapping except for the exact coverage. Wait, but overlapping would cause some towns to be covered by multiple towers. So to avoid that, the coverage ranges must not overlap, except possibly in such a way that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nBut how can that be achieved? Maybe the towers must be arranged such that there's a way to assign their power so that each tower's coverage is exactly a certain segment, and these segments partition the towns 1..n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers must form a structure where between any two adjacent towers, there's a certain spacing that allows for the coverage.\n\nWait, let's think of the problem in terms of the towers. Suppose that there are some towers. How can we assign their power so that:\n\n- Each tower's coverage does not reach town 0 or n+1.\n\n- Each town is covered exactly once.\n\nLet me think about the possible arrangements. For example, if there is exactly one tower in the middle. Let's say n is 5, and there's a tower at position 3. Then, setting its power to 3 would cover towns 0 to 6, but that would include town 0 and 6 (n+1 is 6). Which is invalid. So the power can't be that high. Alternatively, if the tower is at position 3, then to cover towns 1-5, we need power p such that 3 - p < 1 → p > 2. And 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly placing towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: The valid configurations of towers must be such that each tower can be assigned a power to cover specific towns without overlapping coverage and without reaching the boundary towns (0 and n+1). This implies that the towers must be placed in a way that allows for non-overlapping coverage segments.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to place towers up to position `i`. The recurrence relation is derived based on whether a tower is placed at position `i` or not.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (from 1 to i)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i. Then dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: tower at i. Then we need to ensure that the previous tower is at i-1 or earlier\n        # But to avoid overlap, the previous tower must be at i-2 or earlier.\n        # However, since the tower at i can have power 1, covering only i.\n        # So if there is a tower at i, the previous tower must be at i-2 or earlier.\n        # So the number of ways is dp[i-2], but if i-2 < 0, then it's 1 (base case)\n        if i >= 2:\n            dp[i] += dp[i-2]\n        else:\n            dp[i] += 1\n        dp[i] %= MOD\n    \n    # The total valid configurations is dp[n]\n    # The total possible configurations is 2^n\n    # The answer is dp[n] / 2^n mod MOD\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    result = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define `dp[i]` to store the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The base case `dp[0] = 1` represents the empty configuration.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**:\n   - If there is no tower at position `i`, the number of valid configurations is the same as `dp[i-1]`.\n   - If there is a tower at position `i`, it can cover only itself (power 1), so the previous valid configuration must end at `i-2` or earlier, leading to `dp[i-2]`.\n\n3. **Modular Inverse**: To compute the probability, we divide the number of valid configurations by the total number of configurations (which is $2^n$) using modular arithmetic.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring it handles large values of `n` up to 200,000 efficiently.",
