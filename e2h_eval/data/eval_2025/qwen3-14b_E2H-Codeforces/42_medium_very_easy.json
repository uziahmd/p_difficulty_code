Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding all percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on two progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to integers and updated after each byte is copied.\n\nSo, the task is to find all such percentages that appear on both bars at the same time.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for each byte copied, there's a moment when the progress bars update. But since the files are processed sequentially, the total bytes copied up to a certain point can be tracked.\n\nBut considering that each file has a_i bytes, for each file i, and for each byte x (from 1 to a_i), the current progress for the first bar is floor(100 * x / a_i). The total progress is floor(100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x) / total_sum).\n\nBut since the total sum is fixed, let's compute that once. Let's denote total_sum as the sum of all a_i.\n\nNow, the key is to iterate through every possible byte copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are, and record those where they are equal.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the progress bars update after each byte is copied. So, for each byte copied, there's a moment where the progress bars are updated. Also, initially, before any bytes are copied, both show 0. So we need to include that case as well.\n\nWait, the note says that in the first test case, when there's only one file, both bars always show the same value. So for example, when you copy the first byte, the first bar is 100*1/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. The total is also 100*1/6 = 16.666..., so same value. So for each byte, the two percentages are same. So the output includes all values from 0 to 100? No, because for example, when the file is 6 bytes, when you copy 6 bytes, then the first bar is 100*6/6 = 100, and the total is 100*6/6=100. So the output includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100 as per the first example.\n\nSo how do I model all these moments?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n- For each file i (from 0 to n-1)\n   - For each byte x in 1..a_i:\n      - Compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n      - Compute total_bytes = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of all previous files' sizes.\n      - total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes / total_sum)\n      - if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut also, we need to consider the initial state where both are 0. Because before any bytes are copied, both are 0. So that's a valid case. So 0 is included.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the initial state is when both are zero. So that's a moment when they are equal. So we have to include 0 in the output.\n\nBut how to capture that? Because for the initial state, no bytes have been copied yet. However, the first byte is copied, and after that, the progress bars update. So maybe the initial state is considered as a moment where both are 0. So we need to check that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set to collect all valid percentages.\n\n- Add 0 to the set, since initially both are 0.\n\n- Then, for each file i, and for each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   - compute current_percent for the current file (i-th file, x-th byte)\n\n   - compute total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of all files before i.\n\n   - compute total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n   - if current_percent equals total_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the entire file is copied? For example, when x is a_i. Then, the current_percent is 100. And the total_bytes_so_far is sum_prev + a_i. So that's part of the processing.\n\nBut after all files are copied, the progress bars would show 100% for both. However, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So after the last byte is copied, the total percent is 100. So that's included.\n\nBut in the first example, the output includes 100. So the initial 0 and the final 100 are included.\n\nBut how to handle the initial 0? Because when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. But before that, the initial state is 0. So that's a moment where both are 0. So we need to include 0 in the result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the total_sum.\n\nInitialize a set S with 0.\n\nThen, for each file i (starting from 0 to n-1):\n\n   sum_prev = sum of a_0 to a_{i-1}\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to S.\n\nOnce all these are processed, collect all elements in S, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the first file is 6 bytes. So for x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100*x)//6.\n\ntotal_bytes is x (since sum_prev is 0).\n\ntotal_sum is 6. So total_percent is (100*x)//6. Which is same as current_percent. So for all x, they are same. So all the percentages generated here would be added. But the initial 0 is already added. So the set S would contain 0, and all the percentages generated by x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut for x=6, current_percent is 100*6//6 = 100. Which is added. So the output would be 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first example.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_bytes reaches the total_sum. For example, when the last byte is copied, the total_percent is 100. So that's captured in the code.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and the list a.\n\n- Compute total_sum = sum(a).\n\n- Initialize a set.\n\n- Add 0 to the set.\n\n- For each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      compute current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n      total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n      if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n          add to the set.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and print them.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev for each i?\n\nWell, for each i, sum_prev is the sum of the first i files. So for example, for i=0, sum_prev is 0. For i=1, sum_prev is a[0], etc.\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So for i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. For example, prefix_sums is a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So for i in 0..n-1, prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i].\n\nOnce that's done, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nthen for x in 1 to a[i], inclusive:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\ntotal_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut also, what about the case when the total_bytes is exactly total_sum? For example, when x is the last byte of the last file. Then, total_bytes is total_sum, and total_percent is 100. Which is added.\n\nBut the initial 0 is already in the set.\n\nBut what about when the total_bytes is such that the total_percent is 100? For example, if the sum_prev + x is equal to total_sum. That's handled.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the second example:\n\nInput: 2\\n100 500\n\ntotal_sum = 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor the first file (i=0), sum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/100 = x. So 1 to 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is x. total_percent is (100x)/600 = x/6. So for x from 1 to 100, the total_percent is floor(x/6). So when does x equal floor(x/6)?\n\nOnly when x is 0, which is not in this loop. So for example, x=6: current_percent is 6, total_percent is 1. So not equal. So during the first file, there are no matches except maybe for some x?\n\nWait, but the sample output for this input is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo let's think. How does this happen?\n\nThe second example's output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo during the first file (size 100), the current_percent is x (since 100x/100 =x). The total_percent is (x * 100)/600 = x/6. So for these to be equal, x must equal floor(x/6). But x is between 1 and 100. Let's see:\n\nFor example, x=0 is not considered here. For x=0, it's the initial state. So during the first file, perhaps there are no matches except when x=0 (but that's already added).\n\nSo during the first file, no matches. Then during the second file (size 500), sum_prev is 100.\n\nFor x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/500 = x/5, floored.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100 + x. total_percent is (100*(100 +x )) / 600 = (100 +x)*100 / 600 = (100 +x)/6.\n\nSo when is x/5 (floored) equal to (100 +x)/6 (floored)?\n\nLet me see for some x.\n\nLet me take x= 475:\n\ncurrent_percent is 475 /5 = 95.0 → floor 95.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100 +475=575. total_percent is 575 *100 /600 = 57500 /600 = 95.833... → floor 95. So yes, equal. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476:\n\ncurrent_percent is 476/5= 95.2 → floor 95.\n\ntotal_bytes is 576 → 576*100/600 = 96 → floor 96. So 95 vs 96 → not equal.\n\nWait, but what about when x is 475?\n\nSo during the second file, when x is 475, the current percent is 95, and the total is 95. So added.\n\nBut what about other values?\n\nAnother example: x= 480:\n\ncurrent_percent is 480 /5 = 96.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100+480=580 → 580*100/600 = 58000/600 = 96.666..., floored to 96. So 96 equals 96. So added.\n\nSo that's another value.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 481:\n\ncurrent_percent is 481/5 = 96.2 → 96.\n\ntotal_bytes is 581 → 581*100/600 = 58100/600 = 96.833... → 96. So same. So 96 is added.\n\nSo for x from 475 to 499, perhaps?\n\nWait, let's compute for x= 499:\n\ncurrent_percent is 499//5 = 99.8 → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100 +499 = 599 → 599 * 100 /600 = 59900 / 600 = 99.833... → 99. So 99 equals 99. So added.\n\nThen, for x=500:\n\ncurrent_percent is 500/5 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 600 → 600 *100 /600 = 100. So added. So 100 is added.\n\nSo during the second file, there are several x that generate 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nBut what about the initial 0? Also, when the second file is being copied, perhaps there are other points where the percentages match. Also, during the first file, when the first file is copied, the total bytes is 100. So after the first file is completely copied, the total bytes is 100. The total_percent is 100 * 100 /600 = 16.666... → 16. The current_percent is 100 (since x=100 for the first file). So 100 !=16. So no match here.\n\nSo during the second file, the x values that generate the percentages 95,96,97,98,99,100. Also, the initial 0.\n\nBut the sample output for this input is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems to capture that.\n\nSo the code would generate all these cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all possible cases.\n\nNow, what about the case when the total_sum is zero? Well, the problem says that each a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. For example, prefix_sums can be built as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfile_size = a[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to file_size:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // file_size\n\ntotal_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_percent == total_percent:\n\n    add to the set.\n\nOnce all of that is done, collect all the elements in the set, sort them, and output them.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the entire transfer is completed? For example, when all bytes are copied. That's handled when x is the last byte of the last file. At that moment, the total_bytes is total_sum. So total_percent is (100 * total_sum)/total_sum = 100. And current_percent is (100 * a_i) / a_i = 100. So that's added. So 100 is included in the set.\n\nBut in the code, the initial 0 is added. So the code would capture all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the third example:\n\nInput: 4\\n1000 2 2 998\n\nOutput: 0\\n50\\n99\\n100\n\nSo let's think.\n\ntotal_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nThe first file is 1000 bytes. For each x in 1..1000:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/1000 = x/10.\n\ntotal_bytes is x. total_percent = (100x)/2002.\n\nSo when is x/10 equal to (100x)/2002 ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nx/10 = floor( (100x)/2002 )\n\nBut for x=1000, current_percent is 100, total_percent is (100*1000)/2002 = 100000/2002 ≈ 49.95, floor is 49. So not equal. So during the first file, probably no matches except maybe for x=0.\n\nThen, the second file is 2 bytes. sum_prev is 1000. For x in 1 and 2:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/2 = 50x. For x=1, 50. For x=2, 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1000 +x. So for x=1, total_bytes is 1001. total_percent is (100 * 1001)/2002 = 100100 / 2002 = 50. So current_percent is 50, total is 50. So added. So 50 is added.\n\nFor x=2, total_bytes is 1002. total_percent is (100 * 1002)/2002 = 100200/2002 = 50.099... → 50. current_percent is 100. So not equal. So 50 is added once here.\n\nThen, the third file is 2 bytes. sum_prev is 1000+2=1002. For x in 1 and 2:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/2 = 50x. For x=1, 50. For x=2, 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1002 +x.\n\nFor x=1: total_bytes = 1003 → 100 * 1003 / 2002 = 100300 / 2002 ≈ 50.1... → 50. So current_percent is 50. So added again. So 50 is already in the set.\n\nFor x=2: total_bytes is 1004. 100*1004 /2002 = 100400 /2002 = 50.149... → 50. current_percent is 100. Not equal.\n\nThen, the fourth file is 998 bytes. sum_prev is 1002 +2=1004. For x from 1 to 998:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/998. Let's think about when this equals the total_percent.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1004 + x.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(1004 +x )) / 2002.\n\nSo when is (100x)/998 = floor( (100*(1004 +x )) / 2002 ) ?\n\nBut perhaps there are some points where this happens. For example, when x is 997:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * 997)/998 = 99700/998 ≈ 99.899... → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1004 +997 = 2001. total_percent is (100*2001)/2002 = 200100/2002 ≈ 99.95... → 99. So equal. So 99 is added.\n\nWhen x=998: current_percent is 100*998/998=100. total_bytes is 1004+998=2002 → 100*2002/2002=100. So added.\n\nSo during this file, 99 and 100 are added.\n\nSo the set includes 0,50,99,100. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nNow, the code needs to read input. But the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user provided examples where the input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as follows: first line is n, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo in the code, the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut in the example, the user provided multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should process one input. The sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's for the example. The actual code should process one test case.\n\nSo the code should read n from stdin, then the next line as a list of integers.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read the next line, split into integers.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set, say 'result = set()'.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen process each file and x.\n\nNow, in Python, for the prefix sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfile_size = a[i]\n\nfor x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n    current_percent = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n    total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n    total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n    if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n        result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the sorted list.\n\nThen, print each element in the sorted list, separated by newlines.\n\nBut wait, the output requires that the numbers are printed in order, each on a separate line. For example, in the first sample, the output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nSo the code should collect the elements in a sorted list, and print them each on a new line.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut in Python, the code should read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading input, there may be leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace should handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but what about the case when the total_sum is zero? Well, the problem says that each a_i is at least 1, so sum is at least 1.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. total_sum=6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6].\n\nLoop i=0:\n\nsum_prev=0, file_size=6.\n\nx from 1 to 6:\n\nfor x=1: current_percent is 100*1//6 = 16. total_bytes=1. total_percent is 100*1//6=16. So added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6=33. 200//6 is 33.333... → 33. So same.\n\nSo all x from 1 to 6 will generate same percentages, which are added. So the set includes 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich gives output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nWhich the code handles as discussed.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum is 1.\n\nFor x=1: current_percent is 100*1//1 = 100. total_percent is 100*1//1=100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. total_sum=2.\n\nprefix_sums [0, 1, 2]\n\nFor first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 =100.\n\ntotal_bytes=1. total_percent = 100*1//2=50. Not equal. So not added.\n\nFor second file (i=1, sum_prev=1, file_size=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is 100*1//1=100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1+1=2. total_percent is 100*2//2=100. So added. So set contains 0, 100.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum=4.\n\nprefix_sums [0, 2, 4].\n\nFirst file:\n\nsum_prev=0, file_size=2.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 50.\n\ntotal_bytes=1. total_percent=25. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_percent=100. total_bytes=2 → 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file: sum_prev=2, file_size=2.\n\nx=1: current_percent=50. total_bytes=3 → 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_percent=100. total_bytes=4 → 100. So added. So set is {0, 100}.\n\nBut during processing, is there any other point?\n\nWhat about when the first file is partially copied?\n\nFor example, during the first file, x=2 is processed. The total is 2 bytes. total_percent is 50. current_percent is 100. Not equal.\n\nBut what about during the second file, x=1: current_percent is 50. total_bytes is 3. total_percent is 75. Not equal.\n\nSo the only values are 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a=[2]. So total_sum=2.\n\nx=1: current_percent is 50, total_percent is 50. So added.\n\nx=2: current_percent 100, total_percent 100. So added.\n\nSo the set is {0,50,100}.\n\nSo output is 0,50,100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that are simultaneously shown on two progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar indicates the percentage of the current file copied, while the second indicates the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to integers and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined.\n3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n4. **Progress Tracking**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage. Check if these percentages are equal and record them.\n5. **Result Compilation**: Collect all valid percentages, sort them, and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files `n` followed by their sizes in a list `a`.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: The total size of all files is computed once to facilitate the calculation of the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps quickly determine the cumulative size of files processed up to each point, which is essential for calculating the overall progress percentage efficiently.\n4. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, both the current file progress and the overall progress are calculated. If they match, the percentage is recorded.\n5. **Result Compilation**: The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order to meet the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each byte's contribution to both progress bars and accurately capture all instances where both percentages match.",
