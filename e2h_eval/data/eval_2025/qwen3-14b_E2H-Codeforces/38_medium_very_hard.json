    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph and then determining the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly a p-reachable graph is. According to the problem statement, a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, so for each pair (u, v) with u < v, we check if both can reach each other. Then, the total count of such pairs is p. And our task is to find the minimal number of nodes needed to achieve that p, and then among those minimal node graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me think about the first part: finding the minimal number of nodes. For that, I need to figure out how the number of pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are mutually reachable relates to the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph. If all nodes are in a single strongly connected component (SCC), then every pair (u, v) with u < v will be counted as mutually reachable. So for n nodes, the number of such pairs is C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2. But if there are multiple SCCs, then pairs between different components may not be counted. For example, if there's a component A and component B, and there's a path from A to B but not vice versa, then pairs between A and B where u is in A and v in B would not be counted (since they aren't mutually reachable). However, if there's a component that's a DAG of components, then the mutual reachability pairs would only be within each component.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for the p-reachable graph, the count is exactly p. So to minimize the number of nodes, perhaps the optimal way is to have as many pairs as possible within the components. Because if you have multiple components, then the mutual reachability pairs are only within each component. So, for example, if you have two components with sizes a and b, then the total mutual pairs is C(a, 2) + C(b, 2). So to get a certain p, maybe we need to find the minimal n where the sum of combinations of the sizes of the components equals p. But how to arrange this optimally?\n\nBut the minimal number of nodes would be achieved by having as large as possible a single component. Because, for example, if p is 3, then a single component of size 3 gives exactly 3 pairs (C(3,2)=3). Which matches the first example in the problem statement. So the minimal number of nodes for p=3 is 3. \n\nBut if p is larger than C(n,2) for some n, then we need to split into multiple components. Wait, but how? Let me think. Suppose p is 4. What's the minimal n? Let's see:\n\nFor n=3, C(3,2)=3 <4. So we need more nodes. For n=4, C(4,2)=6. So if we have a single component, then p would be 6. But we need p=4. So perhaps we can split into two components. Let's say one component of size 3 (which contributes 3 pairs) and another component of size 1 (contributes 0). Total is 3. Not enough. Alternatively, maybe split into two components of size 2 and 2. Then each contributes 1, total 2. Still less than 4. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a component of size 3 and another of size 1. So total is 3. Not enough. What if we have three components? Like sizes 2, 2, and 1. Then total is 1+1+0=2. Still not enough. \n\nWait, maybe the approach is not to have multiple components, but to have a single component. But then, for p=4, the minimal n is 4, since C(4,2)=6 which is larger than 4. But that would require that the graph is structured in a way that only 4 pairs are mutually reachable. But how can that be? Because if the graph is a single strongly connected component, then all pairs are mutually reachable. So the count would be 6. Which is higher than p=4. So that's not acceptable. Therefore, perhaps the minimal n is not achieved by a single component. \n\nWait, but how else can we get p=4? Maybe by having a graph with two components. Suppose one component has size 3 (contributing 3 pairs) and another component has size 2 (contributing 1 pair). Then total is 3+1=4. So the total number of nodes is 3+2=5. Which is better than using 4 nodes (which would require a single component with 4 nodes, leading to 6 pairs, but that's more than p=4). So in this case, the minimal n is 5. But wait, but maybe there's a way to have a graph with fewer nodes. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, for example, n=4. Suppose the graph is split into a component of size 3 and a component of size 1. Then the total pairs are C(3,2) + C(1,2) = 3 + 0 = 3. Not enough. If the graph is split into two components of size 2 and 2. Then total is 1+1=2. Still not enough. So no way to reach 4 with n=4. So for p=4, the minimal n is 5. Which is the case in the sample input given (the second example input is 4, output is 5 6). Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample input, when p is 4, the output is 5 6. So the minimal number of nodes is 5. Then the second part is 6. How does that happen?\n\nSo the first part is to find the minimal n such that there exists a way to split into components where the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all components is exactly p. And the minimal n is achieved by splitting into components in a way that maximizes the sum for a given n. Wait, no. To find the minimal n, we need to find the smallest n where the maximum possible sum of C(k_i, 2) across all possible component splits is >= p. Wait, no. Because the problem requires that the sum is exactly p. So perhaps the approach is to find the minimal n where the maximum possible sum (i.e., when all nodes are in a single component) is at least p, and then adjust the components to get exactly p.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let's think again. For example, if we have a certain n, and we want to find if it's possible to split into components such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) is exactly p. So for each n, the maximum possible sum is C(n, 2) (when all nodes are in a single component). The minimal possible sum is 0 (if each node is a component). So for a given p, the minimal n is the smallest n where the maximum sum for that n (which is C(n, 2)) is >= p, and there's a way to split the components so that the sum is exactly p. \n\nBut how to find that n. Let's take the example of p=4. The maximum sum for n=4 is 6. So we can split into components such that the sum is 4. How? For example, split into a component of size 3 (sum 3) and a component of size 1 (sum 0), total 3. Not enough. Or split into a component of size 2 (sum 1) and a component of size 2 (sum 1), total 2. Not enough. Or split into a component of size 3 and a component of size 1. Still 3. Not enough. So maybe n=4 cannot be used. Then for n=5, the maximum sum is C(5,2) =10. So how to get 4? For example, split into a component of size 3 (sum 3) and a component of size 2 (sum 1). Total 4. Yes. So n=5 is possible. Thus, the minimal n is 5. Which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the approach for the first part is to find the minimal n such that the maximum possible sum (C(n, 2)) is >= p, and that there exists a way to split into components such that their sum of C(k_i, 2) is exactly p. \n\nBut how do we find that n? Well, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that C(n, 2) >= p, and also that p can be represented as the sum of some combination of C(k_i, 2) for k_i's summing to n. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the following: find the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p, and then check if p can be achieved by splitting the components. But how?\n\nWait, but for any p, once you have n such that C(n,2) >= p, then you can split into components where the sum is exactly p. For example, take the maximum sum (all in one component) and subtract some values by splitting. For example, suppose n is such that C(n,2) >= p. Let's say the difference is d = C(n,2) - p. We can split the component into two parts, say, subtract some amount. For example, if we split a component of size k into two components of size a and b (a + b =k), then the sum changes by (C(a,2)+C(b,2) - C(k,2)). Which is equal to -a*b. Because C(a,2)+C(b,2) = [a(a-1) + b(b-1)] / 2 = [a² -a + b² -b]/2. And C(k,2) is [k(k-1)]/2. Since a + b =k, then k² = (a +b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So the difference is [a² + b² -a -b - (a² + 2ab + b² -a -b)] / 2 = [ -2ab ] / 2 = -ab. So splitting a component into two parts reduces the sum by ab. \n\nSo, for example, if we have a single component of size n, sum is C(n,2). To reduce the sum by d = C(n,2) -p, we can split the component into parts, each time reducing the sum by some ab. So the problem becomes, can we find a way to split the component into parts such that the total reduction is exactly d?\n\nBut how to model this. For example, d must be achievable as a sum of products ab, where each split is done on existing components. But perhaps there's a simpler way. Let's think: for the minimal n, once we have C(n, 2) >= p, then the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n, 2) >= p and C(n-1, 2) < p. Because if C(n-1, 2) < p, then n is the minimal possible. So for example, for p=4, C(3,2)=3 <4, C(4,2)=6 >=4. So n=4? But earlier example shows that with n=4, it's not possible. Wait, but according to this logic, the minimal n is 4. But that's conflicting with the previous example where p=4 requires n=5. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because even though C(4,2) is 6 >=4, but there's no way to split the components in a way that the sum is exactly 4. For example, for n=4, the possible ways to split into components and compute sum:\n\nIf all in one component: sum is 6. \n\nIf split into 3 and 1: sum is 3 + 0 =3.\n\nSplit into 2 and 2: sum is 1 +1 =2.\n\nSplit into 2,1,1: sum is 1 +0 +0 =1.\n\nSplit into 3,1: same as before.\n\nSo for n=4, the maximum possible sum is 6, but there's no way to get sum 4. So the minimal n is not 4, but 5. So my initial assumption was wrong. So the approach of finding the minimal n where C(n,2) >= p is not sufficient. Because even if C(n,2) >= p, there might not be a way to split into components to get exactly p. \n\nSo how to find the correct n?\n\nThis suggests that the minimal n is the smallest integer such that C(n,2) >= p and (C(n,2) - p) can be represented as a sum of terms of the form a*b, where a and b are positive integers, and the sum of all a's and b's (from splitting) is n. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal n where C(n,2) >= p and (C(n,2) - p) can be expressed as a sum of some products of integers, each product being from splitting components. \n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about the problem of representing p as the sum of combinations C(k_i, 2), where the sum of k_i is n. \n\nThe maximum sum for n is C(n,2). The minimum sum is zero. So for any p between 0 and C(n,2), inclusive, there exists a way to split into components to get that sum. Is that true?\n\nFor example, when n=4, can we get sum 4? Well, C(4,2) is 6. So 6-4=2. So we need to reduce by 2. How? Split the component into two parts. For example, split into 2 and 2. The reduction is 2*2=4. So the sum would be 6-4=2. Which is less than 4. Not helpful. What if we split into 3 and 1. The reduction is 3*1=3. So the sum is 6-3=3. Still not enough. Then, perhaps split the original component into 3 and 1 (sum 3), then split the 3 into 2 and 1. That would reduce by 2*1=2. So the total sum would be 3-2=1. Which is even worse. \n\nHmm. So for n=4, there's no way to get sum 4. So the conclusion is that not all values between 0 and C(n,2) are achievable. So the initial approach is incorrect. \n\nThis complicates things. How can we find the minimal n for which there exists a decomposition of p as the sum of C(k_i, 2) for some k_i's summing to n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the following approach: find the minimal n such that the maximum sum (C(n,2)) is >= p, and that (C(n,2) - p) is a sum of products of integers, which can be obtained by splitting the components. \n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal n where C(n,2) >= p and (C(n,2) - p) is less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction for that n. \n\nBut I'm stuck here. Let's think differently. Let's consider that for a given n, the minimal possible sum is 0 (each node is a component) and the maximum is C(n,2). So for any p between 0 and C(n,2), there's a way to split into components. But the example with n=4 and p=4 shows that this isn't the case. So why?\n\nIn that case, the maximum is 6, and p=4 is between 0 and 6. But there's no way to reach it. So perhaps the problem is that the reductions are not additive in the way that allows arbitrary values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to construct the decomposition. Let's think about how to construct the sum. Let's say we have a target sum S = p. We need to find a set of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m such that sum_{i} C(k_i, 2) = S and sum_{i} k_i = n. \n\nLet me think of building the decomposition greedily. For example, take the largest possible component that doesn't exceed S. Suppose S is 4. For n=5, C(5,2)=10. So S is 4. So the difference is 6. We need to split the component of size 5 into parts such that the total sum of C(k_i, 2) is 4. How? For example, split into a component of size 3 and 2. Their sum is 3 + 1 =4. Exactly. So that's possible. Hence, for n=5, it's possible. \n\nBut for n=4, the maximum is 6. To get 4, we need to reduce by 2. How? Let's think. Split the component into two parts. The reduction is a*b. So we need to find a and b such that a + b =4 and a*b =2. Solving: a*(4 -a) =2 → 4a -a² =2 → a² -4a +2=0 → solutions (4 ± sqrt(16 -8))/2 = (4 ± 2√2)/2 = 2 ± √2. Not integers. So impossible. Hence, no way to split once. What if we split into three parts? For example, first split into 3 and 1 (reduction 3*1=3). Then the sum is 6-3=3. Then split the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2*1=2). The new sum is 3-2=1. So total reduction is 3+2=5. But that's more than 2. \n\nAlternatively, split into 2 and 2. Reduction 4. Then the sum is 6-4=2. Which is less than 4. Not helpful. \n\nSo there's no way to split once or twice to get a reduction of 2. Hence, for n=4, p=4 is not possible. Therefore, the minimal n is 5. \n\nSo how can we find the minimal n for a given p?\n\nThe approach seems to be:\n\nFind the minimal n such that C(n,2) >= p and (C(n,2) - p) can be expressed as a sum of products of integers (from splitting components). \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any p, the minimal n is the minimal integer such that C(n,2) >= p and C(n,2) - p is not equal to 1. Because in the case of n=4 and p=4, C(4,2)-p=2. Which can't be achieved. Wait, but why? Because the reduction steps are products of numbers. For example, if you have a component of size k, you can split it into a and b, and the reduction is a*b. So the total reduction is the sum of all such a*b for each split. \n\nSo the problem reduces to whether (C(n,2) - p) can be written as a sum of terms of the form a*b, where each a and b are positive integers (since splitting a component into two parts). \n\nBut how to find if this is possible?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of (C(n,2) - p). For example, when n=4, and p=4, the difference is 2. Can we write 2 as a sum of products a*b? Well, yes. 2=1*2. But how does that fit into the splitting process? \n\nSuppose we have a component of size 4. First split it into 2 and 2 (reduction 2*2=4). Now the total sum is 6-4=2. Which is exactly what we need. So the sum is 2. But that's for p=2. But in our case, p=4. So the difference is 2. But how can we get that difference? \n\nAh, wait. The difference is (C(n,2) - p) = 2. So we need to reduce by 2. But splitting into 2 and 2 reduces by 4, which is more than 2. So that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, can we split into multiple steps. For example, first split into 3 and 1 (reduction 3*1=3). Now the sum is 6-3=3. Then, split the component of size 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2*1=2). The new sum is 3-2=1. So the total reduction is 3+2=5. Which is larger than 2. So not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, split into 2 and 2 (reduction 4), then split one of the 2s into 1 and 1 (reduction 1*1=1). Now the total reduction is 4+1=5. Sum is 6-5=1. Still not helpful. \n\nSo no way to get a reduction of exactly 2. Hence, for n=4, p=4 is not possible. \n\nSo the question is: for a given n and target difference d = C(n,2) - p, can we find a way to split the components such that the total reduction is exactly d?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern. \n\nLet me think about possible values of d. For example, d can be any integer that can be formed by adding products of integers, where each product corresponds to a split. \n\nBut how can we find that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any d ≥ 0, except for d=1, there's a way to achieve it. But I'm not sure. \n\nFor example, for d=1: can we split in such a way that the total reduction is 1? Let's see. Take a component of size 2. Split into 1 and 1. The reduction is 1*1=1. So yes. So for example, if n=2 and p= C(2,2) -1 =1-1=0. So p=0. Which is allowed. \n\nSo for d=1, it's possible. \n\nIn the case of n=4 and d=2, can we find a way to split to get a reduction of 2? Let's think. Suppose we have a component of size 4. We can split it into 3 and 1 (reduction 3*1=3). Then, split the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2*1=2). The total reduction is 3+2=5. Which is too much. Alternatively, split into 3 and 1 (reduction 3), then split the 3 into 1 and 2 (same as before). \n\nAlternatively, split into 2 and 2 (reduction 4), then split one of the 2s into 1 and 1 (reduction 1). Total reduction 5. \n\nAlternatively, split into 4 into 3 and 1 (reduction 3), then split the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). Total reduction 5. \n\nNo way to get 2. So for d=2, no. \n\nBut wait, what if we split into 3 and 1 (reduction 3), then split the 1 into nothing (but that's not possible). No, because once you split into 3 and 1, you can't split the 1 further. \n\nSo for d=2, it's impossible. Hence, for n=4 and p=4 (d=2), it's not possible. \n\nThus, the problem of finding the minimal n is not straightforward. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find the minimal n by checking for each possible n starting from the minimal possible (where C(n,2) ≥ p) and seeing if the difference d can be achieved. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the following: For any n ≥ 2, the minimal n for which C(n,2) ≥ p and d = C(n,2) - p is not 1. Because for d=1, it's possible. For example, if d=1, then split a component of size 2 into two components of size 1 and 1. \n\nBut for d=2, it's not possible. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, but for d=2, can we split a component of size 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2*1=2). So yes. So if we have a component of size 3, and split it into 2 and 1, then the reduction is 2. So if the original component was part of the decomposition, then we can achieve that. \n\nBut how does that fit into the overall scenario?\n\nLet me think. Suppose n is 5. C(5,2)=10. For p=8, d=2. So we need to reduce by 2. How? Split a component of size 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). So the sum is 10-2=8. Which is correct. \n\nSo for example, the decomposition would be a component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1), a component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1), and a component of size 1 (C(1,2)=0). Wait, no. Wait, the original component was size 5. Split into 3 and 2. Then split the 3 into 2 and 1. So the components are 2, 2, 1. Sum of C(2,2) + C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 1+1+0=2. But the original C(5,2) is 10, and the reduction is 3*2 (splitting into 3 and 2) which is 6, and then splitting the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2*1=2). So total reduction is 6+2=8. So the sum is 10-8=2. Which is not what we want. \n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal sum is C(5,2) =10. \n\nIf I split the component into 3 and 2, the sum becomes C(3,2) + C(2,2) = 3 +1 =4. The reduction is 10-4=6. \n\nThen, if I split the 3 into 2 and 1, the sum becomes C(2,2) + C(1,2) + C(2,2) = 1 + 0 + 1 =2. The reduction from the original 10 is 8. So the difference between the original and current sum is 8. \n\nSo if we want d=2, then the difference between original and current sum is 8. So that's not helpful. \n\nBut I want to find a way to reduce by 2. So how?\n\nAh! Maybe instead of splitting the entire component of 5 into smaller ones, we can split a component of size 3 (which is part of the decomposition). For example, suppose I have a component of size 5. I don't split it. The sum is 10. Then, I want to reduce by 2. How? I can't split the component of 5 into parts unless I do it in a way that reduces by 2. But splitting into a and b where a*b=2. For example, a=2 and b=3. Because 2*3=6. So splitting into 2 and 3 would reduce the sum by 6. Which is more than 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach of splitting the entire component into smaller parts is not the only way. Maybe we can have multiple components. For example, if we have multiple components and split them. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the decomposition as a collection of components. For example, to get a sum of 8, with n=5. How?\n\nSuppose we have components of size 4 and 1. The sum is C(4,2) + C(1,2) = 6+0=6. Not enough. \n\nComponents of size 3 and 2: sum is 3+1=4. Not enough. \n\nComponents of size 4 and 1: sum 6. \n\nComponents of size 3, 1, 1: sum 3+0+0=3. \n\nComponents of size 2, 2, 1: sum 1+1+0=2. \n\nComponents of size 2, 1, 1, 1: sum 1. \n\nComponents of size 5: sum 10. \n\nHmm. So there's no way to get 8. So for n=5, p=8 is not possible? But that's impossible because C(5,2) is 10. So d=2. How to reduce by 2?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps there's a way to split the component into parts such that the total reduction is 2. For example, split the component of size 5 into a component of size 4 and 1. Reduction is 4*1=4. Now the sum is 10-4=6. Then split the component of size 4 into 3 and 1. Reduction is 3*1=3. Now the sum is 6-3=3. Then split the 3 into 2 and 1. Reduction is 2*1=2. Now the sum is 3-2=1. Total reduction is 4+3+2=9. Which is way more than 2. \n\nNot helpful. \n\nAlternatively, split into 5 into 2 and 3. Reduction is 6. Sum is 10-6=4. Then, split the 3 into 2 and 1. Reduction is 2. Sum is 4-2=2. Total reduction is 6+2=8. Which gives us a sum of 2. But we wanted to get sum 8. Which would require reduction of 2. But this gives reduction of 8. So no. \n\nThis seems very challenging. \n\nPerhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again about the problem. The sum of C(k_i, 2) for all components must be exactly p. So for example, if I can find a set of integers k_i such that sum k_i =n and sum C(k_i, 2) =p, then that's acceptable. \n\nSo for p=4, n=5, can we find such k_i's? \n\nYes. For example, components of size 3 and 2. Sum C(3,2) + C(2,2) = 3 +1 =4. And 3+2=5. So yes. Hence, for n=5, it is possible. \n\nAh! Oh right! I was thinking of splitting the component of size 5 into 3 and 2, which gives sum 3+1=4. Which is exactly p=4. So that works. So the difference d = C(5,2) - p = 10-4=6. But this is achieved by splitting the component into 3 and 2. The reduction is 3*2=6. So the sum is 10-6=4. Which is correct. \n\nSo why was I confused earlier? Because I thought that the difference d is 2, but in reality, the difference is 6. Wait, no. Wait, p=4. C(5,2) is 10. So d=10-4=6. So the reduction is 6. Which is achieved by splitting the component into 3 and 2, which gives a reduction of 3*2=6. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo for n=5, p=4 is possible. Hence, the minimal n is 5. \n\nSo the confusion earlier was due to miscalculating the difference. \n\nSo, this suggests that for any n where C(n,2) ≥ p, it's possible to split into components to get exactly p. Because we can find a decomposition of p as sum of C(k_i, 2) for sum k_i =n. \n\nHow?\n\nWell, for example, take the largest possible component that can contribute to the sum. Let's say we want to build the decomposition. Start with the largest k such that C(k, 2) ≤ p. Subtract that from p, and repeat with the remaining value, until p is zero. Then, the sum of the k's may be less than n. So we need to add components of size 1 to reach n. \n\nBut how to ensure that the sum of the k's is exactly n. \n\nWait, for example, if we have n=5 and p=4. The largest C(k, 2) ≤4 is C(3, 2)=3. Subtract 3 from 4, leaving 1. Next, the largest C(k, 2) ≤1 is C(2, 2)=1. Subtract 1, leaving 0. So the components are 3 and 2, sum 5. Perfect. \n\nAnother example: n=4, p=3. C(3, 2)=3. So the remaining is 0. So the components are 3 and 1. Sum is 4. So yes. \n\nAnother example: n=4, p=2. The largest is C(2,2)=1. Subtract 1, remaining 1. Again take C(2,2)=1. Remaining 0. So components are 2, 2. Sum 4. Yes. \n\nAnother example: n=4, p=4. How? The largest C(k, 2) ≤4 is C(3, 2)=3. Subtract 3, remaining 1. Take C(2,2)=1. Now sum is 3+2=5, which exceeds n=4. So this approach fails. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. The sum of the k's is 3+2=5, which is larger than n=4. So this approach won't work. \n\nSo the problem is that when we choose the components greedily, their sum may exceed n. \n\nSo how can we adjust this? \n\nIn this case, n=4, p=4. We need to find components whose sum is 4, and their sum of C(k_i, 2) is 4. \n\nIs there such a decomposition? \n\nPossible options:\n\n- One component of size 4: sum C(4,2)=6. Too big.\n\n- Two components of size 2 and 2: sum 1+1=2.\n\n- Components of size 3 and 1: sum 3.\n\n- Components of size 2 and 1 and 1: sum 1.\n\n- Components of size 4: no. \n\nSo no decomposition. Hence, for n=4, p=4 is not possible. \n\nSo the greedy approach of choosing the largest possible C(k, 2) may not work if the sum of the components exceeds n. \n\nThus, the problem becomes: for a given n and p, can we find a decomposition of p into sum of C(k_i, 2), with sum k_i =n?\n\nThis seems like a variation of the integer partition problem, but with specific constraints. \n\nBut how to find the minimal n for a given p?\n\nMaybe the way to proceed is to find the minimal n such that C(n, 2) >= p and n is such that p can be represented as sum of C(k_i, 2) with sum k_i =n. \n\nBut how to find this n efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the following: for a given n, the maximum possible sum is C(n,2). The minimal sum is 0. For p between 0 and C(n,2), can we always find such a decomposition?\n\nThe answer is no, as shown by the example of n=4 and p=4. \n\nBut perhaps for n ≥ 2, and p ≤ C(n, 2), and p is not of the form C(n, 2) - 1, then it is possible. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only cases where it's not possible are when p = C(n,2) - 1. \n\nFor example, n=4, p=6-1=5. Is there a decomposition for p=5? Let's see. \n\nPossible decompositions:\n\n- 3 and 1: sum 3+0=3.\n\n- 2 and 2: 1+1=2.\n\n- 4: 6. \n\n- 3 and 1 and 0? No. \n\nWait, what if we split into 3 and 1. Sum is 3. Then split the 3 into 2 and 1. Sum is 1+0 =1. So total sum is 1. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, split the 4 into 2 and 2.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable.\n2. **Minimum Nodes Calculation**: The minimum number of nodes `n` is determined by finding the smallest `n` such that the sum of combinations of component sizes (C(k_i, 2)) equals `p`. This involves checking if `p` can be represented as the sum of such combinations for some partition of `n`.\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes `n` is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated by considering the structure of the graph.
