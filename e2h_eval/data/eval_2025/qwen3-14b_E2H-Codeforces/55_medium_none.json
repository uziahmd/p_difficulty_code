    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the order of characters? Let me think about the allowed swaps. Since I can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, the 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s. But 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, can they be swapped? No. Because the allowed swaps are only between 0-1 and 1-2. So, for example, a 0 can't go past a 2. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because if you have a 0 and a 2, you can't swap them. So any 0s that are before 2s in the original string will remain before them in the final string. But 0s can be rearranged among themselves, as long as they are moving through 1s. Similarly, 2s can be rearranged through 1s, but not through 0s.\n\nWait, so the key here is that the 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s. But 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So, the relative positions of 0s and 2s in the original string must be preserved. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 will still be before the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, then the 2 will stay before the 0. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. But the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s, as long as they can pass through 0s and 2s via the allowed swaps?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 1s can be swapped with 0s and with 2s. So for example, a 1 can move left through 0s (since 0 and 1 can be swapped) and right through 2s (since 1 and 2 can be swapped). So the 1s can be moved around freely between 0s and 2s. But the 0s can't move past 2s, and vice versa.\n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s can't change their relative order. But the 1s can be arranged in between them, and also between other 1s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to grouping the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and then placing the 1s in between them in the optimal way.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the original string as consisting of a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the final string will have all the 0s and 2s in the same relative order as they appear in the original string. However, the 1s can be arranged between them. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string has a 0, then a 2. Then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. But between them, we can arrange any number of 1s. Also, the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. So perhaps the approach is:\n\n- The 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. The 1s can be placed in between them, but also grouped together. But how to arrange them optimally?\n\nBut wait, the 1s can be moved anywhere, as long as they can pass through 0s and 2s. Wait, but for example, a 1 can be moved left through 0s (since 0 and 1 can be swapped) and right through 2s (since 1 and 2 can be swapped). Therefore, the 1s can be moved to any position in the string, as long as they don't cross a 0 and 2 that are in the original order.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of an example. Suppose the original string is \"02\". Then we can't swap them. So the final string remains \"02\". Now, if the original string is \"012\", then we can swap the 1 and 2, making it \"021\". But then the 0 is before the 2, which is correct. But what about the 1? Well, the 1 can be moved to the end, because it's between 0 and 2. But if the original string is \"20\", then we can't swap them. So the 2 comes before the 0, and that's fixed.\n\nSo the conclusion is: the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. However, the 1s can be arranged in any order between them, but since the 1s can be moved freely, they can be placed in the earliest possible positions to make the lex smallest string.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. The final string will consist of the original 0s and 2s in their original order, but with 1s inserted in between. However, the 1s can be arranged in any order, but since we want lex smallest, we should arrange them as early as possible. Wait, but the 1s can be moved around. So for example, any 1s can be grouped together in the earliest possible positions.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So perhaps all the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. For example, if the original string is \"02\", then the 1s can't be placed between them, because there's no way to get them in between. Wait, but if the original string is \"02\", but there are no 1s. So the 0 and 2 are fixed. But if there are 1s, like in \"012\", then the 1 can be moved to the end, but also can be moved to between the 0 and 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think is that the 1s can be moved freely through the string, except when blocked by 0s and 2s. But since the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, but also between the 0s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire string as being composed of blocks of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the problem becomes:\n\nWe can collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them in such a way that the lex order is minimized.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, if the original string is \"100210\", which is the first example. The output is \"001120\".\n\nOriginal string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThe 0s and 2s in the original string are at positions 2,3,4 (characters 0,0,2). Wait, original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'. So the 0s and 2s are: 0,0,2,0. Their order is fixed. So in the final string, the 0s and 2s must appear in the same order. So the 0s and 2s in the original string are [0, 0, 2, 0]. So the final string must have these four characters in that order. Then, the 1s can be inserted in between them. How many 1s are there? In the original string, the 1s are at positions 0 and 4. So two 1s. So the final string would be something like: [0,0,2,0] with the 1s inserted in between. But how?\n\nTo minimize the lex order, the 1s should be placed as early as possible. Wait, but inserting them in between the 0s and 2s. Let me think.\n\nThe original 0s and 2s are in order: 0, 0, 2, 0. So the positions where 1s can be inserted are:\n\nBefore the first 0, between 0 and 0, between 0 and 2, between 2 and 0, and after the last 0.\n\nBut since the 1s can be moved freely, we can arrange all the 1s in the earliest possible positions. So for example, inserting all the 1s before the first 0. But that's possible?\n\nBut the original string has 1s. Let me think of the example. The original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThe 0s and 2s are [0,0,2,0], and the 1s are [1,1].\n\nSo the minimal string would be to arrange the 1s as early as possible. So inserting the 1s before the first 0. But wait, the original 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the first 0 is in the original string. But the 1s can be moved before that 0. Because the original 0 is preceded by a 1, which can be moved left through the 0? Wait, no. Because the original 1 is before the 0. But the 1 can be swapped with the 0. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. For example, in the original string, the first character is 1 followed by 0. So that can be swapped to 0,1. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. So in the example, the first 0 is in position 1. But the 1 can be moved to the left of it. So the 1s can be placed before the first 0.\n\nSo the idea is that all the 1s can be moved to the earliest possible positions. But since the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order, the 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s. But to minimize the lex order, we want to place as many 1s as possible as early as possible. Wait, but 1s are larger than 0s, but smaller than 2s. So putting 1s earlier may not be optimal. Wait, for example, if we have a 0 and a 2, and some 1s. We can arrange the 1s between them. But putting the 1s between the 0 and 2 would make the string lex smaller than putting them after the 2. Because 0 is better than 1, which is better than 2. So for example, if we have a 0 followed by a 2, inserting 1s between them would give us 0,1,1,2. Which is better than 0,2,1,1. Because the first difference is at position 2 (0 vs 1?), wait no. Let me think. The original is 0 followed by 2. If we have 0, then 1s, then 2, that's better than 0, 2, then 1s. Because 0 is the same, then 1 is less than 2. So inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 is better.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s. Wait, but the 1s can be placed anywhere in between the 0s and 2s. So the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and arrange them in the earliest possible positions. But where exactly?\n\nWait, the 1s can be placed in between any two elements of the 0s and 2s. For example, if the 0s and 2s are [0,0,2,0], then the possible insertion points are:\n\n- Before the first 0 (so the 1s can be placed here)\n- Between the first 0 and second 0\n- Between the second 0 and 2\n- Between 2 and 0\n- After the last 0\n\nBut to minimize the lex order, we want to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible positions. However, inserting 1s before the first 0 would be better than inserting them in later positions. Because 1 is higher than 0, but inserting them before the 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. Wait, that's a contradiction. Oh right! So inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than having 0s first. So that's not good. So maybe the 1s should be placed in the positions where they can be placed in between 0s and 2s, but not before the first 0 or after the last 0. Wait, but how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nThe 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the final string is a sequence of these characters, but with 1s inserted in between. For example, if the original 0s and 2s are [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], where each a_i is either 0 or 2, then the final string is:\n\n[inserted_1s_before_a1] + a_1 + [inserted_1s_between_a1_and_a2] + a_2 + ... + [inserted_1s_after_ak].\n\nBut how to choose where to insert the 1s to minimize the lex order.\n\nNow, the inserted 1s can be placed in any of the k+1 regions (before a1, between a1 and a2, etc., after ak). The problem is to distribute the 1s into these regions in a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, the optimal way is to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without making the lex order worse.\n\nWait, but inserting a 1 in the earliest possible position where it's allowed. For example, inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So that's not good. So we need to avoid inserting 1s before the first 0.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s after the last 0 would be better than inserting them between other positions? Not sure.\n\nSo the idea is that the 1s should be placed in the earliest possible positions where inserting them doesn't make the lex order worse. Let's think about the regions between the 0s and 2s.\n\nEach region is between two consecutive elements in the 0s and 2s sequence. For example, between a_i and a_{i+1}.\n\nBut how to decide where to put the 1s.\n\nLet me think of the regions as follows:\n\nFor each of the regions (before the first element, between elements, after last element), we can decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\nBut the lex order is determined by the earliest position where the strings differ. So, to minimize the lex order, we need to have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s.\n\nSo the best way is to insert the 1s in the regions where inserting them will not interfere with the 0s and 2s. For example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s is better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting between 0 and 2 gives 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2...1.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s between the regions.\n\nLet me think of the regions as follows. The regions are ordered from left to right. For each region, we can decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\nThe key is that inserting 1s in a region earlier in the string is better than inserting them in later regions, but only if inserting them in the earlier regions doesn't cause the string to be lex larger.\n\nWait, but inserting a 1 in an earlier region would mean that the 1 comes earlier in the string. However, if that region is between two 0s, inserting 1s there would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than having the 1s between a 0 and a 2. Or is it?\n\nNo. For example, inserting 1s between two 0s would create 0, 1, 0. Which is worse than having the 1s between a 0 and a 2. Because 0 is better than 1. So inserting 1s between two 0s would create a 1 in the middle of the 0s, which might be worse than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nSo the problem is to find the optimal regions to insert the 1s. Let's think about the regions in terms of their positions. For each region, the characters before and after the region are known. For example, the region between a_i and a_{i+1} is between a_i and a_{i+1}, which are either 0 or 2.\n\nSo, inserting 1s into this region will have the effect of inserting 1s between a_i and a_{i+1}. Since a_i and a_{i+1} are fixed, what is the best way to arrange the 1s in this region?\n\nBut since all the 1s are the same, the best way is to insert all of them in the earliest possible region where inserting them would not cause the string to be lex larger.\n\nBut how to determine which region is the earliest possible.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each region, the insertion of 1s into that region would be better than inserting them into a later region if the region is as early as possible, but only if inserting them there doesn't make the string worse.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the regions as follows. The regions are ordered from left to right. For each region, the insertion of 1s into that region would contribute some 1s to the string. However, the decision of where to insert the 1s depends on the surrounding characters.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a region is between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting 1s between 0 and 2 would lead to 0, 1s, 2, which is better than 0, 2, 1s.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s between 0 and 0 would result in 0, 1s, 0. Which is worse than inserting them between 0 and 2.\n\nSo the priority for inserting 1s is to insert them in regions where the surrounding characters are such that the insertion of 1s would help the lex order.\n\nSo the strategy could be to find all the regions between the 0s and 2s, and for each region, determine the priority of inserting the 1s there. Then, distribute the 1s in the regions according to their priority.\n\nWhat determines the priority? The priority would be determined by the position of the region and the characters around it.\n\nFor example, inserting 1s in a region between a 0 and a 2 would be better than inserting them in a region between a 2 and a 0. Because inserting between 0 and 2 gives 0, 1s, 2, which is better than 2, 1s, 0. But since the original order of 0s and 2s is fixed, the region between a 0 and 2 is allowed, but the region between a 2 and a 0 is also allowed.\n\nBut how to compare different regions for inserting 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the regions as follows: for each region, the insertion of 1s here would contribute to the lex order based on the first occurrence where the 1s are inserted.\n\nFor example, inserting a 1 in the earliest possible region that allows the 1s to be placed as early as possible without increasing the lex order.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the regions in order. The first region is before the first 0 or 2. The second is between the first and second elements, etc.\n\nThe first region is before the first element. Inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So we should avoid that region.\n\nThe next region is between the first and second elements. Let's say the first element is 0 and the second is 0. Then inserting 1s here would create 0,1s,0. Which is worse than having the 1s inserted between 0 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the first element is 0 and the second is 2, inserting 1s here is good.\n\nSo the priority for inserting 1s is to insert them in regions that are as early as possible, but where inserting them doesn't create a worse lex order.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother approach: since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, and we want the lex smallest string, the optimal placement is to have all the 1s grouped together in the earliest possible positions where they do not interfere with the 0s and 2s.\n\nBut where is that?\n\nThe earliest possible positions would be between the 0s and 2s where inserting 1s would not cause the string to have a 1 before a 0. But since the 0s are already in their original order, and the 1s can be moved before them, but that would make the string start with 1s. Which is worse.\n\nSo perhaps the best way is to arrange the 1s in the earliest possible regions where inserting them would not create a worse lex order. For example, between 0 and 2, or between 0 and 0, etc.\n\nWait, but inserting between 0 and 0 would create a 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting them between 0 and 2. Because the 1s are after the 0, but the 0s are before them.\n\nBut how can we decide which regions to choose?\n\nLet me think of the following: for each region between two elements (or before the first or after the last), determine the \"best\" place to insert the 1s. The \"best\" place is the one that allows the 1s to be placed as early as possible, but not before the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the regions as follows: the 1s can be placed in any of the regions, but to minimize the lex order, we want to insert them in regions where inserting them would not introduce a 1 before a 0. Because that would make the string worse.\n\nSo the first region to consider is between a 0 and a 2. Because inserting 1s there would allow the 1s to be between 0 and 2. Which is better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nBut if there are multiple regions where inserting 1s is possible, which one should we choose first?\n\nThe answer is that we should prioritize inserting the 1s in regions where the left side is as small as possible and the right side is as large as possible. For example, inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 0 and 0, because inserting between 0 and 2 allows the 1s to be between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting between 0 and 0, which would create a 1 between two 0s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative idea: the 1s can be placed in any regions between the 0s and 2s. To minimize the lex order, we should insert all the 1s into the earliest possible region that is between a 0 and a 2. If there are no such regions, then we can insert them into regions between 0 and 0, or 2 and 2, etc.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows. The 0s and 2s form a sequence. Let's call this the base sequence. The 1s can be placed in between any of the elements of this base sequence. The optimal way to insert the 1s is to place them in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without causing the string to be lex larger.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the base sequence as a list of characters (0s and 2s). For example, base = [0, 0, 2, 0].\n\nNow, the 1s can be inserted in between any of the elements. The idea is to find for each possible insertion point, the optimal way to insert the 1s. But since all the 1s are the same, the optimal way is to insert them all into the earliest possible insertion point where inserting them would not cause the string to be worse.\n\nThe earliest insertion point is the first one where inserting 1s would not make the string worse.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points as follows:\n\nThe insertion points are:\n\n0: before the first element.\n\n1: between first and second.\n\n2: between second and third.\n\n...\n\nk: after the last element.\n\nNow, for each insertion point, we can evaluate whether inserting 1s here is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nFor example, inserting 1s in insertion point i is better than inserting them in insertion point j (i < j) if inserting them in i leads to a lex smaller string.\n\nBut how to compare.\n\nSuppose insertion point i is between a 0 and a 2. Insertion point j is between a 2 and a 0. Then inserting the 1s in i is better than inserting them in j.\n\nBecause inserting 1s in i would lead to 0...1...2, which is better than inserting in j leading to 2...1...0.\n\nSimilarly, inserting in i between 0 and 0 is worse than inserting in i between 0 and 2.\n\nSo the priority for insertion points is based on the pair of elements that surround the insertion point. The insertion points where the left element is 0 and the right element is 2 are the highest priority. Then, insertion points where the left is 0 and right is 0, or left is 2 and right is 2. Then insertion points where left is 2 and right is 0, etc.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, forming the base sequence.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s in a separate list.\n\n3. Determine the insertion points between the base elements, and for each, determine the priority for inserting 1s.\n\n4. Distribute the 1s into the insertion points in order of priority.\n\nBut how to determine the priority of insertion points.\n\nEach insertion point can be characterized by the left and right elements. For example, between a left and right.\n\nThe priority for inserting 1s in a particular insertion point is determined by the following:\n\n- If the left is 0 and the right is 2, inserting 1s here is the best possible, as it allows the 1s to be between 0 and 2.\n\n- If the left is 0 and the right is 0, inserting 1s here would create 0...1...0. Which is worse than inserting them between 0 and 2, but better than inserting them between 2 and 0.\n\n- If the left is 2 and the right is 0, inserting 1s here would create 2...1...0. Which is worse than inserting between 0 and 2, but better than inserting after the 2.\n\n- If the left is 2 and the right is 2, inserting 1s here would create 2...1...2. Which is worse than inserting between 0 and 2, but better than inserting after the 2.\n\nSo the priority of the insertion points can be determined by comparing the pairs (left, right) of the insertion points. We can assign a priority level to each insertion point based on the pair (left, right), and then insert the 1s into the insertion points with the highest priority first.\n\nWhat's the priority order for the pairs?\n\nThe goal is to insert 1s into the insertion points where inserting them would lead to the lex smallest string. So, for two insertion points, which one is better to insert 1s into first?\n\nLet me think of two insertion points A and B. Suppose inserting 1s into A would result in a lex smaller string than inserting into B. Then A should be chosen first.\n\nFor example:\n\nInsertion point A is between 0 and 2. Insertion point B is between 0 and 0. Inserting 1s into A would be better than inserting into B. Because inserting into A would have the 1s between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting between 0 and 0, which would have the 1s between two 0s.\n\nSimilarly, insertion point between 0 and 2 is better than insertion point between 0 and 2 (same thing), and better than insertion points between 0 and 0, etc.\n\nSo the priority for insertion points is determined by the pair (left, right) as follows:\n\n- The highest priority is for insertion points where left is 0 and right is 2. These are the best places to insert 1s.\n\n- Next priority is for insertion points where left is 0 and right is 0, or left is 2 and right is 2. Inserting 1s here would not be as good as between 0 and 2, but better than inserting between 2 and 0.\n\n- Then insertion points where left is 2 and right is 0. These are worse than the previous cases.\n\n- Finally, the insertion points before the first element (which would have left as nothing, and right as the first element), and after the last element (left as last element, right as nothing).\n\nBut how to compare between insertion points of the same priority level.\n\nFor example, between two insertion points with left=0 and right=0, which one to choose first?\n\nIn this case, inserting the 1s into the earliest such insertion point would be better. Because inserting them earlier in the string would allow the 1s to be as early as possible, but since they are between 0 and 0, inserting them in the earliest such region would be better.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n1. Split the original string into the base sequence (0s and 2s) and collect the 1s.\n\n2. Generate all possible insertion points between the base elements, including before the first and after the last.\n\n3. For each insertion point, calculate its priority based on the pair (left, right). The priority is determined by:\n\n   - The pair (left, right) is compared in a way that higher priority insertion points are those that allow the 1s to be placed in a better position.\n\n   - The priority order for the pairs is:\n\n     - (0, 2) → highest priority.\n\n     - (0, 0), (2, 2) → next priority.\n\n     - (2, 0) → lower priority.\n\n     - (nothing, ...) → lowest priority (insertion before first element).\n\n     - (... , nothing) → lowest priority (insertion after last element).\n\n4. Sort the insertion points in order of their priority. For insertion points with the same priority, sort them by their position (earlier insertion points first).\n\n5. Distribute the 1s into the insertion points, starting from the highest priority insertion points, inserting as many as possible.\n\nOnce the 1s are distributed, the final string is formed by concatenating the base elements with the inserted 1s.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, collect the base sequence. For example, for input \"100210\", the base sequence is [0, 0, 2, 0], and the 1s are [1, 1].\n\nThen, generate the insertion points. There are len(base) + 1 insertion points. Each insertion point is represented by its index (from 0 to len(base)), and the left and right elements.\n\nFor example, insertion point 0 is before the first element (left is None, right is base[0] = 0).\n\nInsertion point 1 is between base[0] and base[1], which are 0 and 0.\n\nInsertion point 2 is between base[1] and base[2], which are 0 and 2.\n\nInsertion point 3 is between base[2] and base[3], which are 2 and 0.\n\nInsertion point 4 is after base[3], which is 0.\n\nNow, for each insertion point, we calculate its priority.\n\nThe priority can be determined as follows:\n\nFor each insertion point, we can assign a tuple that represents its priority. The higher the tuple in lexicographical order, the higher the priority.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For insertion points with (left, right) = (0, 2), the priority tuple is (2, 0, 0) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the priority can be determined by comparing the possible insertion points. For example, the best insertion points are those where inserting 1s would be between 0 and 2. The next best are those between 0 and 0 or 2 and 2. Then between 2 and 0, and then the rest.\n\nSo the priority for each insertion point can be determined by the following:\n\n- If the left is 0 and the right is 2 → priority level 0.\n\n- Else if the left is 2 and the right is 0 → priority level 2.\n\n- Else if the left is 0 or right is 0, or left is 2 or right is 2 → priority level 1.\n\n- Else (both left and right are None, or one is None) → priority level 3.\n\nWait, but that's not precise. Maybe the priority can be determined by the following function:\n\nThe priority is a value that determines how favorable it is to insert 1s into that insertion point. The lower the value, the more favorable.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Insertion points between 0 and 2 are the most favorable. Assign them a priority of 0.\n\n- Insertion points between 0 and 0 or between 2 and 2 are next. Assign them a priority of 1.\n\n- Insertion points between 2 and 0 are next. Assign them a priority of 2.\n\n- Insertion points before the first element or after the last element are assigned a priority of 3.\n\nThen, when sorting the insertion points, we sort them by their priority, and within the same priority, by their position (earlier insertion points first).\n\nOnce sorted, we distribute the 1s into the insertion points in this order.\n\nSo, for each insertion point, we can compute its priority as follows:\n\nif left is 0 and right is 2 → priority 0.\n\nelif left is 2 and right is 0 → priority 2.\n\nelif left is 0 or right is 0 or left is 2 or right is 2 → priority 1.\n\nelse → priority 3.\n\nWait, but for example, if the insertion point is between 0 and 0, then left is 0 and right is 0. So, the condition is satisfied for priority 1.\n\nSimilarly, for insertion point between 2 and 2, same.\n\nFor insertion points between 0 and 2, it's priority 0.\n\nFor insertion points between 2 and 0, priority 2.\n\nFor insertion points between 0 and 2, which is the best, we want to insert as many 1s as possible here first.\n\nOnce the insertion points are sorted by priority, we can process them in that order, inserting as many 1s as possible into each.\n\nBut how to handle the insertion points with the same priority. For example, multiple insertion points with priority 0 (between 0 and 2). Which one to choose first?\n\nIn that case, we should choose the earliest insertion point first. Because inserting the 1s earlier in the string would be better. For example, inserting 1s between the first 0 and 2 is better than inserting them between a later 0 and 2.\n\nSo during the sorting, after determining the priority, we sort the insertion points with the same priority by their position (earlier insertion points first).\n\nOnce the insertion points are sorted, we can iterate through them, and for each, insert as many 1s as possible (all of them, if there are any left).\n\nBut how to distribute the 1s. For example, if there are multiple insertion points with priority 0, we can insert the 1s into the first one first, then the next, etc.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, inserting them all into the earliest insertion point of priority 0 would be better than splitting them into multiple insertion points.\n\nBecause inserting all 1s into the earliest insertion point would make them appear earlier in the string than inserting them into a later insertion point.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCollect the list of insertion points, sorted by priority (ascending) and then by position (ascending).\n\nThen, for each insertion point in this sorted list, insert as many 1s as possible (i.e., all remaining 1s)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, so their relative order must remain unchanged. However, '1's can be freely moved around between '0's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string to form a base sequence, as their relative order must remain unchanged.\n2. **Collect 1's**: Collect all '1's separately since they can be placed anywhere between the '0's and '2's.\n3. **Determine Insertion Points**: Identify potential insertion points for the '1's. These points are before the first character, between each pair of characters in the base sequence, and after the last character.\n4. **Prioritize Insertion Points**: Sort these insertion points based on their priority. The highest priority is given to positions between '0' and '2', followed by positions between '0' and '0' or '2' and '2', then between '2' and '0', and finally before the first character or after the last character.\n5. **Distribute 1's**: Distribute the collected '1's into the highest priority insertion points first to ensure the lexicographically smallest result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    # Separate the base elements (0s and 2s) and collect 1s\n    base = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            base.append(c)\n    \n    # Generate insertion points\n    insertion_points = []\n    n = len(base)\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        left = base[i-1] if i > 0 else None\n        right = base[i] if i < n else None\n        insertion_points.append((i, left, right))\n    \n    # Define a function to determine the priority of an insertion point\n    def get_priority(i, left, right):\n        if left == '0' and right == '2':\n            return (0, i)\n        elif left == '2' and right == '0':\n            return (2, i)\n        elif (left in ('0', '2') or right in ('0', '2')):\n            return (1, i)\n        else:\n            return (3, i)\n    \n    # Sort insertion points by priority and then by index\n    insertion_points.sort(key=lambda x: get_priority(x[0], x[1], x[2]))\n    \n    # Distribute the ones into the insertion points\n    result = []\n    ones_idx = 0\n    for idx, left, right in insertion_points:\n        # Insert as many ones as possible here\n        while ones_idx < len(ones):\n            result.append('1')\n            ones_idx += 1\n        # Add the base elements up to this point if not already added\n        if idx == 0:\n            pass  # nothing to add yet\n        elif idx < len(base):\n            result.append(base[idx-1])\n        else:\n            pass  # nothing to add here\n    \n    # Now, we need to handle the base elements correctly\n    # Wait, the above approach was flawed.

The '1's are then strategically inserted into the most optimal positions between the '0's and '2's to achieve the lexicographically smallest result. The insertion points are prioritized based on their potential to minimize the lexicographical order, ensuring that '1's are placed between '0' and '2' whenever possible, followed by other valid positions.
