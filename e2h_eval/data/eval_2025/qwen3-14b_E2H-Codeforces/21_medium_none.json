The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key, and each odd chest can be matched with an even key. But since each key can be used once and each chest once, the total is the sum of those two minima.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parity: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3,1) is 1 (even chests matched with odd keys). Then min(2,3) is 2 (odd chests matched with even keys). Total 1+2=3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0)=0. Also, odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4)=0. Total 0, which is correct.\n\nSo this logic works. So the plan is to compute these counts.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nWe can read n and m, then the list a, then list b.\n\nThen, count even and odd in a. Then count even and odd in b.\n\nThen compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. So code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead a list as integers.\n\nRead b list as integers.\n\ncount_even_a = number of elements in a where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a.\n\nSimilarly for count_even_b and count_odd_b.\n\nThen answer is min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's handle the input. The input might be given in multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo the code needs to read the first line as n and m. Then the second line as list a, then third line as list b.\n\nIn Python, we can read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when there are multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, it's one test case per input. Wait, looking at the sample input, the input seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows three different inputs, each with their own outputs. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per a single test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows: first line has n and m, then second line has a_i, third line has b_j.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different test cases. Oh, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, no. Looking at the problem statement's input description, it's for a single test case. But the sample input shows three separate test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. Or maybe the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process each one. Wait, the problem says that the user should write a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints the output. So the code must read a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the first line is the number of test cases? No, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWhich seems to be three separate test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the sample input is given with three separate test cases, but the actual code should process one test case. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description does not mention that. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m...\n\nSo it's a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. Which suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the original problem statement's input description says that the first line has n and m. So perhaps the sample input is written as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process each one. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. This is confusing. But looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process each one. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that each test case is on separate lines. But in programming competitions, typically, the code is supposed to process a single test case. But in the sample input given here, there are three test cases, but the problem's input description says that the code should read one. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects the code to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, which implies that it's for a single test case. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three answers. But the problem's input description says that the code should read n and m, then a list, then a list. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, but in the problem statement, it's not mentioned. But looking at the sample input, the first line is not the number of test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is one test case. Then another test case is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nAnd another test case is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code processes one test case. However, the sample shows that the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't say that. This is confusing. However, looking at the problem's original statement, the user provided the sample input as a list of three inputs, but perhaps the actual code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as three test cases, but the code is supposed to read each test case. But how can we know? Well, looking at the problem's sample output, it's given as three outputs, which correspond to the three test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. But perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the code must handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, which would imply that it's for a single test case. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is incomplete. But given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. But then, why are there three outputs?\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking at the problem's original sample input and output, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m...\n\nSo the code must read a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process each one. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read them as separate test cases. But how to know how many test cases there are?\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is the first test case's n and m, then the next two lines are the a and b arrays. Then the next test case's lines follow. So the code must process all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to read that in Python. For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case. But how to do that?\n\nBut the original problem's input description does not mention multiple test cases. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code should handle multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich would be one test case. The output is 3. Then another test case, etc.\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention this. But perhaps the problem is from a source where multiple test cases are allowed. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, the code must read multiple test cases. But how to read them? For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code must process multiple test cases until the end of input.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from standard input and process each test case. However, how to read the input correctly.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as three separate test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLet me look at the sample input again. The sample input is given as a list of three strings, each representing a test case. For example, the first string is \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\", which is the first test case. Then the second is \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\", and the third is \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\". So the code must process each of these as a separate test case.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? The code must read from standard input, which could be multiple test cases. So the code must read all the input lines, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to read the input. For example, for each test case, the first line is n and m, then the next line is the a array, then the next line is the b array. So the code can read all lines, and process them in groups of three lines per test case.\n\nBut how to handle that. For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then iterate through them in groups of three. But perhaps the code can read until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's think of the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read from stdin is using input() or sys.stdin. However, for multiple test cases, the code can read all lines first.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But the problem's output shows three answers. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is incomplete.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem. However, looking at the sample code, the user provided the sample input as a list of three test cases, but the code must output three answers. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the code should read until EOF, processing each test case as per the input format.\n\nBut how to read the input. For example, in Python, the code can read all the input lines as a list, then process them in groups of three lines. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n   process lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2]\n\nBut perhaps the code should read until there are no more lines.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input has three test cases, each with three lines, this approach would work.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So the code must process each test case as per that.\n\nBut the original problem may not require multiple test cases. However, given the sample input, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. However, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output, the user provided a list of three input-output pairs. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. So the code should read all the input lines, process each test case as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as the a array.\n\nRead the third line as the b array.\n\nProcess and output the answer.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python. Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in groups of three. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and m\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx +=1\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx +=1\n        # process this test case\n        even_a = 0\n        for num in a:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_a +=1\n        odd_a = n - even_a\n        even_b = 0\n        for num in b:\n            if num % 2 ==0:\n                even_b +=1\n        odd_b = m - even_b\n        res = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n        print(res)\n\nBut this code would process each test case. However, the problem's input may not have multiple test cases. But given the sample input, this approach would work.\n\nBut what if the input is only one test case? Then the code would process it correctly. So this approach is safe.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's actual input is a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But the user's code must pass all test cases, including those in the sample.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem's actual input is only one. However, the sample input is given as three test cases, but the code is supposed to process all of them. Thus, the code must be written to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may be wrong. However, given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code should be written to process multiple test cases as described.\n\nBut now, let's think about the code.\n\nThe code reads all the lines, and for each group of three lines, processes them as a test case.\n\nBut what if the lines are not a multiple of three? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so the code can assume that.\n\nNow, the code can be written as such. Let's test it with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\neven_a is 3 (14,6,2). odd_a is 2 (9,11).\n\neven_b is 3 (8,4,20). odd_b is 1 (7).\n\nres = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 +2 =3. Correct.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb = [5] → odd_b=1, even_b=0.\n\nres = min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 +0=1. Correct.\n\nTest case3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10] → even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50] → even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nres = min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 +0=0. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where all chests are even and all keys are even → 0.\n\nCase where some chests and keys are even and odd.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. a is [1], b is [2]. Then even_a=0, odd_a=1. even_b=1, odd_b=0. res is min(0,0) + min(1,1) → 0 +1=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=0? But according to input constraints, n and m are ≥1. So no.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the Python code is as described.\n\nNow, the code must be written. Now, considering that in Python, reading from stdin can be done with sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the code uses split(), which handles that.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: For each test case, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Chests and Keys**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by two matches:\n   - The number of even chests matched with odd keys.\n   - The number of odd chests matched with even keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: Sum the minimum values of these two matches to get the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and m\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        even_a = 0\n        for num in a:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_a += 1\n        odd_a = n - even_a\n        \n        even_b = 0\n        for num in b:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_b += 1\n        odd_b = m - even_b\n        \n        res = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n- **Parity Counting**: For each test case, we count how many numbers in the chests and keys are even or odd.\n- **Matching Logic**: The number of even chests is matched with the number of odd keys, and the number of odd chests is matched with the number of even keys. The result for each test case is the sum of these two minimum values, which gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each test case in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
