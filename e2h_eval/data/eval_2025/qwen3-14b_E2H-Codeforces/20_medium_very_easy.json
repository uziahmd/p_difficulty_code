    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. Let's break down the problem. First, what defines a beautiful multiset? For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. Our goal is to count the number of valid c_s assignments that make this maximum exactly f.\n\nSo, the problem is about counting the number of valid configurations of c_s values such that when you choose them, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model the constraints on the c_s values so that the maximum possible size of the multiset is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about what determines the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. For each string in the multiset (which is of length n), it contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, if a string is '01', then it contributes to the counts of '0', '01', and also to the count of '01' (since it's the full string). Wait, no. The prefixes of the string are all the prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., up to n. So each string in the multiset adds 1 to the count of each of its prefixes. Therefore, the constraints for the beautiful multiset are that for each s (prefix), the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum size of such a multiset depends on the c_s values. How can we model this?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we have constraints on the number of elements that can be chosen, based on their prefixes. For example, the maximum size would be determined by some constraints that form a tree structure. Since each binary string is a node in a trie, and the constraints on the prefixes are hierarchical.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is equal to the minimum over all nodes (binary strings) of (c_s multiplied by the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix?), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem. Each string in the multiset contributes 1 to all its prefixes. So, the constraints are that for each prefix s, the sum over all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum size of the multiset is the largest possible number of strings that can be placed without violating these constraints.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum? It's equivalent to finding the maximum number of strings (each of length n) such that for every prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, if you have a string s of length l, then all its prefixes of length less than l are also constrained. The maximum number of strings is limited by the constraints on all prefixes.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a trie where each node has a capacity. The maximum number is determined by the capacities of the nodes, and the way they are structured.\n\nIn such a case, the maximum possible size is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that for each node (binary string) s, we have a capacity c_s. Then, the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is the maximum number m such that for every node s, the number of strings in the multiset that pass through s (i.e., have s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since each string contributes to all its prefixes, the problem is similar to a tree where each node has a capacity, and we want to select as many leaves (strings of length n) as possible, such that for each node, the number of leaves that pass through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to find this maximum m?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure, and for each node, the number of leaves passing through it is the sum of the leaves in its subtree. However, the constraints here are that for each node, the sum of leaves in its subtree must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to find the maximum m? Well, the maximum possible m is determined by the constraints. For example, the root node (empty string?) but in our case, the root is the empty string, but the problem says that the strings are of length from 1 to n. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have c_s. So the root node isn't considered here. Wait, the root is not part of the problem. Wait, the strings are of length 1 to n, so the root would be the empty string, but there's no c_s for that. But in the example given, the strings are of length 1 or 2. So for a string of length 1, like '0', the prefixes are '0'. For a string of length 2, like '00', its prefixes are '0' and '00'.\n\nSo the constraints are for all prefixes of the strings in the multiset. For example, if a multiset contains a string of length n, then for each of its prefixes (all of lengths 1 to n), the count of how many times that prefix appears as a prefix in the multiset must be ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, to maximize the number of strings in the multiset, the problem is equivalent to selecting as many leaves (strings of length n) as possible, such that for every node (prefix) s, the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves in a trie with constraints on each node's capacity. The maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by something?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. So, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints on the nodes. For example, if you have a node s with capacity c_s, and its children have capacities that allow for more leaves, then the capacity of s limits the number of leaves in its subtree. But how to compute this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming on the trie. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in its subtree is min(c_s, sum of the max leaves in the children subtrees). Wait, no. Because each leaf in the subtree of a node contributes 1 to the count of that node. So for a node s, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is limited by c_s. Also, the leaves in the subtree of s are distributed among its children. For example, if s is a node of length l, then its children are the nodes of length l+1, which are s followed by 0 or 1. So, the maximum number of leaves under s is the sum of the maximum leaves under each child. But each of those must be <= c_s. So the maximum number of leaves under s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves under each child.\n\nWait, but this seems recursive. Let me think of it as a tree. For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves in its children's subtrees. Because, for example, if the sum of the children's max leaves is larger than c_s, then the node s can't allow more than c_s leaves in its subtree. Otherwise, it can allow the sum.\n\nThis makes sense. Because the sum of the children's leaves is the maximum possible leaves that can be placed under s, but the node s's capacity c_s may limit that sum. So, the maximum number of leaves under s is min(c_s, sum of children's max leaves).\n\nBut for the leaves (nodes of length n), their children are none. So for a leaf node s (length n), the maximum leaves under it is 1 if allowed by c_s. Wait, no. Because for a leaf node s (of length n), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (since it's a leaf itself). But the constraint is that the number of leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. So for a leaf node, the maximum is min(c_s, 1). But since the node is a leaf, the sum of the children's max leaves is zero, so the formula would be min(c_s, 0) which is zero. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. For a node s of length l < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, sum over children of their max leaves). For a node s of length n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, 1). Because the subtree of s is just the node itself. So, if you can take 1 leaf (the node s itself) only if c_s >= 1.\n\nBut then, for a node of length l < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, sum of children's max leaves). Because the children are nodes of length l+1. So, the maximum leaves under s is the sum of the max leaves under each child. But this sum can't exceed c_s. Hence, the min.\n\nIf that's the case, then the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be placed under the root node. Wait, the root node here would be the empty string, but in our problem, the c_s values start from length 1. Wait, but the root node (empty string) isn't considered in the problem. So perhaps the root is not part of the problem. Or maybe the root is considered as a virtual node with no constraints, but the first level is the nodes of length 1.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the constraints apply to all binary strings of length from 1 to n. So the root node (empty string) is not part of the constraints. So for the entire trie, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints on the nodes. For example, the root node (virtual) would have children being the nodes of length 1. But since there's no c_s for the root node, the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max leaves under each of the root's children (the nodes of length 1), and that sum is not constrained by any c_s. Wait, but that can't be right. Because the root node isn't part of the problem. So, the constraints are only on the nodes of length 1 to n.\n\nWait, but for any string in the multiset, all of its prefixes (including the first character) are considered. For example, a string of length n has prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n. So, the constraints for the prefixes of length 1 to n are all considered. So, the root node (empty string) is not part of the constraints. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints on the nodes of length 1 to n.\n\nBut how does the formula apply? For example, the maximum number of leaves in the entire trie is the sum of the maximum leaves under each node of length 1 (but that sum would be constrained by the nodes of length 1, and their parents, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps the entire process is to compute for the root (virtual) node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree. But since the root node is not part of the constraints, its capacity is effectively infinite. So the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maximum leaves under each of its children (nodes of length 1). But each of those children's maximum leaves is min(c_s, sum of their children's max leaves). So recursively, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints.\n\nSo the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the value computed by this recursive formula, starting from the root (with unlimited capacity), and propagating down to the leaves.\n\nBut since the root isn't part of the constraints, the formula for the root is sum of children's max leaves. For each node s of length l (from 1 to n), the formula is min(c_s, sum of children's max leaves). For nodes of length n, the children are none, so sum of children's max leaves is zero. Thus, their max leaves is min(c_s, 0) which is zero. Wait, but that can't be right. Because for a node of length n, the maximum number of leaves under it is 1 if allowed by c_s. Because the node itself is a leaf. So perhaps the formula for a node s of length l is:\n\nif l == n: max_leaves(s) = min(c_s, 1)\nelse: max_leaves(s) = min(c_s, sum of max_leaves(child) for each child of s)\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because for a node of length n, the only leaf in its subtree is itself. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1, but this is allowed only if c_s >= 1. If c_s is 0, then it can't contribute any leaves. So the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1).\n\nFor nodes of length l < n, their max_leaves is min(c_s, sum of their children's max_leaves). Because the sum of children's max_leaves is the maximum number of leaves that can be placed under their children, and the node's own capacity c_s may limit that sum.\n\nThus, the overall maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of max_leaves(s) for all children of the root node (i.e., the nodes of length 1). But wait, the root node's max_leaves is sum of children's max_leaves. So the root's max_leaves is the total number of leaves in the entire trie, which is the answer.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: for a given set of c_s values (for all s of length 1..n), compute the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be placed, which is the value obtained by this recursive formula. And we need to count the number of c_s assignments where this value is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we model this? Since n is up to 15, the number of binary strings of length up to n is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1) - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16-2 = 65534. Which is manageable for certain approaches.\n\nBut how can we compute the number of c_s assignments where the computed maximum is exactly f?\n\nThe key insight here is that for each node (binary string s of length l), the value of c_s must be at least the minimal value required to allow the maximum leaves to be as high as possible. However, since we're trying to count the number of assignments where the maximum is exactly f, perhaps we can model this as a DP problem where we compute for each node the possible contributions.\n\nBut considering that each node's max_leaves depends on its children's max_leaves, this seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming on the trie structure, processing nodes in order of increasing length.\n\nLet me think of the nodes ordered by their length. For example, process all nodes of length n first, then n-1, and so on up to length 1. Because the max_leaves for a node of length l depends on the max_leaves of its children (which are of length l+1).\n\nSo, for each node s of length l, once we know the max_leaves of its children, we can compute the max_leaves for s. But the value of max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, sum_children). However, the c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\nBut the problem requires that the final result (the max_leaves for the root, which is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children) equals exactly f. So, for each node, the choice of c_s affects the max_leaves(s), which in turn affects the parent nodes.\n\nBut how can we model the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the final result is exactly f?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of max_leaves(s) and the number of ways to achieve that given the constraints on c_s and the children.\n\nBut since the nodes are processed in order of decreasing length (starting from n down to 1), for each node, we can compute the number of ways to choose c_s such that the max_leaves(s) is some value, given that the children's max_leaves are known.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's consider the nodes in order of decreasing length. For a node s of length l, its children are s followed by 0 and s followed by 1. For example, for l = n-1, the children are of length n.\n\nFor each node, the max_leaves(s) is determined by the sum of the max_leaves of its children (let's call this sum_children) and the value of c_s. So:\n\nmax_leaves(s) = min(c_s, sum_children).\n\nBut the choice of c_s can be from 0 to k. However, since max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, sum_children), for a given sum_children, the possible values of max_leaves(s) can be from 0 to min(k, sum_children). Because:\n\n- If c_s <= sum_children: then max_leaves(s) = c_s. So, for any c_s in [0, sum_children], the max_leaves(s) is c_s. However, since c_s can be up to k, but if sum_children is less than k, then c_s can be up to sum_children. So the maximum possible max_leaves(s) is min(k, sum_children).\n\nWait, no. For example, if sum_children is 5, and k is 10. Then, choosing c_s as 3 would give max_leaves(s) = 3, which is <= sum_children. Choosing c_s as 10 would still give max_leaves(s) = 5. So the max_leaves(s) is the minimum between c_s and sum_children. Therefore, for a given sum_children, the possible max_leaves(s) can be any value between 0 and min(k, sum_children). However, for each possible value m of max_leaves(s), the number of c_s that would result in this m is:\n\n- If m <= sum_children: then c_s can be any value between m and min(k, sum_children). Wait, no. Because if sum_children is fixed, then:\n\nmax_leaves(s) = min(c_s, sum_children).\n\nSo, for a given sum_children, the possible m (max_leaves(s)) can be any integer between 0 and min(k, sum_children). But how many ways are there to choose c_s such that min(c_s, sum_children) = m?\n\nWell, if m <= sum_children:\n\nThen, for min(c_s, sum_children) = m, we have two cases:\n\n- If m < sum_children: then c_s must be exactly m. Because if c_s > m, then min(c_s, sum_children) would be min(c_s, sum_children) which could be higher than m. Wait, no. Wait, suppose sum_children is S. Then, for min(c_s, S) = m:\n\nIf m <= S, then c_s must be >= m and <= S. Because if c_s is between m and S, then min(c_s, S) is c_s if c_s <= S, which is m. Wait, no. For example, if S is 5, and m is 3. Then, min(c_s, 5) = 3 implies that c_s must be >=3 and <=5. Because if c_s is 3, min(3,5)=3. If c_s is 4, min(4,5)=4. So that's not equal to m. Wait, this suggests that for a given m, the number of c_s that produce min(c_s, S) = m is zero unless m is exactly the value of min(c_s, S). So how can we get m as the result?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake here. For a given sum_children S, the value of m = min(c_s, S) can be any value between 0 and min(k, S). But for each m, the possible c_s that would result in this m is:\n\n- If m < S: then c_s must be between m and S, but min(c_s, S) is c_s. So to have min(c_s, S) = m, c_s must be exactly m. Because if c_s is larger than m but less than S, then min(c_s, S) is c_s, which is larger than m. So only when c_s = m, min(c_s, S) is m. But if c_s is larger than S, then min(c_s, S) is S. So for m to be the result, either:\n\nm = c_s (and c_s <= S) or m = S (and c_s >= S).\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase. For a given S (sum_children), the value of m = min(c_s, S) can be:\n\n- For any c_s in [0, S], m = c_s.\n\n- For any c_s in [S, k], m = S.\n\nSo, the possible values of m are:\n\nAll integers from 0 to min(S, k), and for each m in this range, the number of c_s that would produce this m is:\n\n- If m < S: then the number of c_s is 1 (only c_s = m).\n\n- If m = S: then the number of c_s is (k - S + 1), provided that S <= k. Otherwise, if S > k, then m can't be S. Wait, no. Because m is min(c_s, S). So if S > k, then for any c_s in [0, k], min(c_s, S) = c_s. So m can be up to k. In this case, m can't be S, because S is larger than k.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nFor a given sum_children S, the possible m (max_leaves(s)) is between 0 and min(S, k). For each m in 0 to min(S, k):\n\n- If m < S: the number of c_s choices that result in m is 1 (c_s = m).\n\n- If m = S: the number of c_s choices is (k - S + 1) if S <= k. Otherwise, 0 (since S > k, and m can't reach S).\n\nWait, but if S <= k, then for m = S, the number of c_s choices is (k - S + 1) because c_s can be from S to k. But since c_s can be from 0 to k, inclusive, the count is (k - S + 1).\n\nBut how does this affect the DP?\n\nSo, for each node s, once we know the sum_children (the sum of the max_leaves of its children), we can compute the possible values of max_leaves(s) and the number of ways to choose c_s for that node.\n\nBut the sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of the children. For example, for a node s with two children, left and right, sum_children is left_max + right_max.\n\nBut since the children are processed before the parent (since we process nodes in order of decreasing length), we can compute for each node the possible values of max_leaves(s) and the number of ways to choose c_s for that node, given the possible values of the children.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can maintain a DP table that tracks the number of ways to achieve a certain value of max_leaves(s) for that node, given the possibilities of its children.\n\nBut how can we combine the possibilities of the children?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for a node s with two children, left and right. The sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of left and right. However, the max_leaves of left and right can vary, and thus the sum_children can vary. Therefore, for each node, the DP state depends on the sum_children, which in turn depends on the combinations of the children's max_leaves.\n\nBut for a node s of length l, which has two children (left and right) of length l+1, the sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of left and right. However, for each child, the max_leaves can be any value between 0 and some upper bound. So, for each node, the DP for that node depends on the DP states of its children.\n\nThis seems computationally intensive, but given that n is small (up to 15), and the maximum possible max_leaves for a node is up to f (since the final answer is f), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible value of max_leaves for any node. Since each node's max_leaves is min(c_s, sum_children), and c_s can be up to k. However, the sum_children for a node of length l is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. For the root node, which is not part of the problem, the sum_children would be the sum of the max_leaves of its children (the nodes of length 1). So, the maximum possible value of the root's max_leaves (which is the total number of leaves in the multiset) is up to the sum of all possible max_leaves of the nodes of length 1. But since each of those nodes can have a max_leaves up to min(k, ...), but for n=15, the maximum possible f could be up to something like 2^15 * k. However, given that k can be up to 2e5, and n up to 15, this might be too large to handle directly.\n\nBut the problem asks for the number of ways where the final value is exactly f. So perhaps we can model this with a DP approach where for each node, we track the possible values of the max_leaves for that node, and the number of ways to achieve it.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n- For each node in the trie (processed in order of decreasing length), compute a DP table that maps possible values of max_leaves(s) to the number of ways to choose c_s for that node, given the possible values of its children.\n\n- The base case is the nodes of length n. For each such node, the sum_children is 0 (since they have no children). Thus, max_leaves(s) = min(c_s, 0). But since 0 is the sum_children, min(c_s, 0) can be 0 only if c_s >= 0 (which it always is), so max_leaves(s) is 0 if c_s is 0, or 0 otherwise? Wait, no. Wait for a node of length n, sum_children is 0. So max_leaves(s) = min(c_s, 0). But since c_s is between 0 and k, min(c_s, 0) is 0. So regardless of the value of c_s (as long as it's ≥0), the max_leaves(s) for a node of length n is 0. But that can't be right, because earlier we thought that for a node of length n, the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the formula for max_leaves(s):\n\nFor a node s of length l:\n\nif l == n: then the max_leaves(s) is the maximum number of leaves in its subtree. Since the node s is a leaf (length n), the only possible leaf in its subtree is itself. So the maximum number of leaves is 1 if allowed by c_s. So the formula should be min(c_s, 1). But according to the previous logic, for a node of length l < n, the max_leaves is min(c_s, sum_children), where sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. For a node of length n, sum_children is 0 (no children), so the formula would be min(c_s, 0), which is 0. But that contradicts the correct formula. So where's the mistake?\n\nAh, here's the error: for a node of length l < n, the max_leaves(s) is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the max_leaves of its children. But for a node of length l = n, the sum_children is zero, but the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). So the formula for max_leaves(s) is:\n\nif l == n: min(c_s, 1)\nelse: min(c_s, sum_children)\n\nSo, the previous reasoning was incorrect for the leaves. So the formula depends on whether the node is a leaf (l = n) or not.\n\nThat changes things. So for a node s of length l, the max_leaves(s) is:\n\nif l == n:\n    m = min(c_s, 1)\nelse:\n    m = min(c_s, sum_children)\n\nwhere sum_children is the sum of max_leaves of the children of s.\n\nSo, for the leaves (l = n), the sum_children is zero, but the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). So for a node of length n, the possible values of max_leaves(s) can be 0 or 1, depending on c_s. Because:\n\n- if c_s is 0, then min(0, 1) = 0.\n- if c_s ≥ 1, then min(c_s, 1) = 1.\n\nSo for each node of length n, the number of ways to choose c_s such that the max_leaves(s) is m (either 0 or 1) is:\n\n- if m = 0: c_s must be 0 → 1 way.\n- if m = 1: c_s can be from 1 to k → (k) ways. Wait, because c_s can be any value between 1 and k, inclusive. So the number of ways is max(0, k - 1 + 1) = k. Unless k < 1, but since k ≥ 1 per input constraints (the input says 1 ≤ k ≤ ...), so yes, it's k ways.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that c_s can be chosen from 0 to k. So for a node of length n, to have max_leaves(s) = 1, the c_s must be ≥1. So the number of possible c_s is (k - 0) - (number of c_s < 1) = k - 0 = k? No, the number of c_s ≥1 is k (since c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k). So yes, k ways.\n\nSo for the leaves (nodes of length n), their DP is:\n\nways[0] = 1 (choose c_s = 0)\nways[1] = k (choose c_s ≥1)\n\nNow, for nodes of length l < n, their max_leaves depends on sum_children. For example, if a node has two children (left and right), then sum_children = left_max + right_max. The node's max_leaves is min(c_s, sum_children). And the number of ways to choose c_s for this node depends on the sum_children.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nProcess nodes in order of decreasing length (starting from n, then n-1, ..., 1). For each node, compute a DP table that represents the possible values of max_leaves for that node and the number of ways to achieve it, given the DP tables of its children.\n\nFor each node, we need to compute the possible values of max_leaves(s) and the number of ways to choose c_s for that node, given the possible combinations of max_leaves of its children.\n\nLet's think about how to combine the children's possibilities. For example, if a node has two children, left and right, each with their own DP tables (possible values and counts), then the sum_children can be any value that is the sum of a value from left's DP and a value from right's DP. For each possible sum_children, we can compute the number of ways to achieve that sum_children, and then use that to compute the possible max_leaves for the current node.\n\nBut for nodes with two children, the sum_children is the sum of their max_leaves. So for each possible combination of left_val and right_val, the sum is left_val + right_val, and the number of ways is (ways_left[left_val] * ways_right[right_val]).\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive if done naively, but for small n (up to 15), and with the max_leaves values possibly up to f, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of sum_children for a node of length l?\n\nAt each level, the sum_children can be up to the maximum possible number of leaves. For example, for the root node, the sum_children is the total number of leaves. For n=15, the maximum possible sum_children is 2^15 * k (if all c_s are set to allow maximum leaves). However, since f can be up to 2e5, and the problem asks for the number of ways where the final value is exactly f, perhaps we can limit our DP to track up to f.\n\nBut how? Because the sum_children for a node could be larger than f, but in that case, the node's max_leaves would be min(c_s, sum_children). However, if the sum_children is larger than f, but the parent nodes may have constraints that reduce it further. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the final answer requires that the maximum possible size is exactly f, perhaps during the DP processing, we can track the possible values up to f, and ignore higher values. However, this is not straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: for each node, the possible max_leaves can be up to the maximum possible value of the sum_children, which depends on the children. However, since the final answer is f, perhaps we can model the DP for each node to track up to f, and for any sum_children greater than f, treat it as f (since the min(c_s, sum_children) would be capped by the parent's constraints).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think recursively.\n\nFor example, suppose that for a node, the sum_children is S. Then, the max_leaves for this node is min(c_s, S). The choice of c_s can be between 0 and k. The number of ways to choose c_s for this node depends on S and k.\n\nIf S is very large (say, larger than k), then min(c_s, S) = c_s, and the possible values of max_leaves(s) are 0 to k. However, if S is smaller than k, then the possible values are 0 to S.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, the final value is f. So during the DP processing, for each node, we need to track the possible values of max_leaves(s) that can contribute to the final f.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each node, we can track the possible values of max_leaves(s) up to f, and ignore higher values. Because if during the processing, a node's max_leaves exceeds f, then it's possible that higher nodes will cap it, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the final value (the root's max_leaves) is the sum of the max_leaves of its children (nodes of length 1). So, for the root's children, their max_leaves must be such that their sum is exactly f. Thus, during the DP processing, for each node, we need to track all possible values of max_leaves(s) up to f.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each node, process in order of decreasing length.\n\n- For each node, compute a DP table that represents the number of ways to choose c_s for that node, leading to a particular value of max_leaves(s). The DP table for a node s is a dictionary or array where dp[s][m] is the number of ways to choose c_s for node s such that max_leaves(s) is m, given the possible combinations of its children's max_leaves.\n\n- For leaves (length n), the DP is straightforward: for m=0, 1 way; for m=1, k ways.\n\n- For non-leaf nodes (length <n), the DP depends on the sum_children, which is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. For each possible sum_children, we compute the number of ways to choose c_s for this node leading to various m values.\n\nBut how to compute the sum_children possibilities for a node?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose a node has two children, left and right. Each child has their own DP tables. The sum_children is the sum of the left's max_leaves and the right's max_leaves. For each possible value of left_val and right_val, we can compute their sum and accumulate the number of ways.\n\nThis seems like a convolution problem. For two children, the possible sum_children values are the convolution of the left's and right's possible values. For example, if left has possible values {a:",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string's constraint such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) on a trie structure of binary strings, considering constraints on each node's capacity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Trie Structure**: We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` as nodes in a trie. Each node's capacity constraint affects how many strings can have it as a prefix.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We process nodes from the deepest (length `n`) up to the shallowest (length 1). For each node, we compute the number of ways to choose its constraint value such that the maximum number of strings in the multiset adhering to constraints is tracked.\n3. **Leaf Nodes Handling**: For nodes of length `n` (leaf nodes), the maximum number of strings that can be included is either 0 or 1, depending on their constraint value.\n4. **Non-Leaf Nodes Handling**: For non-leaf nodes, the maximum number of strings is determined by the sum of capacities of their children and their own constraint value.\n5. **Combining Results**: Using convolution techniques, we combine results from child nodes to determine the number of valid configurations for parent nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Precompute all binary strings of length up to n\n    # But since we need to process nodes in order of length, we can generate them per level\n    # We can represent each node as a string, but for efficiency, we can use a trie-like structure.\n    # However, for n up to 15, it's manageable to process all nodes by their length.\n\n    # For each length l, we need to process all nodes of length l, and for each node, track dp[l][s] where s is the max_leaves for that node.\n\n    # We'll use memoization for each level.

However, for the purposes of DP, we don't need to store all nodes explicitly; instead, we can compute the number of ways for each node based on the number of ways for its children.\n\n    # For each level l, the number of nodes is 2^l. However, for each node, the processing depends on its children.\n\n    # To avoid generating all nodes, we can note that for nodes at the same level, their children are processed first, and their DP is computed similarly. Thus, we can compute the number of ways for each node based on the number of ways for its children.\n\n    # However, since each node has two children (except for leaves), we can model this recursively.\n\n    # Let's define a function that returns the DP table for a node of length l, given that its children have already been processed.\n\n    # But for Python, recursion may not be efficient, so we can use memoization with dynamic programming.\n\n    # Instead, we can process levels from n down to 1, and for each level, compute the DP for each node.\n\n    # However, for each node, the DP depends on its children.

For level l, there are 2^l nodes.\n\n    # However, for the DP computation, each node's DP is independent of other nodes at the same level, except that their children are processed first.\n\n    # Thus, for each level l, we can compute the DP for all nodes as follows:\n\n    # For level n:\n    #   For each node, dp is [0]*(f+1)\n    #   dp[0] = 1\n    #   if 1 <= f:\n    #       dp[1] += k\n    #   (but since k can be large, we need to mod it)\n\n    # For level l < n:\n    #   For each node, we need to combine the DPs of its two children (which are at level l+1).\n    #   For each possible value of left_child's max_leaves (a) and right_child's max_leaves (b), compute sum_children = a + b.\n    #   Then, for this sum_children, compute the number of ways for this node's c_s choice leading to various m.\n\n    # However, since there are 2^l nodes at each level l, and for each node we need to compute the DP based on its children, which are two specific nodes (left and right), this seems computationally heavy.\n\n    # However, notice that all nodes at the same level have the same structure. For example, each node at level l has two children, which are nodes at level l+1. Thus, for all nodes at level l, their children are processed in the same way. Therefore, the DP for each node at level l is the same, and we can compute it once and multiply by the number of nodes at that level.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because each node's children are different. For example, the node '0' at level 1 has children '00' and '01', while the node '1' at level 1 has children '10' and '11'. However, the DPs for these children are the same, as they are nodes at level 2. Thus, for all nodes at level l, their children's DPs are the same, and thus the DP for each node at level l is the same.\n\n    # This is a crucial insight. All nodes at the same level l have identical DP structures because their children are nodes at level l+1, which are processed uniformly. Thus, for level l, we can compute the DP for one node and then multiply the number of ways by the number of nodes at that level.\n\n    # Therefore, we can proceed level by level, computing the DP for a single node at that level, and then multiplying by the number of nodes at that level for the final count.\n\n    # Let's formalize this:\n\n    # Initialize for level n:\n    #   dp_n = [0]*(f+1)\n    #   dp_n[0] = 1\n    #   if 1 <= f:\n    #       dp_n[1] = k % MOD\n\n    # For level l from n-1 down to 1:\n    #   Get the dp_prev (dp for level l+1)\n    #   Compute the convolution of dp_prev with itself (since each node has two children, each with dp_prev)\n    #   For each possible sum_children (s), compute the number of ways to achieve it\n    #   Then, for each possible s, compute the number of ways for the current node's max_leaves(m) based on s and k.\n\n    # However, the convolution part is the key here. For each node, the sum_children is the sum of the two children's max_leaves. Since each child's DP is dp_prev, the number of ways for sum_children s is the convolution of dp_prev with itself at position s.\n\n    # Once we have the number of ways for each sum_children s, we can compute for the current node's DP.\n\n    # So, for each level l, the number of nodes is 2^l. The total contribution to the final answer is the number of ways for one node multiplied by 2^l.\n\n    # However, the final answer is the number of ways for the root's children (level 1 nodes) such that their sum is exactly f.\n\n    # Wait, the root node is not part of the problem, but the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children (nodes of level 1).

So each node is unique.\n\n    # However, for the purpose of counting, the number of ways for nodes at the same level with the same structure (i.e., same number of children and same possible combinations) can be multiplied.\n\n    # But given the time constraints, perhaps we can model the DP for each node as follows:\n\n    # For each level l, starting from n down to 1:\n    #   For each node in level l:\n    #       if l == n:\n    #           dp for this node is {0:1, 1:k}\n    #       else:\n    #           get the dp of left child and right child\n    #           compute the convolution of their possible values to get sum_children\n    #           then compute the possible m for this node based on sum_children and k\n\n    # However, for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable if we process each node efficiently.\n\n    # But for each node, the DP can be represented as a dictionary of possible max_leaves and counts.\n\n    # However, given that for each node, the possible max_leaves is up to f, we can limit our DP tables to track up to f.\n\n    # To optimize, we can note that for nodes at level l, the number of possible max_leaves is limited by the sum of their children's max_leaves, which is up to f.\n\n    # Therefore, we can represent the DP for each node as an array of size f+1, where dp[m] is the number of ways to achieve max_leaves = m for that node.\n\n    # Now, let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # We'll need to generate all nodes for each level. However, for the purposes of DP, we don't need to store all nodes explicitly; instead, we can compute the number of ways for each node based on the number of ways for its children.\n\n    # For each level l, the number of nodes is 2^l. However, for each node, the processing depends on its children.\n\n    # To avoid generating all nodes, we can note that for nodes at the same level, their children are processed first, and their DP is computed similarly. Thus, we can compute the number of ways for each node based on the number of ways for its children.\n\n    # However, since each node has two children (except for leaves), we can model this recursively.\n\n    # Let's define a function that returns the DP table for a node of length l, given that its children have already been processed.\n\n    # But for Python, recursion may not be efficient, so we can use memoization with dynamic programming.\n\n    # Instead, we can process levels from n down to 1, and for each level, compute the DP for each node.\n\n    # However, for each node, the DP depends on its children. Since each node has two children (left and right), which are nodes of length l+1.\n\n    # Therefore, for each level l, we can compute the DP for all nodes of that level, given that the DPs for level l+1 are already computed.\n\n    # For level n, each node's DP is {0:1, 1:k} (but stored as arrays).\n\n    # For level l < n, each node has two children, and their DP is computed by combining the DPs of the children.\n\n    # Let's proceed step by step.\n\n    # First, for each level, we need to know the number of nodes. For level l, there are 2^l nodes.\n\n    # However, for the DP computation, each node's DP is independent of other nodes at the same level, except that their children are processed first.\n\n    # Thus, for each level l, we can compute the DP for all nodes as follows:\n\n    # For level n:\n    #   For each node, dp is [0]*(f+1)\n    #   dp[0] = 1\n    #   if 1 <= f:\n    #       dp[1] += k\n    #   (but since k can be large, we need to mod it)\n\n    # For level l < n:\n    #   For each node, we need to combine the DPs of its two children (which are at level l+1).\n    #   For each possible value of left_child's max_leaves (a) and right_child's max_leaves (b), compute sum_children = a + b.\n    #   Then, for this sum_children, compute the number of ways for this node's c_s choice leading to various m.\n\n    # However, since there are 2^l nodes at each level l, and for each node we need to compute the DP based on its children, which are two specific nodes (left and right), this seems computationally heavy.\n\n    # However, notice that all nodes at the same level have the same structure. For example, each node at level l has two children, which are nodes at level l+1. Thus, for all nodes at level l, their children are processed in the same way. Therefore, the DP for each node at level l is the same, and we can compute it once and multiply by the number of nodes at that level.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because each node's children are different. For example, the node '0' at level 1 has children '00' and '01', while the node '1' at level 1 has children '10' and '11'. However, the DPs for these children are the same, as they are nodes at level 2. Thus, for all nodes at level l, their children's DPs are the same, and thus the DP for each node at level l is the same.\n\n    # This is a crucial insight. All nodes at the same level l have identical DP structures because their children are nodes at level l+1, which are processed uniformly. Thus, for level l, we can compute the DP for one node and then multiply the number of ways by the number of nodes at that level.\n\n    # Therefore, we can proceed level by level, computing the DP for a single node at that level, and then multiplying by the number of nodes at that level for the final count.\n\n    # Let's formalize this:\n\n    # Initialize for level n:\n    #   dp_n = [0]*(f+1)\n    #   dp_n[0] = 1\n    #   if 1 <= f:\n    #       dp_n[1] = k % MOD\n\n    # For level l from n-1 down to 1:\n    #   Get the dp_prev (dp for level l+1)\n    #   Compute the convolution of dp_prev with itself (since each node has two children, each with dp_prev)\n    #   For each possible sum_children (s), compute the number of ways to achieve it\n    #   Then, for each possible s, compute the number of ways for the current node's max_leaves(m) based on s and k.\n\n    # However, the convolution part is the key here. For each node, the sum_children is the sum of the two children's max_leaves. Since each child's DP is dp_prev, the number of ways for sum_children s is the convolution of dp_prev with itself at position s.\n\n    # Once we have the number of ways for each sum_children s, we can compute for the current node's DP.\n\n    # So, for each level l, the number of nodes is 2^l. The total contribution to the final answer is the number of ways for one node multiplied by 2^l.\n\n    # However, the final answer is the number of ways for the root's children (level 1 nodes) such that their sum is exactly f.\n\n    # Wait, the root node is not part of the problem, but the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children (nodes of level 1). Thus, after processing level 1, we need to find the number of ways that the sum of the max_leaves of all nodes at level 1 is exactly f.\n\n    # However, since all nodes at level 1 have the same DP, and there are 2^1 = 2 nodes, the total number of ways is the convolution of the DP for level 1 with itself, evaluated at f.\n\n    # Therefore, the steps are:\n\n    # 1. Compute for level n: dp_n\n    # 2. For each level from n-1 down to 1:\n    #       compute the convolution of dp_prev with itself to get the possible sum_children for a node's children\n    #       compute the new_dp for this level based on sum_children and k\n    #       set dp_prev = new_dp\n    # 3. After processing level 1, compute the convolution of dp_prev with itself (since there are 2 nodes at level 1) and get the value at f.\n\n    # However, this approach assumes that all nodes at the same level have the same DP, which is true because their children are processed uniformly.\n\n    # Let's implement this approach.\n\n    # Let's define a function to compute the convolution of two dp arrays.\n\n    def convolve(a, b, max_val):\n        res = [0] * (max_val + 1)\n        for i in range(len(a)):\n            for j in range(len(b)):\n                s = i + j\n                if s > max_val:\n                    continue\n                res[s] = (res[s] + a[i] * b[j]) % MOD\n        return res\n\n    # Initialize for level n\n    max_level = n\n    current_dp = [0] * (f + 1)\n    if 0 <= f:\n        current_dp[0] = 1\n    if 1 <= f:\n        current_dp[1] = k % MOD\n\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        # For level l, each node has two children from level l+1\n        # We need to compute the convolution of current_dp with itself to get the sum_children distribution\n        # Then, compute new_dp based on sum_children and k\n\n        # Compute the convolution of current_dp with itself\n        conv = [0] * (f + 1)\n        for i in range(f + 1):\n            for j in range(f + 1):\n                s = i + j\n                if s > f:\n                    continue\n                conv[s] = (conv[s] + current_dp[i] * current_dp[j]) % MOD\n\n        # Now, for each possible sum_children s, compute the number of ways for the current node's max_leaves(m)\n        new_dp = [0] * (f + 1)\n        for s in range(f + 1):\n            cnt = conv[s]\n            if cnt == 0:\n                continue\n            # For this sum_children s, compute the ways for this node\n            # The max_leaves for this node is min(c_s, s)\n            # The number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, s) = m is:\n            # For each m in 0..min(s, k)\n            # if m < s: ways is 1 (c_s = m)\n            # if m == s: ways is (k - s + 1) if s <= k else 0\n            # So for each possible m, accumulate the count\n\n            # However, since we need to compute the new_dp for this node, which is the number of ways to have max_leaves = m for this node, given that sum_children is s\n            # So for this s, the contribution to new_dp[m] is cnt * ways_to_choose_c_s_for_m\n\n            # So for each possible m:\n            max_m = min(s, k)\n            if max_m >= 0:\n                # m can be from 0 to max_m\n                # for m < s:\n                #   if m <= f, then add cnt * 1 to new_dp[m]\n                # for m = s:\n                #   if s <= k and s <= f, then add cnt * (k - s + 1) to new_dp[s]\n\n                # However, we can only contribute to m up to f\n                for m in range(0, min(max_m, f) + 1):\n                    if m < s:\n                        if m <= f:\n                            new_dp[m] = (new_dp[m] + cnt) % MOD\n                    else:  # m == s\n                        if s <= k and s <= f:\n                            ways = (k - s + 1) % MOD\n                            new_dp[s] = (new_dp[s] + cnt * ways) % MOD\n\n        current_dp = new_dp\n\n    # After processing level 1, current_dp contains the DP for a single node of level 1\n    # The total number of ways is the convolution of current_dp with itself, evaluated at f, multiplied by 1 (since there are 2 nodes at level 1, and their contributions are combined)\n\n    # Compute the convolution of current_dp with itself\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(f + 1):\n        j = f - i\n        if j < 0 or j > f:\n            continue\n        result = (result + current_dp[i] * current_dp[j]) % MOD\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
