The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nSo, the nation has n districts connected in a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between any two districts). Each district i has 2^i fans. The president wants to remove k contestants, but after removal, the remaining districts must form a connected component. And we need to maximize the total fans of the remaining contestants. The output is the k districts to remove, sorted in increasing order.\n\nThe key here is to select which districts to keep such that they form a connected subtree, and their sum of 2^i is maximized. Since we want to maximize the sum, we need to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible because 2^i grows exponentially with i. But since the districts must form a connected component, we can't just take the top (n -k) districts. We need to find a way to select the districts with the highest possible values while ensuring they are connected.\n\nWait, but how to approach this? Let me think. The problem is similar to finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by including higher-numbered districts, perhaps we need to prioritize keeping the higher-numbered districts and then ensure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that? One approach is to consider that the optimal subtree must include the highest possible nodes, and then connect them through their parent nodes. However, since the tree can be arbitrary, maybe we need to perform some kind of greedy selection.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since each node's value is 2^i, which increases with i, the highest value is at node n. So, ideally, we want to include node n. Then, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but connected.\n\nBut how to select which nodes to remove? Maybe we can model this as a problem where we need to choose (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes selected, the optimal strategy would be to select the (n -k) nodes with the highest possible values, but ensuring they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to do that? Because if you just take the top (n -k) nodes, they might not be connected. So, perhaps we need to find a way to include the highest nodes and their necessary connections.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think in terms of pruning the tree. Let's consider that we want to remove k nodes. The idea is to remove the nodes with the smallest values (since they contribute less to the sum) but also ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected component.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to remove? Here's an idea: the optimal set of nodes to keep is a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes. To do this, perhaps we can perform a traversal of the tree starting from the highest node (node n), and greedily include nodes that are necessary to maintain connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. Let's think of the problem as selecting which nodes to keep. Let's say we need to keep m = n -k nodes. Since the sum is maximized when we have the largest m nodes, but they must be connected. So, the problem becomes selecting the m nodes with the highest values that form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to select those nodes? Let's consider that the largest node (n) must be included. Then, we need to include as many of the next largest nodes as possible, but connected to this subtree.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can use a priority queue approach. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from node n, and include nodes in the order of their value. But since the tree is arbitrary, perhaps we need to find a way to select the nodes with the highest values while maintaining connectivity.\n\nAnother thought: Since the nodes' values are 2^i, which are unique and strictly increasing with i, the optimal solution is to keep the m = n -k nodes with the highest numbers, but connected. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number of lower nodes needed to connect the highest ones?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to remove the k smallest nodes (in terms of their value) such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. But this is not straightforward, since removing certain nodes may disconnect others.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. So, the way to maximize the sum is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, the optimal solution would be to keep all nodes except for the k smallest ones, but ensuring that the kept nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Because if you remove some small nodes, maybe the rest are connected.\n\nWait, but the tree is connected. Suppose we remove some nodes. The remaining nodes will form a forest. But we need exactly one connected component. So, the problem is to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree, and the sum of 2^i is maximized.\n\nSo, the key is to find the set of nodes to remove (k of them) such that the remaining nodes are connected, and their sum is maximum.\n\nNow, since the sum depends on the nodes kept, the maximum sum is achieved by keeping the nodes with the largest possible values. However, the constraint is that they must form a connected component.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to start with the set of all nodes, and then iteratively remove the nodes with the smallest values that are not needed to keep the subtree connected. But how to do that?\n\nAnother approach is to think of this as a problem of selecting a subtree with m = n -k nodes. To maximize the sum, we need to select the m nodes with the highest possible values, but connected. So, how can we find such a subtree?\n\nLet me think about the structure. The node with the highest value is n. So, the subtree must include n. Then, we need to include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, but connected to n. For example, if node n-1 is connected to n, then include it. Otherwise, we need to include the nodes that connect it to n.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps we can perform a traversal of the tree starting from node n, and greedily include the nodes with the highest values. But how to decide which nodes to include.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to build a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. Let's imagine that we want to keep the nodes with the highest values. We can start with node n. Then, for each of its neighbors, we can consider adding the neighbor if it's part of the highest nodes. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps we can use a priority-based approach where we always include the highest available nodes first.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm. Let's think of the tree as a graph where each node has a weight of 2^i. We need to select a subtree with m = n -k nodes that has maximum total weight. This is equivalent to finding a maximum spanning tree, but since the tree is already connected, the maximum spanning tree is the entire tree. But we need to select a subtree with exactly m nodes. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to select the nodes with the highest weights, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. How can we do that?\n\nLet me consider that the optimal subtree is formed by including all nodes except for the k nodes with the smallest values, but ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. However, if some of those nodes are not connected, we have to replace some of the removed nodes with lower ones to maintain connectivity.\n\nBut how to find which ones to remove?\n\nAnother approach: Since the nodes' values are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the optimal strategy is to keep the nodes with the highest possible numbers. The only problem is that those nodes may not form a connected subtree. So, we need to include the necessary lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nFor example, suppose that the highest nodes are all in separate branches of the tree. Then, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them. But since the lower nodes have smaller values, we want to minimize the number of such nodes that we have to include.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model it as a tree where we want to keep the highest nodes, and for each node, decide whether to keep it based on whether it's necessary to connect the higher nodes.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's perform a priority-based traversal where we start with the highest node (n). Then, for each node in the tree, we can decide to keep it if it's part of the path that connects the higher nodes. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: we need to select m = n -k nodes. Let's imagine that we want to select the m nodes with the highest values, and then check if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then that's our answer. If not, we need to replace some of the lower nodes in the selected set with higher nodes that are necessary to connect the subset.\n\nBut checking all subsets is not feasible for n up to 1e6.\n\nSo, this seems computationally challenging.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the nodes have unique values, and the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep the m largest nodes, and then remove any nodes that are not in the subtree formed by those m nodes. However, if the m largest nodes are not connected, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them, but that would require removing some other nodes.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the nodes with numbers from m to n must be kept. Wait, no, because m could be less than n. Let's say m = n -k. For example, if n=6 and k=3, m=3. The largest three nodes are 4,5,6. But if they are not connected, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to know which nodes are in the subtree formed by the largest m nodes?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from node n, and greedily include nodes with higher values. However, since the tree is arbitrary, we need to find a way to select the necessary nodes.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let's think of the problem as a tree where each node has a value, and we need to select a subtree of size m with maximum sum. Since the values are 2^i, which are strictly increasing, the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible nodes, and connects them through the necessary lower nodes.\n\nBut how to find this subtree?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to select the nodes with the highest values, and for each node, decide whether to include it based on whether it's part of the subtree that connects the higher nodes.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a priority queue approach. Let me think:\n\nWe can model the problem as a reverse process. Start with the highest node (n) and then add nodes in the order of their value. For each node, we can check if it's connected to the current subtree. If it's not, we need to include some of its ancestors or siblings to connect it.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a subtree where we always include the next highest node that is connected to the existing subtree. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: The problem is similar to finding a Steiner tree, but with the goal of maximizing the sum. However, Steiner tree problems are NP-hard, but given the structure of the problem (tree as input, and the weights being exponentially increasing), perhaps there's a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think again. Since the nodes have exponentially increasing values, the optimal solution is to include all nodes except for the k smallest ones, but ensuring that the remaining form a connected subtree. However, the k nodes to remove are the ones that are not part of the connected subtree of the highest m nodes.\n\nBut how to find those nodes?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Start with the highest node (n). This is definitely part of the solution.\n\n2. Then, for each node in the tree, sorted in descending order of their value (so from n down to 1), decide whether to include it in the subtree. If including it would connect to the existing subtree, then include it. Otherwise, skip it (but this may not be correct).\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the maximum spanning tree. Since the tree is connected, the maximum spanning tree is the tree itself. But we need a subtree of exactly m nodes. How to select that?\n\nWait, but the problem is not about edges. It's about selecting nodes. So, perhaps the approach is to select the nodes with the highest values, and then find the minimal number of nodes that need to be added to connect them.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\nEdges:\n2-1\n2-6\n4-2\n5-6\n2-3\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 5.\n\nThe nodes are numbered 1 to 6. The values are 2^i.\n\nWe need to keep 6-3 = 3 nodes.\n\nThe optimal is to keep 2, 5, 6. Their sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But according to the sample output, the answer is removing 1,3,4. So the kept nodes are 2,5,6, which are connected via 2-6 and 6-5. So yes, they are connected.\n\nBut why not keep 5,6, and 4? Well, 4 is connected to 2, which is not in the kept nodes. So if we kept 4, we'd need to have 2 connected to it. So if we keep 4, then we need to include 2, but that would make the kept nodes 2,4,5,6 (which is four nodes, but we can only keep 3). Hence, the optimal is to keep the three highest nodes (5,6, and 2?), but 2 is 2^2, which is smaller than 4,5,6. Wait, but the sample keeps 2,5,6. The sum is 4+32+64=100. What if we kept 4,5,6? Their sum is 16+32+64=112, which is larger. Why isn't that the case?\n\nAh, wait! Oh, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. The sample says that the maximum sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But what if we kept 4,5,6? That would be 16+32+64= 112. Which is larger. Why isn't that the case?\n\nHmm, that suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. But according to the sample input, the output is 1 3 4. Which means the kept nodes are 2,5,6, and possibly others? Wait, n is 6, k is 3. So m = 6-3=3. So the kept nodes are 3. So the sample output says that the removed districts are 1,3,4. The kept districts are 2,5,6. But why not 4,5,6?\n\nBecause the districts 4,5,6: is there a path between them? Let's see. District 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. So 4 is connected to 6 via 2. So if we keep 4, 5, 6, then they are connected via 6-2-4 and 6-5. So yes, they are connected. So why isn't that the optimal solution?\n\nBecause the sum of 4,5,6 would be 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112, which is bigger than the sample's 100. So why is the sample output different?\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Let me recheck the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n6 3\n\nThen the edges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the tree looks like this:\n\n- Node 2 is the center, connected to 1, 3, 4, 6.\n\n- Node 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the districts 4, 5, 6: 4 is connected to 2, 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So if we keep 4, 5, 6, then they are connected via node 2? No, because node 2 is not kept. So the districts 4,5,6 would be in the tree as follows:\n\n- 4 is connected to 2 (but 2 is not kept), so the only way to reach 4 is through 2, which is not in the kept set. Similarly for 6. So if the kept districts are 4, 5, 6, then there's no path between 4 and 5 or 6. Because the only connection between them is through node 2, which is not kept. So they are not connected. Hence, this subset is invalid.\n\nAh! That's the mistake. So the kept nodes must form a connected subtree. Therefore, even though 4,5,6 have higher values, they are not connected. So the only way to keep them is to also include node 2. But that would require keeping 4 nodes (2,4,5,6), but we can only keep 3. Hence, we can't keep all of them.\n\nTherefore, the sample's solution is correct. So the problem is to find a subset of m = n -k nodes that are connected, and have the maximum sum.\n\nNow, back to the problem. How to find such a subset?\n\nSince the nodes have exponentially increasing values, the optimal strategy is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring that they are connected. So, the approach could be:\n\nStart with the highest node (n), then include the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. If they are not connected, we may need to include some lower nodes to connect them. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea is to model this as a problem where we need to select the m nodes with the highest values, but ensuring that they are connected. However, since the nodes may not be connected, we need to find the minimal number of lower nodes to add to connect them.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nAnother thought: since the nodes' values are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the best way to maximize the sum is to keep the largest m nodes, but connected. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of nodes that need to be removed from the set {m+1, m+2, ..., n} to make them connected. However, since m = n -k, this is not directly applicable.\n\nWait, m = n -k. So the number of nodes to keep is m. We need to select m nodes, which are as high as possible, and connected. So, for example, the ideal is to select the nodes from (n - m + 1) to n, but only if they are connected. If they are not connected, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which ones?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a modified BFS or DFS. Let's think of the following approach:\n\n1. Start with the highest node, n. This is included in the kept set.\n\n2. For each node in the tree, sorted in descending order of their value (from n down to 1), we check if it is connected to the current kept set. If yes, include it. If not, skip it (but this might not be the right approach, since we might need to include some lower nodes to connect higher ones later).\n\nBut how to check if a node is connected to the current kept set? Because the kept set is a subset of the nodes, and the tree is connected. However, the kept set may not be connected yet. So, for example, if we have kept nodes 6 and 5, and then consider node 4, which is connected to node 2, but node 2 is not in the kept set. So node 4 is not connected to the current kept set.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if a node is connected to the current kept set?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. However, since the nodes are processed in order of descending value, perhaps we can use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to track which nodes are connected to the kept set.\n\nWait, but how to model the DSU. Let me think:\n\nInitially, the kept set is empty. We process nodes in descending order. For each node, we check if any of its adjacent nodes are already in the kept set. If so, we add this node to the kept set. Otherwise, we skip it. However, this approach might not work because even if none of the adjacent nodes are in the kept set, there might be a path through other nodes that are not yet processed.\n\nBut since we are processing nodes in descending order, once we process a node, we can mark it as part of the kept set. If any of its neighbors are already in the kept set, then it can be added. Otherwise, it's not connected to the kept set yet. However, this approach may miss some possibilities where adding a lower node now allows us to include higher nodes later. But since we're processing in descending order, higher nodes are considered first.\n\nLet me try this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: n=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nNodes processed in order: 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nInitially, kept set is empty.\n\nProcess node 6: none of its neighbors are in the kept set (since it's empty). So we can't add it? Or do we add it anyway? Wait, the kept set needs to be connected. But initially, the kept set is empty. So when we add node 6, it's the first node. So it's connected. So we add it to the kept set.\n\nThen process node 5: check its neighbors. It is connected to node 6. Since 6 is in the kept set, we add 5 to the kept set. Now kept set is {6,5}.\n\nNext node is 4. Its neighbors are 2. Not in the kept set. So we cannot add it. So skip.\n\nNext node is 3. Its neighbors are 2. Not in the kept set. Skip.\n\nNext node is 2. Its neighbors are 1, 6, 4, 3. 6 is in the kept set. So we add 2 to the kept set. Now kept set is {6,5,2}.\n\nNow, we have m=3 nodes. So the kept set is {2,5,6}, which matches the sample. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 +64= 100.\n\nBut what about node 4? It was skipped. But if we had added node 2, then maybe node 4 can be considered later. But since we already have m=3 nodes, we can't add more.\n\nThis approach seems to work for the sample. Let's see another example. Suppose we have nodes 4,5,6, and the kept set is {6,5,2}. Now, what if node 4 is processed after node 2? Well, in this case, the kept set is already full, so no more nodes are added.\n\nSo the idea is: process nodes in descending order, and for each node, if it's adjacent to any node already in the kept set, then add it. This way, the kept set is always connected. Once we have m nodes, we stop. The nodes not added are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Compute m = n -k.\n\n- Initialize a DSU structure, or a visited array to track which nodes are in the kept set.\n\n- Process the nodes in descending order (from n down to 1).\n\n- For each node, check if any of its neighbors are already in the kept set.\n\n- If yes, add this node to the kept set.\n\n- Continue until we have m nodes in the kept set.\n\n- The nodes not in the kept set are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if any of the neighbors are in the kept set?\n\nWe can use a boolean array 'kept' that marks whether a node is in the kept set. For each node being processed, we check all its adjacent nodes. If any of them is in 'kept', then we can add the current node to 'kept'.\n\nOnce we have added m nodes, we stop.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut how to handle the tree structure? For each node, we need to know its adjacent nodes.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nRead the tree, build adjacency lists.\n\nInitialize a 'kept' array of size n+1 (since districts are numbered from 1 to n).\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor i from n down to 1:\n\n   if count == m: break.\n\n   if any neighbor of i is in 'kept':\n\n       add i to 'kept' (mark kept[i] = True)\n\n       increment count by 1.\n\nOnce done, collect all the nodes not in 'kept' as the ones to remove. Sort them and output.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's test this approach against the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, m=3.\n\nProcessing nodes 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nkept starts as all False.\n\ncount=0.\n\nProcess 6: check neighbors (2 and 5). Are any in kept? No. So can't add. Wait, but according to this logic, we can't add node 6 because none of its neighbors are in the kept set. But node 6 is the first node. How do we add it?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because the initial kept set is empty. So the first node processed (say 6) has no neighbors in the kept set. According to the current logic, it can't be added. But we need to add it, since it's the first node.\n\nSo, the logic is missing the case where the node is the first one to be added. How to handle that?\n\nAh, here's the fix: for the first node, we can add it regardless of neighbors. Because it's the starting point.\n\nSo, the modified logic is: for each node, if it's the first node (count is 0), then add it. Else, check if any of its neighbors are in the kept set.\n\nSo, during the loop:\n\nfor i from n downto 1:\n\n   if count == m: break\n\n   if count == 0:\n\n       add to kept, count +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       for each neighbor in adj[i]:\n\n           if kept[neighbor] is True:\n\n               add to kept, count +=1\n\n               break\n\nBut this is not sufficient. Because, for example, the first node is added, and then subsequent nodes can be added if they are adjacent to any kept node.\n\nIn the sample, node 6 is processed first. count is 0, so added. count becomes 1.\n\nNext node 5: check its neighbors. 5 is connected to 6. Since 6 is in kept, add 5. count becomes 2.\n\nNext node 4: check its neighbors (2). Not in kept. So skip.\n\nNext node 3: check neighbors (2). Not in kept. Skip.\n\nNext node 2: check neighbors (1, 6, 4, 3). 6 is in kept. So add 2. count becomes 3. Now, m is achieved.\n\nThus, the kept nodes are 6,5,2. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose we have a tree where node 1 is connected to node 2, which is connected to node 3. n=3, k=1. m=2.\n\nProcessing nodes 3, 2, 1.\n\ncount=0: add 3. count=1.\n\nnext node 2: check neighbors (3 is in kept). add 2. count=2. done. kept nodes are 3,2. Removed is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=1, m=3. Tree is 1-2-3-4. So the nodes are in a line. Processing from 4,3,2,1.\n\ncount=0: add 4. count=1.\n\nnext 3: neighbor is 4 (kept). add. count=2.\n\nnext 2: neighbor is 3 (kept). add. count=3. done. kept nodes are 4,3,2. Removed is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=1, m=3. Tree is 1-2, 2-3, 2-4. So node 2 is the center. Processing nodes 4,3,2,1.\n\ncount=0: add 4. count=1.\n\nnext 3: check neighbors (2). not in kept. skip.\n\nnext 2: check neighbors (1, 3, 4). 4 is in kept. add. count=2.\n\nnext 1: check neighbors (2). 2 is in kept. add. count=3. done. kept nodes are 4,2,1. sum is 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 16 +4 +2=22. But what if we kept 4,3,2? sum is 16 + 8 +4 = 28. Which is better. How does our algorithm handle this?\n\nLet's see:\n\nProcessing order: 4,3,2,1.\n\ncount=0: add 4. count=1.\n\nnext node 3: check neighbors. 3 is connected to 2. Not in kept. So can't add. skip.\n\nnext node 2: check neighbors. 4 is in kept. add. count=2.\n\nnext node 1: check neighbors. 2 is in kept. add. count=3. done.\n\nThus, kept nodes are 4,2,1. But the optimal would be 4,2,3. Which is sum 16 +4 +8 = 28. Which is better than 16+4+2=22.\n\nSo why didn't the algorithm pick node 3 instead of 1?\n\nBecause when processing node 3, the algorithm checks if any of its neighbors are in the kept set. At that time, the kept set is {4}. Node 3 is connected to 2, which is not in the kept set. So it can't be added. Then node 2 is added (because connected to 4). Then node 1 is added (connected to 2). Thus, the algorithm picks 4,2,1, but the optimal is 4,2,3.\n\nThis suggests that the algorithm is not optimal. So what's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that the algorithm processes nodes in descending order, but node 3 is higher than node 1. However, node 3 can't be added until node 2 is added. But node 2 is added after node 3 is processed. So the algorithm processes node 3 before node 2. But node 3 can't be added until node 2 is added. But node 2 is processed after node 3.\n\nSo the algorithm misses the opportunity to add node 3, because when node 3 is processed, node 2 is not yet in the kept set. However, node 2 is processed later and added. But once node 2 is added, node 3 can be added. However, the algorithm has already filled up the count to m=3 (with 4,2,1). So node 3 is not considered again.\n\nThus, this approach is flawed. It may miss higher-value nodes that can be added after their parent nodes are added.\n\nSo, the problem is that the algorithm processes nodes in order from high to low, but when a higher node is processed, it may not be able to be added because its parent hasn't been added yet. But the parent is processed later (since the parent has a lower number than the higher node). For example, node 3 has a higher number than node 2, so it is processed first. However, node 2 is processed after node 3. When node 2 is processed, it can be added (since it's connected to node 4). But after that, node 3 can be added, but the count is already full.\n\nSo, the algorithm is not considering that after adding node 2, node 3 can be added. However, the algorithm has already processed node 3 and skipped it, and then when node 2 is added, there's no way to go back and consider node 3 again.\n\nThis shows that the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the solution here?\n\nThe problem is that the algorithm is greedy and processes nodes in descending order, but once a node is skipped, it's never revisited. However, after adding some nodes, it may become possible to add higher nodes that were skipped earlier.\n\nSo, how can we handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of processing nodes in descending order once, we need to prioritize adding nodes that are connected to the current kept set. But since the kept set is dynamic, this seems like a priority queue problem.\n\nLet me think of a priority queue (max-heap) approach. Initially, we add the highest node (n) to the kept set. Then, for each node in the kept set, we look at their neighbors and add them to a priority queue (sorted by their value). Then, we extract the highest node from the priority queue, and if it's not already in the kept set, we add it to the kept set. Repeat until we have m nodes.\n\nThis way, we always add the highest possible node that can be connected to the current kept set.\n\nLet me try this approach with the previous example where the tree is 1-2-3-4, and n=4, k=1, m=3.\n\nInitially, the kept set is {4}.\n\nPriority queue contains neighbors of 4, which is 3. So the priority queue has 3.\n\nExtract 3 (highest value). Add to kept set. Now kept set is {4,3}.\n\nPriority queue now has neighbors of 3 (2), and neighbors of 4 (already processed). So add 2 to the queue.\n\nExtract 2. Add to kept set. Now kept set is {4,3,2}. Done. So the kept set is {4,3,2}, which is optimal.\n\nAnother example where the previous approach failed.\n\nAnother example: the tree is 2 connected to 1, 3, 4. n=4, k=1, m=3. So the tree is 2 connected to 1, 3, 4. The optimal kept set is 4,3,2. Let's see.\n\nInitial kept set is {4}. Priority queue has 2 (neighbors of 4). Extract 2 (value 2). Add to kept set. Now kept set is {4,2}. Priority queue has neighbors of 2 (1,3,4). 4 is already in kept set. So add 3 and 1. The priority queue has 3 (value 3) and 1 (value 1). Extract 3. Add to kept set. Now we have 3 nodes. So the kept set is {4,2,3}, which is optimal.\n\nSo this approach seems to work better. Let's see how it works in the earlier example where the previous approach failed.\n\nLet me try the case where the tree is 1-2-3-4, n=4, m=3. The algorithm would:\n\nStart with 4. Add to kept set. Priority queue has 3.\n\nExtract 3. Add to kept set. Now, priority queue has 2.\n\nExtract 2. Add to kept set. Done. So the kept set is 4,3,2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example where the previous approach failed: the tree is 2 connected to 1, 3, 4. n=4, m=3. The algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\nStart with 4. Add to kept. Queue has 2.\n\nExtract 2. Add to kept. Queue now has 1 and 3. Extract 3 (higher value). Add to kept. Done. So kept set is 4,2,3. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work better. How to implement this?\n\nThe idea is to use a priority queue (max-heap) that stores nodes that are adjacent to the current kept set. Initially, we add the highest node (n) to the kept set. Then, we add its neighbors to the priority queue. Then, we repeatedly extract the node with the highest value from the priority queue. If it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is to prioritize keeping districts with higher numbers (since each district's fan count is exponentially larger) while ensuring the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the fan count for district `i` is `2^i`, we aim to keep the districts with the highest values.\n3. **Connected Subtree**: We need to ensure the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved using a priority queue (max-heap) to always expand the subtree by adding the highest possible node that connects to the current subtree.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = n - k\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # Use a max heap, but Python's heapq is min-heap, so store negatives\n    heap = []\n    # Start with the highest node\n    start = n\n    kept[start] = True\n    count = 1\n    # Push all neighbors of start into the heap\n    for neighbor in adj[start]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))  # use negative for max-heap\n\n    while count < m and heap:\n        neg_node, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if kept[node]:\n            continue\n        # Check if any neighbor is already kept\n        # Since we are using the heap to process nodes adjacent to the current kept set\n        # So if we reach here, it's because at least one neighbor is in the kept set\n        kept[node] = True\n        count += 1\n        # Push its neighbors into the heap\n        for neighbor in adj[node]:\n            if not kept[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n    # Collect all districts not kept\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not kept[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts `n`, the number of contestants to remove `k`, and the adjacency list representing the tree.\n2. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap)**: A max-heap is used to always expand the subtree by adding the highest possible node that connects to the current subtree. This ensures that we maximize the sum of fans.\n3. **Initialization**: Start with the highest-numbered district `n` and push its neighbors into the heap.\n4. **Expanding the Subtree**: Continuously extract the highest node from the heap, add it to the subtree if it hasn't been added yet, and push its neighbors into the heap.\n5. **Result Collection**: After forming the required subtree, collect all districts not included in the subtree and print them in sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always form a connected subtree with the maximum possible sum of fans by leveraging the properties of a max-heap to prioritize higher-value districts.",
