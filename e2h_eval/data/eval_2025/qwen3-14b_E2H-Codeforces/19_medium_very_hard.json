The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i values. But since the sum is based on the node numbers, we need to maximize the sum by keeping the nodes with the highest possible i values, but also ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how do we choose which nodes to remove? Because the sum is 2^i, which grows exponentially with i. So higher-numbered nodes contribute way more than lower ones. Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, while ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after removing k nodes, the remaining nodes must be connected. So the optimal strategy would be to keep the highest possible nodes, but ensuring that they are connected. However, since the tree is connected, maybe we can find a way to select a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nLet me think: since 2^i increases rapidly, the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n - k) nodes. But how to ensure that they form a connected subtree?\n\nFor example, if the largest nodes are all connected, then that's perfect. But if they are not connected, then we need to include some smaller nodes to connect them. However, since we want to maximize the sum, perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, even if that requires including some lower ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of it as selecting a subtree of size (n - k) with maximum sum. Since the sum is based on the node's value, which is 2^i, the problem becomes similar to selecting a subtree of certain size with maximum sum. However, given that the sum is additive and the weights are exponentially increasing, perhaps there's a greedy way to approach this.\n\nWait, but the sum of 2^i is equivalent to the sum of each node's weight. Since 2^i is so large, the optimal solution would be to include the largest possible nodes, and exclude the smallest ones. However, the constraint is that the selected nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo here's an idea: we can start by trying to keep the largest (n -k) nodes. But if those nodes are not connected, we need to remove some of them and add lower-numbered nodes to connect them. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Since the tree is connected, maybe the best way is to start from the highest-numbered node and build the subtree by adding the necessary nodes to connect the higher ones.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is maximized when we have the largest possible nodes, the optimal subtree must contain the node with the highest number, and then as many as possible of the next highest numbers, connected through the tree.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to perform a priority-based selection where we select the nodes with the highest values, but ensure that they are connected. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nWe can think of the problem as choosing which nodes to keep. Let's say we want to keep the nodes with the highest possible values. However, since the tree is connected, if we remove some nodes, the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, possibly pruning the tree in a way that allows us to keep as many high nodes as possible.\n\nAnother angle: the problem is similar to finding a minimum spanning tree but with a twist. Wait, no. Alternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select (n -k) nodes such that they are connected and their sum is maximum. Since the sum is determined by the node's value, the problem is equivalent to selecting the subset of nodes with maximum sum, under the constraints of being connected and of size (n -k).\n\nBut how to find that subset?\n\nSince the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, perhaps we can start by considering that we want to keep all nodes except the smallest k. However, this might not be connected. For example, if the tree is a chain like 1-2-3-4-5-6, and we need to remove 3 nodes, then keeping 4,5,6 would be connected. But if the tree is structured such that the largest nodes are disconnected, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how can we check whether the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree?\n\nIf they do, then we can just remove the smallest k nodes. Otherwise, we need to find which nodes to remove from the largest group to make them connected, while still keeping as many high nodes as possible.\n\nThis suggests that the optimal solution is to keep the highest (n -k) nodes, but possibly remove some of them and include some lower nodes to connect them. However, this seems complex.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to proceed is to perform a greedy approach where we start with the highest node and then include as many higher nodes as possible, ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm for maximum spanning trees. Since we want the maximum sum, perhaps we can model the problem as building a maximum spanning tree, but with the size of the tree being (n -k). But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the Steiner tree problem, but that's NP-hard. However, given the constraints of n up to 1e6, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nWait, but the problem has a specific structure. Let's think again about the weights. Since the weight of a node is 2^i, which is exponentially increasing with i. So, the highest node (node n) has the maximum weight, followed by node n-1, etc. Thus, the optimal solution must include node n. Because if you don't include node n, you could replace any other node with node n and get a higher sum.\n\nSimilarly, once node n is included, the next highest nodes should be included as long as they are connected. So perhaps the strategy is to build a subtree that starts with node n and includes as many higher-numbered nodes as possible, connecting them through the tree.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother approach: since the tree is connected, and we need to select (n -k) nodes, perhaps the problem can be transformed into selecting which nodes to remove. The nodes to remove are the smallest k nodes, but only if they are not required to keep the tree connected. However, if some of the smallest nodes are required to connect the higher nodes, then we can't remove them.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes are required?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we need to perform a traversal of the tree, starting from the highest nodes and pruning the tree in a way that allows us to remove the smallest possible nodes.\n\nWait, here's a possible method:\n\nWe can perform a priority-based selection. We can consider that we want to keep the nodes with the highest values. So, we can start by considering the node with the highest value (n), and then traverse the tree, keeping track of which nodes are needed to connect the high-value nodes.\n\nBut how to decide which nodes to keep?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the optimal set of nodes to keep is a subtree that includes the node n, and as many of the higher-numbered nodes as possible. To ensure connectivity, we need to include certain nodes that act as bridges between the higher nodes.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: the problem is equivalent to finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes, which includes the node with the maximum value, and then the next maximum, etc. So, perhaps we can perform a DFS or BFS starting from the highest node, and greedily select nodes in order of their value, but ensuring that we collect enough nodes.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to select a subset of nodes, and for each node, we decide whether to include it or not. The inclusion depends on whether it's necessary to maintain connectivity.\n\nBut again, this seems vague.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to remove the k nodes with the smallest values, but in such a way that the remaining nodes are connected. However, this may not always be possible. For example, if the tree is structured such that the smallest nodes are all leaves connected to higher nodes, then removing them would leave the higher nodes connected.\n\nBut if the tree is structured such that the smallest nodes are in the middle, then removing them might disconnect the tree.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to first try to remove the k smallest nodes, but if that would disconnect the tree, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, given that the sum is dominated by the higher nodes, maybe the optimal solution is to include as many high nodes as possible. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a traversal of the tree, starting from the highest node, and for each node, decide whether to include it or not based on the priority of its value.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that higher nodes are better. Let's imagine that we want to select the nodes to keep. We can think of this as a problem where we want to keep the nodes with the highest values. However, since the tree is connected, we can model this as a process of pruning the tree by removing the smallest nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nTo do this, we can perform a priority-based selection. Let's think of the tree as rooted at node n. Then, for each node, we can decide whether to keep it or not. However, how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nAnother approach: Since the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and the value of each node is 2^i, the problem is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the selected nodes. Since higher i gives higher value, we want to select the nodes with the largest i possible. However, the constraint is that the selected nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size (n -k) that contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nThe key insight here is that the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest number, n. Because otherwise, we can replace any node in the subtree with n and get a higher sum. Similarly, the subtree must include the next highest possible nodes, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nThus, the strategy is to build a subtree that starts with node n, and then adds the highest possible nodes, ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n\nTo implement this, perhaps we can perform a modified BFS or DFS traversal where we prioritize visiting higher-numbered nodes first. However, the challenge is to select exactly (n -k) nodes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variant of the maximum spanning tree. Since we need to select a connected subtree with (n -k) nodes, perhaps we can use a priority queue approach where we select the nodes with the highest values, and connect them through the tree.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAnother idea: since the nodes have unique values (each node's value is 2^i, so each is unique), the optimal subtree is the one that includes the (n -k) nodes with the highest values, provided that they form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with a greedy algorithm. Let's suppose that we want to include the nodes with the highest values. We can start by including node n, then include the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. However, this is similar to building a maximum spanning tree.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n- Start with the highest-numbered node (n). This is the root of our subtree.\n- Then, for each of the remaining nodes, we want to include them if they are connected to the current subtree and have a higher value than some other nodes. But how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the tree as a collection of nodes, and we want to select the (n -k) nodes with the highest values, but ensuring that they are connected. To do this, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, prioritizing nodes with higher values.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\nWe can perform a traversal of the tree, starting from the highest node (n). For each node, we decide whether to include it in the subtree. However, since the subtree must be connected, we can't just take any nodes. So perhaps we can model this as a priority queue where we always expand the subtree by adding the highest possible nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nThis sounds like Prim's algorithm for maximum spanning trees. Because in Prim's algorithm, we start with a node, and then add the edge with the maximum weight that connects to the current subtree. But here, instead of edges, we are dealing with nodes. However, the value of the nodes is what determines their importance.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let's think of the nodes' values as their weights. We need to select a subtree (connected) of size (n -k) that has the maximum sum of node weights. Since the sum is maximized by including the highest nodes, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by taking the highest nodes and connecting them through their paths.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the optimal subtree is formed by including all nodes except the k smallest ones, provided that they are connected. If they are not connected, then we need to remove some of the smallest nodes and include some others to connect the parts.\n\nBut again, how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So we need to keep 3 nodes. The output is to remove 1,3,4. The kept nodes are 2,5,6. Their sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But why not keep 5,6, and 2? Well, because that's exactly what they did. But why not keep 5,6, and 3? Because 3 is not connected to 5 and 6? Let me see the tree structure.\n\nThe input for the first sample is:\n\nEdges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo the tree is structured with node 2 as a central hub. The nodes 5 and 6 are connected via 6-2. The nodes 1,3,4 are connected to 2.\n\nSo if we want to keep the largest nodes, which are 6,5, and 2. Those are connected. So that's why the sample output removes 1,3,4.\n\nSo the idea is that the largest nodes are 6,5,4,3,2,1. We need to keep 3 nodes. So the top three are 6,5,4. But those are not connected. For example, 6 is connected to 2, 5 is connected to 6, 4 is connected to 2. So if we want to keep 6,5,4, we need to include 2 as well. But that would require keeping four nodes, which exceeds the allowed (n -k) = 3.\n\nTherefore, we cannot keep all three of 6,5,4. So we have to choose between them. The best choice is to keep 6,5, and 2. Because 2 is connected to both 6 and 5. So the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4+32+64=100. Alternatively, if we kept 6,5, and 4, but then they are not connected unless we include 2. So we can't. Hence, the optimal is to keep 6,5,2.\n\nSo the approach here is that we can't just take the top (n -k) nodes. Because they may not be connected. So we need to find a connected subset that includes as many high nodes as possible.\n\nSo how to find that subset?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to perform a traversal of the tree, starting from the highest node, and then greedily adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. This way, we can ensure that the subtree remains connected.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. We can model this as a priority queue (max-heap) where we add nodes based on their value. Initially, we add the highest node (n) to the priority queue. Then, we perform a traversal, expanding the subtree by adding the highest possible nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nBut since the tree is undirected, we need to track which nodes are already part of the subtree and which are not. Let's think of it as a BFS or DFS, but always choosing the next highest node.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nWe can use a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree but not yet included. Initially, we add the highest node (n) to the subtree. Then, we look at all its neighbors. We add those neighbors to the priority queue, sorted by their value. Then, we extract the highest node from the priority queue, add it to the subtree, and repeat the process. However, this is similar to Prim's algorithm for maximum spanning tree, but instead of edges, we're considering nodes.\n\nBut wait, in Prim's algorithm, you add edges to the MST. Here, we are adding nodes to the subtree. However, the idea is that each time we add a node to the subtree, we can then add its neighbors to the priority queue if they haven't been added yet. This way, we can build a connected subtree that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how does this help in selecting exactly (n -k) nodes?\n\nBecause in this approach, we are building a subtree that includes the maximum possible nodes. However, the problem requires us to select exactly (n -k) nodes. So perhaps this approach will allow us to select the maximum sum subtree of any size, but we need to stop when we have exactly (n -k) nodes.\n\nWait, but in this case, the algorithm would select the maximum sum subtree of size (n -k). Let me think: the algorithm would start with node n, then add the highest possible neighbor, then the next highest, etc. So the resulting subtree would have the maximum possible sum for the given size. Is this correct?\n\nWell, this is a greedy approach. It's possible that there's a better selection, but given the exponential weights, this might be the optimal approach.\n\nLet's test this idea with the first sample. The sample needs to select 3 nodes. The algorithm starts with node 6 (since n=6). Then, the neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. The higher of these is 5. So we add 5. Now the subtree has nodes 6 and 5. Then, the next step is to consider the neighbors of these nodes that are not yet in the subtree. The neighbors of 5 are 6 (already in), and neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5 (already in). Also, the neighbors of 2 are 1, 6, 4, 3. So the priority queue would have 2, 1, 4, 3. The highest is 4. Add 4 to the subtree. Now the subtree has 3 nodes (6,5,4). But wait, but the sample solution keeps 2,5,6. Why is this approach giving a different result?\n\nIn this scenario, the sum of 6,5,4 is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 = 64 + 32 + 16 = 112. Which is higher than the sample's 100. But the sample's solution is 100. That suggests that this approach would give a better result, but the sample's output is different. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, but the sample says that the maximum is 100. But according to this approach, the sum would be 112. Which is higher. So there's a contradiction here. Which implies that my reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, what's the actual maximum possible sum in the first sample?\n\nThe total number of fans is the sum of 2^i for the kept districts. The sample says that the maximum is 100, but according to this approach, keeping 6,5,4 would give 64 + 32 + 16 = 112. But how is that possible? Are those nodes connected?\n\nWait, node 6 is connected to node 2. Node 4 is connected to node 2. Node 5 is connected to node 6. So the subtree containing 6,5,4 would require that node 2 is connected. But the subtree is supposed to be connected. However, if we have nodes 6,5,4, but not node 2, then they are not connected. Because node 4 is connected to node 2, which is not in the subtree. So the subtree would consist of 6 and 5 connected, and 4 is isolated. Thus, the subtree is not connected. Therefore, the approach I described earlier is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the nodes are connected. Adding node 4 to the subtree without adding node 2 would break connectivity.\n\nAh! So the mistake was in assuming that adding the highest neighbor would ensure connectivity. But in reality, the algorithm needs to ensure that each new node is connected to the existing subtree. Thus, the approach must ensure that when a node is added, it is adjacent to the current subtree. Hence, the priority queue approach must track which nodes are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nSo, the correct algorithm would be:\n\nStart with the highest node (n) as the initial subtree. The priority queue contains all its neighbors, sorted by their value. Then, we extract the highest node from the queue and add it to the subtree. Then, we add its neighbors (which are not yet in the subtree or in the queue) to the priority queue. Repeat this until the subtree has (n -k) nodes.\n\nThis way, each new node added is connected to the existing subtree, ensuring connectivity.\n\nLet me re-examine the first sample with this approach.\n\nSample 1: n=6, k=3. Need to keep 3 nodes.\n\nStart with node 6. The subtree has 1 node. The priority queue contains its neighbors: 2 and 5. Which are higher? 5 is higher than 2. So extract 5. Now the subtree has nodes 6 and 5. Now, we look at the neighbors of 5, which is 6 (already in subtree) and nothing else. Then, we look at the neighbors of 6 (already in the subtree) and the neighbors of 5. So the next step is to add the neighbors of 5 and 6 that are not yet in the subtree or in the queue.\n\nWait, the priority queue after adding 5 would have the neighbors of 5 (which is 6, already in subtree) and the neighbors of 6 that are not yet processed. Wait, the initial priority queue after adding node 6 was [2,5]. After extracting 5, we add the neighbors of 5 (only 6, which is already in the subtree). Then, the priority queue now contains the neighbors of 6 that are not yet processed. Wait, no. The initial queue after adding node 6 had neighbors 2 and 5. When we extract 5, we add its neighbors (which are 6, already in the subtree) to the queue? No. Because the queue is for nodes adjacent to the current subtree. So, when we add a node to the subtree, we look at its neighbors that are not already in the subtree or in the queue, and add them to the queue.\n\nSo, the correct process is:\n\nInitially, the subtree is {6}. The queue contains the neighbors of 6 (2 and 5). The queue is a max-heap, so the highest is 5. Extract 5, add to the subtree. Now, the subtree is {6,5}. Then, we look at the neighbors of 5 (which is 6, already in the subtree) and the neighbors of 6 that are not yet in the subtree. Wait, no. The queue initially had 2 and 5. When we extracted 5, we add the neighbors of 5 (which is 6) to the queue? No. Because the neighbors of 5 are already considered. Or perhaps, when we add a node to the subtree, we add its neighbors to the queue if they are not already in the subtree or the queue.\n\nWait, the standard Prim's algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of edges. But in this case, the algorithm is similar to Prim's but for nodes. Each time we add a node to the subtree, we add its adjacent nodes to the priority queue if they are not already in the subtree. So the queue contains all nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree but not yet in it.\n\nSo, for the first step:\n\nSubtree: {6}\n\nQueue: neighbors of 6 (2 and 5). They are added to the queue.\n\nExtract 5 (highest). Add to subtree. Now, subtree is {6,5}.\n\nNow, we look at the neighbors of 5, which is 6 (already in subtree) and any other? No. Then, look at the neighbors of 6 (which are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5). But 5 is already in the subtree. So the neighbors of 6 that are not in the subtree are 2, 1, 4, 3. These are added to the queue. But the queue already has 2 (from before?), or no?\n\nWait, the queue was initially {2,5} (but after extracting 5, the queue now contains 2). Then, after adding 5 to the subtree, we look at its neighbors. But since they are already in the queue or not?\n\nNo, the queue is supposed to have all nodes adjacent to the current subtree. When we add a node to the subtree, we add its neighbors to the queue if they are not already in the subtree or the queue.\n\nWait, perhaps the queue is maintained as follows: whenever a node is added to the subtree, all of its neighbors that are not yet in the subtree are added to the queue (if they are not already in the queue).\n\nIn this case, after adding node 5 to the subtree, we look at its neighbors (node 6 is already in the subtree). So nothing is added to the queue. The queue now contains node 2 (from the initial step). Then, we extract node 2 from the queue (the highest value in the queue). Add it to the subtree. Now the subtree is {6,5,2}, which has 3 nodes. So we stop here. The nodes removed are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample. \n\nAh! So this approach works for the first sample. The sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 64 +32 +4 = 100. Which is what the sample says. So this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the idea is to use a priority queue (max-heap) that contains the nodes adjacent to the current subtree. Initially, the subtree is {n}, and the queue contains its neighbors. Then, we extract the highest node from the queue, add it to the subtree, and add its neighbors to the queue (if not already in the subtree or the queue). We repeat this until the subtree has (n -k) nodes. The nodes not in the subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nThis seems promising. Because each time we add the highest possible node that is adjacent to the current subtree, ensuring that the subtree remains connected. The resulting subtree will have the maximum possible sum of node values.\n\nSo the steps for the algorithm are:\n\n1. Build the tree as an adjacency list.\n\n2. Initialize a max-heap (priority queue) with the neighbors of node n. Also, mark node n as part of the subtree.\n\n3. While the size of the subtree is less than (n -k):\n\n   a. Extract the node with the highest value from the heap.\n\n   b. Add it to the subtree.\n\n   c. For each neighbor of this node, if it is not already in the subtree or the heap, add it to the heap.\n\n4. Once the subtree has (n -k) nodes, the nodes not in the subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently, especially for large n (up to 1e6)?\n\nThe main challenges are:\n\n- Implementing a priority queue (max-heap) efficiently. In Python, the heapq module is a min-heap, so we can insert negative values to simulate a max-heap.\n\n- Keeping track of which nodes are in the subtree or in the heap.\n\nBut for large n (like 1e6), using a heap with O(n log n) operations should be feasible.\n\nWait, but for each node, we may add it to the heap multiple times. For example, a node may be adjacent to multiple nodes in the subtree. However, once a node is added to the heap once, we don't need to add it again. Because once it's in the heap, even if it's added again, the first occurrence will be processed first. However, we need to avoid adding duplicates to the heap, as that would increase the time complexity.\n\nTherefore, we need to track whether a node is already in the heap or in the subtree. So, we can have a visited array (or set) that marks whether a node is in the subtree or in the heap.\n\nWait, but how to track whether a node is already in the heap. Because in a priority queue, there's no way to check if a node is already present. So, we can have a boolean array that marks whether a node is in the subtree, or in the heap. But this may not be sufficient. However, in practice, even if a node is added multiple times to the heap, when it's popped, we check if it's already in the subtree. If yes, we ignore it. Otherwise, we add it to the subtree.\n\nThis is a common approach in Dijkstra's algorithm when there are multiple entries in the priority queue for the same node.\n\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- subtree = set containing node n.\n\n- heap is a max-heap containing all neighbors of node n.\n\n- in_heap = a boolean array of size n+1, initialized to False for all nodes except those in the heap. Wait, no. Initially, the heap contains the neighbors of node n. So for each of those nodes, we mark in_heap as True.\n\nThen, while the size of the subtree is less than (n -k):\n\n   Extract the node u with maximum value from the heap.\n\n   If u is already in the subtree, skip it.\n\n   Else, add u to the subtree.\n\n   For each neighbor v of u:\n\n      if v is not in the subtree and not in the heap:\n\n         add v to the heap, and mark in_heap[v] as True.\n\nThis way, even if a node is added multiple times to the heap, once it's processed (added to the subtree), subsequent entries in the heap for that node are ignored.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, the question is: How to implement this in Python efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e6.\n\nImplementing a priority queue (max-heap) with heapq in Python. Since heapq is a min-heap, we can push the negative of the node values. For example, when inserting a node u, we push (-u, u) into the heap. When popping, we get the smallest negative value (i.e., the largest u).\n\nNow, for the in_heap array, we can have a boolean array of size n+1. Also, a boolean array for the subtree.\n\nLet's think about the data structures:\n\n- adjacency list: a list of lists. For each node u, adjacency[u] contains the list of its neighbors.\n\n- in_heap: a boolean array indicating whether a node is currently in the heap.\n\n- in_subtree: a boolean array indicating whether a node is in the subtree.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild the adjacency list.\n\nInitialize in_subtree as a list of False, with size n+1. Set in_subtree[n] = True.\n\nInitialize the heap. For all neighbors of node n, add them to the heap. Also, mark in_heap[neighbor] = True.\n\nThen, while the size of the subtree is less than (n -k):\n\n   Pop the node with the maximum value from the heap. Let's call it u.\n\n   If in_subtree[u] is True, skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      add u to the subtree (mark in_subtree[u] as True).\n\n      for each neighbor v of u:\n\n          if not in_subtree[v] and not in_heap[v]:\n\n              add v to the heap (push -v, v)\n\n              mark in_heap[v] as True.\n\nOnce the loop completes, the nodes not in the subtree are the ones to be removed. We collect them, sort them, and output.\n\nThis should work.\n\nLet's test this logic with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. Need to keep 3 nodes.\n\nInitial subtree: {6}.\n\nHeap contains neighbors of 6: 2 and 5. So the heap has (5, 2). Wait, the heap is a max-heap implemented as a min-heap with negative values. So the heap elements would be (-5,5), (-2,2). The first pop would give -5, which is 5.\n\nProcess 5: not in subtree. Add to subtree. Now subtree size is 2. Then, look at neighbors of 5: which is 6 (already in subtree). So no new nodes added to the heap.\n\nNext, the heap has (-2,2). Pop it. Check if in_subtree[2] is False. Add to subtree. Now subtree size is 3. Done. The subtree is {6,5,2}. The nodes to remove are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother example: let's say we have a tree where node 6 is connected to node 5, which is connected to node 4, etc. Suppose we need to keep 3 nodes. The algorithm would select 6,5,4. But they are connected through the tree. So the sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 = 112, which is better than the sample's 100. But why isn't that the case in the first sample? Because in the first sample, node 4 is connected to node 2, not directly to node 5. So the subtree {6,5,4} is not connected. But according to the algorithm, when processing node 5, the neighbors are 6 (in subtree). Then, when processing node 2, which is added to the subtree. So the algorithm ensures that the nodes are connected.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the second sample input.\n\nSample 2 input is:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the tree structure:\n\nLet me try to visualize:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 6, 7, 1, 4.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 2, 8, 5.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\nSo the tree has node 2 as a central node. The highest node is 8. The required number of nodes to keep is 8 -4 =4.\n\nThe output is '1 3 4 5'.\n\nWhich means the kept nodes are 2,6,7,8. Let's see.\n\nLet's simulate the algorithm:\n\nStart with node 8. Subtree size is 1. Its neighbors are 7. So the heap contains 7.\n\nPop 7. Add to subtree. Now size is 2. Neighbors of 7 are 2, 8 (already in subtree), and 5. So add 2 and 5 to the heap.\n\nHeap now contains 5 and 2. Next, the max is 5. Pop 5. Add to subtree. Now size is 3. Neighbors of 5 are 7 (already in subtree). So nothing added. Heap now contains 2.\n\nPop 2. Add to subtree. Now size is 4. Done. The subtree is {8,7,5,2}.\n\nThe nodes to remove are 1,3,4,6. But the sample output is 1,3,4,5. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, what's the sample output for the second input? The output is '1 3 4 5'.\n\nWait, according to the sample input given, the second input is:\n\n['8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\nSo the output is '1 3 4 5'. Which means the kept nodes are 2,6,7,8. But according to our algorithm, the subtree would",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always expand the subtree by adding the highest-numbered node adjacent to the current subtree.
