He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\nFirst, A has a string with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, maybe the count of 'c's equals both.\n\nSo, given a string S, I have to check if it could have been formed this way.\n\nLet me think about the conditions that the string must satisfy.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's impossible.\n\nSo first, check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the characters must be grouped. Like, all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, \"aabbcc\" is okay, but \"ababcc\" is not because the a's and b's are interleaved.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. How to do that?\n\nWe can check the order of characters. For example, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, let's think about the structure of the string. Let's split the string into three parts: the a part, the b part, and the c part. So, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is 'aaabccc', that's valid. But 'bbacc' would have a's after the b's, which is invalid. Wait, the second example input is 'bbacc' which outputs 'NO' because the order is wrong. So yes, that's the case.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the correct order. How to do that?\n\nI can iterate through the string and check that the characters are non-decreasing in terms of their order. For example, 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So, the string must be such that each character is not less than the previous one. So, for example, if the current character is 'b', then the next can be 'b' or 'c', but not 'a'.\n\nSo, for the entire string, check that each character is >= the previous one. If that's not the case, return 'NO'.\n\nWait, but the string can have only a's, then only b's, then only c's. So, for example, 'aaa' is allowed? Well, according to the problem statement, when B appends the b's, he ensures that there is at least one a and one b. So the original string from A is some number of a's (at least 1), then B appends some number of b's (at least 1). Then C appends some number of c's (at least 1? Or zero? Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. The problem says that C appends some number of letters. So, the number can be zero? Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. However, the note says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. So, the number of 'c's can't be zero. Because the number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's, which are at least 1. Because the original string (after A and B) has at least one a and one b. So when C appends the c's, the number of c's is equal to the number of a's (which is at least 1) or the number of b's (also at least 1). Therefore, the total number of c's is at least 1. Therefore, the final string must have at least one c. So the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when B appends the b's, he ensures that there is at least one a and one b. So the original string after B",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by appending 'b's to a string of 'a's, followed by appending 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string. The string must follow a strict order: all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. Additionally, the string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: Ensure that the string is composed of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. This can be verified by checking that each character in the string is not less than the previous character.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validation**: Ensure that the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's, and that there is at least one occurrence of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    # Count the number of a, b, c\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    # Check if there is at least one a, one b, one c\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check if the number of c is equal to count_a or count_b\n    return count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(s):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure that characters are in non-decreasing order (i.e., all 'a's first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's). If any character is found to be less than the previous one, the string is invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined using the `count` method.\n3. **Validation Checks**: The string is valid only if it contains at least one of each character and the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints of the problem are efficiently checked, providing the correct result in linear time relative to the length of the string.",
