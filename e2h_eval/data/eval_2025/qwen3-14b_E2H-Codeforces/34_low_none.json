And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day window, I need to compute the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. Then output that average with enough decimal places.\n\nFirst, let me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to take each window of size k, sum them, add all those sums together, and then divide by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1). But if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach with O(n*k) time complexity would be too slow. Because for each of the (n -k +1) windows, summing k elements would take O(k) time. So total time would be O(nk), which for n=2e5 and k=2e5 would be O(4e10) operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, sliding window technique. Let me think. The sum for the first window is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then for the next window, it's sum(a[1..k]) which is previous sum minus a[0] plus a[k]. So each step can be done in O(1) time. That way, the total time is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total.\n3. Then for each next window (from i=1 to i = n -k), subtract the element leaving the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k - 1]). Then add this sum to the total.\n4. Finally, divide the total by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is given as ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'] — but wait, how is the input structured? Oh, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the input is given as two lines. Wait, no, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers. But in the example input, there are three separate inputs, which suggests that perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the example shows multiple test cases as part of the sample input. But looking at the problem's original input description, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, maybe that's part of the way the problem is presented here. Wait, the user provided the problem statement and then in the example input, there are three examples. But perhaps in the actual programming problem, each test case is given as per the input format.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers. So for each test case, there are two lines. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases. For example, the first input line is '3 2\\n3 4 7' which is n=3, k=2, and the array [3,4,7]. Then another input line '1 1\\n10' which is n=1, k=1, array [10]. And third input line '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1' which is n=8, k=2, array of 8 numbers.\n\nBut how does that translate into the actual input for the program? The problem says that the program should read from stdin. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input section says that the first line contains two integers, etc. So perhaps the actual problem expects that there are multiple test cases, but the original problem may have different input formats.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a given list of `n` days. The solution must efficiently handle large input sizes and provide results with high precision.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use the sliding window technique to maintain the sum of the current window efficiently. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first `k` elements.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is left behind and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Total Sum and Average Calculation**: Accumulate the sum of all window sums and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx]:\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        total_windows = n - k + 1\n        if total_windows <= 0:\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            continue\n        \n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total = current_sum\n        \n        for i in range(1, total_windows):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total += current_sum\n        \n        average = total / total_windows\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed once.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures each window sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to ensure the required precision, using Python's string formatting for accurate output.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes within acceptable time limits.",
