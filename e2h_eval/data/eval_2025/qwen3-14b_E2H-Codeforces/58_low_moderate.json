You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to create an odd-length cycle, and also count the number of ways to do that. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that a graph is bipartite if and only if it doesn't contain any odd-length cycles. So, if the graph already has an odd-length cycle, then we don't need to add any edges. But if it's bipartite, then we need to add edges to create such a cycle.\n\nSo the first thing I need to check is whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, then t is 0 and w is 1? Wait, no. Because the question says \"the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length\". If the graph already has such a cycle, then adding zero edges would be one way. But maybe there are multiple existing cycles. However, the problem says that the answer requires the minimum t. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is 0 and w is the number of ways to choose zero edges (which is 1?), but maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the output is the number of ways to add t edges. So if t is zero, then the answer is 1 if there's at least one existing odd cycle. But how do we count the number of existing odd cycles? No, wait. The problem says that the output is the number of ways to add t edges to form a cycle. But if the graph already has an odd cycle, then adding zero edges is a valid way. However, the problem says that the answer should count the number of ways to add exactly t edges. But if the graph already has an odd cycle, then adding zero edges is the only possible way. But how many ways are there? Because any existing cycle would count as a way? Or is it that the question counts the number of ways to add edges such that after adding them, there exists an odd cycle. But since the original graph already has an odd cycle, adding zero edges would be one way. However, the problem states that the answer for the second example input is '0 1' when the input is a triangle (which is an odd cycle). So in that case, the answer is 0 and 1. So that suggests that when the graph already contains an odd cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1. Wait, but why is it 1? Because the problem says that the ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then there's exactly one way to add zero edges. So regardless of how many existing cycles there are, the answer for w would be 1. Because adding zero edges is one way. So in that case, the answer is t=0 and w=1. So the first thing is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not bipartite, then t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: if the graph is bipartite, then find the minimal number of edges to add to make it non-bipartite. Otherwise, output 0 1.\n\nSo the next step is to check if the graph is bipartite. But since the graph may not be connected, we need to check each connected component. If any component is not bipartite, then the entire graph isn't bipartite. So the first step is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it is, then we need to find the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nNow, if the graph is bipartite, then adding edges to create an odd-length cycle. How can we do that?\n\nIn a bipartite graph, all cycles are even-length. To create an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges such that there's a cycle with an odd length. How to do that with minimal edges?\n\nThe minimal number of edges to add is 1 if there exists a component that is bipartite and has at least two nodes in each partition. Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle. Wait, let's think. For example, suppose a bipartition (A, B). If you connect two nodes in A, then the cycle would be: say, node u in A connected to v in A. Then the path from u to v through the existing edges (which is even length, since in bipartite graphs, all paths between two nodes in the same partition have even length) plus the new edge would make an odd-length cycle. So the minimal number of edges needed is 1. But only if there's a component where the two partitions have at least one node each.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges required to transform a given undirected graph into one that contains a simple cycle of odd length. Additionally, we need to count the number of ways to achieve this transformation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycles**: If the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, the answer is `t = 0` and `w = 1`.\n2. **Bipartite Check**: If the graph is bipartite, we need to add edges to create an odd-length cycle. The minimum number of edges required to do this is determined by analyzing the bipartite components of the graph.\n3. **Component Analysis**: For each bipartite component, calculate the sizes of the two partitions. The minimum number of edges needed to form an odd cycle is 1 if there exists at least one component with both partitions non-empty. The number of ways to add such an edge is the product of the sizes of the two partitions across all components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[u-1].append(v-1)\n        edges[v-1].append(u-1)\n\n    color = [-1] * n\n    is_bipartite = True\n    components = []\n    for start in range(n):\n        if color[start] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            color[start] = 0\n            cnt = [0, 0]\n            cnt[0] += 1\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v in edges[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        cnt[color[v]] += 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n                    else:\n                        if color[v] == color[u]:\n                            is_bipartite = False\n            components.append(cnt)\n\n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # Now, the graph is bipartite, find the minimal t and w\n    # t is 1 if there's at least one component with both partitions non-zero\n    # w is the product of (a_i * b_i) for all components, where a_i and b_i are the sizes of partitions\n    # But wait: no, because to create an odd cycle, we need to add an edge within the same partition of a component.\n    # So for each component, the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle is a_i * b_i (no, wait: no. Wait, in a bipartition (A,B), adding an edge between A and B is allowed, but it doesn't create an odd cycle. Only adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle. So for a component with partitions A and B, the number of possible edges to add is (size_A choose 2) + (size_B choose 2). However, since the graph is bipartite, there are no existing edges between nodes in the same partition. So the number of possible edges to add is (a * (a - 1) // 2) + (b * (b - 1) // 2) for each component. But the minimal t is 1, so we just need to count how many such edges exist across all components.\n\n    # Wait, but the problem asks for the minimal t. Since adding one edge is sufficient, t is 1. And the number of ways is the sum over all components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2). But wait, no. Because adding any such edge would create an odd cycle. However, the question says that the way to add edges must result in a cycle of odd length. However, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (say, A) creates a cycle. The length of this cycle is the length of the path from u to v in the original graph (which is even) plus 1 (the new edge), making it odd.\n\n    # So for each component, the number of possible edges to add to create an odd cycle is (a_i choose 2) + (b_i choose 2). However, since the problem requires the minimal number of edges (t=1), the answer is t=1 and w is the sum of these values across all components.\n\n    # Wait, but the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add exactly t edges. Since t is 1, the number of ways is the total number of such edges across all components.\n\n    # Let me recheck the example:\n\n    # First example input:\n    # 4 vertices, 4 edges:\n    # Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4. The graph is bipartite. Let's see the components. The entire graph is connected. The bipartition could be {1,4} and {2,3}. So a=2, b=2. The number of possible edges is C(2,2) + C(2,2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches the first output of \"1 2\".\n\n    # Second example input is a triangle (3 nodes, 3 edges). It's not bipartite, so output is 0 1.\n\n    # Third example input: 3 nodes, 0 edges. The graph is bipartite. Each component is a single node. But for a component with a=1, b=0, the possible edges is 0. So for three components (each single node), the total is 0. But according to the sample output, it's 3 1. Wait, this suggests that my previous logic is incorrect.\n\n    # Wait, let's think again. In the third example, the input is 3 nodes with no edges. The graph is bipartite. Each component is a single node. To create an odd cycle, we need to add edges. How?\n\n    # For a single node, you can't form a cycle. So, the minimal t is 3? Because to form a triangle, you need to add 3 edges. But according to the sample output, the answer is 3 1.\n\n    # So, this suggests that the previous logic is wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink the approach.\n\n    # So, the problem is: when the graph is bipartite, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle. The minimal t is 1 if there's at least one component with at least two nodes (so that you can add an edge between two nodes in the same partition). However, if all components are single nodes, then you need to add 3 edges to form a triangle. Wait, but how?\n\n    # Let's think again. If the graph is bipartite, then all its components are bipartite. For each component, if it has at least two nodes, then adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle. However, if all components have only one node (i.e., the graph is empty), then adding any edge between two nodes would not form an odd cycle. Because adding one edge creates a tree. Adding two edges creates a cycle of length 2 (but the graph is undirected, so it's a multi-edge, which is not allowed. Wait, no. The original graph has no loops or parallel edges. So, adding an edge between two nodes creates a single edge. Adding another edge between those two nodes is not allowed. So, to form a cycle of odd length, we need to have at least three nodes. For example, if there are three isolated nodes, adding three edges to form a triangle (which is an odd cycle). So, the minimal number of edges to add is 3.\n\n    # So, the problem is more complex than previously thought. We need to consider two cases:\n\n    # Case 1: There exists at least one component with size ≥ 2. Then, the minimal t is 1. The number of ways is the sum over all components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions in the component.\n\n    # Case 2: All components are single-node. Then, the minimal t is 3. The number of ways is the combination of choosing three nodes and connecting them in a triangle, which is C(n, 3) if n ≥ 3.\n\n    # So, the approach is:\n\n    # Check if the graph is bipartite. If not, output 0 1.\n\n    # Else:\n    #   Check if there is at least one component with size ≥ 2.
