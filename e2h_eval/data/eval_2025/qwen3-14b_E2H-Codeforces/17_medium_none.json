He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output needs to be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is to find a valid assignment that works for some s.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of some possible s. But since the actual s is unknown, how can I check that?\n\nLet me think: For any valid s, all the prefixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes (same lengths) are in the input. But the input contains exactly those 2n-2 strings. So the problem reduces to finding a way to assign each input string as either a prefix or suffix such that there exists a string s where:\n\n- All the assigned prefixes are exactly the prefixes of s (for each length 1..n-1)\n- All the assigned suffixes are exactly the suffixes of s (for each length 1..n-1)\n\nBut how do I find such an assignment?\n\nAn important observation here is that for the correct s, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be the first n-1 characters of s, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be the last n-1 characters of s. Also, for the full string s, the prefix of length n-1 and suffix of length n-1 must overlap in a way that their combination forms s.\n\nWait, but how can I use that? Maybe the idea is to find which of the input strings could be the (n-1)-length prefix and which could be the (n-1)-length suffix. Then, combining them, we can find the possible s.\n\nFor example, if the (n-1)-length prefix is P and the (n-1)-length suffix is S, then the full string s must be such that P + last character equals S's first n-1 characters plus the last character. Or wait, maybe s is the combination of the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nIf the prefix of length n-1 is P, then s is P + c, where c is the last character. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is S, which is the last n-1 characters of s. So, the suffix S would be the last n-1 characters of s. Which is s[1:] if s is length n. So, if s is P + c, then the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters, which is P[1:] + c. So, the suffix S must be equal to P[1:] + c. But since P is the prefix of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is P[1:] + c.\n\nSo combining the two, if we have a candidate for the (n-1)-length prefix (call it P) and a candidate for the (n-1)-length suffix (call it S), then the full string s would be P + c, where c is the last character. But also, S must be equal to P[1:] + c. Therefore, the last character c is S[-1], and also, P[1:] must be equal to S[0..n-2]. Because S is of length n-1.\n\nSo, S[0..n-2] = P[1..n-2], and the last character of S is c. Therefore, the full string s would be P + S[-1].\n\nSo, for any pair of (n-1)-length strings (one as prefix, one as suffix), we can check if they satisfy this condition. If they do, then s is determined as P + S[-1].\n\nOnce we have s, we can check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, assign accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs where one string is the (n-1)-length prefix and another is the (n-1)-length suffix. For each such pair, check if they can form a valid s as described.\n\n2. For each valid s generated this way, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n3. Once such a valid assignment is found, output the corresponding string.\n\nBut how do I find which input strings are the (n-1)-length prefix and suffix? Because the input has two strings of each length, including length n-1.\n\nSo first, for the input, we can collect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. For each possible pair (they can be same if the two strings are same?), but the problem says that the input is such that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So, for example, if n=3, the two strings of length 2 are the two possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut for the correct s, there is exactly one prefix of length n-1 and exactly one suffix of length n-1. So in the input, among the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nSo for our algorithm, we can take all possible combinations of selecting one of the two (n-1)-length strings as prefix and the other as suffix. For each such pair, check if they can form a valid s. Then, for that s, check if all the other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce such a valid s is found, then assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to check for all other input strings?\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (if its length is l, then check if s starts with that string) or a suffix (check if s ends with that string). However, since for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input. For the correct s, exactly one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo once s is determined, for each input string, we can check whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings must be a prefix and the other a suffix. So, for each length l, we need to make sure that exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to assign the labels (P or S) for all the input strings once we have s?\n\nOnce we have s, we can process all the input strings. For each input string, check if it's a prefix of s (of length l). If yes, then it's a prefix. Else, it's a suffix. However, since the input has exactly two strings for each length, and for each length l, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, this will work.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and suffix? For example, if the string is \"a\" and s is \"aaa\", then \"a\" is both a prefix and suffix. However, in this case, for the input, there are two strings of length 1. But since for the correct s, each length l has exactly one prefix and one suffix. So in this case, the two strings of length 1 must be the same, but according to the input description, the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings of each length. But if they are same, then for that length, both are prefix and suffix. However, according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So in that case, if two strings are same, then for that length, both are same, so they can be considered as one prefix and one suffix. But how to assign the labels?\n\nIn this case, when the two strings for a certain length are the same, then both can be assigned as P and S. However, the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment, as long as there exists at least one s that is consistent.\n\nSo, for example, if for a certain length l, there are two same strings, then in the correct s, that string is both a prefix and a suffix. So, in the output, for the two entries, one can be 'P' and the other 'S', but that would be allowed.\n\nBut how does this affect the code? Well, when we have s, for each input string, if it's a prefix, we can mark it as P, else as S. However, if the string is both a prefix and a suffix, then we can choose either. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can just assign as needed.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n and the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n2. Collect all the strings grouped by their lengths. For example, for each length l from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n\n3. For the two strings of length n-1, try all possible combinations (since there are two possibilities: one is prefix, the other is suffix).\n\n   For each such pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate):\n\n   a. Check if they can form a valid s. How?\n\n      The s would be prefix_candidate + (last character of suffix_candidate). But also, the suffix_candidate must be equal to (prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char). So:\n\n      Let me check:\n\n      Let s_candidate = prefix_candidate + last_char.\n\n      Then, the suffix_candidate must be s_candidate[1:].\n\n      Because the suffix_candidate is the suffix of length n-1 of s_candidate, which is s_candidate[1:].\n\n      So, for the suffix_candidate to be equal to s_candidate[1:], which is prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char.\n\n      But since the last_char is the last character of suffix_candidate, which is suffix_candidate[-1], we can compute:\n\n      last_char = suffix_candidate[-1]\n\n      Then, s_candidate would be prefix_candidate + last_char.\n\n      And then check if the suffix_candidate is equal to s_candidate[1:].\n\n      So:\n\n      if (prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char) == suffix_candidate ?\n\n      Yes. Because s_candidate[1:] is prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char. And that should equal the suffix_candidate.\n\n      So, for the pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate), we check if:\n\n      prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate ?\n\n      If yes, then s_candidate is prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1].\n\n      Once we have s_candidate, we can check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n      So, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with it) or a suffix (s_candidate ends with it). But for each length l, exactly one of the two strings for that length must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\n      However, how to check that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate?\n\n      For example, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or a suffix. But if a string is both, then it's okay to assign either P or S.\n\n      However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one s. So once we find a valid s_candidate, then all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n      Wait, but how? Because the input is given as the set of all prefixes and suffixes of some s. So when we generate s_candidate based on the (n-1) prefix and suffix candidates, it's possible that this s_candidate is not the correct one, but the input may have been generated from a different s. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., there exists at least one s. So for the correct s, the (n-1) length prefix and suffix would be part of the input, and the pair would generate that s. So perhaps, when we check for the pair of (n-1) length strings, if the pair is correct (i.e., they are the actual prefix and suffix of the correct s), then the generated s_candidate would be correct, and all input strings would be prefixes/suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n      So, the algorithm is:\n\n      For each possible pair of (n-1) length strings (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate):\n\n         Check if prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate.\n\n         If yes, then generate s_candidate as prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1].\n\n         Then, check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n         If yes, then proceed to assign labels.\n\n      Once such a valid s_candidate is found, then assign for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. Then, output the corresponding 'P' or 'S'.\n\n      But how to handle the case where there are multiple possible s_candidate?\n\n      The problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable. So once we find any valid s_candidate, we can proceed.\n\n      Now, how to implement this?\n\n      Let's think about the steps in code.\n\n      First, group the input strings by their lengths. For example, for each l in 1..n-1, we have two strings.\n\n      Then, for the two strings of length n-1, we can try both possibilities: first string as prefix, second as suffix; and vice versa.\n\n      For each possibility:\n\n         Check if the condition holds (prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate).\n\n         If yes, then create s_candidate.\n\n         Then, check for all input strings whether they are a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\n         If all are, then proceed to assign labels.\n\n      Once such a s_candidate is found, then proceed to assign labels.\n\n      Now, how to check for all input strings?\n\n      For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with it) or a suffix (ends with it). However, for each length l, exactly two strings are present, and exactly one of them must be a prefix and the other a suffix. But in the case where the two strings for a given l are the same, both would be a prefix and suffix, so we can assign either.\n\n      However, during the check, for each input string, we need to make sure that it is either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n      But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, once the s_candidate is generated correctly, all input strings must be prefixes or suffixes.\n\n      So once we find a valid s_candidate, we can proceed.\n\n      Now, the code steps:\n\n      Let's proceed step by step.\n\n      First, read n, then read 2n-2 strings.\n\n      Then, group the strings by their lengths. For example, for each l in 1..n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n      Then, for the two strings of length n-1, try both possibilities (which one is prefix, which is suffix).\n\n      For each possibility:\n\n         Check if the condition holds. For example, for prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate:\n\n         if len(prefix_candidate) == n-1 and len(suffix_candidate) == n-1:\n\n             last_char = suffix_candidate[-1]\n\n             constructed_suffix = prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char\n\n             if constructed_suffix == suffix_candidate:\n\n                 then s_candidate = prefix_candidate + last_char\n\n                 Now, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n      How to check that?\n\n      For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (ends with it). If for any input string, it is neither, then this s_candidate is invalid. Else, proceed.\n\n      Once we find such a valid s_candidate, then we can proceed to assign the labels.\n\n      Now, once s_candidate is determined, for each input string, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. However, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, for the input strings, we can process them in any order, but for each, assign 'P' if it's a prefix, else 'S'.\n\n      However, there's a possibility that a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if the string is 'a' and the s_candidate is 'aaa'. In that case, the two strings of length 1 are both 'a', and both are prefixes and suffixes. So, for the output, we can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S' (as per the problem's note, any assignment is acceptable as long as there exists a valid s).\n\n      So, in code, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\n      However, there's a problem: suppose a string is both a prefix and a suffix. Then, in the code, checking if it's a prefix would return True, and thus assign 'P', but the other string (same as it) would also be a prefix. However, since the input has exactly two strings of each length, and for the correct s_candidate, exactly one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But if the two strings are same, then they are both prefix and suffix. Thus, the code may assign both as 'P' or 'S' depending on the order. However, the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one valid s. So, even if both are assigned as 'P', but the code would have to make sure that for each length l, exactly one is 'P' and one is 'S'.\n\n      Wait, but the problem says that the output must have exactly n-1 'P's and n-1 'S's, because there are 2n-2 strings. But the output requires that the number of 'P's equals the number of 'S's, which is true since 2n-2 is even.\n\n      However, for each length l, there are two strings. For each of those, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each length l, one 'P' and one 'S' in the output.\n\n      Therefore, in the code, for each length l, when processing the two strings, one must be marked as 'P' and the other as 'S'. However, when the two strings are same, and both are prefix and suffix, how to assign?\n\n      For example, for a length l, two same strings. For the code, when checking if a string is a prefix, it will return True. So, for the first occurrence, assign 'P', and for the second, assign 'S'? But how to ensure that for each length, exactly one is 'P' and the other is 'S'.\n\n      But the code will process all input strings, and for each, assign 'P' if it's a prefix, else 'S'. However, if the two strings are same, then for both, the check will return True (as they are prefix and suffix). So, the code will assign both as 'P' (if checked in order), leading to two 'P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\n      Wait, but that can't happen. Because for the correct s_candidate, each length l has exactly one prefix and one suffix. So, for the two same strings, they must be the same prefix and suffix. Therefore, for the code, when checking for each of the two same strings, they are both prefixes and suffixes. But how can that be?\n\n      For example, take s_candidate = \"aaa\", n=3. The prefixes of length 1 are \"a\", and the suffixes of length 1 are \"a\". So, the input for l=1 has two \"a\" strings. Then, for each of these, they are both a prefix and a suffix. So, when the code checks each string, it will see that it's a prefix (True) and assign 'P'. But then, for both, we get 'P's, which would be invalid.\n\n      However, the problem says that the output can be any valid assignment. But how to ensure that for each length, exactly one is 'P' and one is 'S'.\n\n      This suggests that the code's approach of checking if the string is a prefix and assigning 'P' otherwise 'S' may not work in this case. Because for two same strings, both would be considered as prefixes, leading to two 'P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\n      Therefore, the approach of checking if the string is a prefix and assigning 'P' otherwise 'S' is not sufficient. We need to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n      How to handle this?\n\n      One way is: for each length l, collect the two strings. Then, for each of them, determine if they are a prefix or suffix. But since there are exactly one prefix and one suffix for each l, for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n      So, for each l, check which of the two strings is the prefix (i.e., the actual prefix of s_candidate) and which is the suffix.\n\n      For example, for l, the actual prefix is s_candidate[:l], and the actual suffix is s_candidate[-l:]. So for the two strings of length l, one must be equal to the prefix, and the other equal to the suffix.\n\n      Therefore, for each l, we can check which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. Then assign 'P' to the prefix and 'S' to the suffix.\n\n      So the code can be modified as follows:\n\n      Once s_candidate is determined, for each length l from 1 to n-1:\n\n          prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n\n          suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n          for the two strings of length l in the input:\n\n              if the string equals prefix_l → assign 'P'\n\n              else → assign 'S'\n\n      But since the input has exactly two strings of length l, and exactly one of them is prefix_l and the other is suffix_l, this will ensure that for each l, exactly one 'P' and one 'S' are assigned.\n\n      However, what if the two strings for a given l are the same? For example, if the prefix_l and suffix_l are the same (like in the case of \"aaa\" and l=1). Then, the two input strings are both equal to prefix_l (and suffix_l). So, for both, the check would be true. But since there are two strings, how to assign 'P' and 'S'?\n\n      In this case, since the two strings are the same, but the input has two of them, but for the correct s_candidate, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix. However, in reality, they are the same. So, for the code, we can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n      But how to do that in code?\n\n      For example, for a given l, the two strings are same. Then, for the code, when processing the two strings, the first one is assigned 'P' and the second 'S' (or vice versa). But how to track which one is which?\n\n      The problem is that when the two strings are same, the code can't distinguish between them. However, since the input has two entries, but they are same, but in the output, we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n      So, for each l, the code can check for the two strings. For each, compare to the prefix and suffix. Since exactly one of them is the prefix and the other is the suffix, but when they are same, then both are same as prefix and suffix.\n\n      So, in code, for each l:\n\n          collect the two strings of length l → list_strs.\n\n          prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n\n          suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n          for each string in list_strs:\n\n              if string == prefix_l → assign 'P'\n\n              else → assign 'S'\n\n      However, if both strings are equal to prefix_l (and also suffix_l), then both will be assigned 'P'. Which is wrong.\n\n      Therefore, the code needs to handle this case. How?\n\n      Well, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, for each l, the two strings must be either:\n\n      - one is the prefix and the other the suffix (could be same if prefix and suffix are same)\n\n      So, in this case, for the two strings, they are same, and they are both prefix and suffix. So, for the code, when processing the two strings, we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n      But how to do that in code? Because for both strings, they match the prefix and suffix. So, the code would assign both as 'P' (if checking for prefix first).\n\n      To resolve this, perhaps for each l, the code can check which of the two strings is the prefix. Since the prefix is unique (the first l characters of s_candidate), and the suffix is the last l characters. So for the two input strings, one must be the prefix and one must be the suffix. Even if they are same, but the code must assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n      Therefore, for each l, the code can:\n\n          collect the two strings of length l.\n\n          check if the first string is the prefix. If yes, assign 'P' to it, and 'S' to the other.\n\n          else, assign 'S' to the first and 'P' to the other.\n\n      But how to check if the first string is the prefix?\n\n      For example, for l=1, the prefix is s_candidate[0], and the suffix is s_candidate[-1]. If the two input strings are both equal to s_candidate[0], then they are both prefix and suffix. So, for the code, we can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n      So, in code, for each l:\n\n          prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n\n          suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n          list_strs = [str1, str2]\n\n          for each str in list_strs:\n\n              if str == prefix_l → it's a prefix.\n\n              else → it's a suffix.\n\n          but if both are equal to prefix_l, then one is prefix, the other is suffix. How to decide which?\n\n          Well, since the input has exactly two strings, and the code needs to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S', regardless of whether they are same or not.\n\n          So, for example, for the two strings of length l, if they are same, then one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, the code can assign the first occurrence as 'P' and the second as 'S'.\n\n      Therefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n      For each l in 1..n-1:\n\n          collect the two strings of length l → list_strs.\n\n          prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n\n          suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n          for each string in list_strs:\n\n              if string == prefix_l:\n\n                  assign 'P'\n\n              else:\n\n                  assign 'S'\n\n      But in the case where both are equal to prefix_l (and suffix_l), then the first one will be assigned 'P', the second 'S'.\n\n      This would ensure that for each l, exactly one 'P' and one 'S' are assigned.\n\n      Therefore, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\n      Now, putting it all together.\n\n      Now, the code steps:\n\n      Read n.\n\n      Read 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\n      Then, group the strings by their lengths. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the length, and the value is a list of the two strings of that length.\n\n      For example:\n\n      from collections import defaultdict\n\n      groups = defaultdict(list)\n\n      for s in strings:\n\n          groups[len(s)].append(s)\n\n      Then, for the length n-1, get the two strings.\n\n      For each possible pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate) in the two strings of length n-1 (there are two possibilities: first as prefix, second as suffix; and vice versa):\n\n          check if prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate.\n\n          if yes:\n\n              s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n\n              Now, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n              How? For each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\n              Wait, but how to check that?\n\n              For example, for a string in the input, say 'a', check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with 'a') or a suffix (ends with 'a').\n\n              However, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, once s_candidate is generated correctly, all input strings must be either prefixes or suffixes.\n\n              However, perhaps during the code, we need to verify this. For example, if the code generates a s_candidate that is invalid (due to some error in the selection of prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate), then the check would fail.\n\n              So, for each input string in the original list:\n\n                  if not (s_candidate.startswith(string) or s_candidate.endswith(string)):\n\n                      this s_candidate is invalid. break and try next pair.\n\n              If all pass, then proceed.\n\n              Once that is done, then proceed to assign the labels.\n\n              Then, for each input string, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. But as discussed earlier, for each length l, check which of the two strings is the prefix and assign accordingly.\n\n              So, for the output, we need to generate a string of 'P's and 'S's, in the same order as the input strings.\n\n              Therefore, the code needs to process the input strings in the original order, and for each, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\n              However, the code can't just check for each string if it's a prefix, because for the same string, which is both a prefix and suffix, the code may assign 'P' or 'S' depending on the order.\n\n              Therefore, the code needs to process the input strings in the original order, and for each, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. But how?\n\n              Wait, but the way to assign the labels is not based on the individual string, but based on the length. For example, for each string in the input, we need to know which of the two strings of its length is the prefix and which is the suffix, and assign accordingly.\n\n              Therefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n              For the output, create a list of 'P'/'S' of the same length as the input.\n\n              For each input string in the original order:\n\n                  l = len(string)\n\n                  prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n\n                  suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n                  if string == prefix_l:\n\n                      append 'P'\n\n                  else:\n\n                      append 'S'\n\n              However, this approach would work only if the string is either the prefix or the suffix of s_candidate. Which is ensured by the previous check.\n\n              But in the case where the string is both a prefix and a suffix (like in the example where s_candidate is 'aaa', and the string is 'a'), then the code will assign 'P' if the string is equal to the prefix_l. But since the string is also equal to the suffix_l, but the code checks for the prefix first, then it would assign 'P' for that string. However, the other string of the same length would be assigned 'S'.\n\n              So, for example, in the input for l=1, two 'a's. The code would check for the first 'a' and assign 'P', and for the second 'a' check if it is equal to the prefix (yes) and assign 'P' again. Which would result in two 'P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\n              But that's a problem. So, this approach is not correct.\n\n              Wait, but why? Because for the two 'a's, both are prefix and suffix. So, for the code to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S', we need to find for each string in the input, whether it is the prefix or the suffix for its length. However, since the code is processing the input strings in their original order, and for each, comparing to the prefix_l, which is the same as the suffix_l, the code would assign 'P' for both.\n\n              Which leads to two 'P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\n              So, this approach is flawed.\n\n              How to fix this?\n\n              The problem is that when the two strings for a given l are same, and are both the prefix and suffix, the code cannot distinguish between them. Therefore, the code needs to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S', regardless of their content.\n\n              Therefore, for each l, the code must process the two strings of that length and assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'. However, how to do that when the code is processing the input strings in their original order?\n\n              Perhaps, the solution is to pre-process for each l, the two strings, and for each of them, determine whether they are the prefix or the suffix. Then, when the code processes the input strings, for each string, it can check if it's the prefix (for its length) and assign 'P' or 'S'.\n\n              But how to determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\n              Well, for the code, once s_candidate is determined, for each l, the prefix is s_candidate[:l], and the suffix is s_candidate[-l:]. So, for each l, the two strings in the input must be exactly the prefix and the suffix. So, for each l, one of the two strings must be equal to the prefix, and the other must be equal to the suffix.\n\n              Therefore, for each l, the code can check which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n              For example, for l, the two strings are s1 and s2. If s1 == prefix_l, then s1 is the prefix, and s2 must be the suffix. Else, if s2 == prefix_l, then s2 is the prefix and s1 is the suffix. Else, if both are equal to prefix_l, then one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. How to decide?\n\n              But in this case, since the two strings are same, and the prefix and suffix are same, then both are the prefix and suffix. So, the code can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n              Therefore, for each l, the code can:\n\n                  collect the two strings (s_a and s_b).\n\n                  if s_a == prefix_l:\n\n                      assign 'P' to s_a and 'S' to s_b.\n\n                  elif s_b == prefix_l:\n\n                      assign 'P' to s_b and 'S' to s_a.\n\n                  else:\n\n                      # this shouldn't happen because the input is valid.\n\n                      # but in case of both being equal to prefix_l (which is same as suffix_l), assign 'P' to s_a and 'S' to s_b.\n\n                      assign 'P' to s_a and 'S' to s_b.\n\n              However, this requires that for each l, we know the two strings, and for each of them, whether they are the prefix or suffix.\n\n              But how to map this back to the original input strings?\n\n              The problem is that the original input strings are processed in their original order, and for each, we need to determine whether it is the prefix or suffix of its length.\n\n              So, perhaps the code can precompute for each l, which of the two strings is the prefix, and which is the suffix. Then, when processing the original input strings, for each string, if it's the prefix of its length, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\n              So, for example, the code can create a dictionary that maps each string to its label (P or S) for its length. But since there can be duplicate strings, this may not be possible. However, for each l, the code can process the two strings and assign labels.\n\n              Let me think: For example, for each l, the code can create a list of tuples (string, label), where label is 'P' or 'S'.\n\n              Then, when processing the original input strings, for each string, look up its label based on its length and its value.\n\n              However, if there are duplicate strings for a certain l, this approach would not work, because two different strings (same value) would need to have different labels.\n\n              Therefore, this approach is not feasible.\n\n              Another idea: for each l, the code can store the two strings and their labels. Then, when processing the original input strings, for each string, check if it is the first or second string in the group for its length, and assign accordingly.\n\n              But this depends on the order in which the group was created. For example, the group for l is stored as [s_a, s_b]. When processing the original input, a string may be s_a or s_b. So, during the initial grouping, the code can store the two strings for each l, and then, during the label assignment",
