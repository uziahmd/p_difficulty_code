He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that matches the assignments. And we have to output one possible valid assignment.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think the key is to find the correct string s that could be consistent with the given input strings. Once we know s, we can check which of the input strings are its prefixes and which are suffixes, then assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem says that there's at least one possible s. So maybe we can generate all possible candidates for s based on the input strings and then check which ones are valid.\n\nWait, but how to generate possible candidates? Let's think. For example, the correct s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes of s, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining certain strings.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input has strings like 'ba', 'a', 'abab', etc. The correct s is 'ababa'. The prefixes of this string are: 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab', and the suffixes are 'a', 'ba', 'aba', 'baba'. But the input includes all these, but in arbitrary order. So the problem is that for each input string, we need to decide if it's a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how can we find s?\n\nAn idea: The full string s must be such that for each of its prefixes (of length 1..n-1), they are present in the input. Similarly for suffixes. So, perhaps the correct s is determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. Wait, for example, the longest prefix is of length n-1. Similarly for the suffix. But since the input contains exactly two strings of each length, the longest prefix and suffix would be of length n-1. But for the actual string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, if we can find which of the input strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix, then combining them would give us the full string s.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the correct s is ababa (n=5). The longest prefix is abab (length 4), and the longest suffix is baba (length 4). So if we take the prefix of length 4 (abab) and the suffix of length 4 (baba), then the full string must be the combination where the first part is abab and the last part is baba. But overlapping in the middle. So the full string would be ababa. Because the first four letters are abab and the last four are baba. So the fifth character is a, which is the same as the fourth character of the prefix. So combining the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1, the full string is the prefix + the last character of the suffix. Wait, no. Because the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So combining them, the full string s would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix. But since the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], its last character is s[n-1]. So the full string would be s = prefix + (suffix[-1]).\n\nAlternatively, if we take the prefix of length n-1 (let's call it p) and the suffix of length n-1 (call it s), then the full string s must be p + s[-1], because the suffix starts at position 1. So the first n-1 characters are p, and the last n-1 characters are s. So the full string s must be p concatenated with s's last character, but also, the first n-1 characters of s must be p, and the last n-1 characters must be s. Therefore, the first character of s is p[0], and the last character is s[-1]. Also, the second character of s is p[1],",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying a valid string `s` that matches the given prefixes and suffixes and then assigning each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefixes and suffixes of the unknown string `s` are of length `n-1`. By combining these two, we can reconstruct the full string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the String**: For each pair of strings of length `n-1`, one is considered as the longest prefix and the other as the longest suffix. By combining these, we can form potential candidates for the string `s`.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: Check if the reconstructed string `s` is consistent with all given prefixes and suffixes.\n4. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid string `s` is found, determine which input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each pair of candidates as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        for j in range(len(candidates)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Reconstruct possible s\n            s_possible = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the reconstructed s is valid\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                if len(s) == 0:\n                    continue\n                if not (s == s_possible[:len(s)] or s == s_possible[-len(s):]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P and S\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    if s_str == prefix_candidate:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif s_str == suffix_candidate:\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # Check if it's a prefix or suffix of s_possible\n                        is_prefix = s_possible.startswith(s_str)\n                        is_suffix = s_possible.endswith(s_str)\n                        if is_prefix:\n                            result.append('P')\n                        else:\n                            result.append('S')\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: We identify all strings of length `n-1` as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing the String**: For each pair of these candidates, we attempt to reconstruct the string `s` by combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate.\n4. **Validation**: We check if the reconstructed string `s` is consistent with all given strings (both prefixes and suffixes).\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid string `s` is found, we determine the assignment of 'P' and 'S' for each input string based on whether they are prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential candidates for the unknown string `s` and ensures that the solution is consistent with the given constraints.",
