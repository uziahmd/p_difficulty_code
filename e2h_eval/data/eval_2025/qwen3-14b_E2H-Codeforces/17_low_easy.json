He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign each of these input strings as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings in order. The key is to find any valid assignment.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, the main idea is to find the correct string s that could be compatible with the given set of prefixes and suffixes. Once we know s, we can check which of the input strings are its prefixes and which are suffixes, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because the input gives all the prefixes and suffixes of s, but we don't know which is which. However, for the correct s, the set of given strings must include all prefixes and suffixes of s. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be present in the input, and same for the longest suffix. But since the input contains all possible prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by looking for the unique string that has all the required prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but how? For example, the correct s must have all the given strings as its prefixes or suffixes. But since the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes of s, then for s, the set of given strings must contain exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s. Therefore, if we can find a candidate s, then we can check if all the given strings are indeed prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the correct s must be such that:\n\n- The longest prefix (of length n-1) is present in the input. Similarly for the longest suffix. But since the input has two strings of each length, the correct s's longest prefix and suffix would be among them. However, for the correct s, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, the correct s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then the correct s would be P + last character of S. Wait, but that's only if the longest prefix and suffix overlap. Alternatively, maybe the correct s is the combination of the longest prefix and the longest suffix, but overlapping appropriately.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the correct s is of length n. Then, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0...n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1...n-1]. So, the first n-1 characters of s and the last n-1 characters of s. Therefore, if we take the longest prefix (let's call it L_p) and the longest suffix (L_s), then the correct s must be such that L_p is the first n-1 characters and L_s is the last n-1 characters. Therefore, the entire string s must be L_p + (last character of L_s). But wait, because the last character of L_s is the nth character of s. But the first n-1 characters of s are L_p, so the last character of L_s is s[n-1], and the first character of L_s is s[1], so the entire s is L_p[0] ... L_p[n-2], and L_s[0] ... L_s[n-2] = s[1] ... s[n-1]. Therefore, combining these two, the first character of s is L_p[0], the last character is L_s[n-2], and the middle characters are overlapping.\n\nSo, if we take the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), then the correct s must be equal to the longest prefix concatenated with the last character of the longest suffix. However, this is only possible if the longest prefix and the longest suffix overlap correctly. For example, the first n-1 characters of s and the last n-1 characters of s must have their overlapping part (the first n-2 characters of the suffix and the last n-2 characters of the prefix) match. So, for example, if the longest prefix is \"abab\" (n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but not their order. Our goal is to assign each string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with this assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` are both of length `n-1`. These two strings can be combined to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix, we can determine the original string `s`. This is done by taking the longest prefix (length `n-1`) and appending the last character of the longest suffix (length `n-1`).\n3. **Check Validity**: Once we have the candidate string `s`, we check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n4. **Generate Result**: Based on the checks, generate the result string with 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the longest prefix and suffix candidates (length n-1)\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all combinations of the two longest candidates\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for combo in permutations(candidates, 2):\n        prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate = combo\n        # Reconstruct possible s\n        possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Check if all strings are prefixes or suffixes of possible_s\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            if not (s == possible_s[:len(s)] or s == possible_s[-len(s):]):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now assign P/S\n            result = []\n            for s in strings:\n                if s == possible_s[:len(s)]:\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The longest proper prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`) are identified from the input strings.\n3. **Reconstructing String `s`**: By combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each string from the input is checked to see if it matches either a prefix or a suffix of the reconstructed string `s`.\n5. **Result Construction**: Based on the validation, the result string is constructed with 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes, ensuring the correct assignment.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the properties of the longest proper prefixes and suffixes to reconstruct the original string.",
