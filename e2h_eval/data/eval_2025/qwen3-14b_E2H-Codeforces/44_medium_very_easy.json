He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He wants to practice for exactly k days. Each day he solves at least one problem, and he must solve all problems in exactly k days. The way he does it is by splitting the list into k contiguous parts. Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima. Our task is to find the maximum possible total profit and the corresponding distribution of problems per day.\n\nHmm. So, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Because the problem seems to require splitting the array into k segments, and each segment contributes its max. The challenge is to find the optimal way to split.\n\nLet me think about the DP state. Let's say dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems split into j days.\n\nThe base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, but maybe I need to adjust indices. For example, dp[i][j] is the maximum profit for the first i problems divided into j days.\n\nThe transition would be: for dp[i][j], we can look back to some m < i, where the j-1th day ends at m, and the jth day is from m+1 to i. Then, dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m from j-1 to i-1 (since each day must have at least one problem).\n\nBut for n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this approach would be O(kn^2), which might be acceptable? Let's calculate. For n=2000, k=2000, then it's O(2000 * 2000^2) = 8e10 operations. That's way too big. Wait, but n is 2000 and k can be up to n. So this approach is not feasible for n=2000. So we need a better approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to optimize. Let's think again. What if k is small? But in the worst case, k is n, which would make the DP approach O(n^3) time. For n=2000, that's 8e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nHmm. So maybe there's another way. Let's think about the problem structure.\n\nAnother observation: since each day's segment is a contiguous block, and the profit is the maximum in that block. To maximize the total, we want to have as many high values as possible as the maxima of their respective segments.\n\nBut how to split them optimally?\n\nLet me think of the case where k=1. Then the answer is the maximum of the entire array, and the only possible split is [n].\n\nIf k=n, then each day has exactly one problem. The total profit is the sum of all elements.\n\nSo, the problem is somewhere between those extremes.\n\nAnother idea: since the maximums are additive, perhaps the optimal way is to split the array so that each split captures the largest possible elements as maxima. However, since the splits are contiguous, we can't just take the top k elements. For example, if the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], and k=3, the maxima are 5,6,9. Which is what the example shows.\n\nSo, how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: since the segments are contiguous and must cover the entire array, maybe we can use dynamic programming with some optimizations.\n\nLet me try to proceed with the DP approach and see if I can optimize it.\n\nThe DP[i][j] = max over m < i of DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut calculating max(a[m+1..i]) for all m and i is expensive. How can we precompute these maxima?\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum of a[i..j]. But for n=2000, this is O(n^2) space, which is 4 million entries. That's manageable. And for precomputing, we can do it with O(n^2) time.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions can be done with O(1) per step. So the DP would be O(kn^2) time.\n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, this would be O(2000*2000^2) = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python. Even if each operation is a simple addition, Python can't handle that in time.\n\nSo this suggests that the DP approach isn't feasible for the given constraints. Therefore, we need a better approach.\n\nWait, but maybe the constraints are not that tight. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, n is up to 2000, and k is up to n. So for n=2000 and k=2000, the DP approach would be O(2000^3) which is 8e10 operations. That's way beyond the acceptable time limits for Python. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: since the problem requires splitting into exactly k segments, and each segment's profit is the maximum in that segment. The maximum profit would be achieved by ensuring that the highest elements are each in their own segment. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the array has some elements that are larger than others. If we can split the array such that each of the top k elements is in a separate segment, that would give the maximum sum. But if there are more than k elements, then we need to choose the top k elements, and arrange the splits so that each of them is a maximum of their segment.\n\nBut how to arrange that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have the array sorted in descending order. Let's say the top k elements are the ones that we want to capture as maxima. Then, we can split the array so that each of these elements is the maximum of their segment. However, since the array is in original order, we need to find positions where these elements can be isolated as maxima.\n\nBut this approach may not work because the elements may not be in the right positions. For example, if the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], the top three elements are 9, 6, 5. But the example solution uses 5, 6, 9 as maxima. So the third day's maximum is 9, the second day's is 6, and the first day's is 5. So that's the top three elements.\n\nSo the idea is that the maximum total profit is the sum of the top k elements. But this is only possible if we can split the array into k segments, each containing one of the top k elements. However, this is not always possible. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and k=3. The top 3 elements are 5,4,3. To have each in their own segment, you can split as [1,2,3], [4], [5]. But that would have maxima 3,4,5. Sum is 12. Alternatively, maybe another split gives higher sum. Wait, but in this case, the sum of the top 3 elements is 5+4+3=12. Which is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nAnother example: array [3,1,2,4], k=2. The top two elements are 4 and 3. We can split as [3,1,2], [4], sum 3+4=7. Or [3], [1,2,4], sum 3+4=7. Or [3,1], [2,4], sum 3+4=7. So yes, the sum is the sum of the top two elements.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 3, 4], k=2. The top two elements are 5 and 4. How to split? Split into [5], [3,4] → sum 5+4=9. Or [5,3], [4] → same sum. So yes, sum of top two elements.\n\nAnother example: array [2, 1, 2, 1, 2], k=2. Top two elements are 2, 2. So sum is 4. Possible splits: [2,1,2], [1,2] → max 2 and 2. Sum 4. Or [2,1], [2,1,2] → same. So yes.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=3. The top three elements are 5,4,3. Sum is 12. The splits would be [5], [4], [3,2,1] → sum 5+4+3=12. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 5, 2, 4, 3], and k=3. The top three elements are 5,4,3. How to split? The splits would be [1,5], [2,4], [3]. Sum is 5+4+3=12. Which is correct.\n\nSo this suggests that the maximum possible total profit is the sum of the k largest elements in the array. But wait, how can that be possible? Because in some cases, even if you split the array, you might not be able to get all the top k elements as maxima. Wait, no, because the array is split into k segments. Each segment has a maximum. The maximum of each segment must be one of the elements in the array. So, the total sum of the maxima is the sum of the maximums of each segment. To maximize this sum, we need to select as many of the largest elements as possible as the maxima of the segments. But how?\n\nBut in the case where the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=3. The maximum sum would be 5+4+3=12. Which is indeed the sum of the top 3 elements. Similarly, in the example given in the problem statement, the sum is 5+6+9=20, which are the top three elements (assuming the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], the top three are 9,6,5). So that's the case.\n\nBut wait, what about when the array has duplicates. Let's take the third example in the input:\n\nInput is 4 2, array [1,2000,2000,2]. The output is 4000, which is 2000 + 2000. Which is the sum of the top two elements. So this seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: if the array is [1, 3, 2, 4], and k=2. The top two elements are 4 and 3. How to split? Split into [1,3,2], [4], sum 3+4=7. Or [1,3], [2,4], sum 3+4=7. Or [1], [3,2,4], sum 1+4=5. So the best is 7, which is sum of 3 and 4, the top two elements. So yes.\n\nBut here's a case where the top k elements may not be achievable. Wait, can there be a scenario where even though the top k elements are present, they cannot be all selected as maxima?\n\nLet's think of an example. Suppose the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], and k=3. The top three elements are 5,5,5. So the sum is 15. How to split into 3 days. One way is [5], [1,5], [1,5]. Maxima 5,5,5. Sum 15. So yes. So it's possible.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 5, 1, 5], k=3. The top three elements are 5,5,5. Split into [5], [5], [1,5]. Maxima 5,5,5. Sum 15. Yes.\n\nAnother case: array [5, 6, 5], k=2. The top two elements are 6 and 5. The best split is [5,6], [5] → maxima 6 and 5. Sum 11. Or [5], [6,5] → same. So sum is 6+5=11. But the top two elements are 6 and 5. So sum is 11. Which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum total profit is the sum of the k largest elements in the array. If that's the case, then the problem becomes much easier. Because we can just take the top k elements, and split the array into k segments such that each segment contains one of these elements. But how to split?\n\nBut how to ensure that the splits can be made to include each of the top k elements as the maxima of their segments.\n\nWait, but how can we be sure that the sum of the top k elements is achievable?\n\nBecause the array is processed in order. So for example, if the top k elements are in positions that allow splitting into k segments, each containing one of them.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible total profit is the sum of the top k elements. So the problem reduces to selecting the top k elements and arranging the splits so that each of them is the maximum in their segment.\n\nBut how to find that arrangement?\n\nBut how can we be sure that this is the case? Let's think of a counterexample.\n\nSuppose the array is [3, 1, 2, 4], and k=2. The top two elements are 4 and 3. So sum is 7. Which can be achieved by splitting into [3,1,2], [4]. Sum 3+4=7. So yes.\n\nAnother example: array [3, 4, 1, 2], k=2. The top two elements are 4 and 3. Split into [3,4], [1,2]. Maxima 4 and 2. Sum 6. Which is less than 4+3=7. Wait, but why? Because the split [3,4] has maximum 4, and [1,2] has maximum 2. But there's another split: [3], [4,1,2]. Maxima 3 and 4. Sum 7. Which is the sum of the top two elements. So in this case, it is possible.\n\nSo the key is to split the array into segments such that each of the top k elements is the maximum of its segment.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Find the k largest elements in the array.\n\n- Split the array into k segments such that each segment contains exactly one of these elements, and that element is the maximum in its segment.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nBut how do we know that such a split exists?\n\nWell, since the array is processed in order, and the top k elements can be arranged in such a way. For example, the first occurrence of the top elements can be used.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: once we have the top k elements, we can split the array into k segments by taking each of these elements as the end of a segment. For example, the first segment ends at the first occurrence of the largest element, then the next segment ends at the next occurrence of the next largest element, etc.\n\nBut how to ensure that each of these elements is the maximum in their segment?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have the top k elements sorted in decreasing order. Let's say the elements are sorted in descending order as x_1, x_2, ..., x_k. Now, the idea is to split the array into segments where each segment ends with one of these x_i's, and in each segment, x_i is the maximum.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the example from the problem statement: [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], k=3. The top three elements are 9,6,5. So the segments should be split such that each of these elements is the maximum of their segments. For example, the first segment ends at the first occurrence of 5 (the third element?), but in the example, the first segment is [5,4,2], which has max 5. Then the second segment ends at 6, which is the fourth element, and the third segment ends at 9.\n\nBut how to find the positions of the top k elements?\n\nAnother idea: the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements. So the problem becomes to find a way to split the array into k segments such that each of the top k elements is the maximum of their respective segments.\n\nTo do this, we can:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array. Let's call them the 'top elements'.\n\n2. Then, we need to split the array into k segments such that each segment contains exactly one of these top elements, and that element is the maximum in its segment.\n\nBut how to split them?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Sort the top k elements in the order they appear in the array. For example, collect all the positions where the top k elements are located, sorted in increasing order.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple elements with the same value, like in the third example where two 2000's are present, then we need to select the right ones.\n\nBut for the purpose of splitting, perhaps the way to split is to take the earliest occurrences of the top elements, so that they can be separated into different segments.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum of a segment is determined by the maximum element in that segment, if we can arrange for each top element to be in a separate segment, and ensure that no other top element is in the same segment, then each of those top elements will be the maximum of their segment.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose we have a segment that contains two top elements. But since they are among the top k, and the segment's maximum is the larger of the two. So if we have two top elements in the same segment, the maximum of that segment is the larger one. Thus, the other one is not contributing to the sum. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we need to have each of the top k elements in their own segment. But how?\n\nAh, this is the crux. If we can arrange for each of the top k elements to be in their own segments, then the sum of their values would be the maximum possible. But if there are more than k elements with the same value, then perhaps we can't split them all into separate segments. However, since the problem allows any split that meets the conditions, perhaps we can choose which ones to include.\n\nFor example, consider the array [5,5,5], and k=2. The top two elements are 5 and 5. We can split into [5], [5,5]. The maxima are 5 and 5. Sum is 10. Which is the sum of the two top elements. So even though there are three elements, we can select two of them as the maxima.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n- Take the k largest elements (possibly with duplicates) and split the array into k segments such that each segment contains exactly one of these elements, and that element is the maximum in its segment.\n\nBut how to find those segments?\n\nOne way is to find the positions of the k largest elements, and then split the array so that each of these elements is the end of a segment. For example, let's collect the positions of the k largest elements, sorted in the order they appear in the array. Then, the first segment ends at the first position, the second segment ends at the second position, etc.\n\nBut how to ensure that each of these elements is the maximum in their segment.\n\nWait, suppose that we have the positions sorted in increasing order. Let's say the positions are p_1, p_2, ..., p_k. Then, the first segment is from 1 to p_1. The second segment is from p_1 + 1 to p_2. The third from p_2 + 1 to p_3, and so on. However, this may not work if there's a larger element in the segment between p_i and p_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but since the elements p_1, p_2, ..., p_k are among the k largest elements, any element in the array is not larger than the k-th largest. Therefore, if we arrange the segments to end at p_1, p_2, etc., then in each segment, the maximum is the element at p_i, since any element in the segment before p_i is less than or equal to p_i's value (since p_i is among the top k elements).\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the array is [5, 6, 5, 7], and k=2. The top two elements are 7 and 6. So the positions are 4 (for 7) and 2 (for 6). Now, if we split the array into segments ending at 2 and 4. First segment is [5,6], max is 6. Second is [5,7], max is 7. Sum is 13. Which is correct. But suppose the array was [6, 5, 7, 5], and k=2. The top two elements are 7 and 6. Positions 3 and 1. Splitting into [6], [5,7,5]. Maxima 6 and 7. Sum 13. Correct.\n\nBut if the array is [6, 7, 5, 8], and k=2. The top two elements are 8 and 7. Their positions are 4 and 2. Split into [6,7], [5,8]. Maxima 7 and 8. Sum 15. Correct.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], k=3. The top three elements are 9, 6, 5. Their positions are 7, 4, 1. So sorted in order of occurrence: 1,4,7. So split into [1], [2-4], [5-7]. Wait, the first segment is 1 element (position 1), then from 2 to 4 (positions 2-4: 4,2,6), max is 6. Then from 5 to 7 (positions 5-7: 5,1,9), max is 9. Sum 5+6+9=20. Which matches the example. So the split is [5], [4,2,6], [5,1,9]. But the example's split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. Which also gives the same maxima. So the method of taking the positions of the top k elements and splitting the array into segments that end at those positions (in order) works.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array. Let's call them the 'selected' elements.\n\n2. Collect the positions of these elements in the order they appear in the array. For example, if there are duplicates, we can take the earliest occurrences first, or any, but we need to collect exactly k elements.\n\nBut how to collect the k largest elements, considering duplicates?\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: [1, 2000, 2000, 2], k=2. The top two elements are 2000 and 2000. So their positions are 2 and 3. Then, the split would be [1,2000], [2000, 2], sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the k largest elements in the array. How? Sort the array in descending order, take the first k elements. Then, collect their positions in the original array. However, if there are duplicates, we need to collect exactly k elements, possibly including duplicates.\n\nBut how to collect the positions of the k largest elements, considering duplicates?\n\nFor example, if the array is [5,5,5], and k=2. The k largest elements are 5 and 5. So collect their positions (say, 1 and 2).\n\nOnce we have the positions, sorted in the order they appear in the array (so, sorted in increasing order), then the split is done by:\n\n- The first segment is from 1 to pos_1.\n\n- The second segment is from pos_1 + 1 to pos_2.\n\n- The third segment is from pos_2 + 1 to pos_3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut how to collect the positions of the k largest elements?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Create a list of elements with their indices.\n\n- Sort them in descending order of value, and in case of ties, earlier indices come first.\n\n- Take the first k elements from this sorted list. These are the elements that will be the maxima of the segments.\n\n- Then, collect their indices in the original array. Then sort these indices in increasing order.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input:\n\nelements with indices:\n\nindex 0: 1\n\nindex 1: 2000\n\nindex 2: 2000\n\nindex 3: 2\n\nsorted descendingly (with tie-breaker of index):\n\n(2000, 1), (2000, 2), (2, 3), (1, 0)\n\ntake first two: (2000, 1) and (2000, 2). Their indices are 1 and 2. sorted in increasing order: [1, 2]. So the splits are:\n\nfirst segment: 1 to 1 (length 1) → [1, 2000]?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the indices in the array are 0-based or 1-based? The problem says the input is a_1, a_2, etc. So the example uses 1-based indices. But in code, it's easier to use 0-based.\n\nBut in the code, we need to process the array as per the input. Let's assume that the array is 0-based in code.\n\nIn the third sample input, the array is [1, 2000, 2000, 2]. The positions of the top two elements (2000) are 1 and 2 (0-based). So the split would be:\n\nFirst segment from 0 to 1 (indices 0 and 1): [1,2000], max 2000.\n\nSecond segment from 2 to 3: [2000, 2], max 2000.\n\nWhich is the correct split.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Find the k largest elements, with their positions.\n\n- Sort those positions in increasing order.\n\n- Split the array into k segments, where the first segment ends at the first position, the second ends at the second position, etc.\n\nOnce the positions are sorted, the splits can be determined.\n\nNow, the question is, how to find the k largest elements and their positions.\n\nIn code:\n\nWe can create a list of tuples (value, index) for each element in the array. Then sort this list in descending order of value, and for elements with the same value, in ascending order of index. Then take the first k elements. Then collect their indices, sort them in increasing order.\n\nOnce we have the sorted indices, we can compute the split lengths.\n\nFor example, the sorted indices are [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k], sorted in increasing order.\n\nThen, the first segment is from 0 to p_1 (inclusive). The number of elements is p_1 + 1.\n\nThe second segment is from p_1 + 1 to p_2 (inclusive). The number of elements is p_2 - p_1.\n\nThe third segment is from p_2 + 1 to p_3, etc.\n\nThe last segment is from p_{k-1} + 1 to n-1.\n\nBut wait, the split must be exactly k segments. Let's see:\n\nThe first split is from 0 to p_1 (length p_1 - 0 + 1 = p_1 + 1).\n\nThe second split is from p_1 + 1 to p_2 → length p_2 - (p_1 + 1) + 1 = p_2 - p_1.\n\nSimilarly, the third is from p_2 + 1 to p_3 → p_3 - p_2.\n\n...\n\nThe k-th segment is from p_{k-1} + 1 to p_k → p_k - p_{k-1} ?\n\nWait, no. Because the sorted indices are p_1, p_2, ..., p_k. Since they are sorted in increasing order, p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k.\n\nSo the first segment ends at p_1. The next starts at p_1 + 1, ends at p_2. The next starts at p_2 + 1, ends at p_3, etc. The last segment starts at p_{k-1} + 1 and ends at p_k. Wait, but p_k is the last index. So the last segment is from p_{k-1}+1 to p_k. But what if there are elements after p_k? For example, if the array is longer than p_k. But since the p_i's are positions of the top k elements, and we have exactly k elements, then p_k must be the last of those positions. But the array has n elements, which may be larger than p_k.\n\nWait, no. Because the top k elements could be anywhere in the array. For example, if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=2. The top two elements are 5 and 4, positions 0 and 1. Then the split is [0-0], [1-1], and the remaining elements (from 2-4) are not part of any segment. But that's impossible. Wait, no. Because the split must cover all n elements.\n\nAh, here's a problem. Because the current approach would split into k segments, but the last segment ends at p_k, but there may be elements after p_k. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is a critical error. So how to handle the rest of the elements after the last p_k?\n\nIn the example above, the array is [5,4,3,2,1], k=2. The top two elements are 5 and 4. Their positions are 0 and 1. So according to the previous approach, the first segment is [0-0], the second is [1-1], and the rest of the array (indices 2-4) are not covered. That's wrong. So the approach is missing something.\n\nAh! This shows that the approach is incorrect. Because the segments must cover the entire array. So the way to split must include all elements. Therefore, the previous idea of splitting at the positions of the top k elements is only valid if the last of those positions is the last element of the array. Otherwise, there are elements after that position that need to be included in the last segment.\n\nSo how to fix this?\n\nThe problem is that the current approach splits the array into segments ending at the positions of the top k elements, but there may be elements after the last such position. Therefore, the last segment must include all elements from the end of the previous segment to the end of the array.\n\nSo, the correct way is:\n\nThe sorted positions are p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k.\n\nThe first segment is from 0 to p_1.\n\nThe second segment is from p_1+1 to p_2.\n\n...\n\nThe (k-1)th segment is from p_{k-2} + 1 to p_{k-1}.\n\nThe kth segment is from p_{k-1}+1 to the end of the array.\n\nBut then, the kth segment's maximum must be one of the top k elements. However, the p_k is not included in this segment. So the maximum of this segment may not be among the top k elements. But this would break our assumption that the sum is the sum of the top k elements.\n\nThis suggests that the initial idea is incorrect.\n\nSo, this approach may not work. Therefore, the previous reasoning was flawed. Hence, the maximum sum may not be the sum of the top k elements.\n\nThis means that we need to return to the dynamic programming approach, but find a way to optimize it.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach.\n\nLet me define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i elements split into j days.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max for m in [j-1 ... i-1] of ( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1 ... i]) )\n\nThe base case is dp[0][0] = 0. For j=1, dp[i][1] = max(a[0 ... i-1]).\n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, this would be O(n^2 k) time. However, for n=2000, this is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there are optimizations possible. For example, when k is small, or when we can compute the max ranges efficiently.\n\nLet me think about precomputing the max_range[i][j] for all i <= j.\n\nYes, we can precompute a 2D array where max_range[i][j] is the maximum value in a[i...j], for 0 <= i <= j < n.\n\nThis can be done with O(n^2) time and space.\n\nOnce we have this, the DP can be computed.\n\nNow, for n=2000, the precomputation would take O(n^2) = 4 million operations. That's manageable.\n\nThen, the DP for each i and j would involve iterating m from j-1 to i-1, and for each m, adding max_range[m][i-1] (assuming that a is 0-based and the first i elements are a[0..i-1]).\n\nWait, for the first i elements, the indices are 0 to i-1. So for the j-th day, splitting into m elements and the rest i - m elements. So for dp[i][j], we look for m from j-1 (since each day must have at least one problem) to i-1 (so that the j-th day has at least one problem). The j-th day covers from m to i-1, so the max is max_range[m][i-1].\n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, the DP would take O(n^2 k) time, which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints are not as bad as that. For example, if k is small. But for the worst case, this is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to optimize. Let's think about the problem again.\n\nAnother observation: since the segments are contiguous and the max of a segment is the maximum of the elements in that segment, the DP can be optimized using certain properties.\n\nFor example, when considering dp[i][j], the optimal m for the split is likely to be somewhere near the current i. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that for each i and j, the maximum of the segment [m+1 ... i] is non-decreasing as m increases. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the problem of splitting the array into k parts to maximize the sum of maxima. There might be some greedy approach here.\n\nBut earlier examples suggest that the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements. But the earlier problem with the example where the top elements are not at the end of the array shows that this may not be possible. However, perhaps there's a way to adjust the split to include all elements.\n\nLet me re-examine that example. Take the array [5,4,3,2,1], k=2. The top two elements are 5 and 4. To include all elements, the split must be into two segments. One possible way is [5], [4,3,2,1], which gives sum 5+4=9. Another way is [5,4], [3,2,1], sum 5+3=8. Or [5,4,3], [2,1], sum 5+2=7. So the best is 9, which is the sum of the top two elements. So in this case, the approach of taking the top two elements and splitting the array into segments ending at their positions works.\n\nBut in this case, the positions of the top two elements are 0 and 1. So the split is [0-0], [1-4]. Which gives the correct result",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute a list of problems across exactly `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulties of each day's problems, is maximized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Preprocessing**:\n   - **Precompute Maximum Values**: We precompute the maximum values for all possible subarrays using a 2D array `max_range`, where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum value in the subarray from index `i` to `j`.\n   - **Dynamic Programming Table**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days. The recurrence relation involves considering all possible previous splits and using the precomputed maximum values to determine the optimal split.\n\n2. **Reconstructing the Solution**:\n   - After computing the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across the `k` days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        max_range[i][i] = current_max\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize dp table\n    INF = float('-inf')\n    dp = [[INF]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if j > i:\n                continue\n            for m in range(j-1, i):\n                if dp[m][j-1] != INF:\n                    current_max = max_range[m][i-1]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the solution\n    res = []\n    i = n\n    j = k\n    while j > 0:\n        for m in range(j-1, i):\n            if dp[m][j-1] != INF and dp[i][j] == dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1]:\n                res.append(i - m)\n                i = m\n                j -= 1\n                break\n    res.reverse()\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_range` array is filled such that each entry `max_range[i][j]` holds the maximum value of the subarray from index `i` to `j`. This allows quick lookup during the dynamic programming phase.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized with `-inf` to represent impossible states, except for `dp[0][0]` which is 0 (zero problems, zero days).\n\n3. **Filling the DP Table**: For each possible number of problems `i` and days `j`, we consider all possible previous splits `m` and compute the maximum profit by adding the maximum value of the subarray from `m` to `i-1`.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the Solution**: Starting from the end of the array and working backwards, we determine the split points by checking which previous split gives the optimal value, thus reconstructing the distribution of problems across the days.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible profit using dynamic programming with preprocessing, and then reconstruct the optimal distribution of problems across the days.",
