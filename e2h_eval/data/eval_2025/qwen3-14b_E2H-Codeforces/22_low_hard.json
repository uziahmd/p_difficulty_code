After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count all such students.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, the input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line represents a student's marks for m subjects.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThen the gradebook is:\n\nStudent 1: [2,2,3]\nStudent 2: [2,3,2]\nStudent 3: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 1 and 2 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 2)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 1)\n\nSo successful students are student 1 (subject 2), student 2 (subject 1), and student 3? No, wait. Wait for the first example, the output is 2. Wait according to the note, student 3 isn't best in any. So let me check again.\n\nWait for the first example:\n\nSubject 0: max is 2. Students 1 and 2 have 2. So both are best in subject 0?\n\nBut the note says student 1 is best in subjects 1 and 3. Wait maybe I have the indices wrong. Oh, the note refers to subjects as 1-based. Let me check the first sample input again.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223 → student 1's marks are 2, 2, 3.\n\nStudent 2: 2,3,2.\n\nStudent 3: 1,1,2.\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nSubject 1 (first column) has marks 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. So students 1 and 2 are best here.\n\nSubject 2 (second column): 2,3,1. Max is 3. Only student 2 is best.\n\nSubject 3 (third column): 3, 2, 2. Max is 3. Only student 1 is best.\n\nSo student 1 is best in subject 3, student 2 is best in subject 2, and student 1 is also best in subject 1. So student 1 and 2 are successful. Student 3 isn't best in any. Hence output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each subject (each column), find the maximum value.\n\n- Then, for each student, check if in any of the subjects, their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the next n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers. So for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\n3. For each column (subject), find the maximum value. So for column j, iterate through all students' j-th mark and find the max.\n\n4. Then, for each student, check for each subject if their mark in that subject is equal to the max of that subject. If any such exists, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut the input may be given as a single string, but in the example, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So in the code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: first line contains n and m, then n lines each with m characters.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then, for each of these lines, convert into a list of integers.\n\nOnce we have the data as a 2D list",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Grade Conversion**: Convert each row of the gradebook from strings to lists of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column), determine the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum grade in any subject. If so, mark them as successful.\n5. **Count Successful Students**: Count how many students are marked as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    gradebook.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\n# Find the maximum for each subject (column)\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\n# Check each student if they have at least one max in any subject\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if gradebook[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing the grades.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students' grades to find the maximum grade. This is stored in a list `max_per_subject`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if their grade in any subject matches the maximum grade for that subject. If a match is found, the student is counted as successful and we move to the next student.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum grades for each subject and check each student's performance against these maxima, leading to an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
