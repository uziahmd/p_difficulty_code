The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm, the key points here are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between any two districts. So the original structure is a tree.\n2. When we remove k districts, the remaining n - k districts must form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to choosing a connected subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i for its nodes. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to remove.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree? Since the sum is based on 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. Because 2^i grows rapidly, higher numbers contribute way more than lower ones. So the optimal strategy is probably to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring they are connected.\n\nWait, but how to ensure connectivity? For example, if we have a tree where the highest-numbered node is connected to others, but maybe some lower-numbered nodes are in the way. But maybe the best approach is to select a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and then decide which ones to exclude.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the maximum sum would be achieved by keeping the highest possible nodes. So perhaps the approach is to select the largest (n - k) nodes, but only if they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how can we check that? For example, suppose we have to choose m = n -k nodes. The optimal would be to include the largest m nodes, but if they are not connected, we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from them to make them connected. However, that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the tree is connected, maybe we can find a way to select the largest nodes while maintaining connectivity. Let's think about the tree structure. Since the value of each node is 2^i, which is very large for higher i, we need to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the idea is to select a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and possibly some lower ones if needed for connectivity. How can we do that?\n\nOne approach is to start with the largest node (node n), and then greedily add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But this might not work directly because the tree's structure may require including some lower-numbered nodes to connect higher ones.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all nodes except those with the smallest numbers, but ensuring that the subtree remains connected. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest possible nodes, the problem becomes similar to selecting a subtree of size m = n -k, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that includes the largest m nodes, and then check if they are connected. If not, we need to replace some lower nodes with higher ones that are connected.\n\nBut how can we efficiently find such a subtree?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the optimal subtree will consist of all nodes except the k smallest ones that can be removed without disconnecting the tree. But again, how to determine which nodes to remove.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding the minimal set of nodes to remove (of size k) such that the remaining nodes are connected. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, we want to remove the nodes with the smallest values. Because removing a lower-numbered node (which has smaller 2^i) allows us to keep higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the sum is the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes. So to maximize this sum, we need to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to remove the k nodes with the smallest values (i.e., the smallest i's) such that the remaining nodes form a connected tree.\n\nBut how can we ensure that when we remove the k smallest nodes, the remaining tree is connected? Because if we just remove the k smallest nodes, it's possible that the remaining tree is disconnected.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting the k nodes with the smallest values (i.e., the first k nodes in terms of their i values) to remove, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, this is not necessarily correct because removing certain small nodes may split the tree into parts, and we might have to remove some larger nodes instead to keep the tree connected.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal way is to keep",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans (sum of 2^i for each district) is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the fan count for each district is $2^i$, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: After selecting the highest possible districts, we need to ensure they form a connected subtree.
