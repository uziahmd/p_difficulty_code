The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. The output should be the k district numbers in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key points here are:\n\n- The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the initial structure is a tree.\n- When we remove k districts, their districts are removed, and we can't cross through them. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree.\n- We need to choose which k districts to remove so that the sum of 2^i for the kept districts is as large as possible.\n\nThe challenge is to find which districts to remove. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute more. So ideally, we want to keep the highest possible districts. However, the problem is that removing some districts might disconnect the tree, so we have to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component.\n\nWait, but how do we select which ones to remove? Because if we just keep the largest n - k districts, they might not form a connected component. For example, if the tree is structured such that the largest districts are spread out and not connected without passing through smaller ones.\n\nSo the approach needs to be: find a subtree with (n - k) nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: since higher-numbered nodes have higher values, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we try to keep the highest possible nodes, but ensure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother thought: this problem resembles finding a tree with (n -k) nodes that is connected, and has maximum sum. Since each node's value is 2^i, which is unique and increases with i. So the optimal solution would be to include the highest (n -k) nodes possible, but they must form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Suppose we want to keep the largest (n -k) nodes. But if those nodes are not connected, we need to remove some of them and include lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as selecting a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, starting from the highest, and then ensuring connectivity.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of finding a maximum spanning tree, but with the weights being the node values. However, since the tree is already connected, perhaps we can use some kind of priority-based approach.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. Since the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and their values are 2^i, which increases with i, the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how can we determine which nodes to include?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. Let's think of it as a priority-based selection.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as selecting which nodes to keep. Since we need to keep (n -k) nodes, and they must be connected. To maximize the sum, we need to keep the nodes with the highest possible values.\n\nBut how to ensure connectivity? One possible way is to perform a greedy selection, starting from the highest node and adding nodes in a way that maintains connectivity.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother idea: The problem is equivalent to choosing a subtree with exactly m = n -k nodes, which has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible nodes, we need to find a subtree that contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all nodes from some threshold upwards, but connected. But how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a process where we start with the highest node (node n), and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But how to efficiently do that?\n\nBut considering that the tree is connected, and that higher-numbered nodes have higher values, perhaps the optimal strategy is to include all nodes except the smallest k ones, but only if they form a connected subtree. However, this might not be the case. For example, if node n is connected only through node 1, then if we need to remove node 1, but that would disconnect node n from others. So in that case, we can't remove node 1 unless we also",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the fan count for district `i` is `2^i`, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be efficiently managed using a greedy approach with a priority queue (max-heap).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    # We want to keep the largest m nodes, but they must form a connected subtree.\n    # So we start from the highest node and use a priority queue to select nodes.\n    # We can use a max-heap to process nodes in descending order.\n    # We'll use a set to track included nodes and a priority queue to manage the selection.\n    \n    # Start with node n\n    included = set()\n    heap = []\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # Use a max-heap by pushing negative values\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n    visited[n] = True\n    count = 1\n    \n    while count < m and heap:\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        included.add(current)\n        for neighbor in tree[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n                count += 1\n                if count == m:\n                    break\n    \n    # Now, the included set has m nodes. The ones not included are to be removed.\n    # But we need to make sure that the included set is connected. However, since we started from the highest node and greedily added connected nodes, it should be connected.\n    \n    # Collect all nodes not in included, sort them, and output first k.\n    to_remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in included:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove[:k])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a tree structure represented as an adjacency list.\n2. **Greedy Selection**: Starting from the highest-numbered node (node `n`), we use a max-heap to explore the tree. This ensures we prioritize higher-numbered nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n3. **Tracking Included Nodes**: Nodes are added to a set as they are included in the connected subtree. The algorithm ensures that we include exactly `m = n - k` nodes.\n4. **Output**: The nodes not included in the final set are the ones to be removed. These are sorted and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by keeping the highest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity through a greedy traversal using a priority queue.",
