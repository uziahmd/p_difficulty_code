            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. So the first thing is to read those three tiles.\n\nThe problem says that after drawing some tiles, she must have at least one mentsu. The question is to find the minimum number of tiles she needs to draw.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each possible case of the initial three tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. If not, then check what's the minimum number of tiles needed to add to form a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I check if the current tiles can form a mentsu? Let's break it down.\n\nFor the initial three tiles, check if they can form a triplet (all three same) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit). If either is possible, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimum number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that among all the tiles (original plus added), there exists at least one mentsu.\n\nNow, the key is to find for the given three tiles, what is the minimal number of additions required.\n\nLet me think of possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The original three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: They don't. Then we need to find the minimal steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible ways to form a mentsu with the existing tiles plus some added ones.\n\nFor example, maybe adding one tile can make a triplet. Like, if two of the same tiles are present, adding another would make a triplet. Or, if there are two tiles in a sequence, adding one more to complete it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding two tiles can form a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the minimal number, we need to check all possibilities and find the smallest possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCheck if the current tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding 1 tile can form a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if adding 2 tiles can form a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nWait, but maybe adding 1 tile can form a triplet or a sequence. Let's think about all possibilities.\n\nLet me think of the possible scenarios for the initial three tiles.\n\nLet me take the third example from the problem statement: input is ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nOriginal tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p. These don't form a mentsu. But if you add 1p, then you have 2p, 3p, 1p. Which can form a sequence (1p, 2p, 3p). So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: if the initial three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would make a triplet (so 1 tile added). Or adding a 3m would make a sequence (1, 2, 3). So in this case, answer is 1.\n\nSo, the idea is to find for the current tiles, what is the minimal number of tiles to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible sequences and triplets.\n\nFirst, for the triplet case: if there are two same tiles, then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if there are three same tiles, but that's already a triplet.\n\nBut for the initial three tiles, if they don't form a triplet, but have two same tiles, then adding one more would make a triplet. So for example, if the initial tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding another 1m gives a triplet. So that's one tile needed.\n\nBut also, maybe adding another tile could help form a sequence. For example, if the initial tiles are [1m, 2m, 3m], then they already form a sequence. If the initial tiles are [1m, 2m, 4m], then adding 3m would form a sequence. So that's one tile.\n\nSo, for the problem, the approach is:\n\nCheck whether the current three tiles already form a mentsu (triplet",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking the current state of her tiles and determining the minimal additions required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **Check for Possible Triplet Formation**: If not, check if adding one tile can form a triplet. This is possible if there are two identical tiles in the current hand.\n3. **Check for Possible Sequence Formation**: Check if adding one tile can complete a sequence. This involves checking if there are two consecutive tiles in the same suit and determining if the missing tile can be added.\n4. **Determine Minimum Tiles Needed**: If neither a triplet nor a sequence can be formed with one additional tile, then check if adding two tiles can achieve either, which is always possible. Thus, the answer will be 2 in such cases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_tiles_to_draw(tiles):\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    # Parse the input into a list of tuples (number, suit)\n    parsed = []\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        parsed.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    def has_mentsu(p):\n        # Check for triplet\n        counts = Counter(p)\n        for key, val in counts.items():\n            if val >= 3:\n                return True\n        # Check for sequence\n        # Sort the list\n        sorted_p = sorted(p)\n        # Check if the first three are a sequence\n        if len(sorted_p) >= 3:\n            a, b, c = sorted_p[0], sorted_p[1], sorted_p[2]\n            if a[1] == b[1] == c[1] and (b[0] == a[0]+1 and c[0] == b[0]+1):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    if has_mentsu(parsed):\n        return 0\n\n    # Check if can form with 1 tile\n    # Check for possible triplet\n    counts = Counter(parsed)\n    for key in counts:\n        if counts[key] == 2:\n            # Need one more\n            return 1\n\n    # Check for possible sequence\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = {}\n    for num, suit in parsed:\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = []\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        if len(nums) < 2:\n            continue\n        # Sort the numbers\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n        # Check for possible sequences\n        # For each pair, see if adding one tile can make a sequence\n        for i in range(len(nums_sorted)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(nums_sorted)):\n                a = nums_sorted[i]\n                b = nums_sorted[j]\n                # Check if they are consecutive\n                if b - a == 1:\n                    # Need to check if there is a third tile in between\n                    # Or if adding one tile can complete the sequence\n                    # For example, a=1, b=2: need 3 or 0\n                    # But since the sequence must be 3 consecutive numbers\n                    # So if we have a and b, check if adding a-1, a+1, b-1, or b+1\n                    # Wait, for example, if we have 1 and 2, adding 3 would make a sequence\n                    # If we have 2 and 3, adding 1 would make a sequence\n                    # If we have 1 and 3, adding 2 would make a sequence\n                    # So in this case, if the two numbers are consecutive, then adding one more tile can complete a sequence\n                    # If they are not consecutive, but there's a gap of 2, then adding one tile in the middle\n                    # So for any pair, if the difference is 1 or 2, then adding one tile can make a sequence\n                    # So check if the gap is 1 or 2\n                    if b - a == 1:\n                        # Need a third tile that is a+1 or a-1?\n                        # Actually, if we have a and a+1, we need a+2 or a-1\n                        # But the third tile is already in the hand?\n                        # No, because we have only two tiles.
