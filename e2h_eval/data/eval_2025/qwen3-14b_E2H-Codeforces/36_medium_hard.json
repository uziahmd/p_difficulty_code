The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to calculate the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to be possible.\n\nFirst, the signal power setup needs to ensure that each town is covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. Let's think about how the towers can be arranged.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For a tower at position i, its signal power p must be such that it covers some towns. But the key is that each town is covered exactly once. Also, since the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p, which means that the tower's coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, because if p is the power, then the distance from i to c must be less than p. So for example, if p is 2, then towns i-1, i, i+1 are covered. Because |i - (i-1)| = 1 < 2, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that each town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. So for each such town, there's exactly one tower whose coverage includes it.\n\nNow, considering that the signal power can be set as needed, perhaps the arrangement of towers must form certain patterns. Let me think of possible valid configurations.\n\nFor example, if there's a tower at position i, then perhaps it's responsible for covering a certain range of towns. But how?\n\nOne possible approach is that the towers must be arranged such that they can be partitioned into ranges where each tower's coverage is responsible for exactly the towns in its range. For instance, maybe each tower's coverage extends to the next tower's position minus one. Like, if we have two adjacent towers, say at positions i and j (j > i), then the coverage of the first tower must not reach j, and the coverage of the second must not reach i. Otherwise, there might be overlapping coverage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be paired with their neighbors in a way that allows for their signal ranges to cover exactly their assigned regions without overlapping.\n\nWait, let's think of the example given. When n=5 and towers are at 2,4,5. The tower at 2 has power 2, which covers towns 1,2,3. The tower at 4 has power 1 (covers 4 only?), wait, no. If the power is 1, then |c - i| < 1 implies that c = i. So the tower at 4 with power 1 would cover only town 4. Similarly for the tower at 5 with power 1, it covers only 5. So that works.\n\nAnother example: when towers are built in 1 and 2. Then setting their power to 1 each: tower 1 covers 1, tower 2 covers 2. But then town 0 is not covered (since for tower 1, the signal reaches towns where |c -1| < 1 → c=1. So town 0 is not covered. Similarly for town 3, if there's no tower. Wait, but in this case, for n=2, towns 1 and 2 are covered. So that works. Which matches the first example where the answer is 1/4.\n\nSo, what's the condition on the tower positions? It seems that the tower positions must form a certain structure. For example, each tower must be responsible for a certain interval of towns, and these intervals must not overlap. Also, the coverage of each tower must not reach beyond the towns it's supposed to cover.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a valid configuration of towers. Let's consider the leftmost tower. Let's say the leftmost tower is at position i. Then, this tower must cover some towns starting from 1 up to some position. Since the tower can't cover town 0, the power must be such that i - p >= 0? Wait, no. The tower's coverage is |c - i| < p. So town 0 would be covered if |0 - i| < p → i < p. So to avoid covering town 0, the tower's power p must be ≤ i. Because if p is i, then |0 -i| = i, which is not less than p. So the tower at position i can have a maximum power of i, so that town 0 is not covered.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1, the tower at position j can't have a power larger than (n+1 - j). Because if p exceeds that, then |n+1 -j| < p → p > n+1 -j → j + p > n+1. So to avoid covering town n+1, the power must be ≤ (n+1 -j).\n\nBut how does this relate to the coverage of the towns?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid configurations of towers must form a structure where each tower is responsible for a segment of towns, and the segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n.\n\nFor example, for each tower, the range it covers must be [a, b], and the next tower starts at b+1. Also, the tower's power must be set such that it covers exactly [a, b].\n\nBut how to determine the possible ranges for each tower?\n\nLet me think of the tower's coverage. Suppose a tower is at position i, and it's responsible for covering towns from l to r. Then, the power p must satisfy:\n\n- For the left end l: |l -i| < p → p > (i - l)\n- For the right end r: |r -i| < p → p > (r - i)\nAlso, since the tower must not cover beyond r, the next town r+1 must not be covered. So |r+1 -i| ≥ p → p ≤ (r+1 -i).\n\nSimilarly, the previous town l-1 (if exists) must not be covered. So |l-1 -i| ≥ p → p ≤ (i - (l-1)) → p ≤ i - l +1.\n\nBut combining these, the maximum p can be is min(r+1 -i, i - l +1). However, since p must be at least max(i - l +1, r -i +1) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the minimal required p for the tower to cover l to r. For example, if the tower is at i, and it needs to cover from l to r. Then, the minimal p is such that i - p +1 ≤ l and i + p -1 ≥ r. Wait, that's the same as:\n\np must be at least (i - l +1) and (r - i +1). So the minimal p is max(r - i +1, i - l +1). And then, to ensure that the coverage doesn't extend beyond l-1 or r+1, the p must be such that:\n\ni - p +1 ≥ l → p ≤ i - l +1? No, that's not right. Let me re-express the coverage.\n\nThe coverage of a tower with power p is all towns c such that |c - i| < p. Which is the same as c ∈ (i - p, i + p). Since c is an integer, this is equivalent to c ∈ [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. So for the tower to cover exactly l to r, we need that:\n\ni - p +1 = l and i + p -1 = r. Solving these equations gives:\n\nAdding them: 2i = l + r → i = (l + r)/2. Which implies that l + r must be even. Also, p = (r - l + 2)/2.\n\nBut this would require that the tower is exactly in the middle of l and r, and p is (r - l + 2)/2. However, in this case, the tower's coverage is exactly l to r. So, for example, if l=1 and r=2, then i must be (1+2)/2 = 1.5, which is impossible. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible unless l and r are such that i is in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tower can be placed at i, and it's responsible for covering a segment [a, b], such that a ≤ i ≤ b, and the power p is chosen so that:\n\na ≥ i - p + 1\n\nb ≤ i + p - 1\n\nand also, that the coverage does not reach beyond a-1 or b+1. That is:\n\ni - p +1 ≤ a → p ≥ i - a + 1\n\ni + p -1 ≥ b → p ≥ b - i + 1\n\nAlso, to prevent coverage of a-1:\n\ni - p +1 > a-1 → i - p +1 ≥ a → p ≤ i - (a-1) → p ≤ i - a + 1 + 1? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. To ensure that the tower's coverage does not include a-1:\n\nThe coverage of the tower is up to i - p + 1. Wait, no. Wait, the coverage starts at i - p + 1 and ends at i + p -1. So for a-1 to not be covered, we need that a-1 < i - p + 1 → p < i - (a-1) + 1 → p ≤ i - a +1. Wait, solving for a-1 < i - p + 1:\n\na-1 < i - p + 1 → p < i - (a-1) + 1 → p < i - a + 2 → p ≤ i - a + 1 (since p is integer).\n\nSimilarly, for the right side, to prevent coverage of b+1, we need that i + p -1 < b+1 → p < (b+1) - i + 1 → p < b -i + 2 → p ≤ b - i +1.\n\nSo combining these, the power p must satisfy:\n\np ≥ max( i - a +1, b - i +1 )\n\nand \n\np ≤ min( i - a +1, b - i +1 )\n\nWait, that's only possible if the max and min are equal. Which implies that i -a +1 = b -i +1 → 2i = a + b → i = (a + b)/2. So again, this requires that a + b is even, and that i is the midpoint between a and b. Then p would be (i - a +1) = (b - i +1) = (b - a + 2)/2.\n\nBut this suggests that for a tower to cover exactly a to b, it must be located exactly in the middle of a and b, and the power is set to (b -a + 2)/2. Which makes sense. So this seems like a very restrictive condition. Therefore, the only way for a tower to cover a segment [a, b] exactly is if it's placed at the midpoint of a and b, and the power is set accordingly.\n\nBut then, how do we arrange the towers? For example, in the first sample input, when n=2 and towers are at 1 and 2. Each tower covers [1,1] and [2,2]. Which fits this condition. The tower at 1 is responsible for [1,1], so a=1, b=1. Then i = (1+1)/2 = 1. p = (1 -1 + 2)/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nIn the example given in the problem statement where towers are at 2,4,5 for n=5. The tower at 2 covers [1,3]. Here, a=1, b=3. i=2 is the midpoint. So p = (3 -1 + 2)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Which is correct. The tower at 4 covers [4,4], so a=4, b=4. i=4, p=1. Tower at 5 covers [5,5], p=1.\n\nThis suggests that the valid configurations of towers must be such that they can be partitioned into intervals [a_k, b_k], where each interval is covered by a tower at position i_k = (a_k + b_k)/2, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n.\n\nMoreover, the tower at i_k must be present. So for each such interval, the tower must be built. Thus, the presence of towers must form a collection of intervals that can be covered by towers in this way.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems that this structure is similar to a tiling problem, where each tile is a segment that can be covered by a single tower. For example, each tile can be of length 1 (covered by a tower at the same position with p=1), or length 2 (covered by a tower at the middle with p=2?), or longer?\n\nWait, for a segment of length m (from a to b where b - a + 1 = m), the midpoint is at i = a + (m-1)/2. But for that to be an integer, m must be odd. For example, length 1 (m=1): a=1, b=1. Length 3 (m=3): a=1, b=3. Then i=2. So for a segment of length m, it can be covered by a tower only if m is odd? Because the midpoint is an integer.\n\nWait, if m is even, then the midpoint would be a half-integer. Which is not allowed, since the tower positions are integers. So, for example, a segment of length 2 (positions 1 and 2) cannot be covered by a single tower. Because the midpoint would be 1.5, which is not an integer. Hence, in that case, you need two towers. Each covering their own positions. So, in this case, the only way to cover the two towns is to have both towers present, each with power 1.\n\nSo, this seems to imply that the valid tower configurations must be such that the towns are partitioned into segments of odd lengths, each covered by a tower at their midpoint. And each such segment must have a tower present.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towers (each with 50% chance) that can be partitioned into such segments. Then, the probability would be that count divided by 2^n (since each tower is present with probability 1/2).\n\nSo, the problem becomes similar to counting the number of valid subsets of {1, ..., n} where the subset can be partitioned into non-overlapping intervals, each of odd length, and each interval's midpoint is present in the subset.\n\nWait, but the subset must contain exactly the midpoints of those intervals. So for example, if there's an interval [a, b] of length m (odd), then the subset must contain the midpoint i. And for the entire subset, all elements must be midpoints of some such intervals.\n\nSo, the problem now is to count the number of such subsets S of {1, ..., n} that can be partitioned into non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, with their midpoints being in S. And each element of S is the midpoint of exactly one such interval.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about how to model it.\n\nLet dp[i] be the number of valid subsets for the first i towns (positions 1 to i). Then, we can try to find a recurrence relation for dp[i].\n\nFor the base case, dp[0] = 1 (empty set, which is valid for zero towns).\n\nNow, for dp[i], we can consider two possibilities:\n\n1. The i-th position is not included in the subset. Then, the number of ways is dp[i-1].\n\n2. The i-th position is included in the subset. Then, it must be the midpoint of some interval. Let's say that this interval spans from i - k to i + k, for some k ≥ 0. But since the interval must be within 1..i, and the length is 2k + 1 (which is odd). So the interval is [i -k, i +k]. However, since the interval must end at i +k ≤ n. But in this case, we're considering the first i towns. So for the current i, the interval must end at i. So for the interval to end at i, the midpoint is at i, and the length is 2k + 1. So the start of the interval is i -k, and the end is i +k. But since the end must be ≤ i, then i +k ≤ i → k =0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if the interval ends at i, then the midpoint is i, and the interval is [i -k, i +k]. For this to end at i, i +k = i → k=0. So the interval is [i, i], which is length 1. So the only possibility is that the current position is a single-element interval. But that's only one option.\n\nBut that can't be right. Because, for example, in the first sample input where n=2, the valid subset is {1,2}. For position 2, if it's included, then it's part of a single-element interval. But then, what about the first position?\n\nWait, maybe the idea is that when including position i as a midpoint, the interval could be of any length as long as it ends at i and starts at some position. Wait, no. Because the interval must be [a, b], with midpoint i. So i = (a + b)/2 → a + b = 2i. Also, since the interval must be within 1..n. So for the current i, if we want to have a segment ending at i, then the start of the segment is a = 2i - b. But since the segment ends at b = i, then a = 2i - i = i. So again, the segment is [i, i]. So that's the only possibility.\n\nBut then, how can there be a segment like [1,3] with midpoint 2? In that case, when considering i=3, the segment [1,3] would have midpoint 2. But according to this logic, when processing i=3, if we include 2 as part of the subset, then perhaps that's handled in the DP step for i=2?\n\nThis suggests that my initial approach is flawed. Because the DP approach for dp[i] considers only the first i towns, but the intervals can span across multiple positions. So, perhaps the recurrence should be different.\n\nLet me think again. Let's think of dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns (positions 1 to i). Then, for each i, we can consider whether the i-th position is included in the subset or not.\n\nCase 1: i is not included. Then, the number of ways is dp[i-1].\n\nCase 2: i is included. Then, it must be the midpoint of some interval [a, i], where a is such that (a + i)/2 = i → a = i. Which is again [i, i]. So this suggests that the only possibility is to take i as a single-element interval. But that's not sufficient for cases where there's a longer interval ending at i. For example, if i is the midpoint of a longer interval.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The interval [a, b] must have midpoint i. So (a + b)/2 = i → a + b = 2i. Also, since the interval must be entirely within 1..i, then b must be i, and a = 2i - b = 2i - i = i. So again, the interval is [i, i]. So that's the only possibility when considering the first i towns. But this contradicts the example given in the problem statement where the tower at position 2 is the midpoint of [1, 3]. How is that handled in the DP?\n\nAh! Because in that case, when considering i=3, the interval [1,3] has midpoint 2. So for the DP at i=3, the inclusion of 2 as a midpoint would require that the interval [1,3] is considered. However, in the DP approach, when we process i=3, we can't know whether 2 is included in the subset unless we look back.\n\nThis suggests that the DP state needs to account for the possibility of including a tower at position i and covering a range that includes previous positions. Therefore, the recurrence for dp[i] when including i as a midpoint must consider all possible lengths of intervals ending at i.\n\nWait, but the interval [a, i] must have midpoint i. Which implies that a = i. So that's not helpful. But this seems to suggest that the only way to have a tower at position i is to have it cover [i, i]. So how can the example in the problem statement be handled?\n\nIn the example, the tower at position 2 covers [1,3]. But according to the above logic, that would require that the interval [1,3] has midpoint 2. So when considering i=3, the tower at 2 is already part of the subset. How does the DP handle this?\n\nAh, perhaps the DP approach is not looking at the current position i as the end of the interval. Instead, when considering the tower at position i, it can be part of an interval that starts at some earlier position and ends at some later position. But how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, and when considering the i-th town, we can choose to include it as a midpoint of a segment of length 2k + 1, which would cover positions from i -k to i +k. However, since the towns are up to i, then i +k can't exceed n. But in the DP for the first i towns, we can't have segments that go beyond i. Therefore, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, and when considering whether to include the i-th town, we can look back to see if there's a way to form a segment ending at i.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. Let's think of the valid configurations as sequences of intervals where each interval is of odd length and is covered by a tower at its midpoint. These intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n. So, the problem is similar to tiling the line with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile is represented by its midpoint.\n\nFor example, a tile of length 1 is a single town, covered by a tower there. A tile of length 3 is three towns, covered by a tower at the middle. Etc.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is the same as the number of ways to tile the line from 1 to n with tiles of odd lengths. Each tile contributes exactly one tower (the midpoint), and the rest of the positions are not part of the subset (but they are not required to be present, since the subset is exactly the midpoints of the tiles).\n\nWait, but the subset S is exactly the set of midpoints of the tiles. So for each tile of length l (odd), the midpoint is in S. All other positions are not in S. So the problem reduces to counting the number of tilings of the interval [1, n] using tiles of odd lengths, and each tile contributes exactly one tower (midpoint) to the subset. Then, the total number of valid subsets is equal to the number of such tilings.\n\nBecause each tiling corresponds to exactly one subset S (the midpoints of the tiles), and each subset S that can be partitioned into such tiles corresponds to exactly one tiling.\n\nSo the problem becomes finding the number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] with tiles of odd lengths. Each tile is of length 1, 3, 5, etc. Then, the number of such tilings is the same as the number of valid subsets S.\n\nOnce we have this number, say f(n), the probability is f(n) / 2^n. Then, we need to compute this fraction modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the question now is: how to compute f(n), the number of ways to tile a line of length n with tiles of odd lengths.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence for f(n). For example, for n=1, there's only one way: a single tile of length 1. So f(1)=1.\n\nFor n=2, the possible tilings are:\n\n- Two tiles of length 1. So f(2) = 1.\n\nWait, but according to the first sample input, when n=2, the valid subset is {1,2}, which corresponds to two tiles of length 1. So the count is 1, which divided by 2^2 is 1/4, which matches the first sample.\n\nFor n=3, the possible tilings are:\n\n- Three tiles of length 1. (count 1)\n\n- One tile of length 3. (count 1)\n\nTotal f(3) = 2.\n\nWhich would correspond to the example in the note where for n=3, the answer is 1/4. Let's check: the note says that for n=3, the answer is 1/4. The total valid subsets are 2 (the two tilings). 2 / 2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4. Correct.\n\nSo the recurrence for f(n) is f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} f(n - (2k + 1)) }, but with base case f(0) = 1 (empty tiling). Wait, for each position, the first tile can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc., up to n if n is odd. So the recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{m} f(n - (2k + 1)), where m is the maximum k such that 2k + 1 ≤ n. But this can be rewritten as f(n) = sum_{i=1,3,5,...} f(n - i), with f(0) = 1.\n\nBut for example, f(1) = f(0) = 1.\n\nf(2) = f(2-1) = f(1) = 1.\n\nf(3) = f(3-1) + f(3-3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nf(4) = f(4-1) + f(4-3) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nWait, but this seems familiar. The numbers are following the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = 2\n\nf(4) = 3\n\nf(5) = 5\n\nf(6) = 8 ?\n\nLet's compute f(4):\n\nPossible tilings for n=4:\n\n- 1+1+1+1 → 1 way.\n\n- 1+3 → 1 way (tile 1, then tile 3).\n\n- 3+1 → 1 way.\n\n- 1+1+... no, wait, what about 1+1+1+1, 1+3, 3+1, and 5? No, 5 is longer than 4. So total of 3 ways. Which matches f(4)=3.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5, the sum is f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. Which would be the number of tilings. And indeed, the tilings are:\n\n1+1+1+1+1 → 1 way.\n\n1+1+3 → 2 ways (the 3 can be placed in positions 3-5 or 1-3? No, the tiling is sequential. So the first tile is 1, then 1, then 3. Or first tile 1, then 3, then 1. Or first 3, then 1, then 1. Also, 1+3+1, 3+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1, 3+3? No, 3+3 is 6>5. Also, 5-length tile: 1 way. So total 1 (for five 1s) + 2 (for 1+3 and 3+1) + 1 (for 3+1+1?) Wait, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nActually, the number of tilings for n=5 is:\n\n- All 1s: 1 way.\n\n- One tile of 3 and two tiles of 1: the 3 can be placed in positions 1-3, then 4-5 as two 1s; or 2-4, then 1 and 5; or 3-5, then 1 and 2. So three ways?\n\nWait, no. The tiling is a sequence of tiles. So the 3-length tile can be placed in the first three positions, then the remaining two positions as two 1s. Or the 3-length tile can be placed in positions 2-4, then the first and fifth positions. Or the 3-length tile can be placed in positions 3-5, then the first two positions. So that's three possibilities.\n\nAdditionally, there's the 5-length tile (1 way). Also, there's the case of one 1 and one 3 and another 1. Wait, that's the same as the three possibilities above.\n\nThen there's the case of two 3s? No, 3+3=6>5. What about a 1 and a 3 and another 1? That's already counted. What about a 1 and a 1 and a 3? Same as before.\n\nWait, but what about a tile of length 5 (1 way). So total tilings are 1 (all 1s) + 3 (one 3 and two 1s) + 1 (one 5) = 5. Which matches f(5) = 5.\n\nSo the recurrence seems to be f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... until the argument is >=0.\n\nBut this recurrence looks like f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = 2\n\nf(4) = 3\n\nf(5) = 5\n\nf(6) = 8 ?\n\nYes. Because f(6) = f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Which is the same as f(6) = f(5) + f(4) (since 5 + 3 = 8). Wait, f(4) is 3. So 5 + 3 = 8. But according to the previous recurrence, it's f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Which equals f(5) + f(4) (since 5 + 3 = 8). Interesting. So perhaps there's a simpler recurrence here.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf we look at the values:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = 2 = f(2) + f(1) ?\n\nYes, 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nf(4) = 3 = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nf(5) = 5 = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nf(6) = 8 = f(5) + f(4) = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nSo it seems that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nBut wait, why?\n\nLet me think: the original recurrence was f(n) = sum_{k} f(n - (2k+1)), where 2k+1 is the length of the first tile. But for the first tile, it can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc. So the sum is f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut according to our previous calculations, this sum equals f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nHow?\n\nLet me think of f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Because for example, for f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBut according to the original sum, it's f(3-1) + f(3-3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is the same as f(2) + f(1) ?\n\nWait, f(0) is 1, f(1) is 1. So yes. But how does this relate to the general case?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Let's see if that holds for the original sum.\n\nAssume that for all m < n, f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2).\n\nThen, for f(n) according to the original sum:\n\nsum_{k} f(n - (2k+1)) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut according to the Fibonacci-like recurrence, this sum should equal f(n-1) + f(n-2). How?\n\nLet me think for n ≥ 2.\n\nLet me write the sum for f(n) as follows:\n\nsum_{k} f(n - (2k+1)) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut according to the Fibonacci recurrence, this should be equal to f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nSo, if we can show that f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... = f(n-2) - f(n-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me take n=3. The sum is f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. According to the Fibonacci recurrence, it's f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. So yes.\n\nFor n=4: sum is f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. According to the Fibonacci recurrence, it's f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Yes.\n\nFor n=5: sum is f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. According to the Fibonacci recurrence, it's f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Yes.\n\nSo it seems that the sum for the original recurrence equals f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe there's a way to prove that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 1, with base cases f(0)=1, f(1)=1.\n\nLet me think of the tiling problem. The number of ways to tile a line of length n with tiles of odd lengths.\n\nConsider the first tile. It can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc. If the first tile is of length 1, then the remaining is n-1. If the first tile is of length 3, then the remaining is n-3. And so on.\n\nBut according to the Fibonacci-like recurrence, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). How can that be derived?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way to think about it. Suppose that for any tiling, the last tile can be of length 1 or of length ≥ 3. But this may not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a bijection between the tilings counted by f(n) and the Fibonacci numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence here is shifted.\n\nLet me check the values:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13\n...\n\nYes, this looks like the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 2, etc. Wait, no. The standard Fibonacci sequence is:\n\nF(0)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. This can be reduced to a tiling problem where each valid configuration corresponds to a tiling of the line with tiles of odd lengths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid tilings of length n using tiles of odd lengths. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to tile the first `i` towns.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The key insight is that the number of ways to tile a line of length `n` using tiles of odd lengths follows the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each tiling can end with a tile of length 1 or any other odd length, leading to the recurrence relation `dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute dp up to n\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute 1 / 2^n mod MOD\n    inv_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_2n = pow(inv_2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (dp[n] * inv_2n) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: We initialize `dp[0]` to 1 as the base case (an empty tiling). For `dp[1]`, there's exactly one way to tile a single town.\n2. **Filling DP Array**: Using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`, we fill the DP array up to `n`. This relation comes from considering the last tile added to the tiling, which can either be of length 1 or 2 (leading to the Fibonacci-like structure).\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: To compute the probability, we need the modular inverse of `2^n` modulo 998244353. This is done using Fermat's Little Theorem, which allows us to compute the inverse using exponentiation.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by multiplying the number of valid tilings `dp[n]` by the modular inverse of `2^n` and taking modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring it handles large values of `n` up to 200,000 efficiently.",
