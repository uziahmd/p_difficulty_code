He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So for a given n, the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the main idea here is to find all n's where this count equals m. But how do I find those n's efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but why? Let's check:\n\nFor n=5: 5/5 = 1 → 1 zero. So yes. For n=6, same as 5, because 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. Similarly for 7,8,9. So when you reach 10, which is 10/5=2, so the count becomes 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence, those five numbers.\n\nSo the question is, for a given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, how to find those n's?\n\nThe approach I can think of is to first find the possible range of n's that could give exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a larger number can't decrease the count of 5s. So for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more.\n\nWait, but when n crosses a multiple of 5, then f(n) increases. For example, when n is 5, it adds one. At 25, it adds two (since 25 contributes two 5s). So the function is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that have exactly m zeros. But how to find them?\n\nThe key is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count. But wait, maybe there's no such n. For example, if m is 5, but there's no n such that f(n) equals 5. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for example, let's see. Let's compute f(24): 24/5=4, 24/25=0 → total 4. f(25) is 25/5 + 25/25 = 5 +1 =6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there is no n where f(n) is 5. So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is, for a given m, find all n such that f(n) = m. But how?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Then check if there's a range of numbers where f(n) remains m. But since f(n) is non-decreasing, once it increases beyond m, there's no more numbers. So the maximum n where f(n) = m is the number before the next step where f(n) increases.\n\nBut how to find if such numbers exist?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 numbers. Wait, the sample shows 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nBecause when you have a number that's not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't change the count. For example, 5! has 1 zero. 6! is 6*5! so it's 720, which also has 1 zero. So for numbers between 5 and 9, they all have 1 zero. So the count of numbers is 5 (from 5 to 9 inclusive). So the length of the range is 5.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) = m?\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- First, find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Let's call it left.\n\n- Then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   This function is non-decreasing as $ n $ increases.\n\n2. **Finding Valid Ranges**: For a given $ m $, we need to find all $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $. This can be done by finding the smallest $ n $ where $ f(n) = m $ and checking the subsequent values until $ f(n) $ increases beyond $ m $.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest $ n $ for which $ f(n) = m $, we use binary search. This helps in reducing the search space significantly.\n\n4. **Range Validation**: Once the smallest $ n $ is found, we check consecutive values to see how many numbers have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    # Find the lower bound where count_zeros == m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    lower = left\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        return []\n    # Now find upper bound\n    upper = lower\n    while count_zeros(upper) == m:\n        upper += 1\n    return list(range(lower, upper))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m_values = list(map(int, input))\n    results = []\n    for m in m_values:\n        ns = find_n_values(m)\n        results.append(str(len(ns)))\n        if len(ns) > 0:\n            results.append(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n        else:\n            results.append('')\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ using the formula described.\n\n2. **find_n_values Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $. It then checks consecutive values to find the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Function**: Reads input values, processes each $ m $ to find valid $ n $ values, and formats the output as required. If no valid $ n $ values are found, it returns 0 followed by an empty list.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search and direct validation, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
