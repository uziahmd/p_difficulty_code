He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factorial is divisible by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization. But since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s in the factors of the numbers up to n.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero. Let's call this function Z(n).\n\nThe problem is, given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m. Then output the count and the numbers sorted.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me take the example given. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nZ(5) = 1 (5/5=1). Then for 6, it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then at 10, Z(10) is 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0). So between 5-9, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe other counts?\n\nWait, but how can there be multiple n's with the same Z(n)? Because when you increase n by 1, sometimes Z(n) increases by 1, sometimes more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then Z(n) increases by 1. But when it's a multiple of 25, it increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for example, when you cross 25, Z(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between 25 and 24, the Z increases by 2. So for m=6, there would be numbers from 25 up to some point where Z increases again. Wait, but for numbers after 25, like 26, Z(26) is same as Z(25) because adding 26 doesn't add any 5s. So Z(25) = 6, Z(26) = 6, Z(27)=6, etc., until 30. Then Z(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So for m=6, the numbers are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. That's five numbers again. So that suggests that for each m, there can be either 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of possible n's is either 0, 1, or 5. Because when the count of trailing zeros increases by more than 1, there's a gap. For example, if there's a number n where Z(n) increases by 2, then there's a m that's skipped. For example, suppose m is 5. Let's see:\n\nLooking for Z(n) = 5. Let's find n.\n\nFor n=24: Z(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25: 25//5 + 25//25 = 5+1=6. So there's no n where Z(n) is 5. So for m=5, the answer is 0. So that's a case where there are zero numbers.\n\nBut how do we find for a given m, whether there are any n's, and how many?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that Z(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have Z(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n with Z(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n where Z(n) equals m.\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the range of `n` values that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product, which is given by the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s. This count can be calculated using the formula: \n   $$\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the range of `n` values that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search to determine the lower and upper bounds of such `n`.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For a given `m`, if there is no valid `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, the result is zero. Otherwise, the valid `n` values form a contiguous range of up to 5 numbers due to the nature of the trailing zero calculation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_upper(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low - 1\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_lower(m)\n    upper = find_upper(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = upper - lower + 1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` using the formula mentioned.\n2. **find_lower(m)**: Uses binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n3. **find_upper(m)**: Uses binary search to find the largest `n` such that `Z(n) <= m`.\n4. **main()**: Reads input `m`, determines the valid range of `n` values using the helper functions, and prints the results. If no valid `n` is found, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count followed by the valid `n` values in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
