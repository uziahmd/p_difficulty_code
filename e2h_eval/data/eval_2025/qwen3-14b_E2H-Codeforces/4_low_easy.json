The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences can be up to 1000 characters long each. But n can be as big as 2e9, which is a huge number. So simulating each round step by step is impossible because that would take O(n) time, which is way too slow for n up to 2e9.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's think about the cycles. Since both players are repeating their sequences cyclically, the pattern of their moves will repeat after the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. For example, if A has length m and B has length k, then after LCM(m, k) rounds, the same pair of moves will be repeated again. So, the idea is to find out how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and then compute the number of losses in one full cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, I need to compute for each round in the cycle (from 0 to LCM(m, k) - 1) what the outcome is. However, even LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000 each, their LCM can be up to 1000*1000=1e6). So for each possible round in the cycle, we can precompute the outcome, then find how many times each outcome occurs in a full cycle.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it lcm_length.\n2. For each round i from 0 to lcm_length - 1:\n   a. Find the move of A: A[i % m]\n   b. Find the move of B: B[i % k]\n   c. Determine who wins (if any) in this round.\n   d. Keep counts of how many times Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gains a spot) and vice versa.\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // lcm_length.\n   The remaining rounds are remainder = n % lcm_length.\n4. Multiply the counts from one cycle by total_cycles.\n5. Then, process the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle to add the additional losses.\n6. Sum all these to get the total number of losses for each player.\n\nBut how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but for Python versions before 3.5, maybe not. However, since the code needs to run in the environment where it's allowed, assuming that math.gcd exists. Also, note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but for Python 3.5 and above, math.gcd exists. So let's proceed.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Compute m = len(A), k = len(B)\n- Compute LCM(m, k) as lcm = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n- Then, for each i in 0 to lcm-1:\n   get A's move: A[i % m], B's move: B[i % k]\n   determine the result of this round.\n   count the number of times Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gets a spot) and vice versa.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (remainder = n % lcm_length), process each of those rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and add their contributions.\n\nNow, how to determine who wins in each round.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (R beats S)\n- Scissors beat paper (S beats P)\n- Paper beats rock (P beats R)\n- Else, it's a draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), where a is Nikephoros's move and b is Polycarpus's move, determine if a beats b, or vice versa.\n\nLet me think of a helper function that returns (nikephoros_loss, polycarpus_loss) for a single round.\n\nFor example, if a is R and b is S: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarp",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that both players use cyclic strategies. The challenge is to avoid simulating each round individually due to the potentially enormous number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic strategies, their move sequences repeat after certain intervals. The combined cycle length for both players is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one full cycle (LCM of the sequence lengths), determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) and count the number of losses for each player.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and how many remaining rounds are left after these full cycles. Use the precomputed counts for full cycles and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef determine_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute for one full LCM cycle\n    nikephoros_loss = 0\n    polycarpus_loss = 0\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        dl, pl = determine_outcome(a, b)\n        nikephoros_loss += dl\n        polycarpus_loss += pl\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nike = total_cycles * nikephoros_loss\n    total_poly = total_cycles * polycarpus_loss\n    \n    # Process the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        dl, pl = determine_outcome(a, b)\n        total_nike += dl\n        total_poly += pl\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is calculated to determine the combined cycle length.\n3. **Outcome Determination**: For each round within one LCM cycle, the outcome is determined and the number of losses for each player is counted.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: The number of full cycles is calculated, and the losses from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: The remaining rounds after full cycles are processed individually to compute additional losses.\n6. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the cyclic nature of the sequences, ensuring the solution runs in a time complexity that is manageable even for very large values of `n`.",
