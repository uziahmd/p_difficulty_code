The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The key points are:\n\n- Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. So for round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A.\n- Similarly, Polycarpus uses B cyclically. So for round i, his move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n- For each round, determine who wins. If there's a winner, the loser gets a spot. If it's a draw, nothing happens.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently for n up to 2e9. Since n can be very large, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, find for each round i (from 0 to n-1) what moves each player makes. Then determine who wins. But for n up to 2e9, we can't iterate each round. So we need to find patterns or cycles that repeat, and calculate the total number of wins for each player over those cycles.\n\nSo the idea is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = l. Then, the pattern of moves for both players repeats every l rounds. Because after l rounds, both sequences A and B would have completed an integer number of cycles, so their moves would start repeating.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it l. The total number of rounds in a full cycle is l.\n\n2. Compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and the remaining rounds after that.\n\n3. For each full cycle, calculate the number of times Nikephoros loses (which is the number of times he loses in l rounds) and similarly for Polycarpus. Multiply by the number of full cycles.\n\n4. Then, process the remaining (n % l) rounds, adding to the counts.\n\nBut first, I need to compute for each round in the LCM cycle, how many times each loses. But even for l, which could be up to m*k (since m and k are up to 1000 each, l can be up to 1e6). So for m and k up to 1000, l can be up to 1e6. Which is manageable because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCompute the number of full cycles: total_cycles = n // l\n\nremaining_rounds = n % l\n\nThen, for each full cycle, compute the number of losses for each player. Multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, compute the number of losses in the first remaining_rounds rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the number of losses in one full cycle?\n\nFor each round in 0..l-1, we can compute the moves of A and B, compare them, and count the losses.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to l-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins. If a wins, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. If b wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. Else, nothing.\n\nSo for each i in the cycle, we can precompute whether it's a loss for Nikephoros, a loss for Polycarpus, or none.\n\nOnce we have that, for the full cycles, we can multiply the counts by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds, we check each of the first remaining_rounds rounds in the cycle and add the counts.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the LCM of m and k.\n\nTo compute LCM, I can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b).\n\nSo, first, compute GCD of m and k.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n, then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute l = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, precompute for each of the l rounds, the number of times each player loses in that round.\n\nBut for each of the l rounds, we can compute the moves and check the outcome.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to l-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nCheck the outcome between a and b.\n\nSo, for each such pair, we can determine if a wins, b wins, or draw.\n\nSo, let's create a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds using cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible due to the large possible number of rounds (up to 2 billion). Instead, we use the concept of least common multiple (LCM) to identify repeating patterns in the game outcomes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The key observation is that the sequence of moves for both players will repeat every LCM of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one full cycle (determined by the LCM), determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full cycles within the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full cycles. Use the precomputed cycle results to efficiently determine the total losses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle (lcm rounds)\n    nikephoros_losses = 0\n    polycarpus_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine the winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_losses += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    remaining = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = nikephoros_losses * total_cycles\n    total_pol = polycarpus_losses * total_cycles\n    \n    # Now process the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            polycarpus_losses += 1\n        else:\n            nikephoros_losses += 1\n    \n    total_nik += nikephoros_losses\n    total_pol += polycarpus_losses\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_pol}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the cycle length.\n3. **Cycle Outcome Precomputation**: For each round within one cycle, the outcome is determined and the number of losses for each player is counted.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder Handling**: The total number of full cycles and remaining rounds are computed. The results from the precomputed cycle are scaled by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to accumulate the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of move sequences, ensuring optimal performance.",
