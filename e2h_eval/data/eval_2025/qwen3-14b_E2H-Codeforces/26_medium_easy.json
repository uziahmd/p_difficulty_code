    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain inequalities based on the given A, B, C, D. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values that meet the constraints and check if x + y > z. But given that the maximum value for D is 5e5, a brute force approach would be way too slow. We need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The variables are ordered as x ≤ B, y ≥ B and ≤ C, and z ≥ C and ≤ D. Also, since the problem states that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z, so x can be from A to B, y from B to C, and z from C to D. But also, for each x and y, z has to be between max(C, ... ) and D. Wait, but the constraints are already that y ≤ C and z ≥ C, so z starts at C.\n\nBut the main thing is that for each x and y, we need to find the number of z's such that z is between C and D, and z < x + y. Because for the triangle to be valid, z has to be less than x + y. Because x ≤ y ≤ z, so the sum x + y must be > z.\n\nSo for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But z also has to be ≥ C and ≤ D. So the count for z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that x can range up to B (which can be 5e5), and y up to C (also 5e5). If we loop through all possible x and y, that's O(B*C) operations, which for B and C up to 5e5 would be 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to compute the counts for x and y ranges more efficiently. Let's think about the constraints again. Since x can be from A to B, and y from B to C. But also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, so x can be anything up to B, and y starts at B. However, for the triangle condition, x + y must be > z. But z is at least C. So for a given x and y, the minimal z is C, and the maximum z is min(D, x + y - 1). So the number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of (number of valid z's for x and y).\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing this sum efficiently. Let's think about how to compute this sum.\n\nFirst, note that for each x and y, the term is:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C else 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → 0\n\nelse:\n\nmax(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) = min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nBut since x + y -1 can be larger than D or not. So:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, (x + y - 1 - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C and x + y -1 <= D else (D - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= D else 0 )\n\nSo breaking it down into cases:\n\nCase 1: x + y -1 < C → 0\n\nCase 2: C ≤ x + y -1 ≤ D → (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C\n\nCase 3: x + y -1 > D → D - C + 1\n\nSo for each x and y, the count_z is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n\nthen:\n\nif x + y - 1 <= D → x + y - C\n\nelse → D - C + 1\n\nBut x + y -1 is the maximum z allowed. So the count is the number of integers between C and (x + y -1) inclusive, which is (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nBut if that upper bound is higher than D, then we take D instead. So the count is max(0, min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1) → which can be rewritten as max(0, min(x + y -1 - C + 1, D - C + 1)) → which is same as max(0, min(x + y - C, D - C + 1)).\n\nSo the problem is to compute for all x and y, the sum of min(x + y - C, D - C + 1) if x + y - C >= 0, else 0.\n\nBut how do we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think of variables. Let me denote S = x + y. Then the condition is S > C. Because for z to be at least C, we need S > C. Because z must be ≥ C, and x + y > z. So if S ≤ C, then even the minimal z (C) would have x + y ≤ C, so x + y ≤ z, which makes the triangle invalid. Hence, only when S > C, we have possible z's.\n\nSo for each x and y where x + y > C, the contribution is:\n\nif S-1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → S - C.\n\nBut S is x + y.\n\nSo the contribution for each x and y is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n\n   if x + y - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\n   else → (x + y) - C\n\nBut x + y -1 >= D is equivalent to x + y >= D + 1. So:\n\ncontribution = \n\nif x + y <= C → 0\n\nelif x + y <= D + 1 → (x + y) - C\n\nelse → D - C + 1\n\nSo the total sum is the sum over all x and y (with x in [A,B], y in [B,C]) of the above.\n\nNow, how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me think of x and y as variables. Let me think about the sum as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [f(x, y)], where f(x,y) is defined as above.\n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can split the sum into two parts: one where x + y <= D + 1 and another where x + y > D + 1. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, we can find the range of y's that contribute to the sum, and compute the sum for each x.\n\nBut even that might be expensive if done naively. Let's think about for each x, what is the possible y's.\n\nFor a fixed x, y ranges from B to C. For each y, we need to check if x + y > C. Let's find the minimum y for which x + y > C. Since x is fixed, and y >= B.\n\nLet me think. For x fixed, the minimal y that satisfies x + y > C is y_min = max(B, C - x + 1). Because x + y > C → y > C - x → y ≥ C -x + 1. However, since y must be ≥ B, the actual lower bound for y is max(B, C - x + 1). If this lower bound is larger than C, then there are no such y's. Otherwise, for y in [y_min, C], we have x + y > C.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are in the interval [y_start, C], where y_start = max(B, C - x + 1). And for these y's, we can compute their contribution.\n\nNow, for each x and y in this range, we need to compute whether x + y is ≤ D or not. Let me think about for each x, the sum over y in [y_start, C] of:\n\nif x + y <= D → (x + y - C)\n\nelse → (D - C + 1)\n\nSo, for a fixed x, the sum over y can be split into two parts:\n\ny such that x + y ≤ D → contribute (x + y - C)\n\nand y such that x + y > D → contribute (D - C + 1)\n\nLet me find for a fixed x, the threshold y where x + y = D. Let's say y_threshold = D - x.\n\nIf y_threshold >= C, then all y in [y_start, C] will have x + y <= D. So the contribution for this x is sum_{y = y_start}^C (x + y - C) = sum_{y = y_start}^C (x - C + y).\n\nIf y_threshold < y_start, then none of the y's contribute, because x + y would be larger than D. Wait, no. Because y_threshold is D - x. So for x + y > D → y > D - x. So for y in [y_start, C], if D - x < y_start, then all y's are in the region where x + y > D, so their contribution is (D - C + 1) multiplied by the number of such y's.\n\nIf y_threshold is between y_start and C, then some y's are in the first case and others in the second.\n\nSo, for each x, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1). If y_start > C, then no contribution from this x.\n\nElse:\n\n2. Compute the range of y's: [y_start, C]\n\n3. Find the split point y_split where x + y = D → y_split = D - x.\n\n   So for y <= y_split → contribute (x + y - C)\n\n   for y > y_split → contribute (D - C + 1)\n\n   So, the split is at y_split. However, since y can be up to C, we need to find the overlap between [y_start, C] and [y_split + 1, ... ].\n\nBut how to find the split?\n\nLet me compute y_split = D - x. Then:\n\nthe y's in [y_start, min(C, y_split)] contribute (x + y - C), and the y's in [max(y_start, y_split + 1), C] contribute (D - C + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\nnumber_of_y_in_first_part * (x + y_avg - C) ?\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute the sum for the first part (y <= y_split) and the sum for the second part (y > y_split).\n\nLet me think of the first part: y ranges from y_low = y_start to y_high = min(C, y_split). The number of terms is (y_high - y_low + 1). The sum of (x + y - C) for y from y_low to y_high is sum (x - C + y) = (x - C) * (count) + sum(y from y_low to y_high).\n\nSimilarly for the second part: the count is (C - y_split_max + 1), where y_split_max is max(y_start, y_split + 1). And each contributes (D - C + 1).\n\nSo, for each x, we can compute these parts.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute these values quickly. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each x in [A, B], compute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1). Then check if y_start > C. If yes, skip. Else, proceed.\n\nThen compute y_split = D - x. Now, the first part's upper bound is min(C, y_split). Let me call this y_high_part1 = min(C, y_split). The lower bound is y_low_part1 = y_start.\n\nIf y_low_part1 > y_high_part1, then the first part is zero. Else, the contribution from part1 is sum_{y=y_low_part1}^{y_high_part1} (x + y - C) = sum (x - C) + sum y = (x - C) * cnt + sum_y.\n\nSimilarly, part2 is for y in [y_low_part2, C], where y_low_part2 is max(y_start, y_split + 1). If y_low_part2 > C, then no contribution from part2. Else, the count is C - y_low_part2 + 1, and each contributes (D - C + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is part1_contribution + part2_contribution.\n\nNow, the key is to compute these sums efficiently.\n\nBut how? For each x, we need to compute these ranges. Let's think about how to compute the sum of y from a to b. The sum is (a + b) * (b - a + 1) // 2.\n\nSo, for part1_contribution:\n\ncnt = y_high_part1 - y_low_part1 + 1\n\nsum_y = (y_low_part1 + y_high_part1) * cnt // 2\n\npart1_contribution = (x - C) * cnt + sum_y\n\nFor part2_contribution:\n\ncnt = C - y_low_part2 + 1\n\npart2_contribution = cnt * (D - C + 1)\n\nSo, for each x, we can compute this.\n\nNow, the question is, how many x's are there? Since x ranges from A to B, which can be up to 5e5, and for each x, the processing is O(1), this would be O(B - A + 1) operations, which is acceptable for B up to 5e5.\n\nSo the overall time complexity would be O(B - A + 1) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this logic.\n\nFirst, let's note that for x in [A, B], and for each x, compute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1). Let's see:\n\nC - x + 1 is the minimal y that makes x + y > C. Because x + y > C → y > C - x → y >= C - x + 1.\n\nBut since y must be >= B, the y_start is the maximum between B and that value.\n\nSo for example, if x is large enough that C - x + 1 is less than B, then y_start is B. Otherwise, it's higher.\n\nSo, for each x, we compute y_start. Then check if y_start <= C. If not, then no contribution. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nOnce we have that, compute y_split = D - x.\n\nNow, for part1, y_high_part1 is min(C, y_split). So if y_split >= C, then y_high_part1 is C, else it's y_split.\n\nThen, for part1, if y_low_part1 (y_start) is <= y_high_part1, then compute the sum.\n\nFor part2, y_low_part2 is max(y_start, y_split + 1). If y_low_part2 <= C, then compute the count.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nWe need to loop x from 1 to 2, and for each x, compute the contributions.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_start = max(B=2, C - x +1 = 3 -1 +1 = 3). So y_start = max(2, 3) =3. Since C is 3, y_start is 3. So y ranges from 3 to 3 (since C=3).\n\nThen compute y_split = D -x =4 -1=3. So part1 is min(3, 3) =3. So part1 is y_low_part1=3, y_high_part1=3. So cnt =1. sum_y =3. part1_contribution is (1-3)*1 +3 = (-2) +3=1.\n\npart2: y_low_part2 is max(3, 3+1=4). Since 4 > C=3, no contribution. So total for x=1 is 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_start = max(B=2, C -x +1=3-2+1=2). So y_start=2. y ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nCompute y_split = D -x =4-2=2.\n\nSo part1: y_high_part1 = min(3, 2) =2. So y_low_part1=2, y_high_part1=2. cnt=1. sum_y=2. part1_contribution is (2-3)*1 +2 = (-1)+2=1.\n\npart2: y_low_part2 is max(2, 2+1=3). So y_low_part2=3. C is 3. So cnt=3-3 +1=1. part2_contribution is 1*(4-3 +1)= 1*2=2. So total contribution for x=2 is 1+2=3.\n\nTotal overall is 1 (from x=1) +3 (from x=2) =4, which matches the sample. Good.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo x ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_start = max(B=2, C -x +1=2-1+1=2). So y_start=2. Since C=2, y ranges from 2 to 2.\n\ny_split = D -x =5-1=4. So part1: min(2,4)=2. So part1 is sum (x + y - C) for y=2. x=1, y=2. 1+2 -2=1. So part1_contribution is 1. part2: y_low_part2 is max(2, 4+1=5). 5>2, no contribution. So x=1 contributes 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_start = max(2, 2 -2 +1=1) → 2. So y ranges from 2 to 2 (C=2).\n\ny_split =5-2=3. part1 is min(2,3)=2. So part1_contribution is (2-2)*1 + sum_y (2) → 0 +2=2. part2: y_low_part2 is max(2, 3+1=4) →4>2. So nothing. So x=2 contributes 2. Total sum is 1+2=3, which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nSo A=B=C=D=500000. So x can be 500000, y can be 500000, z can be 500000. Check if x + y > z → 500k + 500k > 500k → 1e6 > 5e5 → yes. So the count for z is min(5e5, x + y -1) - C +1. x + y -1 = 5e5 +5e5 -1 = 999,999. min(5e5, ...) is 5e5. So 5e5 -5e5 +1 = 1. So for x=5e5, y=5e5, contribution is 1. So total is 1. Which matches.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's handle the loops. For x in range A to B inclusive. For each x, compute y_start.\n\nNow, in Python, for x in range(A, B+1):\n\nBut when A and B are up to 5e5, looping through all x is acceptable.\n\nNow, for each x, compute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1). Then check if y_start > C. If so, continue. Else, compute the contribution.\n\nNow, for the variables:\n\ny_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_start > C → no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\ny_low = y_start\n\ny_high = C\n\ny_split = D - x\n\nNow, part1_high = min(y_high, y_split)\n\nif part1_high >= y_low:\n\ncompute part1_contribution.\n\nelse, part1_contribution is 0.\n\nThen part2_low = max(y_low, y_split + 1)\n\nif part2_low <= y_high:\n\ncompute part2_contribution.\n\nelse 0.\n\nSo, code:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n    if y_start > C:\n\n        continue\n\n    y_low = y_start\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    y_split = D - x\n\n    # part1: y ranges from y_low to min(y_high, y_split)\n\n    part1_high = min(y_high, y_split)\n\n    if part1_high >= y_low:\n\n        cnt = part1_high - y_low + 1\n\n        sum_y = (y_low + part1_high) * cnt // 2\n\n        part1 = (x - C) * cnt + sum_y\n\n    else:\n\n        part1 = 0\n\n    # part2: y ranges from max(y_low, y_split + 1) to y_high\n\n    part2_low = max(y_low, y_split + 1)\n\n    if part2_low <= y_high:\n\n        cnt = y_high - part2_low + 1\n\n        part2 = cnt * (D - C + 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        part2 = 0\n\n    total += part1 + part2\n\nreturn total\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: when D is very small. Like, when x + y is always larger than D.\n\nFor example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. So for x=1, y_start is max(2, 3 -1 +1=3). So y_start=3. y_high is 3. y_split = D -x =3-1=2. So part1_high = min(3, 2) =2. Which is less than y_low (3). So part1 is 0. part2_low = max(3, 2+1=3). So part2_low is 3. y_high is 3. So cnt=1. part2 = 1 * (3-3 +1) =1. So total for x=1 is 1. For x=2, y_start is max(2, 3-2+1=2). So y_start=2. y_high=3. y_split =3-2=1. part1_high is min(3,1)=1 < y_low=2 → part1=0. part2_low = max(2, 1+1=2) → 2. cnt=3-2 +1=2. part2 = 2*(3-3 +1) =2*1=2. So total for x=2 is 2. Overall total is 1+2=3. Let's check possible triangles. For x=1, y=3, z can be 3. 1+3>3 → yes. So 1 case. For x=2, y can be 2 or 3. For y=2: z must be >=3 and <=3. So check 2+2>3 → 4>3 → yes. So 1 case. For y=3: 2+3>3 → yes. So z can be 3. So 1 case. So total 1+2=3. Which matches the calculation.\n\nAnother edge case: when C is very large. For example, when x + y is always less than C. Then no contribution. But since y starts at B and x is up to B, and B <= C, then for x and y being B, x + y = 2B. If 2B <= C, then for all x and y, x + y <= 2B <= C. So no contribution. So total is zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when x is such that C -x +1 is less than B. For example, A=1, B=3, C=5. For x=3, C -x +1 = 5-3+1=3. So y_start = max(3, 3) =3. Which is okay.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, for large numbers (up to 5e5), the loop would run 5e5 times. Which should be manageable.\n\nNow, considering that in Python, even 5e5 iterations are acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut also note that in the input, the first line is four integers. But the problem says that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as the first line contains four integers. But the sample input shows three lines, like:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as four integers. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the first line contains four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the sample input. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with four integers. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. Oh, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the user should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases? Or is the sample input showing multiple test cases for illustration?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'] — but that's probably a mistake in formatting. Probably, the actual input is one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. But the code is supposed to process one test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. But the sample input shows three lines, which probably indicates that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's sample input shows three lines, but the output shows three lines. So perhaps the actual problem expects multiple test cases. But the original problem statement says \"the first line contains four integers\". This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user's sample input is written as:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the output is:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that there are three test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5e5).\n\nSo the code should read a single line of input. But the sample input shows three lines, which suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the user provided three test cases in the sample, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three lines, but the output shows three lines. Therefore, perhaps the actual problem is that the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the problem's original note:\n\n\"In the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides (1, 3, 3), (2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 3) and (2, 3, 4).\"\n\nWhich corresponds to the first input line.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each given in a line. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original input description:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D. So the code should read one line of input. But the sample shows three lines. That's likely a mistake in the problem's presentation. However, the sample output shows three outputs, which implies that there are three test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read multiple test cases, each given in a line. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the result for each.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. For multiple test cases, the code should read all lines until EOF.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's sample input, and the actual code should process a single test case. However, the sample shows three test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the first input line is '1 2 3 4', and output is '4'. The second input line is '1 2 2 5', output '3'. Third input line is '500000 ...', output '1'.\n\nSo the code should process multiple test cases, each given in a line.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the problem is miswritten, and the actual code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple lines, and the output shows multiple lines, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from input, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, and compute the answer.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, for each line, process it as a test case.\n\nIn Python, that can be done as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute answer and print\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three lines, and the code should output three lines.\n\nSo, the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer as discussed, and print.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nBut in Python, for large numbers, the code should be efficient. However, for 5e5 iterations per test case, and with multiple test cases, but assuming that the number of test cases is small (like up to 10), it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the function for a single test case.\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n\n        y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n        if y_start > C:\n\n            continue\n\n        y_low = y_start\n\n        y_high = C\n\n        y_split = D - x\n\n        # part1: y ranges from y_low to min(y_high, y_split)\n\n        part1_high = min(y_high, y_split)\n\n        if part1_high >= y_low:\n\n            cnt = part1_high - y_low + 1\n\n            sum_y = (y_low + part1_high) * cnt // 2\n\n            part1 = (x - C) * cnt + sum_y\n\n        else:\n\n            part1 = 0\n\n        # part2: y ranges from max(y_low, y_split + 1) to y_high\n\n        part2_low = max(y_low, y_split + 1)\n\n        if part2_low <= y_high:\n\n            cnt = y_high - part2_low + 1\n\n            part2 = cnt * (D - C + 1)\n\n        else:\n\n            part2 = 0\n\n        total += part1 + part2\n\n    return total\n\nBut wait, what if D is less than C? Well, according to the problem statement, C ≤ D. So D - C + 1 is ≥ 1.\n\nBut in code, when D is equal to C, D - C + 1 is 1.\n\nNow, testing this function with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 → returns 4.\n\nSample 2: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5 → returns 3.\n\nSample 3: A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000 → returns 1.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for the case where x is large, and C -x +1 is small. Let's think about when x is larger than C. For example, x= C + 1. But since x ranges up to B, and B ≤ C, this can't happen. Because B ≤ C. So x can be up to B, which is ≤ C. So C -x +1 is ≥ C - B + 1 ≥ 1 (since B ≤ C). So y_start is max(B, ...), which is at least B.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n        total = 0\n\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n\n            y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n            if y_start > C:\n\n                continue\n\n            y_low = y_start\n\n            y_high = C\n\n            y_split = D - x\n\n            # part1\n\n            part1_high = min(y_high, y_split)\n\n            if part1_high >= y_low:\n\n                cnt = part1_high - y_low + 1\n\n                sum_y = (y_low + part1_high) * cnt // 2\n\n                part1 = (x - C) * cnt + sum_y\n\n            else:\n\n                part1 = 0\n\n            # part2\n\n            part2_low = max(y_low, y_split + 1)\n\n            if part2_low <= y_high:\n\n                cnt = y_high - part2_low + 1\n\n                part2 = cnt * (D - C + 1)\n\n            else:\n\n                part2 = 0\n\n            total += part1 + part2\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, for the case where D is very large, like D=1e9. Then, for part2, D - C + 1 could be large. But since the code uses integers, it's okay.\n\nBut for the case where D is very large, but x + y is larger than D, then part2 is added.\n\nNow, testing this code with the samples.\n\nSample 1: returns 4. Correct.\n\nSample 2: returns 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: returns 1. Correct.\n\nBut what about when B is larger than C? No, because the input constraints are A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So B ≤ C.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nBut for very large values, like 5e5, how long would this take? For example, for B=5e5, the loop runs 5e5 times.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to avoid a brute-force solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ must satisfy $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. For a valid triangle, the key condition is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating over all possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we focus on calculating valid ranges for $z$ based on given $x$ and $y$.\n3. **Range Splitting**: For each $x$, determine the valid range of $y$ values such that $x + y > C$. Then, split the calculation of valid $z$ values into two parts: those where $z$ is within the range determined by $x + y$ and those where $z$ reaches the upper bound $D$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n            if y_start > C:\n                continue\n            y_low = y_start\n            y_high = C\n            y_split = D - x\n            \n            # Part 1: y ranges from y_low to min(y_high, y_split)\n            part1_high = min(y_high, y_split)\n            if part1_high >= y_low:\n                cnt = part1_high - y_low + 1\n                sum_y = (y_low + part1_high) * cnt // 2\n                part1 = (x - C) * cnt + sum_y\n            else:\n                part1 = 0\n            \n            # Part 2: y ranges from max(y_low, y_split + 1) to y_high\n            part2_low = max(y_low, y_split + 1)\n            if part2_low <= y_high:\n                cnt = y_high - part2_low + 1\n                part2 = cnt * (D - C + 1)\n            else:\n                part2 = 0\n            \n            total += part1 + part2\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.\n2. **Iterating Over x Values**: For each value of $x$ from $A$ to $B$, compute the minimum $y$ value that ensures $x + y > C$.\n3. **Splitting Valid y Ranges**: For each valid $y$, split the calculation of valid $z$ values into two parts:\n   - **Part 1**: When $x + y$ is within the range $[C, D]$, calculate the valid $z$ values directly.\n   - **Part 2**: When $x + y$ exceeds $D$, all valid $z$ values from $C$ to $D$ are counted.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Sum contributions from both parts for each $x$ and accumulate the total count of valid triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid ranges for $y$ and $z$ based on $x$, ensuring we avoid unnecessary iterations and handle large input sizes within feasible time limits.",
