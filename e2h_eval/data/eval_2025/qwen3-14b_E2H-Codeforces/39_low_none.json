Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to create an N x N board where the rook pays strictly fewer vuns than the queen during their traversal according to the given rules. If it's impossible, we return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the movement rules. Let's recap:\n\nThe process starts at cell 1. Then, each move is determined by choosing the minimal unvisited number among all cells reachable in one move. If there are no such cells, the figure teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying a fee of 1 vun. This continues until all cells are visited.\n\nSo for both the rook and the queen, we need to simulate their paths and count the number of times they have to teleport (i.e., the number of fees paid). Our goal is to construct a board where the rook's fee count is strictly less than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about when this would happen. For example, in the sample input where N=4, the rook had 1 fee and the queen had 2. So the key is to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path requires fewer teleports than the queen's.\n\nBut how can we design such a board?\n\nLet me consider the movement patterns. The rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. The queen can move any direction, including diagonally. So the queen has more possible moves than the rook. However, the order in which cells are visited depends on the numbering. The minimal number determines the next step.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is to arrange the numbers such that the queen gets stuck more often, requiring more teleports. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to structure the numbering so that the rook's path covers cells in a way that avoids needing to teleport, while the queen's path requires more teleports.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nLet me think of small N cases.\n\nFor N=1: Both pay 0. Output is -1.\n\nFor N=2: Let's see. Let's try to make a grid where the rook pays less than the queen.\n\nBut what's the possible scenario here?\n\nLet me try to think of a way to arrange numbers such that the queen has to teleport more than the rook.\n\nWait, but for N=2, the maximum number of cells is 4. Let's imagine the numbering:\n\nSuppose the grid is:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nRook starts at 1. From 1, the rook can move to cells in same row or column. The unvisited cells are 3, 4, 2. The minimal is 2? No, wait. Wait, the rook can move to cells reachable in one move. So from 1 (position (1,1)), the rook can move along row 1 (cell 3) or column 1 (cell 4). So the reachable cells are 3 and 4. The minimal among them is 3. So next is 3. Now, from 3 (position (1,2)), the rook can move along row 1 (already visited 1 and 3), column 2 (cell 2). So next is 2. Now, from 2 (position (2,2)), the rook can move along row 2 (cell 4) or column 2 (already visited). So next is 4. All done. No teleports. So rook pays 0.\n\nQueen's path: starts at 1. From 1, queen can reach any cell in same row, column, or diagonal. So all cells except 1 are reachable. The minimal unvisited is 2 (cell (2,2))? Or 3 (cell (1,2))? Wait, the numbers are 1,3,4,2. So the unvisited cells are 3,4,2. The minimal is 2. So the queen would move to 2. Then, from 2, the queen can reach all cells except those already visited. The next steps would be to check reachable cells. From 2 (position (2,2)), the queen can reach any cell in row 2 (cell 4), column 2 (already visited), or diagonals (cell (1,1) already visited). So only 4 is reachable. Next is 4. Then, from 4 (position (2,1)), the queen can reach row 2 (already visited 2 and 4), column 1 (cell 1, already visited). So no reachable cells. Then teleport to the minimal unvisited cell, which is 3. Pay 1 vun. So queen pays 1. Rook pays 0. So in this case, the rook pays less. So this would be a valid grid for N=2.\n\nBut how to",
