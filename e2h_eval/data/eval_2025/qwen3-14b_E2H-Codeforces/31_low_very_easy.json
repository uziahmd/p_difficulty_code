Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we want the minimal number of cards to reach that.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to get the total sum to zero, so the required sum from the new cards is -S. Let's call that required value R = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to R, given that each card can contribute between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers, the problem becomes finding the minimal number of terms (each between -x and x) that add up to R.\n\nWait, but how do we find that minimal number?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the absolute value of R. Because if R is positive, we need to add positive numbers, and if it's negative, add negative numbers. But since the cards can be either, the minimal number would depend on the maximum possible contribution per card.\n\nFor example, if R is 5, and x is 2. Each card can contribute up to +2. So the minimal number is ceil(5/2) = 3 (since 2+2+1=5). Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Wait, but the maximum per card is x. So for R, the minimal number of cards is ceiling( |R| / x ), but wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose R is 5, x is 2. The maximum per card is 2. So to get 5, you need 3 cards: 2 + 2 + 1. But since each card can be any value between -x and x. So the minimal number is the ceiling of (R divided by x), but considering that each card can contribute up to x. So for example, if R is 5 and x is 2, then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if R is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 = 2, so two cards. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: R is 3, x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, ceiling is 2. So two cards: 2 + 1. That works.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of (abs(R)/x). But wait, what if R is zero? Then no cards are needed. But in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given cards. Let's call it S.\n\n2. Compute R = -S. That's the sum we need to get from the new cards.\n\n3. If R is zero, answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to get sum R. Which is ceil( |R| / x ), but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, for example, if R is 5 and x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceiling is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: R is 7, x is 3. 7/3 is 2.333, ceiling is 3. 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. So three cards. Correct.\n\nBut what if R is 6 and x is 3? 6/3 is 2. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is indeed ceiling( |R| / x ), but wait, what if R is negative? Well, since we take absolute value, it's the same as R being positive. So the minimal number of cards is ceiling( |R| / x ). But wait, let's think of R as the target sum. For example, if R is -5, then we can use cards with values -2, -2, -1. So same as 5, but with negatives. So the number of cards is the same.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |R| / x ), but only if R is not zero. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut wait, let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So R is -2. So |R| is 2. x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, and we need to find the minimal number of such cards to balance the sum of the already found cards.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Required Sum**: Calculate the required sum (R) that needs to be achieved with additional cards to make the total sum zero. This is simply the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Handle Zero Case**: If the required sum (R) is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For non-zero required sums, determine the minimum number of cards needed by using the ceiling of the absolute value of R divided by the maximum absolute value (x). This is because each card can contribute at most x towards balancing the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        current_sum = sum(cards)\n        required = -current_sum\n        if required == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            print(math.ceil(abs(required) / x))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, handling multiple test cases if present.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to balance the total sum to zero.\n- **Required Adjustment**: The required adjustment (R) is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n- **Ceiling Division**: The minimum number of cards needed is determined by dividing the absolute value of the required adjustment by the maximum allowed card value (x), using ceiling division to ensure we account for any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations and ensures correctness by leveraging the properties of integer division and ceiling functions.",
