    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees, modulo 998244353. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nA good tree is an edge-weighted tree where each edge has weight 1 or -1. Additionally, for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Hmm. So for every vertex, if we look at all edges connected to it, multiply their weights, the result is -1.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what constraints this condition imposes on the tree structure and the edge weights. Let's think about the product condition. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges' weights is -1. Since each edge connects two vertices, each edge contributes to the product of two vertices. \n\nLet me consider the product of all these vertex products. For each edge, since it's part of two vertices, when we take the product of all vertex products, each edge's weight will be multiplied twice. So the total product would be (-1)^n (since each vertex contributes -1, and there are n vertices). But also, each edge's weight is multiplied twice, so the product is (product of all edge weights)^2. Therefore:\n\nproduct_{v} (product of edges incident to v) = (product of edge weights)^2 * (-1)^n ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, each edge is counted in exactly two vertices. So the product over all vertex products is equal to the product of (each edge's weight)^2. Because each edge's weight appears in two vertices. For example, if an edge connects u and v, then its weight is part of the product for u and for v. So the total product of all vertex products is product_{edges} (w_e^2) = product_{edges} (w_e)^2. Since w_e is either 1 or -1, w_e squared is 1. So the product of all vertex products is 1. \n\nBut according to the condition, each vertex's product is -1, so the product of all vertex products is (-1)^n. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, that's a problem! Because if n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, which can't equal 1. So that suggests that when n is odd, there are no good trees. But in the sample input, when n=2 (even), there is one good tree. For n=1, which is odd, but the input allows n=1. Wait, what about n=1?\n\nWait for n=1, there are no edges. So for each vertex (only one vertex), the product of edges incident to it is the product of zero edges. The product of zero numbers is 1. But the condition requires that product to be -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, when n is 1, the answer is 0. Which matches the second sample input where n=1 gives output 0.\n\nSo this suggests that for n odd, there are no good trees. So when n is odd, the answer is 0. But when n is even, there might be some good trees.\n\nWait, but the sample input for n=2 is 1, which is even. So the conclusion is that when n is odd, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is 0. For even n, we have to compute the sum.\n\nSo first, check if n is even. If not, output 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming n is even. How do we count the number of good trees, and compute the sum of d(1,n) over them?\n\nBut the problem isn't just counting the number of good trees. It's summing d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nBut first, perhaps we can find the number of good trees, and then find the expected value of d(1,n) multiplied by the number of good trees. But maybe there's a way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each good tree, the sum of d(1,n) can be determined based on some properties.\n\nBut first, let's think about the constraints of a good tree. Each vertex has product of incident edges' weights equal to -1. Let me think about the implications for the tree structure and the edge weights.\n\nLet me model the tree as a graph with edges having weights ±1. For each vertex, the product of its adjacent edges' weights is -1.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the degrees. Wait, but the tree is any tree. However, the product conditions may impose some constraints on the degrees. For example, suppose a vertex has degree k. Then the product of k weights is -1. Since each weight is ±1, the product is -1 iff there's an odd number of -1s among the edges incident to the vertex. So for each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 incident to it must be odd.\n\nBut each edge is between two vertices. So, if I think of the edges as variables, each contributing to two vertices. Let me think of the problem as a system of equations. For each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the number of -1 edges incident to it is 1. Because the product is -1, which is equivalent to having an odd number of -1s.\n\nBut since each edge is between two vertices, if I assign variables x_e ∈ {0,1}, where x_e = 1 if the edge e has weight -1, and 0 otherwise. Then for each vertex v, the sum of x_e over edges incident to v must be congruent to 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is a system of linear equations over GF(2). The variables are the edges of the tree. The equations are that for each vertex, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it is 1 mod 2.\n\nBut since the tree is connected, and has n-1 edges, the system may have certain properties.\n\nLet me think: the sum of all equations. For each equation, sum over edges incident to v of x_e equals 1 mod 2. Summing over all vertices:\n\nEach edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the sum of all equations is equal to sum_{e} 2x_e ≡ sum_{v} 1 mod 2. But 2x_e mod 2 is 0. So the left side is 0 mod 2. The right side is n mod 2. Therefore, for the system to be consistent, n must be even. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. Hence, when n is even, the system is consistent, and when n is odd, there are no solutions.\n\nTherefore, for even n, the system has solutions. Now, the number of solutions depends on the rank of the system.\n\nIn a tree, the number of edges is n-1. The system of equations is for each vertex, sum of x_e (incident edges) is 1 mod 2. However, the sum of all equations is 0 ≡ n mod 2. Which holds when n is even. So the system is consistent.\n\nWhat is the rank of this system? The system is for a tree. Let me think about the equations. Since the sum of all equations is 0, the equations are not all independent. The rank is (n-1) - 1 = n-2? Or something else?\n\nIn general, for a connected graph, the system of equations for the sum of x_e around each vertex being some value. For a tree, the equations are dependent. For example, if you take all equations except one, you can derive the last one. So the rank of the system is (n-1) - 1 = n-2? Because there are n equations, but they are dependent. But since the system is for a tree, which is connected, the rank would be n-1 - 1 = n-2? Or maybe the number of independent equations is n-1.\n\nWait, the system has n equations (for each vertex), but they are not all independent. The sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. So the rank is n-1 if the equations are otherwise independent. But in the case of a tree, perhaps the system's rank is n-1 - 1 = n-2? Or maybe n-1?\n\nWait, let's think for a simple example. Take n=2. There is one edge, connecting vertex 1 and 2. The equations are:\n\nFor vertex 1: x_1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 2: x_1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nThese two equations are the same. So the rank is 1. The system has 2 equations, but they are dependent. So the rank is 1. The number of solutions is 2^{number of variables - rank} } = 2^{1 - 1} = 1. Which matches the first sample: for n=2, there's only one solution (the edge has weight -1).\n\nAnother example: n=3. But since n is odd, there are no solutions. But if we ignore that, for n=3, the system would have three equations. But sum of equations is 0 ≡ 3 mod 2 → 0 ≡ 1 mod 2, which is impossible. Hence, no solutions.\n\nFor n=4. Let's imagine a tree. Let's say a star-shaped tree with root 1 connected to 2,3,4. Then the equations are:\n\nFor vertex 1: x_12 + x_13 + x_14 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 2: x_12 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 3: x_13 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 4: x_14 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nAdding the equations for 2,3,4: x_12 + x_13 + x_14 ≡ 3 mod 2 → 1 mod 2. Which matches the equation for vertex 1. So the system is dependent. The rank is 3 equations (since the fourth equation is dependent on the others). So the rank is 3. The number of variables is 3 (edges). So the number of solutions is 2^(3 - 3) ) = 1. Which would mean that there is exactly one solution. But wait, let's see: the equations for vertices 2,3,4 require that x_12, x_13, x_14 are all 1 mod 2. Then the equation for vertex 1 is 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 = 1, which satisfies. So indeed, there is exactly one solution. So for this tree, the number of possible assignments is 1. But the tree structure is fixed here. But the problem says that the trees can be any tree structure. So for each tree, how many valid assignments of edge weights are there?\n\nWait, the problem says that for the given problem, we have to consider all possible trees (structure) and all possible edge weightings (each edge is ±1) that satisfy the good condition. So the total number of good trees is the number of trees multiplied by the number of valid weightings per tree.\n\nBut for each tree structure, how many valid weightings are there? For the system of equations above, the number of solutions is 2^{m - r}, where m is the number of variables (edges, which is n-1), and r is the rank of the system. For the system, the rank is (n-1) - 1 = n-2? Because the equations are n equations, but they are dependent. Let me think again. The system has n equations, but the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. So the rank is n-1. But for the system to be consistent, the sum of the RHS must be 0 mod 2, which it is when n is even. So the rank is n-1, and the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? Wait, that would mean that for each tree structure, there is exactly one valid weighting. Because the system has m = n-1 variables, and the rank is n-1 (assuming that the system is of full rank). But how?\n\nWait, the system has n equations, but they are not all independent. The rank is n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. So for each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights. That's interesting. So for each tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights such that the product conditions are satisfied. So the total number of good trees is equal to the number of possible trees multiplied by 1. So the number of good trees is n^{n-2} (from Cayley's formula) multiplied by 1. But wait, Cayley's formula counts the number of trees, and for each tree, exactly one valid weighting. So total good trees is n^{n-2} * 1. But the problem says that the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. So for each tree, there is exactly one valid weighting. So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2}.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive. Let me test with n=2. The number of trees is 1 (Cayley's formula). And for each tree, exactly one valid weighting. Which matches the first sample, where there is one good tree. For n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. For each tree, exactly one valid weighting. So total of 16 good trees. Which matches the third sample input, which says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is: for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2}, and for odd n, it's 0.\n\nBut now, the problem is to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees. Since for each tree, there is exactly one valid weighting. So the sum is equal to the sum over all possible trees (structures) of d(1,n) for that tree's unique valid weighting.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each tree structure, compute the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n, under the unique valid weighting, then sum all those values across all trees.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nNow, how can we model this? Let's think about the unique weighting for each tree. For each tree, the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. So for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the constraints that each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nBut how can we find the sum of d(1,n) across all trees?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the unique weighting. Since each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps there's a way to model this as a system of equations and find the value of d(1,n) in terms of the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a clever way to compute the expected value of d(1,n) multiplied by the number of trees, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut considering that the sum is over all trees, and for each tree, there's exactly one valid weighting. Let's think of the sum as the sum over all trees T of (sum of weights along path from 1 to n in T under the valid weighting).\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about the valid weighting. For each tree, the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. Let me think of the system again. Each edge is a variable x_e (0 or 1, representing whether the weight is -1 or 1). For each vertex, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it is 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is a system of equations. For a tree, the system has a unique solution. Let me think about how to find that solution.\n\nIn a tree, the system of equations is such that each equation corresponds to a vertex. Let me think about the solution. Let me consider that the system is equivalent to assigning to each edge a value such that the parity of the number of -1 edges incident to each vertex is odd.\n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem. Suppose we have to assign to each edge a value (0 or 1) such that for each vertex, the sum of the edges incident to it is 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is similar to finding a set of edges such that each vertex has odd degree in the subgraph formed by those edges. This is known as an odd-degree subgraph. But since the tree is connected, the only such subgraph is a collection of edges that form a spanning tree with all vertices having odd degree. However, in a tree, the only way for all vertices to have odd degree is if the number of vertices is even. Which aligns with our previous conclusion.\n\nBut how to find the unique solution? Well, since the system has a unique solution, perhaps there's a way to compute it.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a tree. Let me pick a root, say vertex 1. Then, for each node, I can determine the value of the edge between it and its parent. Let's try to model this.\n\nLet me think of the tree as rooted at 1. For each node, except the root, there is a parent. Let me denote the edge between a node and its parent as e. Let me think of the equations. For each node, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it must be 1 mod 2. For the root, which has some children, the sum of the edges to its children must be 1 mod 2. For each non-root node, the sum of the edge to its parent plus the sum of the edges to its children must be 1 mod 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute the x_e values recursively. Let me think. For example, for the root node (vertex 1), the sum of the x_e values of its edges (to its children) must be 1 mod 2. For each child, say node v, the sum of x_e (edge to parent) plus the sum of x_e of its children edges must be 1 mod 2. So for node v, x_{parent} + sum_{children of v} x_e = 1 mod 2. Therefore, once x_{parent} is known, the sum of x_e for children of v can be determined. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assign the x_e values in a way that propagates down the tree. For example, starting from the root, and setting the x_e values for each edge based on the constraints of the children.\n\nLet me think of the root. Let's say the root has degree k. The sum of the x_e's for its edges must be 1 mod 2. However, for each child of the root, the x_e (edge between root and child) plus the sum of the x_e's for the edges of the child's subtree must be 1 mod 2. But since the child's subtree is a tree, perhaps the x_e for the edge between the root and the child can be determined in a way that allows the rest of the subtree to satisfy the constraints.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a pattern. Let me think of the entire tree. Since the system has a unique solution, perhaps the value of x_e for each edge is determined by the parity of the number of nodes in some subtree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a connection to the concept of a \"potential function\". Let me think of the tree as a graph, and define for each node v a value p(v), such that for each edge (u, v), the weight is determined by p(u) and p(v). For example, if we think of the weight as the product of p(u) and p(v), but since the weights are ±1, perhaps this is possible. However, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since the product of the edges incident to each node is -1, perhaps we can model this with a potential function. Let me think of the product of the edges incident to a node as -1. Suppose we have a function f(v) that is the product of the edge weights from the root to v. Then, for any node v, the product of the edges incident to v would be equal to f(v) multiplied by the product of the edges from v to its children. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for any node v, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Let me consider the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node v, let's denote the edge from v to its parent as e_v. Then, the product of the edges incident to v is equal to the product of e_v (the edge to parent) multiplied by the product of edges to children. Since the product must be -1, this gives us an equation.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed. Let me think of the following approach: for each tree, the sum d(1, n) is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n. Let's call this path P. Each edge on P has a weight of either 1 or -1. The sum is the sum of those weights.\n\nBut how can we find the sum over all trees of this value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the expected value of d(1,n) for a random good tree, and multiply it by the number of good trees (which is n^{n-2} for even n). But how to compute the expected value?\n\nBut since for each tree, the weighting is unique, the expected value is the average of d(1,n) over all trees.\n\nBut how to compute this average?\n\nLet me think about the contribution of each edge to the sum. For each edge e, how often does it appear in the path from 1 to n in a tree, and what is its contribution (either +1 or -1) under the unique weighting?\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with linearity of expectation. Let me think: the total sum is the sum over all trees T of [sum_{e in P_T} w_e(T)], where P_T is the path from 1 to n in T, and w_e(T) is the weight of edge e in the unique valid weighting of T.\n\nBy linearity of expectation, this is equal to sum_{e} [sum over all trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n in T} w_e(T)].\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for each edge e, compute the number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the expected value of w_e(T) in those trees. Then sum over all edges.\n\nBut how to find for each edge e, the expected value of w_e(T) in the trees where e is on the path from 1 to n?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, the probability that it's on the path from 1 to n in a random tree, multiplied by the expected value of its weight in that scenario.\n\nBut even that seems difficult. Let's think differently.\n\nSince each tree is considered with its unique valid weighting, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, the value of w_e in the unique weighting, and then compute the sum over all trees of the sum of w_e for e on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut how to find w_e for a given tree?\n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. The unique solution for the x_e variables (where x_e is 1 if the weight is -1, 0 if it's 1) is such that for each vertex, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it is 1 mod 2.\n\nLet me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node v, let me define a variable s_v which is the sum of x_e for edges along the path from the root to v. Then, for each node v, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it is equal to the sum of x_e for edges from v to its children plus the x_e for the edge from v to its parent. But for the root, there is no parent, so the sum is the sum of x_e for edges to its children.\n\nBut this seems similar to a potential function. Let me think recursively. For the root, the sum of x_e for its children edges must be 1 mod 2. Let me suppose that for each node v, the x_e of the edge between v and its parent is determined by the parity of some function of the subtree.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each node v, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it is 1 mod 2. Let me denote the edge between v and its parent as e_p. Then, the sum of x_e for edges incident to v is x_e_p + sum_{children c} x_e_c = 1 mod 2. Rearranged, sum_{children c} x_e_c = 1 - x_e_p mod 2.\n\nNow, for the children of v, this equation applies recursively. Perhaps we can find a way to express x_e_p in terms of the children's subtrees.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear way forward. Let me think of the following: since the system has a unique solution, maybe the value of x_e for each edge can be determined by the parity of the number of nodes in some subtree. For example, for an edge e between u and v, perhaps x_e is determined by the size of the subtree on one side of the edge.\n\nLet me think of the tree as being split into two parts by removing edge e. Suppose that one part contains node 1, and the other part contains node n. Then, the number of nodes in the subtree that doesn't contain node 1 could be important. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node v, let's define s_v as the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at v. Then, for the edge between v and its parent, perhaps the x_e is determined by the parity of s_v.\n\nWait, let's think for the root. The sum of x_e for its children edges must be 1 mod 2. Suppose that for each child c of the root, the x_e for the edge between root and c is 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at c is odd, and 0 otherwise. Then, the sum would be the number of children with odd-sized subtrees. But I don't know if this is the case.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: for each node v, the sum of x_e for edges in the subtree rooted at v must satisfy certain conditions. But I'm stuck.\n\nLet me think of the tree as a rooted tree. Let's perform a post-order traversal. For each node, after processing its children, we can determine the value of x_e for the edge between the node and its parent.\n\nLet me consider a leaf node (other than the root). For a leaf node v, which is not the root, the sum of x_e for edges incident to it is x_e_p (the edge to its parent) plus the sum for its children (which is zero, since it's a leaf). So x_e_p must be 1 mod 2. Hence, the edge between v and its parent must have x_e_p = 1. Which means that the weight is -1.\n\nBut if this is true, then for every leaf (except the root), the edge between it and its parent has weight -1. But what about the root? Let's think of a simple case.\n\nTake n=2. The tree is just an edge between 1 and 2. The root is 1. The leaf is 2. So the edge between 1 and 2 must have x_e = 1, hence weight -1. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother example: n=4, and the tree is a star with root 1 connected to 2, 3, 4. Each of 2, 3, 4 is a leaf. For each of them, the edge to the root must have x_e = 1. So the root's incident edges have x_e = 1 for each. The sum for the root is 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 = 1, which satisfies the condition. Hence, the edge weights are all -1. The path from 1 to 4 is just the single edge, so d(1,4) is -1. But in the third sample, for n=4, the sum is -10. But according to this, for each tree, the path from 1 to 4 would be the sum of the edges along that path. However, the sample says that there are 16 good trees, and the sum of d(1,4) is -10. But according to this reasoning, for the star-shaped tree, d(1,4) is -1. But there are other trees, like a chain 1-2-3-4. Let's see what happens there.\n\nIn a chain 1-2-3-4, the leaves are 1, 4 (but 1 is the root). Wait, no, if the tree is rooted at 1, then the leaves are 4 and 2? No, the tree is a straight line. Root is 1. Its child is 2. 2's child is 3. 3's child is 4. Leaves are 4 and 1? No, 1 is the root, and has only one child (2). So the leaves are 4 and 2? No, 2 has a child (3), so it's not a leaf. 3 has a child (4), so it's not a leaf. Only 4 is a leaf. So for node 4, the edge to its parent (3) must have x_e = 1 (weight -1). For node 3, the sum of x_e for its incident edges is x_3 (edge to 2) + x_4 (edge to 4) = 1 mod 2. We know x_4 is 1, so x_3 must be 0 mod 2. So x_3 is 0, meaning the weight is 1. For node 2, the sum of x_e for its incident edges is x_1 (edge to 1) + x_3 (edge to 3) = 1 mod 2. x_3 is 0, so x_1 must be 1 mod 2. Hence, x_1 is 1 (weight -1). Finally, for node 1, the sum of its incident edges (only x_1) is 1 mod 2. Which matches. So the edges are:\n\n1-2: -1\n\n2-3: 1\n\n3-4: -1\n\nThe path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4. The sum is -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1. So for this tree, d(1,4) is -1. But in the third sample, for n=4, the sum is -10. How does this fit?\n\nThe third sample says there are 16 good trees, and the sum is -10. So if each tree contributes -1, then the sum would be -16. But the sample says it's -10. So this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. Hence, there must be a mistake in my assumption.\n\nWait, what's wrong here? Let me recheck the example. For the chain tree 1-2-3-4, the edge weights are -1, 1, -1. The sum of d(1,4) is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. But according to the third sample, the sum for all 16 trees is -10. So if all trees contribute -1, then the sum would be -16, which contradicts the sample. So clearly, my earlier reasoning is wrong.\n\nThis suggests that the edge weights are not all -1 for leaves. So what's the error in my previous reasoning?\n\nAh, I assumed that for any leaf (except the root), the edge to its parent must be -1. But perhaps this is not always the case. Let me re-examine that.\n\nLet me take the case of the chain 1-2-3-4 again. Node 4 is a leaf. The sum of the edges incident to it is the edge between 3 and 4. So the sum is x_34. This must be 1 mod 2. Hence, x_34 is 1 (so weight -1). So that part is correct. Then, for node 3, the sum of edges incident to it is x_23 (edge to 2) + x_34 (edge to 4) = 1 mod 2. We know x_34 is 1, so x_23 must be 0 mod 2. So x_23 is 0 (weight 1). For node 2, the sum of edges incident to it is x_12 (edge to 1) + x_23 (edge to 3) = 1 mod 2. x_23 is 0, so x_12 must be 1 mod 2. Hence, x_12 is 1 (weight -1). For node 1, the sum of edges incident to it is x_12 = 1 mod 2, which satisfies the condition. So yes, the edge weights are -1, 1, -1. The sum d(1,4) is -1 + 1 -1 = -1.\n\nBut according to the third sample, for n=4, the sum of d(1,4) over all good trees is -10. So if there are 16 good trees, each contributing -1, the sum would be -16. But the sample says it's -10. So clearly, there are trees where the contribution is different. Hence, my previous reasoning about the edge weights is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the way I calculated the edge weights for the chain tree is wrong. Or perhaps I misunderstood the sample.\n\nWait, looking back at the third sample:\n\nInput is n=4, output is 998244343 which is -10 mod 998244353.\n\nThe note says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees. The sum of d(1,4) is -10. The breakdown is:\n\n-2 for 2 trees,\n\n-1 for 8 trees,\n\n0 for 4 trees,\n\n1 for 2 trees.\n\nTotal is 2*(-2) + 8*(-1) + 4*0 + 2*1 = -4 -8 + 0 + 2 = -10.\n\nSo there are trees where d(1,4) is -2, -1, 0, or 1. So the previous example of the chain tree must contribute -1. But why is there variation in the contributions?\n\nThis suggests that the edge weights depend on the structure of the tree. So the way to calculate d(1,n) varies depending on the tree's structure.\n\nThus, the earlier idea that each tree has a unique weighting is correct, but the sum d(1,n) depends on the tree's structure. Hence, we need to find a way to compute the sum over all trees of d(1,n) under their unique weighting.\n\nThis seems very challenging. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the unique weighting. Since each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges, the total number of -1 edges in the tree is equal to the sum over all vertices of (number of -1 edges incident to it) divided by 2. Because each edge is counted in two vertices. Since each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges, the total sum is n * (some odd number). But since n is even, the total sum is even. Hence, the total number of -1 edges is (sum of odd numbers for each vertex) / 2. For example, for n=2, each vertex has 1 -1 edge. Total sum is 2, divided by 2 is 1. Which matches.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the path from 1 to n. The sum d(1,n) is the sum of the weights along the path. Let me denote this sum as S. What is S mod 2? Since each weight is ±1, the sum S is equal to the number of -1 edges on the path minus the number of +1 edges on the path. Let me denote k as the number of -1 edges on the path, and m as the number of +1 edges. Then S = (m - k) = (m + k) - 2k = (length of path) - 2k. Since the length of the path is (number of edges on path), which is (distance between 1 and n). But since it's a tree, the distance between 1 and n is fixed for a given tree. However, the value of S depends on the number of -1 edges on the path.\n\nBut how to relate this to the constraints of the tree?\n\nLet me think about the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n. This product would be (-1)^k * 1^{m} = (-1)^k. But I don't know if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider the product of the weights of all edges incident to vertex 1. This product is -1. The product includes the edges along the path from 1 to n and other edges. Not sure.\n\nLet me think",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all good trees with $n$ vertices, where each edge is weighted either $1$ or $-1$, and each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight $-1$. The result should be returned modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: A tree is good if each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight $-1$. For such a tree to exist, $n$ must be even. If $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, so the result is 0.\n2. **Key Insight**: For even $n$, each tree structure has exactly one valid weighting that satisfies the conditions. This is derived from solving a system of linear equations over GF(2).\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of $d(1, n)$ for all good trees can be determined using combinatorial properties. The result for even $n$ is derived using modular arithmetic and properties of Cayley's formula.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # For even n >= 2\n    # The answer is (-1) * (n-1) * pow(n, n-2, MOD) * pow(2, n-1, MOD) % MOD\n    # Wait, but according to the sample for n=4, the answer is -10.\n    # Let me think again.\n    \n    # From the sample n=4: answer is -10.
