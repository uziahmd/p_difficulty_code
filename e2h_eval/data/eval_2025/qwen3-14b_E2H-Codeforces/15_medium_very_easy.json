They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So we have a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The results of each phase are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 0?), if s[i] is 0, then in that phase, the lower skill team wins; if it's 1, the higher skill team wins. Our task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out for each possible x, whether it's possible for it to win the tournament given the rules of the phases.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament works. The structure is like a binary tree. Each round, teams are paired, and based on the current phase's rule (s_i), the winner is determined. The problem is that the permutation p is arbitrary, except that it's a permutation of 1 to 2^n. But we need to find all x that can be the champion for some p.\n\nBut how do we model the possible paths for x to reach the final?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each x, determine the minimal and maximal possible positions it can take in the tournament based on the rules. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's consider that for each round, depending on the phase, the way the teams progress depends on their skill relative to others.\n\nBut since the permutation can be chosen, maybe we can model for each possible x, what's the necessary condition for it to be able to reach the final.\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. The tournament has n rounds. For example, when n=3, there are 3 rounds. The first round has 4 games (2^3-1=7 games total, but each round halves the number of teams). Wait, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, then next 2^{n-2}, etc., until the last phase which has 1 game.\n\nSo for each round (phase) i (starting from 0?), during that phase, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winner is determined based on the rule for that phase. The problem is that the initial arrangement of teams (the permutation) can be chosen in any way, but we need to find which x can be the champion.\n\nWait, but the initial arrangement of teams in the bracket matters. For example, the first phase's pairings are fixed as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. But the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. Wait, no. Wait, the teams are arranged in some order, but the problem says that the initial pairings are fixed as per the order. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"In the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on.\"\n\nSo the initial bracket is fixed. But the skill levels of the teams are given by the permutation p. However, the permutation can be chosen as needed. So the idea is that we can arrange the permutation p such that the team with skill x can win the tournament, given the rules of the phases.\n\nBut how to model this? Because the permutation determines the initial arrangement of skill levels in the bracket.\n\nSo for example, if the first phase is 1 (higher skill wins), then in the first round, each pair's winner is the one with higher skill. But if the first phase is 0, then lower skill wins.\n\nBut the permutation p is under our control. So for x to be the champion, we need to arrange the permutation such that, through the phases, x can win all matches.\n\nThe challenge is to find all x that can be champions for some permutation.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a function that, given a current round (say, level k, where k=0 is the first round, and k = n-1 is the final round), and the current set of possible candidates, determines which x can reach the final.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the constraints that x must satisfy in order to reach each round.\n\nLet me think about the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the way the teams progress depends on the phase's rule.\n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1?), the rule is determined by s[0]. Let's say that in phase i (assuming that the phases are numbered from 0 to n-1), the rule is s[i].\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. For example, for n=3, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: 8 teams → 4 winners\n\nRound 2: 4 teams → 2 winners\n\nRound 3: 2 teams → 1 champion.\n\nEach round corresponds to a phase. The first phase (i=0) is round 1, the second phase (i=1) is round 2, etc.\n\nSo for each round i (from 0 to n-1), the rule is s[i].\n\nNow, for x to be the champion, it must win all rounds. Let's think about what conditions x must satisfy in each round.\n\nIn each round, x must be able to win its match, given the rule for that round. However, the opponents in each round depend on how the bracket is structured and the choices made in previous rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation p, perhaps we can choose the opponents in such a way that x can win each round.\n\nLet me think for each round, what is the minimal and maximal possible skill that x can have to pass that round.\n\nWait, but the opponents are determined by the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first round, x is in a pair with another team. Depending on the rule of that phase, x must be either higher or lower than that opponent. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose which team is in that pair.\n\nBut how? Let's think for each round, what constraints are imposed on x's skill relative to other teams.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that in order to reach round i, x must have passed all previous rounds. For each round, the way x progresses depends on the rule of that round.\n\nLet me think about the first round (phase 0). The rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then in this round, x must be the stronger team in its match. So, in order to win this round, x must be higher than the other team in the pair. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose that other team to be any team with lower skill than x. However, for the rest of the tournament, those teams must be arranged in such a way that they don't interfere with x's path.\n\nBut perhaps the idea is that for each round, x must be able to have a certain relation to the other teams in its bracket. For example, in the first round, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its first opponent. But in the next round, the rule may be 0 (lower wins), so x must be lower than the opponent in that round. But again, the opponent in that round is the winner of another match. So, to have x win that round, x must be lower than the winner of that other match. But since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can arrange that the other match's winner is as high as possible or as low as possible, depending on the rule.\n\nBut how to model this for all rounds?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model for each round, the minimal and maximal possible skill that x can have, considering the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think for the final round. In the final round (phase n-1), there are two teams left. The rule for that phase is s[n-1]. So, x must be the winner of that match. So, for example, if s[n-1] is 1, then x must be higher than the other team. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose that other team to be any team with lower skill than x. But that team must have survived all previous rounds.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that x can reach the final? Let's think of it in terms of constraints. For x to be the champion, it must be able to pass through each round, and in each round, the rule determines whether x needs to be higher or lower than the opponent in that round.\n\nBut how can we model these constraints? Let me think for each round, what is the required relation between x and the other teams in the bracket.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node is a match between two winners of the subtrees. The structure of the tree is fixed.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can assign the skill levels to the leaves in such a way that x can win all matches along the path to the root.\n\nBut how to find the constraints on x's value?\n\nLet me think for each round, the number of teams that x must be compared to. For example, in the first round, x must beat one team. In the second round, x must beat another team, which in turn must have beaten someone else. And so on.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps for each round i (starting from 0), we can determine a range of values that x must be in, based on the rules of the rounds up to that point.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for a tournament with k rounds (so 2^k teams), and a string s of length k, the possible x's that can be champions are determined by the rules of each round.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as follows. For each round, depending on the rule (s[i]), x must be either the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{i+1} teams. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as requiring that in each round, x must be the \"winner\" of its bracket according to the rule of that round. For example, in the first round (phase 0), the rule is s[0]. So, in order to proceed to the next round, x must be the winner of its pair. Then, in the next round (phase 1), the rule is s[1], and x must be the winner of its pair in that round, which consists of two teams from the previous round.\n\nBut how can we model the required constraints for x?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round i (from 0 to n-1), we can compute the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have, considering the rules up to that round.\n\nFor example, in the first round (i=0):\n\nIf s[0] is '1', then in order to win the first round, x must be higher than the other team in its pair. Since we can choose that other team to be any team with lower skill, but we need to make sure that in the next rounds, x can continue to win. However, for the first round, the only constraint is that x must be higher than at least one other team. But since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange that x is the maximum in its pair. But then, in the next rounds, the constraints will depend on the rules.\n\nAlternatively, think about the required constraints for x to be able to win all rounds. Let's think about the entire tournament. For x to be the champion, in each round, the rule determines whether x must be the higher or lower in the match. But since the opponents in each round are determined by the structure of the tournament, perhaps the minimal and maximal possible values of x can be determined based on the rules of the rounds.\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each round i (starting from 0), the rule is s[i]. Let's imagine that in order to reach the final, x must have passed through all rounds. For each round, the way x progresses depends on the rule.\n\nLet me think of the rounds in reverse. For example, in the final round (round n-1), the rule is s[n-1]. To win that round, x must be either higher or lower than the other finalist. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other finalist to be any team that can reach that round. But how?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. For each round, the required skill of x depends on the rules of the rounds that come after it. For example, in the first round, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its first opponent. But in the next rounds, depending on the rules, x might need to be lower than others. So perhaps, for each round, we can track the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose that for a tournament with m rounds (original problem has n rounds), the possible x must be in a certain range. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet's define for a tournament with k rounds (so 2^k teams) and a string s of length k, the minimal and maximal possible x that can be champion. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each round i, the number of teams that x must be compared to in that round is 2^{i} teams. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the path that x takes through the tournament. For each round, x must be the winner of its match. Let's think about the constraints for each round.\n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 0), the rule is s[0]. Let's assume that s[0] is '1' (higher wins). Then, x must be higher than the team it faces in that round. Since we can choose the permutation, we can choose that team to be any team with lower skill than x. However, in the next rounds, x must face the winner of another match. For example, in the second round (phase 1), the rule is s[1]. If s[1] is '0' (lower wins), then x must be lower than the opponent in that round. But that opponent is the winner of another match in the first round. So, for that opponent to be higher than x, but in their own match, they must have won according to the rule of phase 1. Wait, no. Wait, the rule for phase 1 applies to the second round. So, during phase 1, the matches are between the winners of phase 0's matches. For x to win in phase 1, according to the rule s[1], x must be either higher or lower than its opponent in that round.\n\nSo, for example, if s[1] is '0', then in the second round, x must be lower than its opponent. But that opponent is the winner of a match in phase 0. How can we arrange that opponent's skill level?\n\nSince we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponents in each round. So, for x to be able to win in each round, we need to arrange that in each round, the opponent is such that x satisfies the rule for that round.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think for each round, what is the required relation between x and the other teams in the bracket.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building constraints on x. For example, in each round i, the rule s[i] determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{i+1} teams. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a series of layers. For x to be the champion, in each layer (round), it must be the winner of its match according to the rule. For the first round, the number of teams is 2^n. The first round splits them into 2^{n-1} matches. For x to win its match, it must be either higher or lower than its opponent, depending on the rule. Then, in the next round, the number of teams is 2^{n-1}, and so on.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, perhaps for each round, x can be placed in a position where it can win according to the rule, by ensuring that in each round, there are enough teams that are either higher or lower than x, depending on the rule.\n\nThis feels similar to the problem where you have to find the minimal or maximal possible value based on certain conditions.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round, depending on the rule, the x must be either the minimum or maximum in a certain subset of teams. Let me think recursively.\n\nSuppose we have a function that returns the range of possible values for x to be the champion in a tournament of size 2^k teams, given the rules s[0...k-1]. Let's call this range [lo, hi]. How can we compute this range?\n\nFor example, for k=1 (only one round, two teams), the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then the higher skill wins. So x must be the higher of the two, which means x can be 2 (since the permutation is 1 and 2). Wait, but in this case, the possible x is 2. Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x can be 1. So the range is [1, 1] or [2, 2].\n\nBut for larger k, how to compute the range?\n\nLet's think for k=2. The tournament has 4 teams. There are two rounds. The first round (phase 0) has 2 matches. The second round (phase 1) has 1 match.\n\nSuppose the rules are s = \"10\". So phase 0 is higher wins, phase 1 is lower wins.\n\nTo find the possible x's:\n\nIn phase 0, x must be higher than its opponent. So, in the first round, x must be higher than one other team. Then, in phase 1, x must be lower than the other finalist. But that finalist is the winner of another first-round match. Since the rule for phase 1 is lower wins, the finalist must be lower than x. So x must be higher than the other finalist. Wait, no. Because during phase 1, the rule is lower wins. So the winner is the one with lower skill. So x must be lower than the other finalist. Therefore, x must be lower than the other finalist. But that finalist must have passed phase 0. Since phase 0 rule is higher wins, that finalist must be higher than its first-round opponent.\n\nBut how can we arrange this? Let's imagine that in phase 0, x beats its opponent (so x is higher than that opponent). The other finalist is someone who also won their first-round match (so they are higher than their opponent). Then, in phase 1, x must be lower than that other finalist. So x must be lower than that finalist. So the finalist must be higher than x. But how can we arrange this?\n\nLet me think of possible x values. Let's say the teams are 1, 2, 3, 4. Suppose x is 3. Can we arrange the bracket so that 3 is the champion?\n\nIn phase 0, 3 must be higher than its first opponent. Let's say 3 is in a match against 1. 3 wins. The other match could be between 2 and 4, where 4 wins. Then, in phase 1, the rule is lower wins. So 3 (skill 3) vs 4 (skill 4). The lower is 3, so 3 wins. So yes. So x=3 is possible.\n\nAnother example: x=2. Can it be the champion?\n\nIn phase 0, x=2 must beat its opponent. So opponent must be 1. Then, in phase 1, the other finalist is someone who beat their opponent. Let's say the other finalist is 4. Then, phase 1 rule is lower wins. 2 is lower than 4, so 2 wins. So yes. So x=2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, x=4: in phase 0, it must beat its opponent. Suppose it's paired with 1. Then, in phase 1, the other finalist is 3. Then, phase 1 rule is lower wins. 3 is lower than 4, so 3 would win. So 4 can't be champion. So x=4 is not possible. So for this case, the possible x's are 2, 3.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nLet me think of the ranges. For each round, the required conditions are that x must be in a certain range based on the rules of the rounds.\n\nAnother observation: the tournament can be viewed as a series of layers. For each layer (phase), the rule determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in a group of size 2^{layer+1}.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each round i (starting from 0), the rule is s[i]. The number of teams in the tournament at that round is 2^{n - i} teams. For x to reach the next round, it must be either the maximum or minimum in its group of two teams (the match in that round). However, for the subsequent rounds, the same logic applies.\n\nBut how to model the cumulative effect of all rounds?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for a tournament of depth k (with 2^k teams), and a string of rules s, the possible x must be in a certain range. Let's denote this range as [low, high]. How to compute this range?\n\nFor the base case (k=1), the tournament has two teams. The rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then x must be higher than the other team. Since the other team can be any value except x, the possible x is the maximum possible value (since we can arrange the permutation so that x is the higher one). Wait, but the permutation is of numbers 1 to 2^k. For k=1, the possible x can be 2 if s[0] is '1', or 1 if it's '0'.\n\nBut for general k, let's think: the tournament has two subtournaments of depth k-1. For x to reach the final, it must win its subtree (based on the rules of the first phase) and then win the final match (based on the rule of the last phase).\n\nWait, maybe the way to think is that for each round, depending on the rule, x must be the min or max in its group of 2^{i+1} teams. For example, in the first round (i=0), the group is 2 teams. In the second round (i=1), the group is 4 teams. And so on. So, for each round i, x must be the min or max of the group of 2^{i+1} teams, depending on the rule s[i].\n\nBut how does this work? Let me think for the example I had earlier with n=2, s=10. The possible x's are 2 and 3.\n\nIn this case, for the first round (i=0, rule is 1: max), x must be the max in its group of 2 teams. For the second round (i=1, rule is 0: min), x must be the min in its group of 4 teams. Wait, but the group of 4 teams would include the two groups of 2 teams. But how can x be the min of the entire group of 4 teams? Because x is the max of its group of 2, but then in the next round, it's the min of the group of 4.\n\nThat seems contradictory. Unless there's some way to balance the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe for each round, the group size is 2^{k - i} teams, where k is the total number of rounds. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For x to be the champion, during each round i, the rule s[i] determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in the group of teams that it has to compete against in that round. For example, during round i, x is part of a group of 2^{i+1} teams. Because in each round, the number of teams is halved. So for round 0 (first round), there are 2^n teams, and each group is 2 teams. For round 1, there are 2^{n-1} teams, and each group is 4 teams. Wait, no. Wait, during round i, there are 2^{n-i} teams, and each match is between two teams. So the group size for that round's match is 2 teams. But the entire bracket for that round's match would be 2^{n - i} teams. Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut here's a different idea. Let's imagine that for each round i, the rule determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in the set of teams that it has to beat in that round. But since the tournament is a single-elimination bracket, each round requires x to beat one team. However, the choice of which teams are in the bracket depends on the permutation.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal and maximal possible x can be determined by considering for each round i, the required comparison. For example:\n\nLet's process the rounds from first to last. For each round, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum of a certain number of teams.\n\nLet me think of it as follows:\n\nInitially, for the first round (phase 0), the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then x must be higher than one other team. So, there must be at least one team with lower skill than x. Since the permutation can be arranged, this is always possible unless x is 1. But since x can be any value, but we need to find all x that can be champion. However, for later rounds, there might be more constraints.\n\nBut for the second round (phase 1), the rule is s[1]. Let's say s[1] is '0', meaning lower wins. So, in this round, x must be lower than the opponent. But that opponent is the winner of another match in phase 0. Which implies that the opponent must be higher than its own opponent in phase 0. So, for x to be lower than that opponent, x must be lower than some team that is higher than someone else. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose that opponent to be higher than x, but also ensure that x can win in phase 0.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems complex.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the example:\n\nLet me think of the following: for each round i, the required condition is that x must be either the minimum or maximum in a certain number of teams. For example, for the first round, if the rule is 1, then x must be the maximum in its pair. For the second round, if the rule is 0, then x must be the minimum in its pair of two teams (which are the winners of two first-round matches). But how many teams are in that pair's group? Well, in the second round, each match is between two teams that each won their first-round matches. So, for x to be the minimum in its second-round match, there must be another team that is higher than x, and that team must have been the maximum in their first-round match.\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange for that other team to be as high as possible, and x to be as low as possible, as long as the constraints are met.\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each round, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of the following recursive formula:\n\nLet’s say that for a tournament with k rounds, and a string of rules s, the possible x must be in a range [lo, hi]. \n\nFor the base case, when k=1, if s[0] is '1', then x must be the maximum of two teams, which can be any value from 2 to 2^1 (since the permutation is of 1 and 2). Wait, but for k=1, there are two teams. So the possible x is 2 if s[0] is '1' (because x must be higher than the other team). If s[0] is '0', then x must be the lower, so x is 1.\n\nSo for k=1, the range is [2,2] if s[0] is '1', else [1,1].\n\nNow for k=2. Suppose the rules are s[0] and s[1]. Let's say for the first round (s[0] is '1'), then in the second round (s[1] is '0').\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must:\n\n- Win the first round by being higher than its opponent (so x must be higher than at least one team).\n\n- In the second round, it must be lower than its opponent. But that opponent is the winner of another first-round match, which was determined by s[0] (higher wins). So that opponent must be higher than its own first-round opponent.\n\nSo, for x to be lower than that opponent, x must be lower than someone who is higher than someone else. But how to find the range of x?\n\nIn this case, the opponent in the second round can be any team that is higher than someone else (so at least 2), and x must be lower than that. So x can be anything from 1 up to (max possible value of opponent - 1). But what is the max possible value of the opponent?\n\nThe opponent is the winner of their first-round match, which is higher than their first-round opponent. Since we can arrange the permutation, the opponent can be as high as possible. For example, if x is 2, then the opponent can be 3, which is higher than 1 (their first-round opponent). Then, in the second round, x=2 is lower than 3, so wins.\n\nBut how to compute the range for x in this scenario.\n\nLet me think recursively. For the second round, the rule is '0' (lower wins). So, during this round, x must be the minimum of the two teams in the match. Those two teams are winners of their first-round matches (which were decided by rule '1', higher wins). \n\nSo, for x to be the minimum of the two, it must be that x is the minimum between itself and another team that is the maximum of its first-round match. \n\nThus, x must be less than that other team. But since the other team can be any value that is higher than at least one other team (so >=2), then x can be as high as (some value) as long as there exists a higher value in the tournament.\n\nBut since the tournament has 4 teams, the maximum possible x is 4. However, for x to be the minimum between itself and another team, that other team must be higher than x. But also, that other team must have been the maximum in their first-round match.\n\nSo, for example, x can be 2 or 3. If x is 3, then the other team can be 4 (which is the max of their first-round match). Then, in the second round, 3 is lower than 4, so wins. If x is 2, the other team can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo for this case, the possible x's are 2 and 3.\n\nNow, how to generalize this. For the second round, the rule is '0', which means that x must be the minimum of the two teams in that round. But those two teams are the maximum of their first-round matches (because the first round's rule is '1').\n\nSo, the other team in the second round is a maximum of some group of 2 teams. Thus, for x to be the minimum between itself and that other team, x must be less than that other team. But since that other team can be any value that is at least 2 (as it's the maximum of two teams), x can be up to (max possible value - 1). But the max possible value is 4 in this case. So x can be up to 3.\n\nBut how to combine this with the first round's requirement.\n\nIn the first round, x must be the maximum of its two teams. So x must be at least 2 (since it's the maximum of two teams). Combining with the second round's requirement (x must be less than some other team which is at least 2), then x can be from 2 to 3.\n\nSo the range is [2, 3].\n\nSo for this case, the answer is 2 and 3, which matches the earlier example.\n\nSo, the general approach seems to be:\n\nFor each round, based on the rule, we determine whether x must be the minimum or maximum in a certain group. These groups are determined by the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nBut how to model this recursively?\n\nLet me think of the following recurrence:\n\nLet’s define for a tournament with k rounds (i.e., 2^k teams), and the rules s[0..k-1], the possible x's must be in a range [lo, hi].\n\nFor k=1, as discussed earlier.\n\nFor k>1:\n\nThe tournament is divided into two subtournaments of k-1 rounds each. The winner of each subtournament proceeds to the final round (k-th round).\n\nIn the final round, the rule is s[k-1]. So, the winner is determined based on that rule.\n\nBut how does this affect the range of x?\n\nLet me think. For x to be the champion, it must be the winner of its subtournament (of k-1 rounds), and then win the final round.\n\nBut the subtournament's rules are s[0..k-2], and the final round's rule is s[k-1].\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be in the range [lo1, hi1] for its subtournament, and then in the final round, it must be able to beat the winner of the other subtournament.\n\nLet me think of the final round. Suppose that the rule is '1' (higher wins). Then, x must be higher than the winner of the other subtournament. But the winner of the other subtournament is in the range [lo2, hi2] for that subtournament. Since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange that the other subtournament's winner is as small as possible (so that x can be higher than it), or as large as possible (if needed).\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that x can be higher than the other winner? Since the other winner's range is [lo2, hi2], x must be higher than the minimum of that range. Or wait, perhaps not. Because the other winner can be any value in [lo2, hi2], and we can choose it to be as small as possible to allow x to be higher.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that x can beat the other winner, x must be greater than the minimum possible value of the other winner's range. Or, if the rule is '1', then x must be greater than the other winner. To make this possible, x must be greater than the minimum possible value of the other winner's range. But since the other winner's range is [lo2, hi2], the minimum possible value is lo2. So x must be > lo2. However, since the other winner can be chosen to be as small as possible, we can arrange for x to be greater than that.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Perhaps the correct way to model it is:\n\nFor the final round, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum of the two subtournament winners. So:\n\nIf the final round's rule is '1' (higher wins), then x must be higher than the other winner. To ensure that this is possible, x must be in the range [lo1, hi1], and there exists a value in the other subtournament's range [lo2, hi2] that is less than x. Since the other subtournament's range includes values from lo2 to hi2, the minimal value is lo2. So, as long as x > lo2, it's possible. But since we can choose the other subtournament's winner to be lo2, we can arrange for x to be higher than that.\n\nSimilarly, if the final round's rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be lower than the other winner. So x must be < hi2 (since the other winner can be as high as hi2).\n\nBut how does this affect the overall range for x?\n\nLet me think of the overall range for x. The x must be in the range [lo1, hi1] (from its own subtournament), and also satisfy the condition based on the final round's rule.\n\nSo, combining these:\n\nIf the final round's rule is '1', then x must be > the minimum possible value of the other subtournament's range. The other subtournament's range is [lo2, hi2]. The minimum possible value is lo2. So x must be > lo2. Since x is in [lo1, hi1], the combined condition is that lo1 > lo2, or that x's range overlaps with values greater than lo2.\n\nBut since the other subtournament's range is independent of x's, perhaps we need to find the intersection between [lo1, hi1] and (lo2, infinity) if the rule is '1', or (-infinity, hi2) if the rule is '0'.\n\nBut how can we compute this without knowing the other subtournament's range?\n\nAh, but since both subtournaments are identical in structure (same rules s[0..k-2], but the other subtournament's range is the same as the current one's. Wait, no. Because the subtournament's range depends on the rules. For example, for the two subtournaments, they have the same rules s[0..k-2], so their ranges are the same. So, for both subtournaments, the range is [lo, hi].\n\nTherefore, the other subtournament's range is also [lo, hi]. Thus,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can become the champion of a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves analyzing the constraints imposed by each phase's rule and determining the valid range of skill levels that can potentially win the tournament.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `2^n` teams and proceeds through `n` phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half, with the winner determined by the rule specified for that phase (either higher or lower skill level wins).\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, we calculate the range of possible skill levels that a team must have to progress through that phase. This is done recursively, considering both the current phase's rule and the results from previous phases.\n3. **Recursive Function**: We use a recursive approach to determine the valid range of skill levels for a team to win the tournament. The base case is when there is only one team (no matches needed), and the recursive step considers the constraints from each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    def get_range(k, rules):\n        if k == 0:\n            # Only one team, no matches\n            return (1, 2**0)\n        else:\n            # Recursively compute the range for the subtournament\n            sub_lo, sub_hi = get_range(k-1, rules[:-1])\n            current_rule = rules[-1]\n            if current_rule == '1':\n                # Need to be higher than the other winner\n                # Other winner's range is [sub_lo, sub_hi], so x must be > sub_lo\n                # So the new lo is sub_lo + 1, hi is 2^k\n                new_lo = sub_lo + 1\n                new_hi = 2**k\n            else:\n                # Need to be lower than the other winner\n                # Other winner's range is [sub_lo, sub_hi], so x must be < sub_hi\n                # So the new lo is 1, hi is sub_hi - 1\n                new_lo = 1\n                new_hi = sub_hi - 1\n            return (new_lo, new_hi)\n    \n    lo, hi = get_range(n, s)\n    result = []\n    for x in range(lo, hi + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case Handling**: When there is only one team (`k == 0`), the range is trivially from 1 to 1 since there are no matches.\n2. **Recursive Calculation**: For each phase, we recursively determine the valid range for the subtournament (with one fewer phase). Depending on the rule of the current phase, we adjust the range:\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), the valid range for the current phase is adjusted to ensure the team is higher than the minimum possible value from the subtournament.\n   - If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), the valid range is adjusted to ensure the team is lower than the maximum possible value from the subtournament.\n3. **Result Construction**: After determining the valid range for `n` phases, we generate all integers within this range and print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the valid skill levels using recursion and range adjustments based on the tournament rules, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
