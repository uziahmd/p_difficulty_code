There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with a specific rule. The rule says that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to figure out, given n players, what's the maximum possible games the winner can have.\n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the opponent (player 3) has zero games played. The winner has already played one game. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So output is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Why? Because if you arrange it as two initial matches (like 1 vs 2 and 3 vs 4), then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has two games. If you tried to have the winner play three games, that would require three matches. But how? Let's see. Let's imagine the winner plays three games. Each time, the opponent must have either same number of games or differ by one. Let's think: first game, the winner plays someone (say, player 2). Then, second game, he needs to play someone who has either 0 or 1 games. Suppose he plays player 3. Now, after two games, he has two games. Then for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how? The other players would have to have played enough games. But with four players, maybe there's not enough players to allow that. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the question is, for a given n, find the maximum possible number of games the winner can have.\n\nLet me think about the general approach. Let's denote the maximum number of games as k. The winner has to play k games, which implies that in each of those games, the opponent must meet the condition. How can we model this?\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have a number of games that's either equal to the winner's current count or one less. Wait, because the winner's current count before the game is, say, m. The opponent's count must be either m-1, m, or m+1? No, wait. The rule says that the two players can play only if their number of games already played differs by no more than one. So when the winner is about to play their (m+1)th game, the opponent must have either m-1, m, or m games? Wait, no. Let's think: suppose the winner has already played m games. Then the opponent must have played either m-1, m, or m+1 games? No, because the difference between the two must be no more than one. So if the winner has played m games, the opponent must have played m-1, m, or m+1 games? But that's impossible unless the opponent has already played m-1, m, or m+1 games. However, since the winner is the one who's winning all their games, the opponents in each game must have lost, so they are eliminated. So for the winner's k-th game, the opponent must have played some number of games that's within one of the winner's current count.\n\nBut how can we model the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for the winner to have k games, there must be a certain number of players. Let's find the minimal n that allows the winner to have k games. Then, given n, find the maximum k such that the minimal n for k is ≤ given n.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number? Because each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let me think.\n\nLet me think about how the winner can reach k games. For example:\n\nTo have 1 game, you need 2 players. That's the base case.\n\nFor 2 games: the winner plays two games. For the first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. Let's say the winner plays against someone who has 1 game. How can that happen? That person must have played one game before. So, that requires that there's another player who has played once. So, for the second game, the winner's opponent must have played once. So that would require that there's another match that was played. So, the total number of players needed would be 2 + 1 = 3? Because in the first game, the winner plays against player 2. Then, the second game, the winner plays against player 3, who has to have played once. How does player 3 get to have played once? He must have played against someone else. But that would require another player. So for example, if there are three players, the first game is between 1 and 2. Then, player 3 has to play someone. But there's no one else. So maybe that's not possible. Wait, but the example for n=3 gives output 2, which implies that the winner can have 2 games. How?\n\nAh, maybe the way the tournament is structured allows for the opponent in the second game to have 0 games. For example, the winner plays against player 2 (first game, 1 game played). Then, the winner plays against player 3, who hasn't played any games. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So in that case, the winner has two games. So the total players is 3. So the minimal number of players for k=2 is 3.\n\nBut for k=3, what's the minimal number of players? Let's think. The winner plays 3 games. Let's think of the structure:\n\nThe third game must be against an opponent who has either 2, 1, or 3 games. But since the winner has already played two games before this third one, the opponent must have 1, 2, or 3 games. But the opponent can't have 3 games because that would require them to have won two games already, which would require that they have played two matches. But the winner is the only one who can have that many wins. So perhaps the opponent has 2 games. How can that happen?\n\nSo, for the third game, the winner's opponent has played 2 games. That means that opponent must have had two wins. So, that requires that there's a subtree where that opponent has two wins. So, the minimal number of players would be something like 3 (for the first two games) plus the players needed for the opponent's two games. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of it as a Fibonacci sequence. Let f(k) be the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games. Then:\n\nFor k=0, f(0) = 1 (but that's not relevant here).\n\nFor k=1, f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2, f(2) = 3. Because the winner has two games. The first game is against one player, and the second game is against another player (who has 0 games). But how does that work? Wait, the opponent in the second game has 0 games, which is allowed because the winner has 1 game (difference is 1).\n\nBut for the next step, to have k=3, the winner must play a third game. The opponent in that game must have played 2 or 1 or 0 games. But the winner has already played 2 games. So the opponent must have played 2, 1, or 3 games. But the opponent can't have 3 games (since that would require them to have won 3 games, which would require more players). So the opponent could have 2 games. How do we get that opponent?\n\nThat opponent must have had two wins. So that requires that they have a path of two games. So the minimal players would be f(2) (the players needed for the opponent's two games) plus the players needed for the winner's previous games. Wait, maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because for the winner's k-th game, the opponent must have played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). And that opponent requires f(k-1) players. But the winner's previous games would require f(k-1) players? Or perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let me think:\n\nFor example, to get k=3, the winner's third game is against an opponent who has played 2 games. That opponent requires f(2) players. But the winner's first two games must have been against players that are part of the structure. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is the sum of the minimal players required for k-1 and k-2. Because in order to have a player that can play against the winner in their k-th game, that player must have played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). So that player's subtree requires f(k-1) players. But the winner's first k-1 games must have been arranged such that they can reach that. So the total number of players is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n\nThis seems familiar. Let's check with the earlier examples.\n\nFor k=1: f(1)=2.\n\nk=2: f(2)=f(1)+f(0)? But what is f(0)? Well, maybe f(0) = 1. So f(2)=2+1=3, which matches the example.\n\nk=3: f(3)=f(2)+f(1) = 3+2=5. So for 5 players, the winner can have 3 games. Let's see. For example, the structure would be:\n\nFirst, the winner plays against someone (player 2). Then, the winner plays against someone who has 1 game. How? That someone must have played once. Let's say player 3 and 4 play first, then the winner plays against the winner of that. Then, the winner has 2 games. Then, for the third game, the opponent must have 2 games. How? Let's say there's another subtree where someone has 2 games. For example, the winner's third game is against a player who had two games. So maybe the initial setup is:\n\nPlayers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nFirst, 1 vs 2 (winner is 1, 1 game).\n\nThen, 3 vs 4 (winner is 3, 1 game). Then, 1 vs 3 (winner is 1, 2 games). Now, for the third game, the opponent must have 2 games. How?\n\nMaybe there's another player, 5, who has to have played two games. But how? For that, 5 would have to have played two games, meaning that he had to have two wins. But that would require another player. Wait, maybe the structure is more complex. For example, the third game's opponent could be someone who had two wins. Let's imagine:\n\nIn the first round, 1 vs 2 (1 wins). Then, 3 vs 4 (3 wins). Then, 5 vs someone. But there's no one else. So that's not possible. So perhaps the minimal number of players for k=3 is 5. Let me think of the structure.\n\nMaybe the winner's path is:\n\nGame 1: 1 vs 2 (winner 1, 1 game)\n\nGame 2: 1 vs 3 (winner 1, 2 games). But for this to be allowed, the opponent (3) must have played 1 game (since 1 has played 1 game). How did 3 get to play 1 game? He must have played against someone else. So, in the first round, 3 vs 4, and 3 wins. Then, in the second round, 1 vs 3. Then, the winner has 2 games.\n\nThen, for the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games. So, how can we get that? Let's say there's another player, 5. But to have played 2 games, he must have had two wins. So, for example, player 5 plays against player 6, then wins, then plays against player 7, then wins. But that would take more players. But if the minimal is 5 players, how?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is that for the third game, the opponent is someone who has played two games. So, for example, the winner (1) has to play against someone who has two games. Let's say that the opponent is player 5, who has played two games. How can that happen?\n\nPlayer 5 must have played two games, which implies that he had two wins. So, for that, he must have played two matches. For example, in the first round, player 5 plays against player 2 (but 2 has already lost to 1). Hmm, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the tournament is structured in a way that allows for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal players for k=3 is 5. Let's think of the structure as follows:\n\nThe winner (1) needs to play three games. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (game count 1).\n\nSecond game: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins (game count 2). For this to be allowed, 3 must have played 1 game (so he played against someone else, like 4, and won). Then, the third game: 1 vs 5. But 5 has to have played 2 games. How?\n\nWait, 5 must have played two games. So he has to have two wins. So, maybe in the first round, 5 plays against 4 (wins), then in the second round, he plays against 3 (wins). Then, in the third round, he plays against 1. So the total players is 5. So, the structure would be:\n\nRound 1: 2 vs 1 (1 wins), 3 vs 4 (3 wins), 5 vs ... but there's no one else. Wait, with 5 players, there's 5 players. So maybe the initial matches are:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (game count 1).\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins (game count 1).\n\nMatch 3: 5 vs someone. But there's no one else. So that's not possible. So maybe the initial matches are different.\n\nAlternatively, the first round has 1 vs 2 (1 wins), and 3 vs 5 (3 wins), and 4 vs someone. But with 5 players, that's not possible. Maybe the first round has 1 vs 2, and 3 vs 4. Then, the winners are 1 and 3. Then, the next round is 1 vs 3. But that's the second game for 1, and the first for 3. So then, 1 has 2 games. Now, for the third game, 1 has to play against someone who has 2 or 1 games. How?\n\nIf there's a player 5, who has played 1 game (he played against someone else). But how? For example, maybe in the first round, player 5 is not playing. But then he hasn't played any games. So, if the tournament is structured in a way that 5 is not involved until later. But that's not possible. Because the tournament is a knockout, so all players except the winner are eliminated. So, for 5 players, the tournament would have to have 4 matches (since each match eliminates one player, and you need to eliminate 4 players to have a winner). So, the structure could be:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins.\n\nMatch 3: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins (now 1 has 2 games).\n\nMatch 4: 1 vs 5 → 1 wins (now 1 has 3 games). But for match 4, the opponent (5) has 0 games. The difference is 2 (since 1 has 2 games). Which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nSo, how can the third game be arranged?\n\nAh, perhaps the opponent in the third game must have played 1 game. So, for example, in match 3, the winner (1) plays against someone who has 1 game. But how?\n\nLet me think of a different structure. Suppose the initial matches are:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 5 → 1 wins (game count 1).\n\nMatch 2: 2 vs 3 → 2 wins (game count 1).\n\nMatch 3: 4 vs someone. Not sure. Maybe this isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for k=3 is 5, but the way the matches are arranged is more complex. For example, the winner's third game is against a player who has 2 games. How?\n\nLet's think of the following scenario:\n\nThe winner (player 1) needs to have 3 games. The first game is against player 2 (wins). Second game is against player 3 (who has 1 game, meaning he won a previous game). Third game is against player 4, who has 2 games. How can player 4 have 2 games?\n\nPlayer 4 must have played two games. So, for example, in the first round, player 4 plays against player 5 (and wins). Then, in the second round, player 4 plays against player 3 (and wins). So, player 4 has 2 games. Then, the third round, player 1 (with 2 games) plays against player 4 (with 2 games). So, the difference is 0, allowed. So, in this case, the total players is 5.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (game count 1).\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 5 → 3 wins (game count 1).\n\nMatch 3: 4 vs 5? No, wait. Let me reorganize.\n\nWait, the initial matches would be:\n\nMatch 1: 2 vs 5 → 2 wins (game count 1). Then, match 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins (game count 1). Then, match 3: 1 vs 2 (player 1 has 0 games, player 2 has 1. Difference is 1, allowed. 1 wins, now has 1 game. Then, match 4: 1 vs 3 (player 1 has 1 game, player 3 has 1 game. Allowed. 1 wins, now has 2 games. Then, match 5: 4 vs someone. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. The minimal number of players required for k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because to get to the k-th game, the winner must have played against an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). The opponent's subtree requires f(k-1) players. But the winner's previous games would require f(k-1) players? Or maybe the winner's previous games up to k-1 steps require f(k-1) players. But then, the total would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because for the winner's k-th game, the opponent must have played k-1 games (so that's f(k-1) players) and the winner's prior games up to k-1 steps would require f(k-1) players? Or perhaps not. Maybe the winner's prior games up to k-1 steps would require f(k-1) players, but the opponent's subtree requires f(k-1) players? That doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, think of f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have exactly k games. For the winner to have k games, the last game is against someone who has played k-1 games (since the winner has played k-1 games before that match, and the opponent has played k-1 games, which is allowed). So the opponent's path requires f(k-1) players. Also, the winner's path up to the previous game (k-1 games) requires f(k-1) players? No, because that's the same as the opponent's. But how can that be?\n\nWait, perhaps the winner's path to k games is built by having two subtrees: one where the winner has played k-1 games, and another where the opponent has played k-1 games. But that would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because for the k-th game, the opponent must have played k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players. But before that, the winner must have played k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players. But that would imply that f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-1) = 2*f(k-1), which is not matching the earlier examples. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, think that for the winner to have k games, the first k-1 games must be arranged such that the winner can reach k-1 games, and then the k-th game is against someone who has played k-1 games. But how does that fit into the formula?\n\nLet me think again. For the winner to have k games, the last game is against an opponent who has played (k-1) games. Because the winner has played (k-1) games before that, and the opponent has played (k-1) games. So the difference is 0, which is allowed. So, the opponent's subtree requires f(k-1) players. But the winner's own path to reach (k-1) games requires f(k-1) players. However, the winner's path and the opponent's path are separate. So the total number of players is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-1) ? But that would make f(k) = 2*f(k-1), which for k=2 would be 2*2=4, but earlier example shows that for k=2, f(2) is 3. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent's subtree requires f(k-1) players, and the winner's path before the last game requires f(k-1) players. But that would be overlapping. Maybe the winner's path to reach the k-th game requires that he has played k-1 games. To reach that, the minimal number of players is f(k-1). And the opponent's path requires f(k-1) players. But since the winner and the opponent are separate, the total is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-1) - 1? Because the winner is counted in both parts. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's see:\n\nAssume that for the winner to have k games, he must have played a game against someone who has played k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players. But before that, the winner had to have played k-1 games. To reach that, the winner's previous path required f(k-1) players. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the winner's path to get to k-1 games requires f(k-1) players, and the opponent's path requires f(k-2) players? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a binary tree. Each time the winner plays a game, it's a node in the tree. The winner's path is a chain of length k. Each game in this chain requires that the opponent has a certain number of games. So for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. For the second game, the opponent has 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, the opponent should have 1 game, which would require that opponent to have a path of length 1. So the minimal number of players for k=2 is 2 + 1 = 3 (the winner's first opponent and the opponent's subtree). For k=3, the winner's third game's opponent has 2 games. That requires that opponent's subtree has 3 players (as per k=2). And the winner's previous games (up to 2 games) require 3 players. But adding them together would be 3 + 3 = 6, but subtracting 1 for the winner? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players for k is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute Fibonacci numbers. Let's define Fib(0) = 1, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 2, Fib(3) = 3, Fib(4) = 5, Fib(5) = 8, etc. \n\nFor k=1, the minimal n is 2. Which is Fib(3) = 2?\n\nIf Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) = 5, Fib(6)=8, etc. Then for k=1, the minimal n is Fib(3) = 2. For k=2, Fib(4) = 3. For k=3, Fib(5) =5. For k=4, Fib(6)=8. So yes, the minimal n for k is Fib(k+2). \n\nIf this is the case, then the problem becomes: given n, find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nSo for example, for n=3, Fib(4) is 3, so k=2. For n=4, Fib(5) is 5 which is larger than 4, so the maximum k is 2 (since Fib(4) is 3 <=4). For n=5, Fib(5)=5, so k=3. \n\nSo the approach would be to find the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n. \n\nBut how to compute this for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18, then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list of Fibonacci numbers to find the maximum k.\n\nLet's check the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2: 3 → Output 2. Fib(4) is 3. So k=2.\n\nSample Input 4: 4. The Fib numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,... So Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5. Since 5>4, the maximum k is 2 (Fib(4) =3 ≤4). So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 10: the Fib numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13... For k=4, Fib(6)=8 ≤10. Fib(7)=13>10. So maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nYes! So the answer is to find the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo the problem reduces to generating the Fibonacci sequence until it exceeds 1e18, then for each input n, find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nNow, let's generate the Fib numbers. Let's start with Fib(0) = 1, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2)=2, Fib(3)=3, Fib(4)=5, Fib(5)=8, Fib(6)=13, etc. Wait, perhaps the indexing is different. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier assumption: for k games, the minimal n is Fib(k+2). Let me check:\n\nk=1 → Fib(3) = 2 → correct.\n\nk=2 → Fib(4) =3 → correct.\n\nk=3 → Fib(5) =5 → correct.\n\nk=4 → Fib(6)=8 → yes.\n\nSo the Fib sequence starts as follows:\n\nFib(0) = 1\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 2\n\nFib(3) = 3\n\nFib(4) =5 \n\nFib(5) =8 \n\nFib(6)=13 \n\nand so on.\n\nSo the Fib sequence is generated as Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), with Fib(0) = 1, Fib(1)=1.\n\nSo for the problem, given n, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo for example, for n=10:\n\nFib(6) is 13 which is larger than 10. Fib(5)=8 ≤10. So k+2=5 →k=3? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait Fib(k+2) = Fib(5) =8. So k+2=5 →k=3. But the sample input for n=10 outputs 4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait sample input 10 gives output 4. But according to this logic, Fib(k+2) must be <=10. Let's compute:\n\nLet me recheck:\n\nFor k=4, Fib(k+2) = Fib(6) =13>10. So no. So what's Fib(5)=8. So k+2=5 →k=3. But sample input 10 gives output 4. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nWait sample input 10: output is 4. So according to the previous logic, the maximum k is 4. So Fib(k+2) = Fib(6) = 13. But 13 is larger than 10. So that's not possible. Therefore, our previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the correct value for k when n=10?\n\nThe sample says the output is 4. So for n=10, the maximum possible games is 4. Let's see what Fib(k+2) would be for k=4. Fib(6) is 8+5=13. But 13 is larger than 10. So how is it possible to have k=4 for n=10?\n\nSo our previous assumption about the Fib sequence is wrong. Need to re-examine.\n\nLet me think again. For k=4, what is the minimal number of players required?\n\nLet's try to find the minimal n for k=4.\n\nAccording to the previous idea, the minimal n would be Fib(6) = 13. But for n=10, the answer is 4. So that suggests that the minimal n for k=4 is less than 10. Which contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is not based on Fib(k+2). Let's think again.\n\nLet me think of the minimal n for k=3.\n\nEarlier example said that it's 5. So for k=3, minimal n is 5.\n\nFor k=4, the minimal n would be 8? Let's see.\n\nHow can the winner have 4 games?\n\nThe fourth game must be against an opponent who has played 3 games. So that opponent's subtree requires minimal n for k=3, which is 5. The winner's previous games up to 3 games would require minimal n for k=3, which is 5. But adding those gives 5+5-1=9? Or something else?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal n for k is the sum of the minimal n for k-1 and k-2. Let's see:\n\nFor k=1, minimal n is 2.\n\nk=2: 3.\n\nk=3: 2+3=5.\n\nk=4: 3+5=8.\n\nk=5: 5+8=13.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,3,5,8,13..., which is the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 3. Which is the Fib sequence shifted.\n\nSo the minimal n for k is Fib(k+1), where Fib(1)=2, Fib(2)=3, Fib(3)=5, Fib(4)=8, etc. Let's see:\n\nFor k=1, Fib(2) = 2 → correct.\n\nk=2, Fib(3)=3 → correct.\n\nk=3, Fib(4)=5 → correct.\n\nk=4, Fib(5)=8 → yes. So for n=8, the maximum k is 4. For n=10, which is larger than 8, the maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 gives output 4.\n\nSo the formula for minimal n for k is Fib(k+1), where Fib(1)=2, Fib(2)=3, Fib(3)=5, Fib(4)=8, Fib(5)=13, etc. This is the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 3.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, find the maximum k such that Fib(k+1) ≤n.\n\nSo for example:\n\nn=10: Fib(5)=8 ≤10. Fib(6)=13>10. So maximum k is 5-1=4? Wait:\n\nWait Fib(k+1) is the minimal n for k. So for k=4, Fib(4+1)=Fib(5)=8 ≤10. So yes, the maximum k is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to generate the Fib sequence starting with Fib(1)=2, Fib(2)=3, Fib(3)=5, Fib(4)=8, Fib(5)=13, etc. For a given n, find the largest k such that Fib(k) ≤n.\n\nSo for example, for n=3, Fib(2)=3 →k=2.\n\nFor n=4, Fib(3)=5>4. So the largest Fib(k) ≤4 is Fib(2)=3 →k=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fib sequence until it exceeds 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum k where Fib(k) ≤n.\n\nSo for n=2, Fib(1)=2 →k=1.\n\nFor n=3, Fib(2)=3 →k=2.\n\nFor n=4, Fib(2)=3 ≤4, Fib(3)=5>4 →k=2.\n\nFor n=5, Fib(3)=5 →k=3.\n\nFor n=10, Fib(4)=8 ≤10, Fib(5)=13>10 →k=4.\n\nSo the sample input for n=10 gives output 4, which matches.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that Fib(k) ≤n, where Fib(1)=2, Fib(2)=3, Fib(3)=5, Fib(4)=8, etc.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nGenerate the Fib sequence up to the point where it exceeds 1e18. Then, for each input n, perform a binary search on this list to find the maximum k where Fib(k) <=n.\n\nLet's generate the Fib sequence:\n\nStart with a list, say fibs = [2,3]. Then, each next term is sum of previous two.\n\nLet me compute the terms:\n\nfibs[0] = 2 (k=1)\n\nfibs[1] =3 (k=2)\n\nfibs[2] =5 (k=3)\n\nfibs[3]=8 (k=4)\n\nfibs[4]=13 (k=5)\n\nfibs[5]=21 (k=6)\n\nfibs[6]=34 (k=7)\n\nfibs[7]=55 (k=8)\n\n...\n\nWe need to generate this until the value exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, find the largest index i such that fibs[i] <=n. Then, the answer is i+1 (since the index starts at 0 for k=1).\n\nWait:\n\nFor example, if the list is [2,3,5,8,13,...], then for index 0, it's Fib(1) =2. So the index is i, and the corresponding k is i+1.\n\nWait, no. For the list, the first element (index 0) is Fib(1) =2. So if the list is [Fib(1), Fib(2), Fib(3), ...], then the index is i, and the k is i+1?\n\nNo. Let me think:\n\nThe list is generated as follows:\n\nfibs[0] = Fib(1) =2 → corresponds to k=1.\n\nfibs[1] = Fib(2) =3 → corresponds to k=2.\n\nfibs[2] = Fib(3) =5 → corresponds to k=3.\n\nSo, for a given value in the list at index i, it corresponds to k=i+1.\n\nSo if we find the largest index i where fibs[i] <=n, then the answer is i+1.\n\nBut if n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging properties of the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result for very large values of n (up to 10^18).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern related to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each subsequent game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a number of games that differs by at most one from the winner's current count, leading to a structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games corresponds to the (k+1)-th term in a modified Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 3. This sequence is generated as follows:\n   - Fib(1) = 2\n   - Fib(2) = 3\n   - Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Given the constraints (n up to 10^18), we precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed 10^18. For each input value, we then use binary search on this precomputed list to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to 1e18\n    fibs = []\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    while a <= 10**18:\n        fibs.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    # Binary search for the maximum k\n    left, right = 0, len(fibs) - 1\n    ans = 0\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if fibs[mid] <= n:\n            ans = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    print(ans + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 3 until the values exceed 10^18. This allows us to handle very large inputs efficiently.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: For each input value `n`, we perform a binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci list to find the largest value that does not exceed `n`. The index of this value in the list gives us the corresponding number of games the winner can play, adjusted by 1 to account for the sequence indexing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the large input range and provide the correct result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence and binary search.",
