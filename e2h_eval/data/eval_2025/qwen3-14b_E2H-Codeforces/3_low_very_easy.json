Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the smallest d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm, how to approach this? Well, the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required radius based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have two consecutive lanterns at positions a and b. The distance between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from the edge of their coverage areas would be half of that distance. Because each lantern's light can reach halfway towards the other. So for example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, each needs to cover 2 units towards each other. So the required d for that gap is (b - a)/2. But wait, what about the ends of the street?\n\nOh right! Because the first lantern might not be at 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly, the last lantern might not be at l, so the distance from the last lantern to l is also important. Those are the edge cases.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Another candidate.\n4. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, compute (current - previous) / 2. The maximum of these values is another candidate.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the gaps between lanterns, the worst case is when the gap is the largest. For example, if two lanterns are 6 units apart, then the middle point is 3 units away from each. So the radius must be at least 3 to cover that area. So the maximum of all those (gap/2) values is needed.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? Then the maximum of the first and last distances is the answer. For example, if the lantern is at position x, then the maximum between x and (l - x) is the required d.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between the first lantern's position and (l - last lantern's position).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted array, checking each consecutive pair. For each pair, compute the difference, divide by two, and see if that's larger than the current max_d.\n\nFinally, return the max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not sorted? Oh right, so the first step is to sort them.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the first distance: 0 to first lantern is 0. The last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street, so that's 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nSecond example input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as 2,5.\n\nFirst check: distance from 0 to 2 is 2. Distance from 5 to 5 (since l=5) is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=10, lantern at 0. Then the distance from 0 to 0 is 0, and from 0 to 10 is 10. So the answer is 10.0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern at 5, l=1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a segment around it with a radius `d`. The goal is to find the smallest possible `d` such that the entire street from point 0 to point `l` is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). These distances are potential candidates for the radius `d`.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by two gives the radius required to cover the area between these two lanterns.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The required radius `d` is the maximum value among the distances calculated in the edge cases and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    first_line = input[idx].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    l = int(first_line[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the beginning\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    # Check the end\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check between lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting ensures that we can sequentially check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: The first lantern's position from the start of the street and the last lantern's position from the end of the street are checked to ensure coverage at both ends.\n- **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap is divided by two because each lantern's light needs to cover half the gap towards the other lantern to ensure full coverage.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements for accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated with optimal coverage.",
