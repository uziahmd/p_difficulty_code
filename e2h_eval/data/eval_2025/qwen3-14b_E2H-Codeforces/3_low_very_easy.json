Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we have to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be checked properly. For example, if lanterns are at positions 5, 3, then after sorting they are 3,5. The gap between them is 2, so the maximum required d for that gap would be 1 (since each lantern covers up to d distance. So between 3 and 5, the middle point is 4, which is 1 unit away from both. So the maximum required d for that gap is (5-3)/2 = 1.)\n\n2. After sorting, check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position. The required d for that is (a[0] - 0) because the lantern's light has to reach the start of the street. Wait, no. Suppose the first lantern is at position a. Then the distance from 0 to a is a. But the lantern's light can cover up to d. So to cover 0, the lantern must be within d distance. So the maximum distance between 0 and the first lantern is a. So the required d for this part is a. Similarly for the end: the last lantern's position is a[-1], and the distance from there to l is l - a[-1]. So the required d for that is l - a[-1].\n\n3. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is (current - previous). For that gap, the maximum required d is half of that gap. Because the optimal coverage would be to cover the middle point of the gap. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then the middle is 2 units away from each. So d needs to be at least 2 to cover the entire gap.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- the last lantern's position (if it's not at l)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is already at 0? Then the distance from 0 is zero, so no problem. Similarly for the last lantern. So the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first position: if it's greater than 0, then the required d is a[0] - 0. So compare with current max_d.\n\nCheck the last position: if it's less than l, then required d is l - a[-1]. Compare with current max_d.\n\nThen for each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute the difference between current and previous. The maximum of these differences divided by 2 is the required d for that gap. So compare that with current max_d.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck first lantern is at 0, so no problem. Last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street. So no problem. Now check the consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum among these is 2.5. Which is the answer. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. First lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street. The gap between 2 and 5",
