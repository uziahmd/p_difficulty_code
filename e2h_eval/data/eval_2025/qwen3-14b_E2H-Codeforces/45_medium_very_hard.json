There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nLet me think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a perfect binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed, and we need to arrange the matches in a way that maximizes the winner's games, under the given constraint.\n\nSo the problem is not about the standard structure but about finding the optimal arrangement. Let's look at the examples:\n\nFor n=2, there's only one game. The answer is 1.\n\nFor n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But why is that allowed? Let's see. The first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, the next game, the opponent (player 3) has 0 games. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play 3 games? Because in a normal knockout, 4 players would have 3 rounds (log2(4)=2 games for the winner?), no. Wait, wait: for 4 players, the first round has two matches, then the winners play each other. So the winner plays two games. So the answer is 2. But how does that fit with the rule?\n\nBut the example says that for n=4, the answer is 2. So maybe the maximum possible is not the same as the standard knockout structure. Wait, but maybe in some other arrangement, the winner could have more games? But according to the example, it's not possible. So for n=4, the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time he plays, he must have a new opponent. Let's think about the structure of the tournament. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time he plays, his opponent must be someone who has played as many games as possible, but differing by at most one.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a tree where each node represents a player. The winner's path through the tournament requires that each time he plays, his opponent has a number of previous games that is either equal to his current count or one less. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for each game the winner plays, the number of players required to reach that stage might follow a Fibonacci-like pattern.\n\nLet me think. Let's say f(k) is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before the final one. Let's think recursively. \n\nTo play the k-th game, the winner must have an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. Because the difference between their game counts must be ≤1. \n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games, and then in the k-th game, he faces someone who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nBut how does that translate into the number of players required?\n\nLet me think: For the winner to have played k games, the total number of players required would be the sum of the players required for the two subtrees leading up to the final game. \n\nFor example, suppose the winner plays his k-th game against an opponent who has played k-1 games. Then, the number of players required for that opponent's path is f(k-1). But the winner's path up to k-1 games would require f(k-1) players. But then, the total would be f(k-1) + f(k-1) = 2*f(k-1). However, since the winner is part of both, maybe that's not accurate. Or perhaps the way to model it is that to get to the k-th game, the winner must have a path where each step requires certain players.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's consider that to have a winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something. Let me think with examples.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the winner plays 1 game, then there are 2 players. So f(1) = 2.\n\nIf the winner plays 2 games, then the first game is against someone, and then the second game is against another. For the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game (since the winner has already played 1 game). So the opponent must have a path where they played 1 game. So the total players would be f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4? But in the example for n=3, the answer is 2. So that suggests that for k=2, the minimal number of players is 3. Which is less than 4. So my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. How can the winner play 2 games with only 3 players?\n\nFirst game: player 1 vs 2. Player 1 wins. Then, player 1 vs 3. Player 1 wins. So for this case, the opponent in the second game (player 3) has played 0 games. The difference between 1 (player 1's games) and 0 is 1, which is allowed. So in this case, the minimal number of players for k=2 is 3. So f(2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, what's the minimal n?\n\nThe winner has to play 3 games. Let's think:\n\nIn the third game, the opponent must have played 2 or 1 games. Let's say that the opponent has played 2 games. Then, the winner's path is 2 games before the third game. So the opponent's path requires f(2) players. But the winner's path up to 2 games requires f(2) players. But then, the total players would be f(2) + f(2) = 3 + 3 = 6. But maybe that's not the minimal. Alternatively, the opponent could have played 1 game. Then, the winner's path up to 2 games requires f(2) players, and the opponent's path up to 1 game requires f(1) players. So the total would be f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. So for k=3, the minimal n is 5?\n\nWait, but how can that work?\n\nLet me try to build a scenario for k=3 with 5 players.\n\nLet's imagine the winner plays 3 games. Let's say the first game is against player 2. Then, the second game is against player 3. Then, the third game is against player 4. But for the third game, the opponent (player 4) must have played 2 or 1 games. Let's see. How did player 4 get to that point? Well, in order for them to have played 1 game, they must have beaten someone. So maybe the structure is like:\n\nRound 1: Player 1 vs 2 (winner 1), Player 3 vs 4 (winner 3). Then Round 2: Player 1 vs 3 (winner 1). Then, for the third game, player 1 needs to play against someone else. But there's only player 5. So in that case, player 5 hasn't played any games yet. So the difference between 2 (player 1's games) and 0 (player 5's games) is 2, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nHmm. So maybe the minimal n for k=3 is 5? How?\n\nAlternative approach: For the winner to play 3 games, the opponent in the third game must have played 2 games. So the opponent's path requires that they have played 2 games. So the winner's path is 2 games, and the opponent's path is 2 games. So total players would be f(2) + f(2) = 3 + 3 = 6? But how?\n\nLet me try to model that. Let's say there are 6 players. The winner (player 1) has to play 3 games. \n\nFirst, player 1 plays against player 2 (game 1). Then, player 1 plays against player 3 (game 2). Now, for game 3, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. Let's say the opponent is someone who has played 2 games. How can that happen? Let's imagine that the opponent is player 4, who has played two games. How would that happen? \n\nMaybe the structure is:\n\n- First, player 4 plays against player 5 (game 1), wins. Then, plays against player 6 (game 2), wins. Then, player 1 plays against player 4 in game 3. \n\nBut for that to happen, the winner (player 1) has played 2 games, and the opponent has played 2 games. The difference is zero, which is allowed. So the total players is 6. So in this case, the minimal n is 6 for k=3. \n\nBut then, for k=3, the minimal n is 6. So the function f(k) would be:\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 3\n\nf(3) = 6?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let's see. What if the opponent in the third game has played 1 game. How can that be arranged? \n\nSuppose the winner has played 2 games. Then, the opponent has played 1 game. So the opponent must have had one game before. So the total players would be f(2) (for the winner's path) plus f(1) (for the opponent's path). So 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nBut how can that be arranged? Let's think for n=5. \n\nLet me try to create a scenario where the winner plays three games. \n\nFirst, player 1 beats player 2 (game 1). Then, player 1 beats player 3 (game 2). Now, for game 3, the opponent must have played 1 game (so difference is 1). Let's say the opponent is player 4, who has played one game. How did player 4 get there? He must have beaten player 5 in a previous game. But when? \n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nRound 1: player 1 vs 2 (winner 1), player 3 vs 4 (winner 3), player 5 vs ... wait, there are five players. Wait, in the first round, how many matches are there? Well, for five players, the initial matches would have to be arranged such that after each match, the loser is eliminated. \n\nBut for the opponent of the winner in the third game, player 4, he must have played one game. Let's see:\n\nMaybe the first two matches are:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins.\n\nThen, Match 3: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins. Now, the winner has played 2 games. Now, to have another match, the next opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. But there's player 5. So the next match would be between 1 and 5. Player 5 has played 0 games. So the difference is 2 (1's games is 2, 5's is 0). Not allowed. So this is invalid. \n\nSo how can we get the opponent to have played 1 game?\n\nAlternative structure:\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a tree. For the winner to play 3 games, the structure must be such that each time, the opponent has played as many games as possible. Let's think recursively. \n\nLet's think of f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. \n\nTo have the winner play k games, he must have played k-1 games before, and then in the k-th game, he faces an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nSo the minimal number of players for k is f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the k-th game, the winner's opponent must have a path that allows them to play k-1 or k-2 games. If the opponent has played k-1 games, then the minimal players is f(k-1) for that opponent, and the winner's path is f(k-1) (since he had to play k-1 games before). But that's not right because the winner's path is already part of the same structure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players for k is f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, the winner's path to play k games requires that he plays against someone who has played k-1 games (so that he can have a difference of 0) or k-2 games (difference of 1). \n\nBut to find the minimal n, we need to take the minimal between these possibilities. However, perhaps the minimal is achieved by taking f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n\nLet's test this hypothesis with previous examples. \n\nFor f(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0)? Wait, but what is f(0)? Maybe f(0) is 1? Because if the winner has played 0 games, that's just the initial state, but that's not possible. Hmm. Maybe the recurrence starts from f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3. Then for k >=3, f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n\nLet's see:\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. But earlier I thought that with 5 players, it's not possible for the winner to play 3 games. But according to this formula, it's possible. \n\nWait, maybe there's a way to arrange for 5 players. Let me think again. \n\nLet me try to create a scenario where the winner plays 3 games. \n\nLet me think of the tournament as follows:\n\nFirst, player 1 plays against player 2 (game 1). Player 1 wins. Then, player 1 plays against player 3 (game 2). Player 1 wins. Now, the next opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. \n\nBut there are players 4 and 5 left. How to arrange their matches. \n\nLet me think that in the first round, there are two matches. For example:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins.\n\nThen, Match 3: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins.\n\nNow, there's player 5. How to get him into the next match? \n\nBut the winner (player 1) has played 2 games. To play against player 5, the difference is 2-0 = 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. \n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the winner plays against someone who has played 1 game. How? \n\nLet me think of a different structure. Suppose:\n\nFirst, player 1 plays against player 5 (game 1). Player 1 wins. Then, player 1 plays against player 2 (game 2). Player 1 wins. Then, player 1 plays against player 3 (game 3). But for that to be allowed, player 3 must have played 1 or 2 games. How? \n\nPlayer 3 could have played against player 4 in a previous match. For example:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 5 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 2 vs 3 → 2 wins.\n\nMatch 3: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 4: 1 vs 4 → 1 wins.\n\nBut in this case, the winner has played 3 games. But the fourth match is against player 4, who has played 0 games. Wait, no. Player 4 was not in any match before. So he has 0 games. The winner has 3 games. The difference is 3, which is not allowed. \n\nHmm. So how can this be done?\n\nWait, maybe the opponent in the third game has played 1 game. Let's think of this:\n\nLet me have the winner play three games. For the third game, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. Let's say the opponent has played 1 game. So, for example, the opponent is player 3, who has played 1 game. How did that happen?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- First, player 3 plays against player 4. Player 3 wins. (game 1 for player 3).\n\n- Then, player 1 plays against player 2. Player 1 wins. (game 1 for player 1).\n\n- Then, player 1 plays against player 3. Player 1 wins. (game 2 for player 1, game 2 for player 3? No, player 3 has already played one game. So this match is allowed (difference is 1). \n\n- Now, player 1 has played 2 games. To play a third game, he needs an opponent with 1 or 2 games. Let's say player 5 has played 1 game. How? \n\nPlayer 5 must have played one game. So, maybe:\n\n- Player 5 plays against player 6 (but there are only 5 players). So that's not possible. \n\nWait, n is 5 here. So the initial setup would have to be:\n\nFirst, have some matches. Let me think of the tournament structure as a binary tree. For the winner to play 3 games, the number of players required is 5. How?\n\nMaybe the structure is:\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2 (1 wins), 3 vs 4 (3 wins), 5 is idle?\n\nBut that's not possible. Because all players except the winner must be eliminated. Wait, the tournament is a knockout, so every player except the winner is eliminated once they lose. So for 5 players, there must be 4 matches. \n\nBut in the scenario where the winner plays 3 games, there must be 3 matches involving him. But the total number of matches in the tournament is (n-1) = 4. So the other matches would be 1. \n\nLet me try to model this:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins.\n\nMatch 3: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 4: 1 vs 5 → 1 wins.\n\nBut in match 4, the opponent (player 5) has 0 games. The winner has played 3 games. Difference is 3, which is not allowed. So this is invalid.\n\nSo, how can the third match be arranged?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the opponent for the third game is someone who has played 2 games. How?\n\nTo get that, for example:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins.\n\nMatch 3: 3 vs 5 → 3 wins. (so now, player 3 has played 2 games.)\n\nMatch 4: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins. \n\nIn this case, the winner (player 1) has played 2 games (matches 1 and 4). But the third game is not there. So that's not enough. \n\nHmm. This seems challenging. Perhaps my initial assumption about the recurrence is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let's check:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. \n\nIf the minimal players for k games is F(k+2), then:\n\nFor k=1, F(3) = 2 → correct.\n\nk=2 → F(4) = 3 → correct.\n\nk=3 → F(5) = 5 → which is what the previous calculation suggested. But how to get that? \n\nLet's think for k=3, n=5. How?\n\nMaybe the structure is:\n\nThe winner plays three games. For that, the first game is against someone, the second game against someone else, and the third game against someone who has played two games. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as follows:\n\n- First, player 1 plays against player 2. Player 1 wins (game 1).\n\n- Then, player 1 plays against player 3. Player 1 wins (game 2).\n\n- Now, for the third game, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. Let's say the opponent is player 4, who has played 1 game. How?\n\nPlayer 4 must have played one game. So, perhaps:\n\n- Before the third game, player 4 played against player 5 and won (game 1). \n\nSo the tournament structure would be:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 2: 4 vs 5 → 4 wins.\n\nMatch 3: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins.\n\nMatch 4: 1 vs 4 → 1 wins.\n\nBut in match 3, the opponent is player 3, who has played 0 games. Wait, no. Wait, in match 3, the opponent is player 3, who hasn't played before. So the difference between 1's 2 games and 0 is 2, which is invalid. \n\nAh, so this is not allowed. So match 3 can't be between 1 and 3. \n\nAlternative approach: For the third game, the opponent is someone who has played 1 game. So, maybe the winner plays against player 4, who has played one game. How can that happen?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (game count for 1 is 1).\n\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins (game count for 3 is 1).\n\nMatch 3: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins (game count for 1 is 2, for 3 is 1. Allowed, difference is 1).\n\nMatch 4: 1 vs 5 → 1 wins. But here, 5 has 0 games. Difference is 2, which is invalid. \n\nSo this is not allowed. \n\nBut what if there's a fifth player, and the structure is:\n\nAfter match 3, there are two players left: 1 and 3. But there's also player 5. How can they be incorporated?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again about the recurrence relation. \n\nAssuming that f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with f(1)=2, f(2)=3. Then:\n\nf(3) = 3+2=5.\n\nf(4)=5+3=8.\n\nf(5)=8+5=13.\n\nSo for n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. But how?\n\nMaybe the tournament structure is such that the winner plays three games, and the opponents are arranged in a way that meets the constraints. \n\nLet me think of the following scenario for n=5:\n\nPlayer 1's path:\n\nGame 1: plays against player 2 → wins.\n\nGame 2: plays against player 3 → wins.\n\nGame 3: plays against player 4 → wins.\n\nBut how did player 4 get to this point? \n\nPlayer 4 must have played 1 or 2 games before this match. Let's say player 4 has played 1 game. \n\nHow can that happen?\n\nPlayer 4's path:\n\nGame 1: plays against player 5 → wins. \n\nSo, during the tournament, the matches are arranged as follows:\n\nFirst, match between 1 and 2 → 1 wins.\n\nThen, match between 4 and 5 → 4 wins.\n\nThen, match between 1 and 3 → 1 wins.\n\nThen, match between 1 and 4 → 1 wins.\n\nIn this scenario, for the third match (between 1 and 4), player 1 has played 2 games, player 4 has played 1 game. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's valid. \n\nThus, the winner plays 3 games. And the total players is 5. So this is possible. \n\nAh! So the example for n=5 would allow the winner to have 3 games. So the recurrence seems to hold. \n\nSo the function f(k) gives the minimal number of players needed to have the winner play k games. Then, the maximum number of games the winner can play for a given n is the largest k such that f(k) ≤ n. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where f(k) ≤ n, where f(k) is defined by the recurrence f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with f(1)=2, f(2)=3. \n\nBut wait, what is f(k) exactly? For example, for k=3, f(3)=5. Which means that if n is 5, the answer is 3. If n is 6, then f(3)=5 ≤6, and f(4)=8>6. So the answer is 3. \n\nBut for n=6, can the winner play 3 games? Yes, because 5 players can do it. So for n=6, the maximum is 3. \n\nSo the approach is to generate the sequence f(k) until it exceeds n, and find the maximum k where f(k) ≤n. \n\nSo the problem becomes, for a given n, find the maximum k where f(k) ≤n, where f(k) is the sequence starting with f(1)=2, f(2)=3, and f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2 is 3. For n=3, the maximum k is 2 since f(2)=3. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The sequence is:\n\nf(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5. Since 5>4, the maximum is 2, which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSample Input 10: Let's compute the sequence:\n\nf(1)=2\n\nf(2)=3\n\nf(3)=5\n\nf(4)=8\n\nf(5)=13.\n\nSo for n=10, the maximum k is 4, since f(4)=8 ≤10, and f(5)=13>10. So the answer is 4, which matches the sample output of 4. \n\nYes! That seems to fit. \n\nSo the problem is now to compute this sequence until the value exceeds n, and find the maximum k for which f(k) ≤n. \n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this for very large n (up to 1e18). So we need to generate the sequence until it exceeds n, which for n=1e18 would require about O(log n) steps, which is feasible. \n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Precompute the sequence f(k) until it exceeds n. \n\n2. Find the maximum k such that f(k) ≤n. \n\nBut how to generate this sequence? Let's think about the initial terms:\n\nk | f(k)\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n5 | 13\n6 | 21\n7 | 34\n... etc. \n\nThis sequence is similar to the Fibonacci numbers, but shifted. For example, the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(3) = 2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, etc. So f(k) is equal to Fib(k+2), assuming Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc. \n\nYes. Because:\n\nFor Fib(3) = 2 = f(1)\n\nFib(4) = 3 = f(2)\n\nFib(5) = 5 = f(3)\n\nFib(6) = 8 = f(4)\n\nSo f(k) = Fib(k+2). \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nBut how to compute this? For example, given n, find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci numbers starting from Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. \n\n- For each generated Fib number, check if it is <=n. Keep track of the index. \n\n- Once Fib(m) >n, then the maximum k is (m-2) - 1? Wait, let me think. \n\nWait, for Fib(m) = f(k) = Fib(k+2). So for Fib(m) = f(k), then k = m-2. \n\nSo for example, Fib(3) = 2 = f(1) → m=3, k=1. \n\nSo given n, we want to find the largest m such that Fib(m) ≤n. Then, the answer is (m-2). \n\nBut wait, what if n is between Fib(m) and Fib(m+1)? For example, if n is 4, which is between Fib(4)=3 and Fib(5)=5. Then the largest Fib(m) ≤4 is Fib(4)=3. Then the answer is m-2 =4-2=2. Which matches the sample input for n=4 (output is 2). \n\nAnother example: n=5. Fib(5)=5. m=5. answer is 5-2=3. Which would be correct, as for n=5, the answer is 3. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the largest m such that Fib(m) ≤n. Then the answer is m-2. \n\nBut what if Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc. \n\nSo for n=2, Fib(3)=2 → m=3 → answer 1. Which is correct. \n\nFor n=3, Fib(4)=3 → m=4 → answer 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nFor n=10, the Fib sequence up to 13 is:\n\nFib(1)=1\n\nFib(2)=1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nFib(6)=8\n\nFib(7)=13. \n\nSince 13>10, the largest m is 6 (Fib(6)=8). answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample. \n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the largest m where Fib(m) ≤n, and then subtract 2. \n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Generate the Fibonacci numbers until the current number exceeds n.\n\n2. Find the maximum m such that Fib(m) ≤n.\n\n3. The answer is m-2. \n\nBut there's a corner case when n is 1. But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. \n\nBut wait, the input constraints are 2 ≤n ≤1e18. So for n=2, Fib(3)=2, m=3, answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, keeping track of the index. \n\nBut for very large n (up to 1e18), the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the number of steps is small. For example, Fib(90) is around 2.8e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, the loop will run about 90 times. \n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize variables a=1 (Fib(1)), b=1 (Fib(2)), m=2 (since Fib(2) is 1, but m is the index). \n\nWe need to find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n. \n\nWe can generate the Fib sequence as follows:\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_prev = 1 (Fib(1))\n\nprev = 1 (Fib(2))\n\ncurrent_m = 2\n\nThen, while the next Fib number is <=n:\n\ncurrent = prev_prev + prev\n\ncurrent_m +=1 \n\nif current <=n:\n\n   prev_prev = prev \n\n   prev = current \n\nelse:\n\n   break \n\nOnce we exit the loop, the maximum m is current_m-1 if the last current was over. \n\nWait, let's think of the loop:\n\nInitially, prev_prev is Fib(1) =1, prev is Fib(2)=1, m=2. \n\nWe can generate the next Fib numbers:\n\nnext_num = prev_prev + prev = 2 → Fib(3) =2. \n\nCheck if next_num <=n. If yes, then we update prev_prev to prev (1), prev to next_num (2), and m increases by 1 (now m=3). \n\nRepeat until next_num exceeds n. \n\nOnce the loop ends, the last Fib number that was <=n is prev. And the current m is the index for that. \n\nFor example, let's take n=3.\n\nStart with prev_prev=1, prev=1, m=2.\n\nnext_num=1+1=2 <=3 → yes. So prev_prev becomes 1, prev becomes 2, m=3.\n\nnext_num=1+2=3 <=3 → yes. prev_prev=2, prev=3, m=4. \n\nnext_num=2+3=5>3. So loop stops. The maximum m is 4. \n\nWhich gives answer 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5.\n\nprev_prev=1, prev=1, m=2.\n\nnext_num=2 → m=3.\n\nnext_num=3 → m=4.\n\nnext_num=5 → m=5. \n\nnext_num=8>5. So maximum m is 5. answer 5-2=3. \n\nSo the code needs to track the current Fib numbers and their indices. \n\nOnce the loop ends, the maximum m is the current m (after the loop). \n\nBut wait, in the example above, when next_num is 5 (<=n=5), then we increment m to 5, and then next_num is 8, which is larger. So the maximum m is 5. \n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize:\n\na = 1 (Fib(1))\n\nb = 1 (Fib(2))\n\nm = 2 \n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = a + b \n\n    if next_num > n:\n\n        break \n\n    a = b \n\n    b = next_num \n\n    m +=1 \n\nAt the end, the maximum m is m, because the last valid Fib number is b, which is Fib(m). \n\nWait, no. Because initially, a is Fib(1), b is Fib(2). \n\nThen, when next_num is Fib(3) = a + b = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nThen, a becomes Fib(2) =1, b becomes Fib(3)=2, m increases to 3. \n\nThen, next_num is Fib(4) = 1 + 2 =3. \n\nThen, a becomes Fib(3)=2, b becomes Fib(4)=3, m increases to 4. \n\nAnd so on. \n\nSo, after the loop, the maximum m is m, and the Fib(m) is b. \n\nSo for example, when the loop breaks, the last Fib number that is <=n is b. \n\nBut what if the initial Fib numbers are 1, 1, and n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. \n\nSo for the given problem, after generating the sequence, the answer is m-2. \n\nWait, let's take n=2. \n\nInitial a=1, b=1, m=2. \n\nnext_num=2, which is <=2. \n\nSo a becomes 1, b becomes 2, m=3. \n\nnext_num is 1+2=3>2. So loop breaks. \n\nSo m is 3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3. \n\nLoop proceeds to generate m=4. answer 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n < 2: impossible, but input is n≥2.\n\ninitialize a=1, b=1, m=2.\n\nloop:\n\nnext_num = a + b \n\nif next_num <=n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging properties of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires a certain number of players, and the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games can be derived from the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is equivalent to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, we need to find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints (n up to 10^18), we generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until we exceed `n`, keeping track of the indices. This approach ensures we efficiently find the maximum number of games using the properties of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n < 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    a = 1  # Fib(1)\n    b = 1  # Fib(2)\n    m = 2  # current index\n    \n    while True:\n        next_num = a + b\n        if next_num > n:\n            break\n        a = b\n        b = next_num\n        m += 1\n    \n    # The maximum m where Fib(m) <= n is m\n    # The answer is m - 2\n    print(m - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 1) and initialize the index `m` to 2.\n2. **Iterative Generation**: Generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers by summing the previous two numbers. Continue this process until the generated number exceeds `n`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: The index `m` at which the last valid Fibonacci number (less than or equal to `n`) was found corresponds to the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number. Subtracting 2 from this index gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to 10^18.",
