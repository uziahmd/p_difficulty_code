Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D values. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints for the triangle sides. The problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other two conditions (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically be true since z is the largest.\n\nSo the approach is to find all triples (x, y, z) such that:\n\n- A ≤ x ≤ B\n- B ≤ y ≤ C (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B)\n- C ≤ z ≤ D (since y ≤ C and z ≥ C)\n- And x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait the problem says that the order is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B?), but wait the original condition is that x ≤ B ≤ y. So for example, x can be anything between A and B, and y is between B and C (since B ≤ y ≤ C). Similarly, z is between C and D. So the variables are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z, but with x up to B, y starting at B and up to C, and z starting at C up to D.\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x is between A and B, inclusive. Then y is between B and C, inclusive. And z is between C and D, inclusive. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, then x ≤ y. Similarly, y ≤ C ≤ z implies y ≤ z. So the triple (x, y, z) satisfies x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, for the triangle to be non-degenerate, we need x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all possible triples (x, y, z) with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D], such that x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe brute-force approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check if x + y > z. However, given that the maximum possible value for each of these variables is 5e5, this approach would be O(B*C*D), which is way too slow for the constraints given. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me consider that for each x and y, the valid z's are those that are less than x + y. But since z is in [C, D], and also z must be ≥ y (since y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait, but z is between C and D, and y is between B and C. So y can be up to C, and z starts at C. So for a fixed x and y, the z must satisfy:\n\nz >= C (since z is in [C, D]), and z <= min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x + y (since x + y > z).\n\nBut also, since z must be >= y (because x ≤ y ≤ z), but since z starts at C and y is up to C, maybe there's an overlap here. Let me think.\n\nFor example, suppose y is 3, and C is 3, so z starts at 3. Then z can be 3,4,...,D. But for the triangle inequality, z must be less than x + y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. But also, since z must be >= y (as per the constraints), but since z starts at C and y is up to C, perhaps the lower bound for z is max(C, y) ? Wait, no. Because y is in [B, C], and z is in [C, D]. So z is always >= C, and y is <= C. Therefore, z >= C >= y (since y is up to C). So for z, the lower bound is C, and the upper bound is min(D, x + y -1). However, if x + y -1 < C, then there are no valid z's for this x and y. Otherwise, the number of valid z's is (min(D, x",
