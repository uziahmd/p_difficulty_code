Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways. Each card can contribute a maximum of x (if positive) or a minimum of -x (if negative). So, for example, if T is positive, we can use as many x as needed. Similarly for negative.\n\nBut since we want the minimal number of cards, we need to maximize the contribution per card. So, for example, if T is positive, each card can contribute up to +x. So the minimal number of cards would be ceil(T / x). But wait, maybe there's some remainder. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4, which leaves 1. So we can have two cards of 2 and one of 1, but since 1 is allowed (as x is 2). But wait, the maximum per card is x. So the minimal number is ceil(T / x). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Then it's T/x. Otherwise, it's (T//x) + 1.\n\nBut wait, for example, T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which is correct: 2 + 1. But since each card can be any value between -x and x, but the sum needs to be T. So for the case where T is positive, the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Similarly for T negative, it's ceil( |T| / x ), since each card can contribute up to x in absolute value.\n\nWait, but for example, if T is 3 and x is 2. So the minimal number of cards is 2. Because you can have 2 and 1. But 2 is allowed. So yes.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nCompute T = -sum of found cards.\n\nIf T is zero, then no cards needed. So answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf T is positive, then the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, how?\n\nWait, let's think. For example, T is 5, x is 2. Then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3. Which is correct. Because 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So 3 cards.\n\nAnother example: T is 4, x is 2. Then 4/2 = 2. So two cards. Correct.\n\nBut what if T is 1 and x is 2? Then 1/2 is 0.5, ceil is 1. Which is correct. One card of 1.\n\nSo for positive T, the minimal number is ceil(T / x).\n\nSimilarly, if T is negative, then we can take the absolute value, and compute ceil( |T| / x ). Because each card can contribute up to x in the negative direction. For example, T is -5, x is 2. So |T| is 5. 5 / 2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. So three cards of -2, -2, -1. Sum is -5.\n\nSo the formula is: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then the answer is 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call it sum_found. Then T is -sum_found.\n\nIf T is zero, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the absolute value of T, say abs_T.\n\nThen the minimal number of cards is ceil( abs_T / x )\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, for positive numbers, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nSo for example, 5 / 2 is 2.5, (5 +",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the found cards to zero is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: For a non-zero target sum, compute the minimum number of cards required by considering the maximum absolute value each card can contribute. This is done using the formula `ceil(abs(target) / x)`, which can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        nums = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        sum_found = sum(nums)\n        target = -sum_found\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        min_cards = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, handling multiple test cases if present.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the target sum needed to balance them to zero.\n- **Target Handling**: If the target sum is zero, no cards are needed. Otherwise, the minimum number of cards is calculated using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations, ensuring efficiency and precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
