The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the parity here. Because if a_i is even, then adding an odd key would make it odd. Similarly, if a_i is odd, adding an even key would make it odd. So, the key's parity must be different from the chest's parity. \n\nSo, for each chest, we need a key that has the opposite parity. But since each key can be used only once, and each chest can be opened once, we need to match as many as possible.\n\nSo the approach is probably to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right. Because even chests can be opened by odd keys. Odd chests can be opened by even keys. So for each group, take the min of the two counts.\n\nLet me test this idea with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's compute their parities. \n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So count_odd_chest = 2, count_even_chest = 3.\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: even, even, odd, even. So count_odd_keys = 1, count_even_keys = 3.\n\nThen, the first part is min(3 even chests, 1 odd key) → 1. The second part is min(2 odd chests, 3 even keys) → 2. Total is 3, which matches the sample output. \n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: second input is 5 1. Chests are all even (2,4,6,8,10). Keys is 5 (odd). So count_odd_keys is 1. So min(5 even chests, 1 odd key) → 1. The other part is min(0 odd chests, 0 even keys) → 0. Total 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So count_odd_keys is zero. So min(1 even chest, 0 odd keys) → 0. And min(0 odd chests, 4 even keys) → 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is to count the number of even and odd chests, count even and odd keys, then compute min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i, count how many are even (count_even_chest) and odd (count_odd_chest).\n\n3. Read the list of b_j, count how many are even (count_even_keys) and odd (count_odd_keys).\n\n4. The answer is min(count_even_chest, count_odd_keys) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_keys).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple keys and chests? Like, for example, if there are more even chests than odd keys, but some other keys can be used for other chests. But no, because each key can be used once. So the maximum possible is indeed the sum of those two minima.\n\nYes. Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key, but each key can be used once. So the number of such pairs is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list, count even and odd.\n\nRead b list, count even and odd.\n\nCompute answer as min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nIn Python, for each input line, we can process the numbers.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input, the first line shows three examples. Wait, the user provided three examples, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, the original problem's input is for a single test case, but the sample shows three different inputs. Oh, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases in the example. But the actual code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has n integers.\n\nThird line has m integers.\n\nSo the code needs to read one test case. However, in the sample input, there are three examples given. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, the actual code should read one test case. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate inputs, but the output is three separate outputs. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the next lines are the a_i and b_j. So the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But that's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, the user might be showing three different test cases and their outputs. But in reality, the code should process one test case per run. However, looking at the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nIn the input section, the first line contains n and m. Then the second line has a_i, third line has b_j. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three examples. For example, the first input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich gives output 3. Then another input is 5 1, etc. But the code is supposed to process one input. So perhaps in the actual problem, the code is supposed to process a single test case. Therefore, the code should read n and m, then the a list, then the b list.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as list of a_i.\n\nRead the next line as list of b_j.\n\nCompute counts.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_even_chest = 0\n\ncount_odd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        count_even_chest += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_odd_chest += 1\n\ncount_even_key = 0\n\ncount_odd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        count_even_key += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_odd_key += 1\n\nans = min(count_even_chest, count_odd_key) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_key)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nThat's the code. Let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na: 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So count_even_chest is 3, count_odd_chest is 2.\n\nb: 8 (even), 4 (even), 7 (odd), 20 (even). count_even_key is 3, count_odd_key is 1.\n\nmin(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na: 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. count_even_chest=5, count_odd_chest=0.\n\nb: 5 → odd. count_odd_key=1, count_even_key=0.\n\nmin(5,1) → 1, min(0,0) → 0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na: 10 → even. count_even_chest=1, count_odd_chest=0.\n\nb: 20,30,40,50 → all even. count_even_key=4, count_odd_key=0.\n\nmin(1,0) → 0, min(0,4) → 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if there are zero even chests? For example, all chests are odd. Then, the answer depends on the number of even keys. For example, if there are 3 odd chests and 2 even keys, then min(3, 2) → 2. So the code would return 2.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are more keys than needed. Like, if there are 2 even chests and 5 odd keys. Then min(2,5) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code reads three lines. For example, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests and keys.\n2. **Match Parities**: Use the counts to determine how many valid pairs can be formed:\n   - Even chests can be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum counts of even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_even_chest = 0\ncount_odd_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_chest += 1\n    else:\n        count_odd_chest += 1\n\ncount_even_key = 0\ncount_odd_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_key += 1\n    else:\n        count_odd_key += 1\n\nresult = min(count_even_chest, count_odd_key) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into the number of chests (`n`), the number of keys (`m`), the list of chest numbers (`a`), and the list of key numbers (`b`).\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the list of chest numbers and key numbers to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculating Valid Pairs**: The valid pairs are determined by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of the minimum counts of these pairs, ensuring we use each key and chest at most once.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
