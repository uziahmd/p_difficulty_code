You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find two things: t, the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple odd-length cycle, and w, the number of ways to do that with exactly t edges. The graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's required. A simple cycle of odd length. So, the cycle must have at least three vertices (since it's more than one vertex), and each vertex occurs once. Also, the cycle must be of odd length.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the minimal edges to add to create such a cycle.\n\nLet me think about the properties of such cycles. A graph that has no odd-length cycles is bipartite. So, if the graph is bipartite, then adding edges to create an odd cycle would require some changes.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal edges needed to create an odd cycle. So, if the original graph already contains an odd cycle, then t is 0 and w is the number of such cycles? No, wait. Wait, the problem says that we need to find the minimal number of edges to add. So if the original graph already has an odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of ways to add zero edges (which is 1?), but according to the example, when the input is a triangle (3 nodes connected in a cycle), the output is 0 1. Which matches that. Because there's already an odd cycle, so you don't need to add any edges. So w is 1 here.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the graph already has an odd-length cycle. If yes, then t is 0 and w is 1? Or maybe the number of existing odd cycles? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. But if t is zero, then the way is to not add any edges. However, the problem requires that the resulting graph has at least one such cycle. But if the original graph already has such a cycle, then adding zero edges is a valid way. But how many such ways are there? Well, since the question counts the number of ways to add edges, but in this case, adding zero edges is one way. So for example, if there are multiple existing odd cycles, but the minimal t is zero, then w is 1? Because the problem says that the ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So even if there are multiple existing cycles, adding zero edges is one way. So the answer for t=0 is 1?\n\nBut looking at the sample input where the second case is a triangle (3 nodes connected as a cycle). The output is 0 1. Which aligns with that. So the answer for t=0 is 1. So regardless of how many existing odd cycles there are, as long as there's at least one, t is 0 and w is 1. Because adding zero edges is the only way (since any other way would require adding edges, which would not be minimal).\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that the question is not about creating any odd cycle, but to create a cycle that is of odd length. So if the original graph already has such a cycle, then the answer is t=0 and w=1. Because the way to add zero edges is one way.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the graph already has an odd-length cycle. If yes, then output t=0, w=1.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle.\n\nSo, how can we create an odd-length cycle?\n\nLet me think. For a graph that is bipartite (so no odd cycles), adding edges between nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle. Because in a bipartition (A, B), all edges are between A and B. Adding an edge between two nodes in A would create a cycle of length odd. For example, suppose there is a path from u to v through some edges. Since u and v are in the same partition, the path length is even. Adding an edge between u and v creates a cycle of length even + 1 = odd.\n\nSo, for a bipartite graph, the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle is 1. Because adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition would do that.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal t and the number of ways?\n\nSo, if the graph is bipartite, then t is 1. And the number of ways is the number of pairs of nodes in the same partition (but not connected by an edge already) that can be connected to form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but for each connected component, if it's bipartite, then adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (of that component) will create an odd cycle. So, for each connected component, if it's bipartite, then the number of possible edges to add is (number of possible pairs within partition A) + (number of possible pairs within partition B) minus the existing edges (but since the graph is bipartite, existing edges are between partitions).\n\nWait, but the existing edges are between the two partitions. So the number of possible edges that can be added between same partitions is (size_A choose 2) + (size_B choose 2) minus the existing edges between same partitions (but there are none). So, the total number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle in this component is (C(A) + C(B)), where C(A) is the number of possible pairs in partition A, and similarly for B.\n\nBut for the entire graph, if there are multiple connected components, each of which is bipartite, then adding an edge between any two nodes in the same partition (in any component) will create an odd cycle. So the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (C(A_i) + C(B_i)), where A_i and B_i are the partitions of component i.\n\nWait, but that's only if the graph is bipartite. So the first step is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not bipartite, then there's already an odd cycle, so t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, we need to compute the minimal edges to add, which is 1, and the number of possible ways is the sum over all connected components of (C(A_i) + C(B_i)).\n\nWait, but why is the minimal number of edges 1? Because adding a single edge between two nodes in the same partition of a bipartition creates an odd cycle. So that's the minimal possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Check if the graph has any odd-length cycles. If yes, then t=0 and w=1.\n- Else, the graph is bipartite. Then t=1, and w is the sum for each connected component of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions in that component.\n\nWait, but why? Because adding any such edge would create an odd cycle. So the number of possible edges to add is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2). But since the graph is bipartite, there are no existing edges between same partitions. So the number of possible edges that can be added is exactly that sum. Therefore, the answer for w is that sum.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add exactly t edges (which is 1) to form a cycle of odd length. So each such edge addition is a way. So the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle is exactly the sum of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) for each connected component. So the answer for w is that sum.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple connected components? For example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 4\n\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n\nLet me draw this graph. Let's see:\n\nNodes 1 connected to 2 and 3.\n\nNodes 4 connected to 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the graph has two connected components? No, it's connected. Let me see:\n\n1 is connected to 2, 3. 2 is connected to 4, 3 is connected to 4. So all four nodes are connected. So the connected component is one.\n\nNow, check if it's bipartite.\n\nLet me try to color it. Let's assign colors to nodes.\n\nStart with node 1 as color 0. Then its neighbors (2 and 3) must be color 1. Then node 2's neighbors (1, 4) — 1 is color 0, so 4 must be color 0. Similarly, node 3's neighbors are 1 (color 0) and 4. So 4 must be color 0. So node 4 is color 0. Then, node 4's neighbors are 2 and 3 (color 1). So that's okay.\n\nNow, check for any conflicts. All edges are between 0 and 1. So the graph is bipartitioned into {1,4} and {2,3}.\n\nSo the sizes of the partitions are 2 and 2. Then (a choose 2 + b choose 2) is 2C2 + 2C2 = 1 +1 = 2. Which matches the first sample output: t=1 and w=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second case:\n\n3 nodes, connected as a triangle. So it's a cycle of length 3 (odd). So the graph already has an odd cycle. So t=0, w=1.\n\nThird sample input is 3 nodes and 0 edges. The graph is bipartite (since it's disconnected). Each connected component is a single node. For each component, the partitions are size 1 and 0. So for each component, the sum is 1C2 + 0C2 = 0. So the total sum is 0. But that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the graph is bipartite. So for each connected component (each single node), the bipartition is (1,0). Then the number of possible edges to add is (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. So sum across all components is zero. But according to the third sample input, the output is 3 1. Wait, that's conflicting. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the third sample input is n=3 and m=0. So the graph is three isolated nodes. So each connected component is a single node. Now, the graph is bipartite, because each component is trivially bipartitioned. But to create an odd cycle, how?\n\nIn this case, the minimal number of edges to add is 3? Because adding any single edge would not create a cycle. Adding two edges would create a cycle of length 2? No, but that's not possible. Wait, adding two edges between nodes A and B, and B and C. Then, there's no cycle. Adding three edges would form a triangle. So to create an odd cycle, you need to add three edges. So in this case, t is 3, and w is 1 (only one way to add three edges to form a triangle).\n\nBut according to our earlier logic, when the graph is bipartite, t is 1. But in this case, the graph is bipartite, but adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would not create a cycle. Because the component is a single node. So the bipartition is (1,0). Adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition is impossible because there are no two nodes in the same partition. So the sum of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) for all components is 0. So according to our previous logic, the answer would be t=1, but that's not possible. So clearly, our previous reasoning was wrong.\n\nAh! So the mistake is that for connected components that are single nodes, the bipartitions are size 1 and 0. So the number of possible edges to add is (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0. So for such components, adding any edge would not create an odd cycle. Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition. But in this case, the component is a single node. So the bipartition is (1,0). So adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would require two nodes in the same partition. But the component has only one node. So the sum is zero. Therefore, in this case, the total sum across all components is zero. So according to our previous approach, the answer would be t=1, but that's not possible. So what's wrong here?\n\nThis suggests that our approach is missing something. So the problem arises when the connected component is a single node. So, for a connected component that is a single node, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition is not possible. Hence, for such components, there's no possible edge to add. Therefore, in order to create an odd cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that creates a cycle. But for that, we need at least three nodes. So, in the case of the third sample input, where there are three isolated nodes, the minimal number of edges to add is 3 (connecting them into a triangle). So in this case, t is 3, and w is 1.\n\nSo our previous approach is incorrect. It works only when the graph is bipartite and there exists at least one connected component with at least two nodes. So, how to adjust the approach?\n\nSo, the key idea is that if the graph is bipartite, then:\n\n- If there exists at least one connected component with at least two nodes, then adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition (of that component) will create an odd cycle. Hence, t=1 and w is the sum over all components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\n- If all connected components are single nodes (n nodes, all isolated), then to create an odd cycle, you need to add three edges (forming a triangle). So t=3, and w=1 (the only way is to connect all three nodes in a triangle).\n\nWait, but what if the graph is bipartite, but has multiple components. For example, a graph with two components: one component is a single node, another component is two nodes connected by an edge. Then, the component with two nodes is bipartitioned into (1,1). So the sum for that component is (1 choose 2 + 1 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. So the total sum is zero. So according to the previous approach, the answer would be t=1, but how?\n\nAdding an edge between two nodes in the same partition. But in the component with two nodes, the partitions are size 1 and 1. So adding an edge between the two nodes (which are in different partitions) would not create an odd cycle. Wait, no. The component is a single edge. So the bipartition is {A, B} where A and B are the two nodes. Adding an edge between A and B would create a cycle of length 1? No, but that's not possible. Wait, the existing edge is between A and B. Adding another edge between A and B would create a loop, but the problem says that adding loops is prohibited. So in this case, the sum is zero. So the total is zero. Thus, the previous approach would say that the answer is t=1, but there are no edges to add. Hence, this is a problem.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the previous approach is only valid when the graph is bipartite and has at least one connected component with at least two nodes. Otherwise, when all components are single nodes, the minimal t is 3.\n\nSo, the overall steps are:\n\n1. Check if the graph has an odd-length cycle. If yes, then t=0 and w=1.\n\n2. Else, the graph is bipartite. Then:\n\n   a. Check if there exists at least one connected component with size ≥ 2. If yes, then t=1, and w is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\n   b. Else, all components are single nodes. Then, to form an odd cycle, you need to add 3 edges (forming a triangle). So t=3, and w=1 (only one way to choose 3 nodes and connect them as a triangle).\n\nBut how to check if the graph is bipartite?\n\nWe can perform a BFS or DFS for each connected component and check if it is bipartite. If any component is not bipartite, then the graph has an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each connected component, check if it is bipartite. If any is not, then the answer is t=0 and w=1.\n\nElse:\n\n- Check if there's at least one component with size ≥2.\n\n   - If yes, then t=1, and w is the sum over all components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\n   - If no (all components are size 1), then t=3 and w=1.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the graph is bipartite and there is at least one component with size ≥2, then adding one edge between same partition nodes would create an odd cycle. So that's correct.\n\nBut for the case where the graph is bipartite and has components with size ≥2, but the sum of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) is zero. For example, a component with two nodes. Then, a_i and b_i are both 1. So (1 choose 2) is 0. So sum is zero. So in this case, the answer would be t=1 and w=0. But that's impossible. Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition. But in this case, the component has two nodes. The bipartition is (1,1). So adding an edge between the two nodes (which are in different partitions) would not create an odd cycle. Wait, but the existing edge is between the two nodes. So adding another edge would be a parallel edge, which is not allowed. So in this case, the sum is zero, meaning that there are no possible edges to add. So what's the problem here?\n\nAh! So the problem is that in a component that is bipartitioned into (a, b), the possible edges that can be added between same partitions are those that are not already present. However, in the case of a component with two nodes connected by an edge, the bipartition is (1,1). The possible edges between same partitions are between the two nodes in the same partition. But since they are in different partitions, there are no same partition pairs. Hence, the sum is zero. Therefore, in this case, adding an edge would not be possible. So the answer would be t=1, but there are zero ways. Which is impossible. So this suggests that our approach is missing something.\n\nSo, this case is a problem. How can we handle it?\n\nWait, the component is a single edge (two nodes). The graph is bipartitioned into {u}, {v}. So the possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle are between same partitions. But the same partitions are {u} and {v}, so adding an edge between u and u (loop) is not allowed. Or between v and v (loop). So there are no possible edges. Hence, the sum is zero. So in this case, the answer would be t=1 and w=0. But that's impossible. Because adding any edge would not create an odd cycle. So the minimal number of edges is not 1. So what's wrong here?\n\nSo, this indicates that the approach is incorrect. So the problem is that the graph is bipartite, but there's no way to add an edge between same partitions. So the minimal t is not 1. But how?\n\nSo, in this case, the graph is bipartite. But adding an edge between same partitions is not possible. So how to create an odd cycle?\n\nWe need to add edges such that there is a cycle with odd length. How?\n\nFor example, take two components: each is a single edge. Suppose n=4, and two separate edges. Then, the graph is bipartite. To create an odd cycle, perhaps adding two edges. For example, connect the two components into a structure that forms a cycle of odd length. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of edges to add is 2. For example, take two separate edges (u-v and x-y). Add edges u-x and v-y. Then, the cycle u-v-y-x-u is of length 4 (even). Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, add edges u-x and v-x. Then, there is a cycle u-v-x-u, which is length 3 (odd). So adding two edges.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal t is 2. Which contradicts our previous approach of t=1.\n\nSo this shows that our initial approach is incorrect. Hence, there's a flaw in the logic.\n\nThus, the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to approach this?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAn odd-length cycle can be formed in two scenarios:\n\nCase 1: The graph already contains an odd cycle. Then t=0 and w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite. Then, to create an odd cycle, we need to add edges such that there exists an odd-length cycle.\n\nIn a bipartite graph, any cycle is of even length. Adding edges can create odd-length cycles. The minimal number of edges to add depends on the structure of the graph.\n\nSo, for a bipartite graph, the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle is:\n\n- If there exists a connected component with at least two nodes, then adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition (of that component) would create an odd cycle. However, this is only possible if there are at least two nodes in the same partition of that component. For example, in a component with two nodes (u and v) connected by an edge. The bipartition is {u}, {v}. There are no two nodes in the same partition, so adding an edge between same partition is not possible. Hence, in this case, adding one edge is not possible. Hence, we need to find another way.\n\nSo, the problem is that in some cases, even though the graph is bipartite, there's no way to add a single edge to create an odd cycle. Hence, the minimal t is higher.\n\nSo, the minimal t in case of a bipartite graph depends on the presence of connected components with enough nodes in their partitions.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: There exists a connected component with at least two nodes in one of its partitions. Then, adding one edge between two nodes in that partition creates an odd cycle. So t=1.\n\nScenario 2: All connected components are either single-node or have partitions of size 1 and 1. In this case, adding a single edge is not possible (as explained earlier). So, what's the minimal number of edges to add?\n\nIn this case, the graph is made up of components that are either single nodes or edges (two nodes). To form an odd cycle, we need to connect these components in a way that creates a cycle of odd length.\n\nFor example, consider two separate edges (u-v and x-y). To form a cycle of length 3, we need to connect u to x and v to y, but that creates a cycle of length 4. Alternatively, connect u to x and u to y. Then, u-x-u-y-u is not a cycle. Wait, that's a loop. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, connect u to x and x to v. Then, the cycle is u-v-x-u. That's a cycle of length 3. So adding two edges. Hence, t=2.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal t is 2. So for a graph composed of components that are edges (each with two nodes), the minimal t is 2.\n\nAnother example: three separate edges. How to create an odd cycle? Maybe connect three edges into a triangle. But that requires adding three edges. For example, take three components (u-v, x-y, a-b). Connect u to x, x to a, a to u. That forms a triangle. So adding three edges. But maybe there's a way to do it with fewer edges. Like, connect u to x and x to v. Then, u-v-x-u is a cycle of length 3. So adding two edges.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t is 2.\n\nSo, in general, if the graph is bipartite and all connected components have size 1 or 2, then the minimal number of edges to add is:\n\n- If there are at least two components of size ≥ 2 (i.e., edges), then t=2. Because you can take two edges and connect them to form a triangle.\n\n- If there is only one component of size 2 (an edge), then you need to add two edges to connect it to another node. But wait, there are no other nodes. So if the graph is one edge and two isolated nodes, then adding three edges to form a triangle.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. How to generalize this?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe minimal number of edges to add to make an odd cycle in a bipartite graph is:\n\n- If there exists a connected component with at least two nodes in one partition (i.e., a_i ≥ 2 or b_i ≥ 2 for some component), then t=1.\n\n- Else, all connected components are single-node or edges (each component is size 1 or 2). Then, the minimal number of edges to add is 2 if there are at least two components of size ≥2 (like two edges), otherwise:\n\n   - If there is one component of size 2 (an edge), then you need to add two edges to connect it to another node. But if there are no other nodes (n=2), then you can't form a cycle. So for n=2, you need to add one edge to form a loop, which is not allowed. Hence, impossible. But the problem states that the graph has no loops, but you can't add loops.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the graph has no loops, and you cannot add loops. So, in the case of n=2, you can't form a cycle. So, the minimal number of edges to add is 1? No, because that would create a loop. So, the problem requires that the new graph has a cycle of odd length. So for n=2, it's impossible. But the problem statement says that the graph is given with n ≥1. However, the sample input includes n=3 with 0 edges, and the answer is t=3, w=1.\n\nSo, going back, the case when the graph is bipartite and all components are of size ≤ 2.\n\nSo, if there are at least two components of size 2 (each being an edge), then you can add two edges to form a triangle. For example, take two edges u-v and x-y. Add edges u-x and v-y. Then the cycle u-v-y-x-u is length 4 (even). Not helpful. But if you add edges u-x and v-x, then the cycle u-v-x-u is length 3 (odd). So adding two edges. Hence, t=2.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t is 2. And the number of ways is the number of ways to choose two components of size 2 and then add edges between them.\n\nWait, but in the case of multiple components, how to count the number of ways?\n\nAlternatively, for the case where all components are size 1 or 2, and the graph is bipartite, then:\n\nIf there are k components of size 2 (each is an edge), then the minimal t is 2, and the number of ways is C(k, 2) * 2. Because for any two components (each being an edge u-v and x-y), you can connect u to x and v to x (creating a cycle u-v-x-u). Or connect u to y and v to y. Or connect u to x and v to y (which doesn't create a cycle). Or connect u to x and v to x (cycle of length 3). Or connect u to y and v to y. So for each pair of components, there are 2 ways to add two edges to form a cycle.\n\nWait, but for two components (u-v and x-y), how many ways to add two edges to create a cycle of odd length?\n\nLet's think. We need to connect the two components in such a way that there is a cycle of odd length.\n\nOne possibility is to connect u to x and v to x. This creates a cycle u-v-x-u (length 3). Another possibility is to connect u to y and v to y. That's also a cycle of length 3. Or connect u to x and v to y. Then, the path u-v-y-x-u is length 4. No cycle. Or connect u to x and x to v. Then, the cycle u-v-x-u (same as before). Or connect u to x and x to y. That's adding two edges, but the cycle is u-x-y-x-u (which is not a simple cycle, since x is visited twice). Not allowed.\n\nSo, for two components, there are exactly two ways to add two edges to create a cycle of length 3.\n\nHence, for each pair of components of size 2, there are 2 ways.\n\nSo, the number of ways is (number of pairs of components of size 2) multiplied by 2.\n\nIf there are no such pairs (i.e., only one component of size 2), then we need to add three edges. For example, take the component (u-v) and two isolated nodes x and y. Then, adding edges u-x, x-y, y-v creates a cycle u-v-y-x-u (length 4). Not helpful. Alternatively, add edges u-x, x-y, y-u. That forms a triangle (u-x-y-u). Length 3. So adding three edges. Hence, t=3, and the number of ways is C( (number of isolated nodes), 2 ), since we need to choose two nodes to connect with u. Wait, but in this case, the isolated nodes are x and y. So for the component (u-v), and two isolated nodes x and y, the number of ways to add three edges is 1 (connect u to x, x to y, and y to u). Or, alternatively, connect u to x, x to y, and y to v. That would form a cycle of length 4. Not helpful. So the only way is to connect three nodes into a triangle. So, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose three nodes (the two from the component plus one isolated node? No, the component has two nodes. So, to form a triangle, we need to select two more nodes. But if there are only two isolated nodes, then we can connect them with the two nodes in the component. So, the number of ways is 1 (the only way to connect the two isolated nodes with the component's nodes to form a triangle).\n\nBut this seems complicated. So, for the case where the graph is bipartite and all components are size 1 or 2, the minimal t depends on the number of components of size 2:\n\n- If there are at least two components of size 2: then t=2, and the number of ways is C(k, 2) * 2, where k is the number of components of size 2.\n\n- If there is exactly one component of size 2: then, to form an odd cycle, we need to add three edges. For example, connect the two nodes of the component with two other nodes. So, the number of ways depends on the number of available isolated nodes. If there are at least two isolated nodes, then the number of ways is C( (number of isolated nodes), 2 ). Because we need to choose two nodes from the isolated ones and connect them with the two nodes in the component to form a triangle. For example, component has u and v. Isolated nodes are x and y. The triangle can be u-v-x-u (requires adding edges u-x and v-x, but that's only two edges. Wait, that forms a cycle of length 3. Oh right, earlier example. So adding two edges. Wait, this contradicts the previous analysis. So, if there's one component of size 2 (u-v) and two isolated nodes (x and y), then adding edges u-x and v-x would form a cycle of length 3. That's two edges. So in this case, t=2. Which contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nSo why is this? Because even with one component of size 2, we can add two edges to form a cycle of length 3. Hence, the minimal t is 2 in this case.\n\nAh, this changes everything. So, in this case, the minimal t is 2, not 3. So, the earlier analysis was incorrect.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the minimal t is 2, and the number of ways depends on the number of isolated nodes.\n\nSo, this suggests that the previous approach is incorrect, and that the problem is more complex.\n\nAt this point, I'm realizing that the initial approach is insufficient and that the problem requires a deeper analysis.\n\nLet me think differently. The problem requires finding the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle. What's the minimal possible t?\n\nAn odd-length cycle requires at least 3 nodes. So, the minimal number of edges needed to create such a cycle is:\n\n- If the graph has at least 3 nodes and is bipartite, then:\n\n   - If there's a connected component with at least two nodes in one partition (so adding one edge between them creates an odd cycle), then t=1.\n\n   - Else, if the graph has at least three nodes (but all components are size 1 or 2), then:\n\n      - If there are at least two components of size 2 (edges), then t=2 (adding two edges to connect them into a triangle).\n\n      - If there is one component of size 2 and at least one other node (so, at least one isolated node), then t=2 (adding two edges to connect the two nodes of the component to the isolated node, forming a triangle).\n\n      - If there is only one component of size 2 and no other nodes (n=2), then it's impossible to form a cycle. But the problem says that the graph has n ≥1, but in this case, the minimal t is 1? No, because adding an edge between the two nodes would create a cycle of length 1 (which is not allowed). Or it would form a single edge, which is not a cycle. So, no way to form a cycle. Hence, the problem must ensure that the input allows for a solution. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the input is such that it's possible to add edges to form an odd cycle. Or is it?\n\nThe problem says that it's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain loops or parallel edges. But it doesn't say that it's possible to form an odd cycle. However, the sample input includes the case of n=3 and m=0, which requires adding three edges. So, the problem must have a solution for all inputs.\n\nBut how to handle all cases?\n\nLet me think of all possibilities for the graph being bipartite:\n\nCase 1: The graph has at least one connected component with a_i ≥ 2 or b_i ≥ 2. Then, adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition creates an odd cycle. So t=1.\n\nCase 2: All connected components have size 1 or 2, and the total number of nodes is at least 3. Then, we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges. How?\n\nFor example, if there is one component of size 2 (u-v) and one isolated node x, then adding edges u-x and v-x creates a cycle u-v-x-u (length 3). So t=2.\n\nIf there are two components of size 2 (u-v and x-y), adding edges u-x and v-x creates a cycle of length 3 (u-v-x-u).\n\nIf there are three isolated nodes (x, y, z), then adding edges x-y and y-z creates a path of length 2, but no cycle. To create a cycle, need three edges. For example, connect x-y, y-z, z-x. That's three edges, forming a triangle. So t=3.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t depends on the number of nodes and the structure of the components.\n\nThis is getting very complex. How to generalize this?\n\nPerhaps the minimal number of edges to add is:\n\n- If the graph is bipartite and has at least three nodes, then the minimal t is:\n\n   - If there is at least one component with at least two nodes in a partition, then t=1.\n\n   - Else, if there are at least two components of size 2, then t=2.\n\n   - Else, if there is one component of size 2 and at least one other node, then t=2.\n\n   - Else, if all nodes are isolated (n ≥ 3), then t=3.\n\nBut how to determine this programmatically?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nAfter determining that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and the number of ways to achieve this.
