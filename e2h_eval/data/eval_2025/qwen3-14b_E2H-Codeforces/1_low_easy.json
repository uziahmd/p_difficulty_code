The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but how do I compute the number of cells in each ring?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a 3x3 rectangle's border has 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice) → 8 cells. Which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that each subsequent ring is possible. For example, if the initial w and h are small, after some steps, the dimensions might become too small. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ), which probably ensures that each ring can be formed.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and add them all.\n\nSo let's formalize this. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and current height is h_i = h - 4*(i-1). The perimeter for this ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Sum this over i from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. Then for i=1, w_i=3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8 → correct.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28 → matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is i=2: w_i =7 -4*(1) =3, h_i=9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40 → which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   - add to total\n\n- Return total\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because for the maximum k allowed, min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 1? Let me think. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me see. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For that case, when i=1, 3-4*(0) =3, which is okay. If min(w,h) is 5, then (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1. But for i=1, 5-0=5, which is okay. If k is 2, then for min(w,h) = 7, since (7+1)/4 is 2. So floor is 2. Then for i=2, 7 -4*(1) =3, which is okay.\n\nSo the formula for the maximum k ensures that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or maybe not. Let me think. Suppose min(w, h) is ",
