The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, like the first one, the perimeter of the rectangle. But how is that calculated? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, 3x3: the perimeter cells are the outermost layer. So for a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W or H cells, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So yes, 2*(W + H - 2) equals that. So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w' x h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that each subsequent ring is possible. For example, if the current dimensions are such that the rectangle is too small to have a ring. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), which ensures that each ring is possible. So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions for the ring are valid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd this to total.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So current_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the second output. Then third example is 7 9 2. So for i=1, perimeter is 28. For i=2, current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9 -4*(1)=5. Then perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 =40. Which matches the third example. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k, then loop for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter for each, sum them all.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then, for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum += perimeter\n\nReturn sum.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So for the given k, each i-th ring is possible. So no need to check.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me test with the third example. For i=1: 7,9. perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. i=2:",
