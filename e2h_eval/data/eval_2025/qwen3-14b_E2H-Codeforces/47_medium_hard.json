    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the LCM depends on. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of x and y. Because if the GCD is larger, then the LCM would be smaller for the same product.\n\nBut since x and y are a + k and b + k, let's denote them as x and y. Let's say x = a + k, y = b + k. Then, x - y = a - b. Wait, because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me call this difference d. Let's assume that a < b. Then, d is negative. But maybe I should take absolute value. Wait, regardless of which is bigger, the difference between x and y is (a - b), but since x and y are swapped if a and b are swapped, maybe I can assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b. Or maybe not. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key idea here is that the difference between x and y is fixed. Let me think: Let's suppose that a and b are given, and we want to choose k such that x = a + k, y = b + k. Then, the difference between x and y is (a - b). Let me define d = |a - b|. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed. So, for example, if a is 6 and b is 10, then d is 4. So x and y differ by 4. Now, for their LCM to be as small as possible, we want their GCD to be as large as possible. Because LCM(x,y) = (x*y)/GCD(x,y). Since x and y differ by d, perhaps the maximum GCD possible is d. Because if x and y have a common divisor g, then since x - y = d, then g must divide d. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD is the greatest common divisor of d and ... something else?\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me suppose that x and y are two numbers such that x - y = d. Then, any common divisor of x and y must divide d. So, the GCD of x and y must be a divisor of d. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that divides both x and y. So, if we can find a k such that x and y are multiples of some divisor of d, then that would help.\n\nBut how can we find such a k?\n\nLet me consider that x = a + k, y = b + k. Let's say that a < b, so d = b - a. Then, y = x + d. So, the GCD of x and y is the same as GCD(x, x + d) = GCD(x, d). Therefore, the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that divides x. So, to maximize the GCD, we need to find x such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d. And since x can be chosen by varying k, we can find the optimal x.\n\nWait, but how does that help us? Let me think. For example, in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. d = 4. So, the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of 4. Let's see. We want to find x and y such that their GCD is as large as possible. Let's say that the maximum possible is 4. Then, x must be a multiple of 4. Let's see: for x = 8 (k=2), y is 12. Their GCD is 4. So LCM is 8*12 /4 = 24. Which is indeed the sample's answer. If we can find a case where the GCD is 4, that's better than lower GCDs.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the maximum possible GCD of x and y. Since that maximum is a divisor of d, we can iterate through all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, find the minimal k that makes x and y divisible by g. Then, among those possibilities, choose the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal k for each possible g?\n\nLet me think. For a given g (divisor of d), we want x = a +k to be divisible by g, and y = b +k to be divisible by g. But since y = x +d, and d is a multiple of g (since g divides d), then if x is divisible by g, then y is also divisible by g. Because x +d is congruent to 0 + 0 mod g (since d is a multiple of g). So, for a given g, we need x to be divisible by g. That is, a +k ≡ 0 mod g. So, k ≡ (-a) mod g. So, the minimal non-negative k for this condition is (g - (a % g)) % g. Wait, but that's when a mod g is not zero. For example, if a mod g is 0, then k can be zero. But we need to make sure that when we compute k, it's the minimal possible.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal k such that a +k is divisible by g. Then, once we find that k, the LCM of x and y is (x * y)/g. But since x = g * m, and y = g * n, and since x and y differ by d, which is g * (n - m). Wait, since x = a +k, y = x +d. So, since d is a multiple of g, then x and y are both multiples of g, so their GCD is at least g. However, the actual GCD could be higher. But for our purposes, since we are considering all possible divisors of d, and trying to find the maximum possible, perhaps we can proceed.\n\nBut wait, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is the maximum divisor of d. So, if we find the maximum possible g (divisor of d), then for that g, the LCM would be (x * y) / g. But since x and y are multiples of g, let me think: x = g * m, y = g * n. Then, their LCM is g * m * n / gcd(m,n). But since x and y differ by d, which is g * (n - m) = d. So, n - m = d/g. So, for example, if g is the maximum possible divisor of d, then m and n are such that their difference is d/g. But since we want to minimize the LCM, perhaps choosing the maximum possible g will lead to the minimal LCM.\n\nTherefore, the strategy could be:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If a == b, then d is zero. But in that case, a +k and b +k are the same number. So, their LCM is a +k. So the minimal possible is when k is zero, since that gives a +0 = a. So, in that case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, first, handle the case where a == b. Then the answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, for the case where a != b:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|.\n\nThen, find all divisors of d. For each divisor g, compute the minimal k such that a +k is divisible by g. Then, for that k, the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is ( (a +k) * (b +k) ) / g. But since a +k and b +k are multiples of g, and their difference is d, which is a multiple of g.\n\nBut for each divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal k. Then, for each such k, compute the LCM. Then, choose the k that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple k's have the same LCM, choose the smallest one.\n\nBut how do we find all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, for d up to 1e9, generating all the divisors can be done efficiently. For example, factorize d, generate all possible combinations of exponents, etc. But factorizing a number up to 1e9 is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps even better, since we can generate all the divisors of d by checking up to sqrt(d).\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can process them in descending order. Because the largest possible g would give the best chance for minimal LCM.\n\nBut for each divisor g, we need to compute the minimal k such that a +k is divisible by g. Let me think: Let's suppose that a < b. Then, d = b -a. So, we can compute k such that (a +k) mod g == 0. So, k ≡ -a mod g. The minimal non-negative k is (g - (a % g)) % g. Wait, for example, if a mod g is zero, then k is zero. Otherwise, it's (g - (a mod g)).\n\nBut wait, since a +k must be divisible by g. So, k = (g - (a % g)) % g. Because if a mod g is zero, then k is zero. Otherwise, it's g - (a mod g). So that's the minimal non-negative k.\n\nBut once we compute this k, then for that k, the LCM is ((a +k) * (b +k)) / g. However, since a +k and b +k are multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. But since they differ by d, which is a multiple of g, their GCD could be higher. For example, suppose that g is a divisor of d, and the actual GCD of x and y is g', which is a multiple of g. Then, the LCM would be (x * y) / g', which is smaller than (x * y)/g. However, since we are considering all possible divisors of d, including those that are multiples of g, perhaps when we process the divisors in descending order, we can find the best possible one.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d. So, if we process the divisors in descending order, and for each, compute the minimal k, then the first one that gives a valid k would be the best option. But perhaps not. Because even if a larger g is considered, the corresponding k may result in a higher LCM than a smaller g. For example, maybe for a larger g, the x and y are larger numbers, but their GCD is larger, leading to a smaller LCM.\n\nBut how can we compare between different g's?\n\nFor example, suppose d is 4. Suppose that we have two divisors: 4 and 2. For the divisor 4, the minimal k is such that a +k is divisible by 4. Let's say that a is 6. Then, for g=4, the minimal k is (4 - (6%4)) mod 4. 6 mod 4 is 2. So, k is 2. Then x is 8, y is 12. LCM is 24. For g=2, the minimal k is (2 - (6%2)) mod 2. 6%2 is 0, so k is 0. Then x is 6, y is 10. Their LCM is 30. So, in this case, the larger g gives a better LCM.\n\nAnother example: suppose d is 6, and we have two divisors 6 and 3. Suppose a is 3. For g=6: k = (6 - (3%6)) mod 6 → 3. So x is 3+3=6, y is 3+3 +6= 12? Wait, no, original a and b are such that d is 6. Let's say a is 3, and b is 9. Then d is 6. For g=6, the minimal k is (6 - (3 mod 6)) mod 6 → 6-3=3. So k=3. x = 6, y = 9 +3=12. LCM(6,12) is 12. For g=3, the minimal k is (3 - (3 mod 3)) mod 3 → 0. Then x is 3, y is 9. LCM is 9. Which is better. So here, the smaller g gives a better LCM. Wait, but why?\n\nAh, because even though the GCD is higher for g=6 (since GCD(6,12) is 6, which is higher than GCD(3,9) which is 3), the product x*y is 6*12=72, divided by GCD 6 → 12. While for the other case, 3*9=27, divided by GCD 3 → 9. Which is smaller. So, even though the GCD is larger, the product x*y is much larger. Therefore, the LCM is not necessarily minimized by taking the largest possible GCD. So, this suggests that we need to check all possible divisors of d, and for each compute the corresponding LCM, then choose the minimal one.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n- For each divisor g of d (where d is |a -b|), compute the minimal k such that (a +k) is divisible by g. Then compute the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k), which is ((a +k) * (b +k)) / gcd(a +k, b +k). However, since a +k and b +k are multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. But since they differ by d, which is a multiple of g, their GCD is actually g * gcd(m, n), where m = (a +k)/g and n = (b +k)/g. But since (b +k) - (a +k) = d = g * (n - m) → n -m = d/g. So, m and n differ by d/g.\n\nBut since m and n differ by a fixed value, their GCD depends on their values. However, since we don't know what m and n are, perhaps we can't compute the exact GCD. However, for the purpose of computing the LCM, perhaps we can note that the LCM is (x * y) / GCD(x, y). But since x and y are multiples of g, let's say x = g * m and y = g * n. Then, LCM(x, y) = g * m * n / GCD(m, n). But since y -x = d = g * (n - m) → n - m = d/g. So, for a fixed g, m and n differ by d/g. But m and n can be any integers such that n = m + (d/g). Therefore, the LCM is g * m * (m + (d/g)) / GCD(m, m + (d/g)).\n\nBut since d/g is an integer (as g divides d), let's denote t = d/g. Then, the LCM becomes g * m * (m + t) / GCD(m, m + t) = g * m * (m + t) / GCD(m, t). Because GCD(m, m + t) = GCD(m, t).\n\nBut m is (a +k)/g. How can we find m? Well, since k is chosen such that a +k is divisible by g, then m = (a +k)/g. But since k is chosen to be minimal, m is the smallest possible value such that m >= (a)/g (but since k is non-negative, m can be as low as ceil(a/g) or something, but I'm not sure).\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps there's another way. Because for the particular k chosen for divisor g, the x and y are (a +k) and (b +k) = x + d. Since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then y is also a multiple of g. Therefore, the GCD of x and y is equal to g * GCD(m, n), where m and n are x/g and y/g respectively. However, since y = x + d, and d = g * t, then y/g = x/g + t. So, m and m + t. Therefore, GCD(x, y) = g * GCD(m, m + t) = g * GCD(m, t). \n\nBut since t = d/g, which is fixed for a given g. Therefore, the LCM is (x * y) / (g * GCD(m, t)) ). But x * y is (g*m) * (g*(m + t)) ) = g² * m (m + t). Therefore, the LCM is [g² * m (m +t)] / [g * GCD(m, t)] ] = g * m (m + t) / GCD(m, t).\n\nBut m is (a +k)/g. However, since k is the minimal non-negative value such that a +k is divisible by g, then a +k is the smallest multiple of g that is ≥ a. Let me think: For example, if a is 6 and g is 4, then the minimal k is 2, making a +k = 8. Which is the first multiple of 4 ≥ 6. So m = 8 /4 = 2.\n\nSo, for a given g, m is the ceiling of a/g, but adjusted to be exactly the multiple. Wait, more accurately, m = (a +k)/g, where k is the minimal non-negative integer that makes a +k divisible by g. So, m = ceil(a / g) if a is not divisible by g, or m = a/g if it is. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, m is (a +k)/g = (a + ( (g - a % g) % g )) / g. Which simplifies to (a + (g - a % g)) // g if a % g is not zero. Or a//g if a is divisible by g. So, m = ceil(a/g) if a mod g is not zero, else a/g. But perhaps there's a simpler way to compute m. Anyway, regardless of m, the LCM for this case is g * m * (m + t) / GCD(m, t), where t = d/g.\n\nBut how can we compute this? Well, since t is fixed for a given g, and m is determined by the minimal k, perhaps we can compute this value for each divisor g. However, this seems computationally intensive, but given that the number of divisors of d is small (for d up to 1e9, the maximum number of divisors is around 1000 for numbers with many factors), it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Because for the minimal k, the corresponding x and y are the smallest possible multiples of g that are ≥ a and ≥ b, respectively. Wait, no. Because when you add k to both a and b, they become x and y. But since x = a +k and y = b +k, and since d = |a -b|, then x and y are either increasing together. So, for example, if a < b, then adding k increases both numbers. So, the minimal k that makes x divisible by g is the same as making a +k divisible by g. Once that is done, y is automatically divisible by g. Therefore, the LCM for x and y is (x * y) / GCD(x, y) = (x * y) / (g * GCD(m, t)), where t = d/g. However, since m = x/g, and t = d/g, which is fixed for the current g.\n\nBut how do we compute this for each g? Well, perhaps for each divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal k, then compute x and y, then compute their LCM directly. Because for small numbers, this is feasible. However, if d is large (up to 1e9), and the divisors are large, then x and y could be up to 1e9 + k, which could be up to 2e9, but computing their LCM is manageable with Python's built-in math.gcd function.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Handle the case when a == b: return 0.\n\n2. Else, compute d = abs(a - b).\n\n3. Find all divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal k such that (a +k) is divisible by g. Then compute x = a +k, y = b +k. Then compute LCM(x, y). Keep track of the minimal LCM, and the corresponding k. If there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest one.\n\n5. Also, we need to consider the case where k is zero. Because for example, if a and b are such that their initial LCM is already minimal. For example, in the third sample input, a=5, b=10. d=5. The divisors of 5 are 1,5. For g=5, the minimal k is (5 - (5%5)) mod 5 → 0. Then x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. For g=1, the minimal k is (1 - 5%1) mod 1 → 0. So x=5, y=10. Same LCM. So the minimal k is 0. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all the divisors of d, compute for each the corresponding k, and then select the best one.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this:\n\nFirst, generate all the divisors of d. How to do that?\n\nWell, for a given number d, we can generate all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d). For each i from 1 to sqrt(d), if i divides d, then add i and d//i to the list of divisors. Then, after collecting all, remove duplicates and sort.\n\nBut in code, we can do:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in the case when a == b, we return 0, so d is zero. But in that case, the code would not reach this part.\n\nSo, once we have all the divisors of d, we can process them.\n\nBut for each divisor g, compute the minimal k. Then compute x and y, compute their LCM, and track the minimal one.\n\nBut what about the case where k is negative? No, because we are taking (g - (a % g)) % g. Which ensures that k is non-negative.\n\nWait, for example, if a is 6 and g is 4, then a mod g is 2, so k is 2. Which is correct. If a is 8 and g is 4, then a mod g is 0, so k is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code for computing k is:\n\ndef compute_k(a, g):\n    remainder = a % g\n    if remainder == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return g - remainder\n\nBut in code, this can be written as (g - (a % g)) % g. Because if a % g is zero, then (g - 0) mod g is zero. But (g - (a % g)) is always between 0 and g-1. So, the minimal k is (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nBut wait, let's test with a = 6, g=4: 6%4=2, 4-2=2. Correct. a=8, g=4: 8%4=0, 4-0=4, mod 4 is zero. Correct.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nOnce we compute k, then x = a +k, y = b +k. Then compute their LCM.\n\nBut how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(x,y) = x * y // gcd(x,y).\n\nSo, in Python, using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value. Since x and y are positive, that's fine.\n\nBut for very large x and y, multiplying them could cause integer overflow. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not an issue.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, compute the corresponding k, then compute x and y, compute their LCM, and track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the k with minimal LCM. If multiple k's have the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nBut what about the case when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, two different divisors g1 and g2, each leading to the same LCM. Then, we have to choose the minimal k between them.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nInitialize min_lcm to a very high value (like infinity), and min_k to a very high value.\n\nFor each g in divisors of d:\n\n    compute k_candidate = compute_k(a, g)\n\n    x = a + k_candidate\n\n    y = b + k_candidate\n\n    current_lcm = lcm(x, y)\n\n    if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n        min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n        min_k = k_candidate\n\n    elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n        if k_candidate < min_k:\n\n            min_k = k_candidate\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, return min_k.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are multiple divisors that produce the same LCM but different k's? For example, in the third sample input, where a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5: compute k_candidate = (5 - (5%5))%5 = 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=1: compute k_candidate = (1 - (5%1))%1 → 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. So, same LCM. So, the minimal k is 0.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would compare the two and choose the smallest k (0 in both cases, so no problem).\n\nAnother example: suppose a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=4: k_candidate=2. x=8, y=12. LCM 24.\n\nFor g=2: compute k_candidate for a=6. 6 mod 2 is 0. So k_candidate is 0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30. Which is higher than 24.\n\nFor g=1: k_candidate is 0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30. So the minimal is 24, with k=2.\n\nThus, the code would select 2.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nBut what about other possible k's that are not generated by the divisors of d? For example, suppose that there exists a k that is not generated by any divisor of d, but gives a better LCM. Is that possible?\n\nNo. Because the maximum possible GCD of x and y is a divisor of d. So, any optimal solution must have a GCD that is a divisor of d. Therefore, the optimal k must be generated by one of the divisors of d.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose that there exists a k such that x and y have a GCD of g, which is not a divisor of d. But earlier reasoning says that since x and y differ by d, their GCD must divide d. Therefore, g must divide d. Hence, all possible GCDs are divisors of d. Thus, the optimal solution must be covered by considering all divisors of d.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n    compute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n    x = a + k_candidate\n\n    y = b + k_candidate\n\n    compute lcm_xy = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)\n\n    track the minimal lcm_xy and the corresponding k_candidate.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, return the minimal k_candidate.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple divisors that generate the same LCM? For example, two different divisors may generate the same LCM, but different k_candidate. We need to pick the smallest k_candidate.\n\nBut in the code, when processing the divisors, if two divisors generate the same LCM, the code will compare their k_candidate and choose the smaller one.\n\nBut the order in which the divisors are processed may affect the outcome. For example, if two divisors generate the same LCM, but the first one has a larger k_candidate than the second. So, during the iteration, when the second is processed, the code will check if it's equal to the current min_lcm and update min_k accordingly.\n\nThus, the code will correctly select the minimal k.\n\nNow, the problem is generating the divisors of d. For example, for d=0, but in that case, a == b, which is handled separately.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, in Python, to compute the divisors of d. Let's code that.\n\nBut also, note that for d=0, the code is not called. Because when a == b, we return 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return divisors\n\nBut for n=0, this function would fail. But since in that case, the code is not called.\n\nNow, the main function:\n\nRead a and b from input. For example, input is a line with two integers.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with two integers. But the example shows multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'], but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is two integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input says:\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo, the code should read a single line with two integers. But in the example, the input is given as three lines. But perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe example shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nOutput:\n\n['2', '9', '0']\n\nBut this is probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is two integers. So, perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is given as two integers. So perhaps the example is written in a way that the user inputs multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line with two integers. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo, the code should read one line of input, with two integers. But the example shows three test cases. So, perhaps the example is showing three separate test cases, each with their own input and output. But the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nSo, for example, when the user runs the code, they input a single line, like \"6 10\", and the code outputs \"2\".\n\nTherefore, the code should read a single line of input, split into a and b.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_k(a, g):\n    remainder = a % g\n    if remainder == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return g - remainder\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(d**0.5) +1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    for g in divisors:\n        # compute k_candidate\n        k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        x = a + k_candidate\n        y = b + k_candidate\n        # compute LCM\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        # compare with min_lcm\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if k_candidate < best_k:\n                best_k = k_candidate\n    print(best_k)\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. For example, in the case where a is larger than b. Let's say a=10, b=6. Then, d is 4. The code computes the divisors of d=4. Then, for each divisor g, compute k_candidate based on a=10. But in this case, the x is a +k_candidate, and y is b +k_candidate. However, the code is correct because the difference between x and y is still d. So, even if a is larger than b, the code works.\n\nBut let's test for the first sample input where a=6 and b=10. The code would compute d=4, divisors {1,2,4, ...}.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when a=5 and b=10, d=5. Divisors are 1,5. For g=5, compute k_candidate = (5 - (5%5))%5 = 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. For g=1, k_candidate is (1 - 5%1) mod 1 → 0. x=5, y=10. Same LCM. So best_k is 0.\n\nAnother example: when a=21 and b=31. Then, d=10. Divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=10:\n\nk_candidate = (10 - (21%10))%10 → 21%10 is 1 → 10-1=9. So k_candidate=9. x=21+9=30, y=31+9=40. LCM(30,40) is 120. \n\ng=5: compute k_candidate = (5 - (21%5))%5 → 21 mod 5 is 1 → 5-1=4. So k_candidate=4. x=21+4=25, y=31+4=35. LCM(25,35) is 175. Which is worse than 120.\n\ng=2: compute k_candidate. 21 mod 2 is 1 → 2-1=1. So k_candidate=1. x=22, y=32. LCM(22,32) is (22*32)/2= 352. Worse.\n\ng=1: k_candidate is 0. x=21, y=31. LCM is 21*31= 651. So the best is 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would return 9 for this case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple divisors that produce the same LCM? For example, suppose two different divisors produce the same LCM but different k's.\n\nAnother edge case: when a=1 and b=2. d=1. Divisors are 1.\n\nk_candidate = (1 - (1%1))%1 → 0. x=1, y=2. LCM is 2. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized.
