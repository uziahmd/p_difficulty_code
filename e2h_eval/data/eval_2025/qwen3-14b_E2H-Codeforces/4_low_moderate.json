The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then compare them and see who loses. The challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round step by step is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: Nikephoros's sequence A has length m, and Polycarpus's sequence B has length k. The moves for each player repeat every m and k rounds respectively. So the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM is the least common multiple of m and k. So after LCM(m, k) rounds, the same pair of moves will be repeated again.\n\nTherefore, the idea is to compute for one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, how many times each player loses. Then, multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (if any).\n\nBut first, let's compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, I can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD first. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive here, it's okay.\n\nOnce I have the LCM, let's call it T. Then, the total number of full cycles is n // T, and the remaining rounds are n % T. For each full cycle, we can calculate the number of losses for each player. Multiply by the number of cycles, then process the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how do I calculate the number of losses in one cycle of T rounds?\n\nWell, for each round in 0 to T-1, I can compute what A's move and B's move are. Then compare them and count the losses.\n\nBut T can be as big as m*k. Since m and k are up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6. Which is manageable. Because even if m and k are both 1000, LCM(m,k) could be up to 1e6. So for each T rounds, we can precompute the number of losses for each player.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k).\n\n2. For each round in 0 to T-1:\n\n   a. Find the move of A: it's A[ i % m ]\n\n   b. Find the move of B: it's B[ i % k ]\n\n   c. Compare them. Determine who loses (if any). Increment the counts accordingly.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is q = n // T, and the remainder is r = n % T.\n\n4. So total losses for each player is q * (losses_in_cycle_A, losses_in_cycle_B) plus the losses in the first r rounds of the next cycle.\n\nSo, the main problem is to compute the number of losses in T rounds, and then compute the number of losses in the first r rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the T rounds?\n\nFor each i in 0 to T-1:\n\nA's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each i in 0 to T-1, we can compute the moves and check who wins.\n\nBut with T up to 1e6, this is feasible. Because even 1e6 iterations are manageable in Python.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCalculate for the entire T rounds, the number of times A loses (which is the number of times B wins) and the number of times B loses (number of times A wins). Then multiply by q, and then add the number of losses in the first r rounds.\n\nNow, how to compute the number of losses in the first r rounds? Well, for that, we can compute for each round from 0 to r-1, check the moves and count.\n\nBut for r up to T-1, which is up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the overall steps:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for a very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Each player's moves repeat cyclically based on their respective sequences. The combined pattern of both players' moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round within one full cycle, determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Up**: Use the results from one cycle to compute the total losses over all full cycles. Then handle any remaining rounds after the full cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle\n    loss_A_cycle = 0  # number of times A loses in one cycle\n    loss_B_cycle = 0  # number of times B loses in one cycle\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            loss_B_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            loss_A_cycle += 1\n    \n    # Total number of full cycles and remainder\n    q = n // T\n    r = n % T\n    \n    total_A = q * loss_A_cycle\n    total_B = q * loss_B_cycle\n    \n    # Now compute the losses in the first r rounds\n    for i in range(r):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_B += 1\n        else:\n            total_A += 1\n    \n    print(total_A, total_B)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences determines the cycle length after which the combined moves repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcomes are recorded. This helps in calculating the number of losses for each player in one cycle.\n4. **Scaling Up**: The total number of full cycles is computed, and the losses from these cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles. Any remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed separately to account for the final partial cycle.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for very large numbers of rounds by leveraging the repeating patterns of the move sequences.",
