The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to calculate how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The key is to simulate each round, but given that n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nThe sequences A and B are cyclic. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, if anyone.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through each round. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of wins in one full cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = T. Because after T rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so their moves will repeat every T rounds.\n\nBut wait, for example, if A has length m and B has length k, then after T rounds, where T is the LCM of m and k, the combination of moves would repeat. So the pattern of wins and losses would repeat every T rounds.\n\nSo the idea is to compute how many times each player loses in one T-round cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the result for the remaining rounds (n mod T).\n\nBut first, let's compute T. How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, it's okay.\n\nSo first step: compute T = LCM(m, k). But since m and k can be up to 1000, T could be up to 1e6 (since LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000). Wait, 1000 * 1000 is 1e6, but since LCM is up to that. So even if n is 2e9, T is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k). Let's say T is the period after which the moves repeat.\n\n- For each round from 0 to T-1, compute the moves of A and B, and determine who wins. Then, count for each of these T rounds, how many times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and how many times Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is q = n // T, and the remainder is r = n % T.\n\nSo the total for each player is q * (their loss count in one cycle) + the loss count in the first r rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor a given round i (starting from 0?), the move of A is A[i % m], and the move of B is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0..T-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nBut since T is up to 1e6, and for each of those steps, we can compute the outcome, this is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each of the T rounds (0 to T-1) the outcome (who loses, if any).\n\n2. Sum up the number of losses for each player in this T-length period.\n\n3. Multiply by the number of full cycles (q) and add the losses from the first r rounds (r is n % T).\n\nBut how to handle the rounds? Let me think:\n\nSuppose n is 7, T is 4. Then q = 7//4 = 1, r=3. So the total is 1 full cycle (each of the 4 rounds) and then 3 more rounds.\n\nSo for each of the first 4 rounds, we have the counts, and then for the first 3 rounds of the next cycle.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for the first T rounds, the counts of losses for each player. Then compute how many full cycles there are (q) and how many remaining rounds (r). Then total for each player is (count_in_cycle * q) + count_in_first_r_rounds.\n\nNow, the main steps are:\n\n- Compute T.\n\n- Precompute for each of the T rounds",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, we must efficiently simulate the game by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' move sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Game Rules**: Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. A draw results in no loss for either player.\n2. **Cyclic Nature of Moves**: Each player's moves are repeated cyclically based on their respective sequences.\n3. **Periodicity Detection**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which the move combinations repeat. This allows us to compute the outcomes for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the total number of rounds.\n4. **Efficient Simulation**: By computing the outcomes for one full cycle (determined by the LCM), we can multiply the results by the number of full cycles and add the results from any remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses for each player in one LCM period\n    nikephoros_loss = 0\n    polycarpus_loss = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine the winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_loss += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_loss += 1\n    \n    # Calculate how many full cycles and remaining rounds\n    q = n // lcm\n    r = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nike = nikephoros_loss * q\n    total_poly = polycarpus_loss * q\n    \n    # Now calculate the losses for the first r rounds\n    for i in range(r):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_nike += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move combinations repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Cycle**: For each round within the LCM period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome (losses) is recorded.\n4. **Extrapolation**: The number of full cycles and remaining rounds are calculated. The losses from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are simulated separately.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the problem to a manageable size.",
