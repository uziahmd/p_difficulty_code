Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the X-Shape Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Python script to detect an 'X' shape in a character grid. The rules are pretty straightforward, but I need to be meticulous.  My thoughts are:\n\nFirst, I need to read the input - the grid size `n` and then the grid itself, probably best stored as a list of strings or a list of lists. I should make sure I handle the input correctly.\n\nNext, I need to figure out which cells are on the diagonals. That's a simple calculation: `r == c` for the main diagonal, and `r + c == n - 1` for the anti-diagonal.  Any cell satisfying *either* of those conditions is part of a diagonal.\n\nNow comes the core logic.  Rule 1 says all diagonal letters must be the same.  I'll grab the first diagonal character (e.g., `grid[0][0]`) and compare it to *every* other diagonal element. If even one doesn't match, it's not an 'X'.\n\nRule 2 and 3 are intertwined: all off-diagonal cells must have the same single character, and that character must be different from the diagonal character.  I can grab any off-diagonal character (e.g., `grid[0][1]`). Then I'll check every *other* off-diagonal cell against this character. If any differ, it's not an 'X'. Finally, I need to ensure the diagonal character and the off-diagonal character are distinct; otherwise, it's not an 'X' either.\n\nI've got to be careful about edge cases, even if this is a somewhat restricted problem. I'm noting `n` is odd. I’m thinking the center element will always be on both diagonals. This is fine, since I’m already checking diagonals, and it keeps things simple. It’s also guaranteed there will be off-diagonal elements since `n` is always at least 3. I need to ensure a proper initialization for `diag_char` using `grid[0][0]` and a proper initialization for `off_diag_char` using `grid[0][1]`. This makes sense, given the problem constraints, and avoids any weird indexing issues.\n\nEssentially, I'm going to iterate through the grid, check each cell against the diagonal and off-diagonal rules, and return 'yes' if everything conforms to an 'X' shape, and 'no' otherwise. I’ve broken this down into logical steps, and the algorithm itself seems pretty efficient. Now, let’s get this script written!\n",
