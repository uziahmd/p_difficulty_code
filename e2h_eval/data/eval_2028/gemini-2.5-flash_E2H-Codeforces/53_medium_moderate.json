    "thought": "**Longest Repeating Substring Algorithm**\n\nOkay, here's my plan. I need to write a Python script to figure out the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The input string will only have lowercase Latin letters, and it won't be longer than 100 characters. Overlapping occurrences of the substring are allowed.\n\nI'm thinking, since the string length is small (at most 100), I can just go through *all* possible substrings. That's a reasonable number to handle computationally. For a string of length N, there are N*(N+1)/2 substrings. So, for a 100-character string, that’s 5050 substrings, which is definitely doable.\n\nHere's how I'll approach it:\n\n1.  **Generate all substrings:** I'll use nested loops to create every possible substring from the input string.\n2.  **Count occurrences of each substring:** For each substring I generate, I'll need to see how many times it appears in the original string. I can use Python's built-in `find()` method for this. But, since I need to handle overlaps (like in \"ababa\"), I'll need to adjust the starting search position for each subsequent `find()` call. After finding one occurrence, the next search will start from the position one character *after* the beginning of the previously found match.\n3.  **Track the maximum length:** I'll keep a variable called `max_len`, initialized to zero. Whenever I find a substring that occurs at least twice, I'll update `max_len` to the length of that substring if it's longer than the current `max_len`.\n\nSince I want to find the *longest* substring, a good strategy is to check lengths in decreasing order.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `max_len = 0`.\n2.  Get the input string `S`. Let `N` be the length of `S`.\n3.  **Outer Loop (Decreasing Length):** Iterate through lengths from `N` down to 1 (inclusive).\n    *   **Inner Loop (Starting Positions):** For each length, iterate through all possible starting positions (`i`) from 0 up to `N - length`.\n        *   Extract the substring `sub = S[i : i + length]`.\n        *   Count the number of times `sub` appears in `S`.\n        *   I'll initialize `count = 0` and `start_index = 0`.\n        *   In a `while True` loop:\n            *   Find `sub` in `S` starting from `start_index` using `found_index = S.find(sub, start_index)`.\n            *   If not found (`found_index == -1`), break the loop.\n            *   Increment `count`.\n            *   Update `start_index = found_index + 1` to correctly handle overlapping matches.\n        *   If `count >= 2`, I found a substring that appears at least twice. I can then print its length which is `length`. And importantly, *return* or exit the function because `length` is the *longest* possible repeating substring.\n4.  If the outer loops finish without finding a repeating substring, print `0`.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say the input string is \"ababa\". My code will work through the substrings systematically. It will try substrings of length 5, then 4, and so on. If no substring is found, then `max_len` remains 0.  If I consider length 3, and a starting position of `i=0`, then `sub` is `\"aba\"`. `count` will be 2 (the overlapping \"aba\" at indices 0 and 2). That's a win! I can immediately return 3.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n*   **Empty String:** Although the problem statement doesn't mention empty strings, it's good practice to add a check for an empty string. If it's empty, `max_len` should be 0.\n*   **String with all identical characters:** I should test with a string like \"zzz\". The answer here is 2. My algorithm will check all substrings.\n\n**Complexity:**\n\nThe outer loop will run N times (for lengths). The inner loop will also run N times (on average). Counting occurrences of a substring involves iterating through the string, and, using Python's `find()`, this could be roughly O(N) where N is the length of the string `S`. Given the small size of N, an O(N^4) algorithm should be acceptable.\n\n**Implementation Details",
