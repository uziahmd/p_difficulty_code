Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The goal is clear: maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots and output those pairs.  I see this as a bipartite matching problem.  Standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp might be too slow given the potential size of the graph.  I need a more clever strategy, likely a greedy one.\n\nMy first thought is to analyze the compatibility rules.  ` (c, c), (?, c), (c, ?), (?, ?)` all work, but `(c1, c2)` doesn't if `c1 != c2` and neither are the wildcard character.  That's my starting point for a strategy.\n\nMy initial approach is to categorize the boots by color.  I'll use lists or dictionaries to store the indices of left and right boots for each specific color 'a' to 'z', and separate lists for the wildcard boots. This lets me efficiently access boots based on their color.\n\nNow, the core idea is to prioritize the most specific matches first.  Matching boots with identical colors seems like the most restrictive condition to satisfy. Therefore, I'm going to iterate through each specific color and match as many left boots of that color with right boots of the *same* color as possible.  I'll take the minimum number of boots available for that color (left or right) to ensure a valid pairing.  These pairs are then added to my output.\n\nAfter matching all of the specific colors, I'll update my data structures by removing the paired boots.  The remaining unmatched boots will either be wildcard boots or boots of different colors that can no longer find a match.  At this stage, I have maximized the \"strict\" pairs.\n\nThis approach should give a good, hopefully optimal, solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to output these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1.  `(c, c)` is compatible (same specific color).\n2.  `(?, c)` is compatible (question mark matches any specific color).\n3.  `(c, ?)` is compatible (any specific color matches a question mark).\n4.  `(?, ?)` is compatible.\n5.  `(c1, c2)` is not compatible if `c1 != c2` and neither is `?`.\n\nThe key idea is to process matches in an order that prioritizes more restrictive conditions first. This ensures that boots with specific colors are matched optimally before they are potentially used to satisfy a more flexible '?' match, which could be satisfied by other '?' boots.\n\nHere's a greedy strategy that works:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color:**\n    First, we need to efficiently access boots of a particular color. We'll use lists (or deques for efficient popping) to store the original 1-based indices of boots for each color.\n    -   `left_boots[char_code]` and `right_boots[char_code]` for specific colors 'a' through 'z'.\n    -   `left_q_boots` for left boots with color '?'.\n    -   `right_q_boots` for right boots with color '?'.\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors (c, c):**\n    Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. For each `c`, pair up as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible. This is the most restrictive match.\n    -   Take `min(len(left_boots[c]), len(right_boots[c]))` pairs.\n    -   Add these pairs to our `result` list.\n    -   Remove the used boots from their respective lists.\n\n3.  **Match Specific with Question Mark (c, ?) and (?, c):**\n    After step 2, `left_boots[c]` contains left boots of color `c` that didn't find a matching right boot of color `c`. Similarly for `right_boots[c]`.\n    Now, these remaining specific-colored boots can be matched with question mark boots. It doesn't matter if we match `(c, ?)` or `(?, c)` first, as they are independent sets of boots.\n\n    a.  **Match remaining `left_boots[c]` with `right_q_boots`:**\n        Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. For each `c`, take remaining `left_boots[c]` and pair them with available `right_q_boots`.\n        -   Take `min(len(left_boots[c]), len(right_q_boots))` pairs.\n        -   Add these pairs to `result`.\n        -   Remove used boots.\n\n    b.  **Match remaining `right_boots[c]` with `left_q_boots`:**\n        Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. For each `c`, take remaining `right_boots[c]` and pair them with available `left_q_boots`.\n        -   Take `min(len(right_boots[c]), len(left_q_boots))` pairs.\n        -   Add these pairs to `result`.\n        -   Remove used boots.\n\n4.  **Match Question Marks (?, ?):**\n    Finally, any remaining `left_q_boots` and `right_q_boots` can be paired together.\n    -   Take `min(len(left_q_boots), len(right_q_boots))` pairs.\n    -   Add these pairs to `result`.\n    -   Remove used boots (though not strictly necessary as this is the last step).\n\nThis greedy strategy works because:\n-   Exact matches `(c, c)` are the most restrictive; using a `c` boot for an `(c, c)` match is always optimal because that `c` boot cannot be used for an `(any_other_color, c)` match. If it were used for `(c, ?)` or `(?, c)`, it would prevent a potential `(c, c)` match without necessarily enabling more matches overall.\n-   After exhausting `(c, c)` matches, `c` boots can only match `?` boots. It doesn't matter which `c` matches which `?` as long as we maximize pairs.\n-   Finally, `?` boots that haven't been used can only match other `?` boots.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n-   We can use `collections.defaultdict(list)` or lists of lists for `left_boots` and `right_boots` indexed by character code (e.g., `ord(c) - ord('a')`).\n-   `left_q_boots` and `right_q_boots` can be simple lists.\n-   When pairing, we can use `pop()` from the end of lists to efficiently remove used boots.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 10`\n`l = \"code??????`\n`r = \"??????test\"`\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    `left_boots`: `{'c': [1], 'o': [2], 'd': [3], 'e': [4]}`\n    `right_boots`: `{'t': [7], 'e': [8], 's': [9], 't': [10]}`\n    `left_q_boots`: `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n    `right_q_boots`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n    `result = []`\n\n2.  **Specific Matches (c, c):**\n    -   'c': `left_boots['c']=[1]`, `right_boots['c']=[]`.
