During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the LCM Minimization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this problem: find the smallest non-negative integer 'k' that minimizes the least common multiple of (a+k) and (b+k). Let's call a+k 'x' and b+k 'y'.  My goal is to minimize lcm(x, y).  I know the relationship: lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y). This tells me I'm playing a game of minimizing the numerator and maximizing the denominator, but since I have a fixed starting point, minimizing the numerator is more impactful.\n\nLet's introduce 'g' as gcd(x, y) which is gcd(a+k, b+k). Now, a useful property is that gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X), so g = gcd(a+k, b+k-(a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a).  Let's call b-a 'd'. I can assume a <= b without loss of generality, and 'd' will be non-negative.\n\nIf 'a' equals 'b', then 'd' is 0. gcd(a+k, 0) is a+k, and lcm(a+k, a+k) is a+k. To minimize that, I pick k=0, and the answer is simply 'a'. That's my base case handled.\n\nNow, if 'a' is less than 'b', 'd' is positive. g = gcd(a+k, d). This means 'g' must be a divisor of 'd'. I can write a+k as m*g and d as n*g for some integers m and n. I want to relate lcm to gcd. b+k then becomes (a+k)+d which is (m+n)*g. gcd(a+k, b+k) is the gcd of m*g and (m+n)*g which is g*gcd(m,m+n) which is g*gcd(m,n). I really only care about minimizing lcm and thus maximizing g. To ensure the greatest common divisor is solely g and not something larger, I want gcd(m, n) = 1. So a+k is m*g where gcd(m, d/g)=1.\n\nI know lcm(a+k, b+k) is (a+k)(b+k)/gcd(a+k, b+k).  Using X and Y for a+k and b+k I can define it as g*X*Y and I need to use the fact that b-a=g(Y-X). Given that 'g' is a divisor of 'd', I'll iterate through each divisor 'g' of 'D' (b-a) to determine which is the best.\n",
