You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Replacing Digits Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of this problem is maximizing a number `a` by strategically swapping its digits with digits from a sequence `s`, using each `s` digit at most once. The key insight?  The leftmost digits matter most for the overall magnitude. A single change in the most significant digit has a much bigger effect than a change further down. That screams \"greedy\" approach.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking of tackling it:\n\n1.  **Parse the input:** Read the strings `a` and `s`. Nothing fancy here, just need the raw data.\n\n2.  **Prep `s`:** Sort `s` in descending order. This makes picking the largest available digit super easy – it's always at the beginning.\n\n3.  **The Heart of the Matter:**\n    *   Convert `a` to a modifiable list of characters.\n    *   Start at the leftmost digit of `a`.\n    *   Compare the current digit in `a` with the largest unused digit from the sorted `s`.\n    *   If the `s` digit is *greater*, swap it in. Advance the `s` pointer to the next largest available digit in `s`.\n    *   If not, leave the current `a` digit as is. We *don't* advance the `s` pointer in this case, meaning we keep that current `s` digit available for a *later* digit in `a` that might be smaller.\n\n4.  **Wrap It Up:** Convert the modified character list `a` back into a string and print the result.\n\nThe crucial bit is the \"greedy\" replacement rule: always prioritize the leftmost digits and use the largest available `s` digit. If the largest `s` digit *can't* improve a digit, then we don't use it. We're thinking: if `s[i] <= a[i]`, we skip using `s[i]` for improving `a[i]`. We just move onto the *next* digit of `a`, because we know we can't improve this particular `a[i]` and there is a possibility that a *smaller* digit further on *can* be improved by `s[i]`.\n\nThis ensures we get the absolutely *largest* possible number, and that we don't \"waste\" a big `s` digit on an already large digit in `a` and miss an opportunity further down the line. I'm confident in this approach.  The edge cases don't seem to break the logic either, so I'm ready to write the code.\n",
