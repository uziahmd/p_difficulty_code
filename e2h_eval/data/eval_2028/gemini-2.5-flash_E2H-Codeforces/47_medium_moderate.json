    "thought": "**Reflecting on the Minimum LCM Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where the goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer, `k`, that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. My thought process is to systematically figure out how to efficiently determine this `k`.\n\nFirst, I define `x` as `a+k` and `y` as `b+k`, which makes `lcm(x, y)` the target function.  I know that `lcm(x, y)` is `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. I then cleverly introduce `d = gcd(a+k, b+k)`, leveraging the Euclidean algorithm's property: `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`. This simplifies things to `gcd(a+k, b-a)`.  I call `b-a` as `D`. Assuming `a <= b` without loss of generality, `D` is non-negative.\n\nA critical edge case pops up: if `a` equals `b`, `D` is zero. In this special scenario, the LCM is minimized at `k=0`. So I'll handle that upfront.\n\nFor the general case, where `a < b`, `D` is positive. Here, `gcd(a+k, D)` becomes the core. Since `gcd(a+k, D)` needs to be a divisor of `D`, it's clear that `a+k` must be a multiple of that divisor. This means I should iterate through the divisors of `D` (which I can precompute), and for each divisor, find the smallest `k` that makes `a+k` its multiple.\n\nNow, the trick is to minimize `lcm(a+k, b+k) = (a+k) * ((b+k) / gcd(a+k, b-a))`. If `g` is the `gcd(a+k, D)`, `g` has to be `gcd(a+k, b+k)`. To minimize the LCM, I can iterate over all divisors `g` of `b-a`, and for each divisor find the minimal `k` that gives me this gcd `g`. I need to ensure that the constructed `a+k` and `g` have the appropriate relationships, specifically that `g` divides both `a+k` and `b+k`.\n\nI can find the right `k` by checking `(a+k) = m*g` with `gcd(m,D/g) = 1`.  So, for each divisor `g` of `b-a`,  I determine the smallest `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`. The value is either zero if a is a multiple of `g`, otherwise `g - (a % g)`.\n\nThen, I can test if this `k` leads to the intended `g`. If it does, and if it produces the smallest LCM found so far, I update the minimum LCM and the corresponding `k`. This process gives me the most efficient strategy.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If there are multiple optimal `k` values, we should choose the smallest one.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(X, Y) = (X * Y) / gcd(X, Y)`.\nSo, we want to minimize `(a+k)(b+k) / gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\n\nA key property of the greatest common divisor is `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`.\nApplying this, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nLet `D = b-a`. Without loss of generality, we can assume `a <= b` by swapping `a` and `b` if `a > b`, as `lcm` is symmetric. This makes `D >= 0`.\n\nSpecial case: If `a = b`, then `D = 0`.\nIn this case, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.\nThe `lcm(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)(a+k) / (a+k) = a+k`.\nTo minimize `a+k` for `k >= 0`, we must choose `k=0`. So, if `a=b`, the answer is `0`.\n\nGeneral case: Assume `a < b`, so `D = b-a > 0`.\nLet `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. From the property above, `g = gcd(a+k, D)`.\nThis implies that `g` must be a divisor of `D`.\nAlso, `a+k` must be a multiple of `g`.\n\nThe strategy is to iterate through all possible values for `g`. Since `g` must be a divisor of `D`, we can find all divisors of `D` and use each as a candidate for `g`.\n\nFor each divisor `g` of `D`:\n1. We need `a+k` to be a multiple of `g`. To minimize `k` (and thus `a+k` and `b+k`), we want `a+k` to be the smallest multiple of `g` that is greater than or equal to `a`.\n   Let `rem = a % g`.\n   If `rem == 0`, then `a` is already a multiple of `g`. The smallest `k` is `0`.\n   If `rem != 0`, then `a` is not a multiple of `g`. The smallest `k` to make `a+k` a multiple of `g` is `g - rem`.\n   Let this smallest `k` be `k_candidate`.\n\n2. With this `k_candidate`, we calculate `x = a + k_candidate` and `y = b + k_candidate`.\n   Now, we must verify if `gcd(x, y)` is indeed `g`. It's possible that `gcd(x, y)` is a multiple of `g` but not `g` itself (e.g., if `gcd(x/g, D/g) > 1`). If `gcd(x, y) != g`, then this `k_candidate` is not valid for *this specific `g`* (though it might be valid for a larger `g' = gcd(x,y)`). However, our goal is to find the overall minimum `lcm`, so we just need to calculate `lcm(x,y)` for this `k_candidate` and compare it with the current minimum. The check `gcd(x,y) == g` is implicitly handled by `gcd(x,y)` being calculated correctly.\n\n3. Calculate `current_lcm = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)`.\n   We maintain `min_lcm_val` (initialized to infinity) and `ans_k` (initialized to `0` or the `k` for initial `lcm(a,b)`).\n   If `current_lcm < min_lcm_val`:\n     Update `min_lcm_val = current_lcm` and `ans_k = k_candidate`.\n   If `current_lcm == min_lcm_val`:\n     Update `ans_k = min(ans_k, k_candidate)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k`.\n\nThe maximum value for `a, b` is `10^9`.\n`D = b-a` can be up to `10^9 - 1`.\nFinding divisors of `D` takes `O(sqrt(D))` time, which is about `sqrt(10^9) approx 31622` operations. This is efficient.\nThe number of divisors for `N <= 10^9` is at most `1344`.\nFor each divisor, we perform arithmetic operations and a `gcd` calculation (`log(max(x,y))`).\n`x, y` can be up to `a + D = a + (b-a) = b`, or slightly larger if `k_candidate` is non-zero. The maximum `k_candidate` is `D-1`. So `x, y` can be up to `10^9 + 10^9 = 2 * 10^9`.\n`x*y` can be up to `(2*10^9)^2 = 4*10^18`, which fits in a 64-bit integer. Python handles arbitrary precision integers, so overflow is not an issue.\n\nThe initial candidate for `k` can be `0`. The `lcm(a,b)` is a valid starting point for `min_lcm_val`.\n\nExample Walkthrough (`a=6, b=10`):\n1. `a=6, b=10`. `a != b`.\n2. `D = 10 - 6 = 4`.\n3. Initialize `min_lcm_val = float('inf')`, `ans_k = 0`. (A better initial value for `ans_k` is `0` and `min_lcm_val = (a*b)//gcd(a,b)` i.e., `lcm(6,10)=30`).\n   So, `min_lcm_val = 30`, `ans_k = 0`.\n4. Divisors of `D=4`: `[1, 2, 4]`.\n\n   - For `g = 1`:\n     `rem = 6 % 1 = 0`. `k_candidate = 0`.\n     `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n     `current_gcd = gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n     `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n     `current_lcm (30) == min_lcm_val (30)`. `ans_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n   - For `g = 2`:\n     `rem = 6 % 2 = 0`. `k_candidate = 0`.\n     `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n     `current_gcd = gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n     `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n     `current_lcm (30) == min_lcm_val (30)`. `ans_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n   - For `g = 4`:\n     `rem = 6 % 4 = 2`. `k_candidate = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n     `x = 6+2 = 8`, `y = 10+2 = 12`.\n     `current_gcd = gcd(8, 12) = 4`.\n     `current_lcm = (8 * 12) // 4 = 24`.\n     `current_lcm (24) < min_lcm_val (30)`. Update `min_lcm_val = 24`, `ans_k = 2`.\n\n5. All divisors checked. Print `ans_k = 2`.
