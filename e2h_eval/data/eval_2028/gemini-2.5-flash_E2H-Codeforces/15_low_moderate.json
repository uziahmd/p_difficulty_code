They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Playoff\" Problem and Winning Integers**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Playoff\" problem, which seems interesting. The core of it is figuring out which skill levels, represented by integers, can actually win this tournament. I need to write a Python script for it.\n\nHere's the setup: we have $2^n$ teams, $n$ rounds, and the string $s$ dictates how games are decided â€“ whether the lower or higher-skilled team wins in each phase. My main objective is to pinpoint these \"winning integers\" $x$. A winning $x$ means there exists some skill assignment where the team with that skill triumphs.\n\nMy initial thought is to dive into the tournament structure. It's a bracket-style elimination, with $2^{n-i}$ games in phase $i$.  The string `s` is critical. If `s[i] == '0'`, the lower skill wins in phase i; if `s[i] == '1'`, the higher skill prevails.\n\nTo win, a team needs to win $n$ games. If I think about a team with skill $x$, it's clear: for $x$ to be a winning integer, it must win all $n$ games.\n\nNow, how does this string `s` affect the possible skill levels? Let's say a team with skill $x$ competes against an opponent with skill $y$ in phase $i$.\n*   If `s[i-1] == '0'`, the team with skill $x$ needs $x < y$ to win.\n*   If `s[i-1] == '1'`, it needs $x > y$.\n\nSo, winning integers are related to the arrangement of skills. If a team with skill x can win, a permutation of skills ($1, \\dots, 2^n$) must exist. This is the crucial aspect of the problem.\n\nMy focus now shifts to the range of possible skill levels that could be winning integers. Let's suppose a team with skill x wins the entire tournament.\nI can define $k_0$ as the number of phases where `s[i] == '0'` (lower skill wins), and $k_1$ is the number of phases where `s[i] == '1'` (higher skill wins). Thus $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n*   When `s[i] == '0'`, x needs $k_0$ opponents with skill greater than x.\n*   When `s[i] == '1'`, x needs $k_1$ opponents with skill less than x.\n\nSince each opponent is a distinct team, I need to find the range of possible skill values that satisfy these conditions to determine all winning integers. The task appears to boil down to determining the boundaries of $x$ such that it has $k_0$ possible higher skill opponents and $k_1$ lower skill opponents. This will inform my approach to coding the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) that can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ of length $n$ describing the rules for each phase. The string $s_i$ (0-indexed) dictates the rule for phase $i+1$: if $s_i = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins; if $s_i = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $x$ to win the tournament.\nA team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\nFor each game, its opponent has a specific skill level.\n\nLet $k_0$ be the number of phases where the lower skill team wins (i.e., the count of '0's in $s$).\nLet $k_1$ be the number of phases where the higher skill team wins (i.e., the count of '1's in $s$).\nWe know $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n\nFor a team with skill $x$ to win:\n1. In each of the $k_0$ phases where the lower skill team wins, $x$ must be strictly less than its opponent's skill. This means $x$ needs $k_0$ distinct opponents whose skill levels are all greater than $x$.\n2. In each of the $k_1$ phases where the higher skill team wins, $x$ must be strictly greater than its opponent's skill. This means $x$ needs $k_1$ distinct opponents whose skill levels are all less than $x$.\n\nThe $n$ opponents a winning team faces are all distinct teams. Therefore, their skill levels must also be distinct.\nTo satisfy condition 1, $x$ must be smaller than $k_0$ other skill levels. The smallest $k_0$ skill levels greater than $x$ are $x+1, x+2, \\dots, x+k_0$. For these to exist, $x+k_0$ must be less than or equal to $2^n$. This implies $x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\nTo satisfy condition 2, $x$ must be larger than $k_1$ other skill levels. The largest $k_1$ skill levels smaller than $x$ are $x-1, x-2, \\dots, x-k_1$. For these to exist, $x-k_1$ must be greater than or equal to $1$. This implies $x \\ge 1 + k_1$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, a team with skill $x$ can potentially win if and only if:\n$1 + k_1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nLet's verify if this range is always achievable.\nSuppose we want a team with skill $x$ (where $1 + k_1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$) to win. We need to construct a permutation $p$ such that $x$ wins.\nThe $n$ opponents of the winning team must be assigned specific skill levels:\n- For the $k_0$ games where $x$ must be lower: assign skill levels $x+1, x+2, \\dots, x+k_0$ to these $k_0$ opponents.\n- For the $k_1$ games where $x$ must be higher: assign skill levels $x-1, x-2, \\dots, x-k_1$ to these $k_1$ opponents.\n\nAll these $k_0+k_1 = n$ skill levels are distinct from $x$ and from each other.\nThe set of skill levels used for the winning team and its opponents is $\\{x\\} \\cup \\{x-1, \\dots, x-k_1\\} \\cup \\{x+1, \\dots, x+k_0\\}$.\nThis set contains $1+k_1+k_0 = 1+n$ distinct skill levels.\nAll these skill levels are within the range $[1, 2^n]$ due to our bounds on $x$.\nSpecifically:\n$x-k_1 \\ge 1+k_1-k_1 = 1$.\n$x+k_0 \\le (2^n-k_0)+k_0 = 2^n$.\n\nThe remaining $2^n - (1+n)$ skill levels can be assigned to the other $2^n - (1+n)$ teams arbitrarily, as long as they form a valid permutation. For example, we can assign them in increasing order to the remaining teams. This construction ensures that the $n$ opponents of $x$ have the required skill levels relative to $x$. The crucial part is that these opponents are \"eliminated\" in their respective games against $x$, and their specific path through the tournament doesn't matter beyond ensuring they meet $x$ at the right time. Since $x$ wins all its matches, it progresses to the final and becomes the champion.\n\nTherefore, the winning integers are precisely those $x$ such that $1 + k_1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nLet's calculate $k_0$ and $k_1$ from the input string $s$.\n$k_0 = s.count('0')$\n$k_1 = s.count('1')$\n\nThe minimum winning skill is $1 + k_1$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - k_0$.\n\nThe problem asks for all winning integers in ascending order.\nSo we need to print integers from $1+k_1$ to $2^n-k_0$, inclusive.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$k_0 = s.count('0') = 1$\n$k_1 = s.count('1') = 2$\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$\nMinimum winning skill: $1 + k_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - k_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. What went wrong?\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully: \"in the first one of them, the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\". This means that the tournament bracket is fixed. Team $p_1$ plays $p_2$, $p_3$ plays $p_4$, etc. The *positions* in the bracket are fixed, but the *skill levels* $p_i$ are assigned to these positions.\nThe problem states \"$p$ is a permutation of integers $1, \\dots, 2^n$\". This means we can assign any skill $x$ to any initial team position (e.g., team 1, team 2, ..., team $2^n$).\nMy interpretation was that we choose the permutation $p$. The problem says \"find a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $x$ wins\". This means we can decide which team (say, team $j$) has skill $x$, and then assign the other skills $1, \\dots, x-1, x+1, \\dots, 2^n$ to the remaining $2^n-1$ teams.\n\nMy previous logic holds: to make skill $x$ win, we need to find $n$ opponents for $x$ in the bracket, and assign skill levels to them appropriately. The specific teams (e.g., team 1, team 2, etc.) are just placeholders for positions in the bracket. We can put skill $x$ into any initial position, say position 1. Then we need to assign skills to its opponents. The opponents are determined by the bracket structure.\n\nLet's reconsider the range for $x$.\n$k_0$ is the number of '0's in $s$.\n$k_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$.\n$2^n$ is the total number of teams.\n\nThe smallest possible skill level is $1$. The largest is $2^n$.\nIf $x$ wins a game where $s_i = '0'$, $x$ must be lower than its opponent. This means $x$ \"uses up\" a lower rank.\nIf $x$ wins a game where $s_i = '1'$, $x$ must be higher than its opponent. This means $x$ \"uses up\" a higher rank.\n\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skill levels.\nFor $x$ to win, it needs $k_1$ skill levels *smaller* than $x$ to be its opponents.\nIt needs $k_0$ skill levels *larger* than $x$ to be its opponents.\nThese $k_1$ smaller skills and $k_0$ larger skills must be distinct from $x$ and from each other.\nSo, we need $k_1$ values from $\\{1, \\dots, x-1\\}$ and $k_0$ values from $\\{x+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\n\nThe smallest possible value for $x$ that can win:\nTo minimize $x$, we want to minimize the number of smaller skill levels needed ($k_1$) and maximize the number of larger skill levels needed ($k_0$).\nThe $k_1$ smallest skill levels are $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$. If $x$ is to win $k_1$ games where it must be greater, it needs $k_1$ distinct opponents with skills less than $x$. The minimum $x$ can be is $k_1+1$. If $x = k_1+1$, its opponents can be $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe largest possible value for $x$ that can win:\nTo maximize $x$, we want to maximize the number of smaller skill levels needed ($k_1$) and minimize the number of larger skill levels needed ($k_0$).\nThe $k_0$ largest skill levels are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$. If $x$ is to win $k_0$ games where it must be smaller, it needs $k_0$ distinct opponents with skills greater than $x$. The maximum $x$ can be is $2^n-k_0$. If $x = 2^n-k_0$, its opponents can be $2^n, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$.\n\nThe range of values $x$ can take is $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nThis is exactly the same range as $1+k_1 \\le x \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nLet's recheck Example 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$k_0 = 1$ (one '0')\n$k_1 = 2$ (two '1's)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$\nMinimum winning skill: $k_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - k_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nExample output: `4 5 6 7`. Still a mismatch. The range is off by one at the lower end.\n\nWhat could be the reason for this discrepancy?\nThe problem statement: \"a permutation is an array where each element from $1$ to $2^n$ occurs exactly once\".\nCould it be that the $k_1$ smaller skills and $k_0$ larger skills must be *consecutive* to $x$? No, \"it is possible to find a permutation $p$\". It doesn't say the opponents must be $x-1, x-2, \\dots$ or $x+1, x+2, \\dots$. They just need to be $k_1$ values less than $x$ and $k_0$ values greater than $x$.\n\nLet's consider the total number of skills available.\nThere are $x-1$ skills smaller than $x$.\nThere are $2^n-x$ skills larger than $x$.\nFor $x$ to win, it needs to have $k_1$ opponents with skill $< x$. So it must be that $x-1 \\ge k_1$. This means $x \\ge k_1+1$.\nFor $x$ to win, it needs to have $k_0$ opponents with skill $> x$. So it must be that $2^n-x \\ge k_0$. This means $x \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis logic seems sound and leads to the range $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nWhy is the example output `4 5 6 7` for $n=3, s=\"101\"$?\n$k_0=1, k_1=2$. My range is $[3, 7]$. The example's range is $[4, 7]$.\nThe difference is the lower bound. My $k_1+1$ vs example's $k_1+2$.\n\nLet's try to construct a winning scenario for $x=3$ in Example 1.\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nPhase 1: $s_0 = '1'$ (higher skill wins). $2^{3-1}=4$ games.\nPhase 2: $s_1 = '0'$ (lower skill wins). $2^{3-2}=2$ games.\nPhase 3: $s_2 = '1'$ (higher skill wins). $2^{3-3}=1$ game.\n\nSuppose skill $x=3$ wins.\nGame 1 (Phase 1, $s_0='1'$): $3$ vs $O_1$. $3 > O_1$. So $O_1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$. Let $O_1=1$.\nGame 2 (Phase 2, $s_1='0'$): $3$ vs $O_2$. $3 < O_2$. So $O_2 \\in \\{4,5,6,7,8\\}$. Let $O_2=4$.\nGame 3 (Phase 3, $s_2='1'$): $3$ vs $O_3$. $3 > O_3$. So $O_3 \\in \\{2\\}$. (Because $O_1=1$ is used). Let $O_3=2$.\n\nThe skills used are $\\{3, 1, 4, 2\\}$. These are $1,2,3,4$.\nThe opponents are $O_1=1, O_2=4, O_3=2$.\n$k_1$ opponents: $1, 2$. These are 2 opponents with skill $<3$. (Matches $k_1=2$)\n$k_0$ opponents: $4$. This is 1 opponent with skill $>3$. (Matches $k_0=1$)\n\nThis construction is valid for $x=3$. So $3$ should be a winning integer.\nWhy does the example output not include 3?\n\nCould it be that the *number of teams* with skill less than $x$ (or greater than $x$) matters beyond just the opponents?\nIf $x$ wins, there are $n$ opponents. These $n$ opponents are eliminated.\nThe winning team and its $n$ opponents form a group of $n+1$ teams.\nThe skills used by these $n+1$ teams must allow $x$ to win its $n$ games.\nThe other $2^n - (n+1)$ teams and their skills can be filled in any way.\n\nLet's re-examine the example output.\nExample 1: Input `3\\n101`, Output `4 5 6 7`.\nMy calculation: $k_0=1, k_1=2$. $2^n=8$. Range $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0] = [3, 7]$.\nExample 2: Input `1\\n1`, Output `2`.\n$n=1, s=\"1\"$. $k_0=0, k_1=1$. $2^n=2$. Range $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0] = [1+1, 2-0] = [2, 2]$. Output `2`. This matches!\nExample 3: Input `2\\n01`, Output `2 3`.\n$n=2, s=\"01\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=1$. $2^n=4$. Range $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0] = [1+1, 4-1] = [2, 3]$. Output `2 3`. This matches!\n\nIt seems my formula works for $n=1,2$ but not for $n=3$. This suggests there might be a subtle detail related to $n$ or the structure of $s$.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully.\n\"The skill level of the $i$-th team is $p_i$, where $p$ is a permutation of integers $1, 2, \\dots, 2^n$.\"\nThis means the initial teams (team 1, team 2, ..., team $2^n$) are given skill levels $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{2^n}$.\nThe bracket is fixed: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), ..., (winner(1v2) vs winner(3v4)), etc.\nThis implies that the *position* of a team in the bracket is fixed, and we are assigning skills to these fixed positions.\nSo, if team $j$ has skill $x$, its path through the tournament is fixed. For $x$ to win, we need to assign skills to its opponents in the bracket such that $x$ wins all its games.\n\nThis is exactly what I assumed. My logic for $k_0, k_1$ and the range $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0]$ seems to be the most straightforward interpretation.\n\nCould it be that $k_1$ is not simply the count of '1's, but something more complex?\nThe problem text: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThe phases are 1-indexed in the text, but $s$ is 0-indexed in typical programming.\n$s_i$ (0-indexed) corresponds to phase $i+1$.\n$s_0$ for phase 1 ($2^{n-1}$ games)\n$s_1$ for phase 2 ($2^{n-2}$ games)\n...\n$s_{n-1}$ for phase $n$ ($2^{n-n}=1$ game)\n\nThis is a standard playoff structure.\nLet's analyze $n=3, s=\"101\"$ again.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): higher skill wins.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): lower skill wins.\nPhase 3 ($s_2='1'$): higher skill wins.\n\nFor a team with skill $x$ to win, it must win 3 games.\nGame 1 (Phase 1): $x$ must be higher than opponent $O_1$.\nGame 2 (Phase 2): $x$ must be lower than opponent $O_2$.\nGame 3 (Phase 3): $x$ must be higher than opponent $O_3$.\n\nSo, $x$ needs two opponents with skill less than $x$, and one opponent with skill greater than $x$.\nThis means $k_1=2$ and $k_0=1$. This matches my calculation of counts of '1's and '0's.\nThe range is $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0] = [1+2, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output is `4 5 6 7`.\n\nWhat if the number of skills available for opponents is limited by the fact that other teams also need to win their games to reach $x$?\nNo, the problem asks \"if it is possible to find a permutation $p$\". We only care about $x$ winning. The fate of other teams is irrelevant, as long as they don't prevent $x$ from winning.\nThe $n$ opponents of $x$ are unique. Their skills are used up. The skill $x$ is used up.\nThe remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skills can be assigned to the remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ teams.\nThis should not affect the range.\n\nIs there any \"minimum skill\" requirement for a winner based on $n$?\nFor example, if $n=3$, $2^n=8$. The winner must beat 3 opponents.\nThe minimum skill an opponent can have is 1. The maximum is 8.\n\nCould it be related to the specific structure of the bracket?\nIn phase 1, $2^{n-1}$ games.\nIn phase 2, $2^{n-2}$ games.\n...\nIn phase $n$, $1$ game.\n\nLet's think about the *number of teams* that can reach a certain phase.\nA team that wins phase 1 has won 1 game.\nA team that wins phase 2 has won 2 games.\n...\nA team that wins phase $n$ has won $n$ games and is the champion.\n\nWhat if $k_1$ is not just the count of '1's but something more subtle related to $n$?\nFor example, the number of teams that can reach a certain point in the bracket.\nThis seems unlikely given the wording \"find a permutation $p$\". This means we can assign $x$ to any initial position, and then fill the rest of the permutation to make $x$ win.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that *must* have skill less than $x$ or greater than $x$.\nFor $x$ to win, $x$ must be greater than $k_1$ specific opponents.\nFor $x$ to win, $x$ must be less than $k_0$ specific opponents.\nTotal $n$ specific opponents.\nThese opponents are distinct.\nThe values $x-1, x-2, \\dots, x-k_1$ are needed as opponents.\nThe values $x+1, x+2, \\dots, x+k_0$ are needed as opponents.\nThis is the simplest way to satisfy the conditions.\nThis requires $x \\ge k_1+1$ and $x \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nLet's try to find a counterexample to my construction for $x=3, n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$p_1 \\dots p_8$.\nSuppose team 1 has skill 3.\nPhase 1: $s_0='1'$. Team 1 (skill 3) plays Team 2. Team 1 wins if $p_1 > p_2$. So $p_2 < 3$. Let $p_2=1$.\nWinner of (1v2) is team 1 (skill 3).\nWinner of (3v4) is some team $W_2$.\nWinner of (5v6) is some team $W_3$.\nWinner of (7v8) is some team $W_4$.\n\nPhase 2: $s_1='0'$. Winner(1v2) (skill 3) plays Winner(3v4) ($W_2$). Team 1 wins if $3 < W_2$. So $W_2 > 3$. Let $W_2=4$.\nWinner of (1v2, 3v4) is team 1 (skill 3).\nWinner of (5v6, 7v8) is some team $W_5$.\n\nPhase 3: $s_2='1'$. Winner(1v2,3v4) (skill 3) plays Winner(5v6,7v8) ($W_5$). Team 1 wins if $3 > W_5$. So $W_5 < 3$. Let $W_5=2$.\nChampion is team 1 (skill 3).\n\nSkills used by $3$ and its direct opponents:\n$p_1=3$.\n$p_2=1$ (opponent in phase 1).\n$W_2=4$ (opponent in phase 2). $W_2$ must be the champion of the (3v4) sub-bracket.\n$W_5=2$ (opponent in phase 3). $W_5$ must be the champion of the (5v6, 7v8) sub-bracket.\n\nSo we need to find a permutation $p$ such that:\n$p_1=3$.\n$p_2=1$.\nThe winner of (3v4) has skill 4.\nThe winner of (5v6, 7v8) has skill 2.\n\nConsider the winner of (3v4). Let's say team 3 wins this sub-bracket. So $p_3=4$.\nFor team 3 to win (3v4), it needs to win one game in phase 1.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): $p_3$ vs $p_4$. $p_3 > p_4$. So $4 > p_4$. Let $p_4=5$? No, $p_4 < 4$. Let $p_4$ be some unused skill $<4$. E.g. $p_4=X$. $X \\in \\{2\\}$. But $2$ is needed for $W_5$.\nThis is where it gets tricky. The skills are used by other participants too.\n\nLet's re-think the number of \"slots\" for skills.\n$k_1$ games where $x$ must be higher. $x$ needs $k_1$ skills from $\\{1, \\dots, x-1\\}$.\n$k_0$ games where $x$ must be lower. $x$ needs $k_0$ skills from $\\{x+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\n\nThe crucial insight here might be the *number of teams* that must have skills less than $x$ or greater than $x$, not just the $n$ opponents.\nFor skill $x$ to win, it must defeat $k_1$ opponents with skill $<x$ and $k_0$ opponents with skill $>x$.\nThe total number of teams involved in the tournament is $2^n$.\nThe minimum skill is $1$, the maximum is $2^n$.\n\nIf $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins), then in phase $i$, the winning team has a skill level lower than its opponent. This means that if $x$ wins, its relative rank compared to its opponent in this game moves downwards.\nIf $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), then in phase $i$, the winning team has a skill level higher than its opponent. This means that if $x$ wins, its relative rank compared to its opponent in this game moves upwards.\n\nConsider the minimum possible skill $x$ that can win.\nTo minimize $x$, we want $x$ to be as close to $1$ as possible.\nThis means $x$ should ideally win games where $s_j = '0'$ (lower skill wins), because then $x$ beats a higher skilled opponent.\nBut $x$ *must* win $k_1$ games where $s_j = '1'$. In these games, $x$ needs to be higher than its opponent.\nTo win these $k_1$ games, $x$ needs at least $k_1$ distinct skill levels lower than itself. These are $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$.\nSo, $x$ must be at least $k_1+1$. This is the lower bound $k_1+1$.\n\nConsider the maximum possible skill $x$ that can win.\nTo maximize $x$, we want $x$ to be as close to $2^n$ as possible.\nThis means $x$ should ideally win games where $s_j = '1'$ (higher skill wins), because then $x$ beats a lower skilled opponent.\nBut $x$ *must* win $k_0$ games where $s_j = '0'$. In these games, $x$ needs to be lower than its opponent.\nTo win these $k_0$ games, $x$ needs at least $k_0$ distinct skill levels higher than itself. These are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$.\nSo, $x$ must be at most $2^n-k_0$. This is the upper bound $2^n-k_0$.\n\nThe logic remains the same.\nThe example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is `4 5 6 7`.\nMy range is $[3, 7]$.\nThe number of '0's is $k_0=1$.\nThe number of '1's is $k_1=2$.\nThe length of $s$ is $n=3$.\n$2^n = 8$.\n\nThe example output's lower bound is $k_1+2$.\nThe example output's upper bound is $2^n - k_0$.\nThis means the upper bound is consistent, but the lower bound is not.\n\nLet's check the number of '1's in $s$. $k_1$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins.\n\nConsider the total number of teams that are eliminated over the course of the tournament.\nA total of $2^n-1$ teams are eliminated.\nThe winning team eliminates $n$ opponents.\n\nLet's think about the \"rank\" of the winner.\nIf $s$ contains only '1's, then $k_1=n, k_0=0$. The winner must be greater than $n$ opponents.\nRange: $[1+n, 2^n-0] = [n+1, 2^n]$.\nExample: $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $k_1=1, k_0=0$. Range $[1+1, 2^1-0] = [2, 2]$. Output `2`. Matches.\nExample: $n=3, s=\"111\"$. $k_1=3, k_0=0$. Range $[1+3, 2^3-0] = [4, 8]$.\nThe winner must be greater than 3 opponents. It needs 3 skills less than itself. $1,2,3$. So $x \\ge 4$.\nIt needs 0 skills greater than itself. So $x \\le 8$.\nSo range $[4, 8]$.\n\nIf $s$ contains only '0's, then $k_1=0, k_0=n$. The winner must be lower than $n$ opponents.\nRange: $[1+0, 2^n-n] = [1, 2^n-n]$.\nExample: $n=3, s=\"000\"$. $k_1=0, k_0=3$. Range $[1+0, 2^3-3] = [1, 8-3] = [1, 5]$.\nThe winner must be lower than 3 opponents. It needs 3 skills greater than itself. $8,7,6$. So $x \\le 5$.\nIt needs 0 skills less than itself. So $x \\ge 1$.\nSo range $[1, 5]$.\n\nThe problem is that the example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is `4 5 6 7`.\nMy calculation: $k_0=1, k_1=2$. Range $[3, 7]$.\nThe example output's lower bound is $k_1+2$.\nThe example output's upper bound is $2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis means the number of skills required to be *less* than $x$ is $k_1+1$, not $k_1$.\nWhy would $x$ need $k_1+1$ skills less than itself?\nIt needs $k_1$ opponents to be less than $x$.\nWhat is the additional skill?\n\nLet's consider the total number of teams that *must* have skill less than $x$.\nFor $x$ to win, it needs to be greater than $k_1$ opponents.\nThe total number of teams in the tournament is $2^n$.\nThe minimum skill is $1$. The maximum skill is $2^n$.\n\nThis is a common pattern in competitive programming, where the \"obvious\" interpretation might miss a detail.\nThe problem statement says \"permutation of integers $1, \\dots, 2^n$\".\nThis means that if we are trying to make skill $x$ win, then $x$ must be assigned to one of the $2^n$ initial positions.\nThe other $2^n-1$ skills $1, \\dots, x-1, x+1, \\dots, 2^n$ must be assigned to the other $2^n-1$ initial positions.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are eliminated by $x$. This is $n$.\nHow many teams are in the \"half\" of the bracket where $x$ starts?\nIn phase 1, $x$ plays against one team.\nIn phase 2, $x$ plays against the winner of two other teams.\nIn phase $i$, $x$ plays against the winner of $2^{i-1}$ other teams.\nThe total number of teams in the sub-bracket that $x$ eventually plays against is $2^i$.\nThe total number of teams in $x$'s \"half\" of the bracket for the final game is $2^{n-1}$. These are the teams that could potentially reach the final from $x$'s side.\n\nThis is a standard playoff.\nThe $2^n$ teams are arranged in a fixed bracket.\nTeams $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{2^n}$ are the initial positions.\nGame 1: $P_1$ vs $P_2$. Winner $W_{12}$.\nGame 2: $P_3$ vs $P_4$. Winner $W_{34}$.\n...\nGame $2^{n-1}$: $P_{2^n-1}$ vs $P_{2^n}$. Winner $W_{(2^n-1)2^n}$.\nPhase 2:\nGame 1: $W_{12}$ vs $W_{34}$. Winner $W_{1234}$.\n...\nThis process continues.\n\nWhen $x$ wins, it must be assigned to some $P_j$.\nThen we must assign skills to $P_1, \\dots, P_{2^n}$ such that $x$ wins.\nThe conditions $x \\ge k_1+1$ and $x \\le 2^n-k_0$ are necessary.\nAre they sufficient? Yes, they are.\nWe need to assign skills such that $x$ wins its $n$ games.\nWe also need to ensure that the opponents $x$ needs to defeat actually *reach* $x$.\nThis is always possible. For any opponent $O_j$ that $x$ needs to defeat, $O_j$ must win some games to reach $x$. We can assign skills to $O_j$'s opponents such that $O_j$ wins.\nFor example, if $x$ needs to defeat $O_j$ in phase $k$, and $s_{k-1}='1'$ (higher skill wins), then $x > O_j$.\n$O_j$ must have won $k-1$ games to reach $x$.\nWe can assign skills to $O_j$'s opponents such that $O_j$ wins its $k-1$ games. The skills used by $O_j$ and its opponents are distinct from $x$ and $x$'s other opponents.\nThis is a standard argument for these types of problems.\n\nThe only way my logic is wrong is if $k_1$ and $k_0$ are not simply counts of '1's and '0's from $s$.\nWhat if $k_1$ is related to $n-k_0$? No, that's $k_1$.\nWhat if $k_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$ *plus one*?\nIf $k_1'$ is the number of '1's in $s$, then maybe the lower bound is $k_1'+2$.\nThis would explain the example: for $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $k_1'=2$. Lower bound $2+2=4$. This matches the example output.\nSo the range would be $[k_1+2, 2^n-k_0]$ if $k_1$ is the count of '1's in $s$.\nLet's check this modified rule with other examples.\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $k_0=0, k_1=1$.\nModified range: $[k_1+2, 2^n-k_0] = [1+2, 2-0] = [3, 2]$. This range is empty!\nBut the output is `2`. This means the modified rule is incorrect.\n\nThe original rule $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0]$ works for $n=1,2$ but not $n=3$.\nThis is very strange.\nCould $n=1$ be an edge case? $k_1+1$ vs $k_1+2$.\nFor $n=1, s=\"1\"$: $k_1=1$. $1+k_1=2$. $k_1+2=3$.\nThe output is `2`. My formula gives `2`. The modified formula gives empty range.\n\nFor $n=2, s=\"01\"$: $k_1=1$. $1+k_1=2$. $k_1+2=3$.\nMy formula gives $[2,3]$. Output `2 3`. Matches.\nModified formula gives $[3,3]$. Does not match.\n\nIt seems my original formula $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0]$ is correct for $n=1,2$.\nAnd the example output for $n=3$ is what's confusing me.\n\nLet's re-read the $n=3, s=\"101\"$ example output.\nInput:\n3\n101\nOutput:\n4 5 6 7\n\nIs it possible that $k_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$ that are *not* the first character?\nNo, that's too specific.\n\nWhat if $k_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$ and $k_0$ is the number of '0's in $s$?\nThe problem is well-defined.\nThe range $[1+k_1, 2^n-k_0]$ is the standard solution for this type of problem.\nThe only reason it would be different is if there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\"The skill level of the $i$-th team is $p_i$, where $p$ is a permutation of integers $1, 2, \\dots, 2^n$\".\nThis implies we can assign $x$ to any team $i$ and then fill the rest.\n\nCould the example output be wrong? Or am I misunderstanding something fundamental about $n=3$?\nThis is unlikely for a competitive programming problem. The examples are usually correct.\n\nLet's consider the values for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$2^n=8$.\n$s_0='1'$ (phase 1: higher wins)\n$s_1='0'$ (phase 2: lower wins)\n$s_2='1'$ (phase 3: higher wins)\n\nIf skill $x$ wins, it must win 3 games.\nGame 1 (phase 1): $x > O_1$.\nGame 2 (phase 2): $x < O_2$.\nGame 3 (phase 3): $x > O_3$.\n\nSo $x$ needs two opponents $O_1, O_3$ with skills less than $x$.\nAnd $x$ needs one opponent $O_2$ with skill greater than $x$.\nThis means $k_1=2$ and $k_0=1$.\n\nThe skills used are $x, O_1, O_2, O_3$. These are 4 distinct skills.\nThe smallest possible $x$ would be 3 (if $O_1=1, O_3=2$).\nThe largest possible $x$ would be 7 (if $O_2=8$).\n\nLet's try to make $x=3$ win.\n$p_1=3$.\n$p_2=1$. (Team 1 beats Team 2 in Phase 1, $s_0='1'$, $3>1$). Winner is Team 1 (skill 3).\nNow Team 1 (skill 3) plays some other team's winner. Let's say Team 3's winner.\nTeam 3 (skill 3) must beat Team 4's winner (say, skill 4) in Phase 2 ($s_1='0'$, $3<4$). Winner is Team 1 (skill 3).\nNow Team 1 (skill 3) plays the other half's winner (say, skill 2) in Phase 3 ($s_2='1'$, $3>2$). Winner is Team 1 (skill 3).\nSkills used: $3, 1, 4, 2$. These are $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\nThe skills $5,6,7,8$ are unused by these teams. We can assign them to other teams.\nFor example, $p_1=3, p_2=1$.\nTo make winner of (3v4) be 4: $p_3=4, p_4=5$. (4 beats 5 in Phase 1, $s_0='1'$, $4>5$ is false. $p_3=5, p_4=4$ is false too).\nThis is where the fixed bracket structure matters.\nIf $s_0='1'$, higher skill wins.\nTo make winner(3v4) be 4: we need $p_3$ or $p_4$ to be 4, and $p_3$ or $p_4$ to be some value less than 4.\nExample: $p_3=4, p_4=2$. Then winner(3v4) is 4.\nTo make winner(5v6,7v8) be 2:\nWinner(5v6) is $W_{56}$. Winner(7v8) is $W_{78}$.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): $W_{56}$ vs $W_{78}$. Winner is 2. So one of them is 2, and it's lower than the other.\nLet $W_{56}=2, W_{78}=6$. Then winner is 2.\nTo make $W_{56}=2$: $p_5=2, p_6=7$. (2 beats 7 in Phase 1, $s_0='1'$, $2>7$ is false).\nThis is the problem. The skills used by the opponents must also win their games to reach their match against $x$.\n\nLet's count the number of teams that must have skill less than $x$, and the number of teams that must have skill greater than $x$.\nThis is not just $k_1$ and $k_0$.\nFor $x$ to win, it needs to defeat $k_1$ opponents that are less than $x$.\nAnd $k_0$ opponents that are greater than $x$.\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skills.\nLet $L$ be the set of skills $\\{1, \\dots, x-1\\}$. Size $x-1$.\nLet $G$ be the set of skills $\\{x+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$. Size $2^n-x$.\n\nA team with skill $x$ wins.\nThe $k_1$ opponents of $x$ (who must have skill less than $x$) take $k_1$ distinct skills from $L$.\nThe $k_0$ opponents of $x$ (who must have skill greater than $x$) take $k_0$ distinct skills from $G$.\n\nNow consider the sub-brackets.\nFor each game $x$ plays in phase $i$, its opponent is the winner of a sub-bracket of size $2^{i-1}$.\nLet $N_0$ be the number of phases where $s_i='0'$.\nLet $N_1$ be the number of phases where $s_i='1'$.\nThe values $N_0$ and $N_1$ are $k_0$ and $k_1$ as I defined them.\n\nA team with skill $x$ wins.\nIn any phase $i$ where $s_i='0'$, $x$ must be lower than its opponent. This means $x$ \"uses up\" one of the $2^n-x$ higher skills.\nIn any phase $i$ where $s_i='1'$, $x$ must be higher than its opponent. This means $x$ \"uses up\" one of the $x-1$ lower skills.\n\nThis is the key: The number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $x$ is $k_1$.\nThe number of teams that must be strictly larger than $x$ is $k_0$.\nBut these are just the direct opponents. What about teams that are NOT direct opponents, but still must have skill less than $x$ or greater than $x$ for the bracket to work out?\n\nConsider the $k_1$ games where $x$ must be greater than its opponent.\nFor each such game, say $x$ vs $O_j$, $O_j$ must have skill $<x$.\nConsider the $k_0$ games where $x$ must be less than its opponent.\nFor each such game, say $x$ vs $O_j'$, $O_j'$ must have skill $>x$.\n\nThe total number of teams that are in the same half of the bracket as $x$ in the final game is $2^{n-1}$.\nThe total number of teams that are in the same quarter of the bracket as $x$ in the semi-final game is $2^{n-2}$.\n...\nThe number of teams in $x$'s initial sub-bracket (for phase 1) is $2^0=1$ (excluding $x$).\n\nLet's trace the number of teams that are *guaranteed* to be less than $x$ or greater than $x$ for $x$ to win.\nConsider the $k_1$ games where $x$ must be higher than its opponent.\nThe $k_1$ opponents must have skills $<x$.\nConsider the $k_0$ games where $x$ must be lower than its opponent.\nThe $k_0$ opponents must have skills $>x$.\n\nThe crucial observation from similar problems is that the number of teams that must be smaller than $x$ is not just $k_1$.\nFor each '1' in $s$, say $s_i = '1'$, $x$ must win this game by having higher skill. Its opponent $O$ must have skill $<x$. This opponent $O$ is the winner of a sub-bracket of size $2^i$. This sub-bracket has $2^i-1$ other teams.\nFor $O$ to win this sub-bracket, $O$ must have won $i$ games.\nThis implies $O$ needs some opponents to be smaller/larger than itself.\n\nThe number of teams that must have a skill less than $x$ is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that must have a skill greater than $x$ is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis is a common pattern in these types of problems.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner must be higher. The number of teams in the opponent's sub-bracket is $2^{i-1}$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner must be lower.\n\nThis interpretation means:\nThe number of teams with skill less than $x$ must be at least $2^{k_1}-1$.\nSo $x-1 \\ge 2^{k_1}-1 \\implies x \\ge 2^{k_1}$.\nThe number of teams with skill greater than $x$ must be at least $2^{k_0}-1$.\nSo $2^n-x \\ge 2^{k_0}-1 \\implies x \\le 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$.\n\nLet's test this new range: $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)]$.\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$. $2^n=8$.\nLower bound: $2^{k_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nUpper bound: $2^n - (2^{k_0}-1) = 8 - (2^1-1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nRange: $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output! `4 5 6 7`.\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $k_0=0, k_1=1$. $2^n=2$.\nLower bound: $2^{k_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nUpper bound: $2^n - (2^{k_0}-1) = 2 - (2^0-1) = 2 - (1-1) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\nRange: $[2, 2]$. This matches the example output! `2`.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=1$. $2^n=4$.\nLower bound: $2^{k_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nUpper bound: $2^n - (2^{k_0}-1) = 4 - (2^1-1) = 4 - (2-1) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\nRange: $[2, 3]$. This matches the example output! `2 3`.\n\nThis new interpretation seems to be correct.\nThe reasoning behind $2^{k_1}-1$ and $2^{k_0}-1$:\nWhen $x$ wins a game where $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), its opponent $O$ must have skill $<x$. This opponent $O$ is the winner of a sub-bracket of $2^{i}$ teams (including $O$ itself). All $2^{i}-1$ teams in $O$'s sub-bracket (excluding $O$) must eventually be defeated by $O$. This doesn't mean all $2^{i}-1$ teams must be less than $x$.\nHowever, the $2^{k_1}-1$ value comes from the fact that $x$ needs to be higher than $k_1$ opponents. The minimum number of teams that must have skills lower than $x$ is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThis is because for each game where $x$ must be higher than its opponent, the opponent is the winner of a sub-tournament. To ensure $x$ wins these $k_1$ games, the $k_1$ opponents must have skills less than $x$. And all the teams that these $k_1$ opponents defeated to reach $x$ must also have skills less than $x$.\nThis implies that $x$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ other values.\nSimilarly, $x$ must be less than $2^{k_0}-1$ other values.\n\nThe total number of teams that must have skill less than $x$ is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThis means $x-1 \\ge 2^{k_1}-1$, so $x \\ge 2^{k_1}$.\nThe total number of teams that must have skill greater than $x$ is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis means $2^n-x \\ge 2^{k_0}-1$, so $x \\le 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$.\n\nThis logic gives the range $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)]$.\nThis is the correct range that matches all examples.\n\nFinal Algorithm:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $k_0 = s.count('0')$ and $k_1 = s.count('1')$.\n4. Calculate $min\\_x = 2^{k_1}$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_x = 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$.\n6. Print all integers from $min\\_x$ to $max\\_x$ inclusive, in ascending order.\n\nThe values $2^{k_1}$ and $2^{k_0}$ can be computed efficiently using bit shifts ($1 \\ll k_1$ and $1 \\ll k_0$).\nThe maximum value of $n$ is 18, so $2^{18}$ is $262144$. The range can be up to this size. Printing them all is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    k0 = s.count('0')\n    k1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # Calculate the minimum winning skill\n    # A team with skill x needs to win k1 games where it must have higher skill.\n    # This implies there must be at least 2^k1 - 1 other teams with skill less than x.\n    # So, x - 1 >= 2^k1 - 1  =>  x >= 2^k1\n    min_winning_skill = 1 << k1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum winning skill\n    # A team with skill x needs to win k0 games where it must have lower skill.\n    # This implies there must be at least 2^k0 - 1 other teams with skill greater than x.\n    # So, 2^n - x >= 2^k0 - 1  =>  x <= 2^n - (2^k0 - 1)\n    max_winning_skill = (1 << n) - ((1 << k0) - 1)\n\n    # Generate the list of winning integers\n    winning_integers = []\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        winning_integers.append(str(x))\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(winning_integers) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
