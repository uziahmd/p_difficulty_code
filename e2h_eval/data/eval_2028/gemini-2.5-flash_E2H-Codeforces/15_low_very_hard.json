They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Playoff\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm tackling this \"Playoff\" problem. Seems straightforward on the surface, but let's dive deep.  My goal is a Python script to find these \"winning integers\".\n\nFirst, let's refresh the problem: We have $2^n$ teams, a tournament with $n$ phases, and each team has a skill level, which is just a permutation of the numbers from $1$ to $2^n$. The string $s$ dictates who wins in each phase: a '0' means the lower skill wins, a '1' the higher.  I need to find all the skill levels that *could* win, regardless of the initial permutation.\n\nThe core is the single-elimination structure. Each winner has to win 'n' matches. My mind immediately goes to analyzing this tournament bracket.  Team $k$'s skill is $p_k$, and I'm trying to figure out which *x* values are possible for $p_k$ if team $k$ can win.\n\nThe string 's' is the key here.  $s[i-1]$ (with 0-based indexing) tells me the outcome of phase i.\n\nThe crucial thought is breaking down how skill levels interact with these outcomes.  A winning team $X$ will have to win against opponents whose skills are either higher or lower, depending on the phase. The final game, the $n$th phase, is the clearest. If $s[n-1] = '0'$, *X* has to be lower than their opponent. If $s[n-1] = '1'$, it's higher. But how can I generalize this?\n\nIt's about the range of possible skill levels for the winner. I need to figure out what values for X are *always* possible given the string s. If I can nail down the range, I can then iterate.\n\nThe number of games is important. The winner plays 'n' games. A team reaching the final plays $n-1$, and so on. But the skill interaction is what confuses me.  Every time the winner plays, if it wins, it does so against someone of either a greater or lower skill. So, the winner can be a low or high skilled person.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) such that a team with skill $x$ can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ that dictates game outcomes in each phase. $s_i = '0'$ means the lower-skilled team wins in phase $i$, and $s_i = '1'$ means the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament.\nA team must win $n$ games to become the champion. Let's consider the $n$ games it plays, one in each phase.\n\nSuppose a team with skill $X$ wins.\nIn each of the $n$ games it plays, it must defeat an opponent.\nLet $k_0$ be the number of phases where $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins).\nLet $k_1$ be the number of phases where $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins).\nSo, $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n\nFor the team with skill $X$ to win:\n1. In the $k_0$ phases where $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be *lower* than its opponent's skill. This means $X$ must be smaller than at least $k_0$ other distinct skill values.\n2. In the $k_1$ phases where $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be *higher* than its opponent's skill. This means $X$ must be larger than at least $k_1$ other distinct skill values.\n\nCrucially, the skill values of the opponents are distinct from $X$ and from each other.\nAlso, the permutation $p$ can be chosen arbitrarily. This means we can assign any skill value from $1, \\dots, 2^n$ to any team, as long as each value is used exactly once.\n\nTo make $X$ win, we need to find $n$ distinct skill values for its opponents, say $O_1, O_2, \\dots, O_n$, such that:\n- For $k_0$ opponents, $X < O_j$.\n- For $k_1$ opponents, $X > O_j$.\n\nTo minimize $X$, we want to pick the smallest possible values for the $k_1$ opponents $O_j < X$, and the smallest possible values for the $k_0$ opponents $O_j > X$.\nThe smallest $k_1$ values less than $X$ are $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$. So, $X$ must be at least $k_1+1$.\nThe smallest $k_0$ values greater than $X$ are $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+k_0$.\nSo, if $X$ is the winner, it must be possible to find $k_1$ distinct values smaller than $X$ and $k_0$ distinct values larger than $X$.\nThe smallest possible value for $X$ is $k_1+1$. If $X = k_1+1$, its $k_1$ smaller opponents can be $1, \\dots, k_1$. Its $k_0$ larger opponents can be $k_1+2, \\dots, k_1+1+k_0$. This requires $k_1+1+k_0 \\le 2^n$. Since $k_0+k_1=n$, this is $n+1 \\le 2^n$. This holds for $n \\ge 1$.\nSo, the minimum possible skill $X_{min}$ for a winner is $k_1+1$.\n\nTo maximize $X$, we want to pick the largest possible values for the $k_1$ opponents $O_j < X$, and the largest possible values for the $k_0$ opponents $O_j > X$.\nThe largest $k_0$ values greater than $X$ are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$. So, $X$ must be at most $2^n-k_0$.\nThe largest $k_1$ values less than $X$ are $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-k_1$.\nSo, if $X$ is the winner, it must be possible to find $k_1$ distinct values smaller than $X$ and $k_0$ distinct values larger than $X$.\nThe largest possible value for $X$ is $2^n-k_0$. If $X = 2^n-k_0$, its $k_0$ larger opponents can be $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$. Its $k_1$ smaller opponents can be $2^n-k_0-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0-k_1$. This requires $2^n-k_0-k_1 \\ge 1$. Since $k_0+k_1=n$, this is $2^n-n \\ge 1$. This holds for $n \\ge 1$.\nSo, the maximum possible skill $X_{max}$ for a winner is $2^n-k_0$.\n\nTherefore, any integer $X$ such that $k_1+1 \\le X \\le 2^n-k_0$ can be a winning skill.\nFor any such $X$:\n- We need $k_1$ opponents with skill less than $X$. We can pick $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$. These are all less than or equal to $k_1$, and $X \\ge k_1+1$, so these are all less than $X$.\n- We need $k_0$ opponents with skill greater than $X$. We can pick $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$. These are all greater than or equal to $2^n-k_0+1$, and $X \\le 2^n-k_0$, so these are all greater than $X$.\n- All $k_1$ chosen values and $k_0$ chosen values are distinct from $X$.\n- The set of $n$ opponent skills $\\{1, \\dots, k_1\\} \\cup \\{2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$ are all distinct. This is true because $k_1 < 2^n-k_0+1$ if $k_1+k_0 \\le 2^n$. Since $k_1+k_0 = n$, we need $n < 2^n+1$, which is always true for $n \\ge 1$.\n- The total number of distinct skill values used is $1$ (for $X$) plus $k_1$ (for smaller opponents) plus $k_0$ (for larger opponents), which is $1+k_1+k_0 = 1+n$. This is always $\\le 2^n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nSo, the range of winning integers is $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\n\nLet's calculate $k_0$ and $k_1$ from the input string $s$.\n$k_0 = \\text{count of '0's in } s$.\n$k_1 = \\text{count of '1's in } s$.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$k_0 = 1$ (for $s_1='0'$)\n$k_1 = 2$ (for $s_0='1', s_2='1'$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nMinimum winning skill: $k_1+1 = 2+1 = 3$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n-k_0 = 8-1 = 7$.\nWinning integers: $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe example output is `4 5 6 7`. This implies my analysis is slightly off.\n\nThe problem states \"in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\" or \"in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins\". This means *all* $2^{n-i}$ games in phase $i$ follow the same rule $s_i$.\nThe crucial part is that the *permutation $p$ can be chosen*. This means we can assign skill values to teams such that the desired team wins.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. The number of games $X$ must win is $n$.\nIn $k_0$ of these games, $X$ must be lower than its opponent.\nIn $k_1$ of these games, $X$ must be higher than its opponent.\nTo win, $X$ must defeat $n$ different opponents.\nLet $M$ be the set of $k_1$ opponents $X$ must beat (so $O_j < X$).\nLet $L$ be the set of $k_0$ opponents $X$ must be beaten by (so $O_j > X$).\nThe sets $M$, $L$, and $\\{X\\}$ must be disjoint.\nThe smallest possible value for $X$ is $k_1+1$. In this case, $M=\\{1, \\dots, k_1\\}$. $L=\\{k_1+2, \\dots, k_1+1+k_0\\}$.\nThe largest possible value for $X$ is $2^n-k_0$. In this case, $L=\\{2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$. $M=\\{2^n-k_0-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0-k_1\\}$.\n\nMy logic for the range $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$ seems correct. Let's check the example `3\\n101` again.\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_0='1'$, $s_1='0'$, $s_2='1'$.\n$k_0=1$ (one '0'), $k_1=2$ (two '1's).\n$2^n = 8$.\n$X_{min} = k_1+1 = 2+1 = 3$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n-k_0 = 8-1 = 7$.\nRange: $[3, 7]$. Output: `3 4 5 6 7`.\nThe example output is `4 5 6 7`. My output for this example is `3 4 5 6 7`.\nThis means $3$ might not be a winning number. Why?\n\nPerhaps the issue is not just about the *number* of opponents, but their positions in the bracket.\nThe problem statement: \"in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"1 vs 2\" plays against the winner of the game \"3 vs 4\", then the winner of the game \"5 vs 6\" plays against the winner of the game \"7 vs 8\", and so on.\"\nThis implies a fixed bracket structure. The team $X$ plays some specific set of *slots* in the bracket.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that $X$ must beat, and the number of teams that must beat $X$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins if $X < \\text{opponent}$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins if $X > \\text{opponent}$.\n\nLet's think about the *number of teams* that can potentially win the tournament.\nIn the first phase, $2^{n-1}$ games.\nIf $s_0 = '0'$, the lower skill wins. This means the winners are the $2^{n-1}$ teams with lower skill in their initial pairs.\nIf $s_0 = '1'$, the higher skill wins. This means the winners are the $2^{n-1}$ teams with higher skill in their initial pairs.\n\nLet's count how many teams must be *smaller* than $X$ for $X$ to win, and how many teams must be *larger* than $X$ for $X$ to win.\nThe key insight might be related to the number of teams that are eliminated by $X$, and the number of teams that eliminate others to reach $X$.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"beaten\" by $X$. $X$ wins $n$ games. So $X$ directly beats $n$ opponents.\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"beaten by $X$'s opponents\".\nFor $X$ to win, it must ultimately defeat $n$ opponents. Let's call them $O_1, O_2, \\dots, O_n$.\n$O_1$ is $X$'s first opponent.\n$O_2$ is $X$'s second opponent. $O_2$ must have won its first game.\n$O_3$ is $X$'s third opponent. $O_3$ must have won its first two games.\n...\n$O_n$ is $X$'s $n$-th opponent (in the final). $O_n$ must have won its first $n-1$ games.\n\nThis is the standard competitive programming trick where the actual values of $p_i$ don't matter beyond their relative order.\nThe $2^n$ teams are in a fixed bracket. A team $T$ plays $n$ games to win.\nTo win the tournament, team $T$ must defeat $n$ opponents.\nLet $k_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$, and $k_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nFor team $T$ with skill $X$ to win, $X$ must be:\n- smaller than $k_0$ opponents.\n- larger than $k_1$ opponents.\n\nThe crucial part is that the permutation $p$ can be chosen. We can assign $X$ to team $T$.\nWe can assign skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ to $k_1$ opponents that $X$ needs to beat in '1' phases.\nWe can assign skills $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$ to $k_0$ opponents that $X$ needs to beat in '0' phases.\nThe remaining $2^n - (1+k_0+k_1)$ skills can be assigned to the other teams in the tournament.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is $k_1+1$. This means $X$ is greater than $k_1$ values and smaller than $2^n - (k_1+1)$ values.\nThe maximum skill $X$ can have is $2^n-k_0$. This means $X$ is smaller than $k_0$ values and greater than $2^n - (k_0+1)$ values.\n\nSo, the range of possible values for $X$ is still $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nLet's check the example where my calculation gave `3 4 5 6 7` but the example output was `4 5 6 7`.\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nMy range: $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nExample range: $[4, 7]$.\n\nWhat if the $k_0$ opponents $X$ must be smaller than, and the $k_1$ opponents $X$ must be larger than, are not just *any* $n$ distinct opponents, but opponents that themselves have won a specific number of games?\nThe problem says \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\".\nThis means *all* games in phase $i$ follow the rule $s_i$.\nSo, if $X$ is in a game in phase $i$ and $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must have lower skill than its opponent.\nIf $X$ is in a game in phase $i$ and $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must have higher skill than its opponent.\n\nLet's consider the total number of teams that must be eliminated to make way for $X$ to win.\n$X$ itself eliminates $n$ teams.\nConsider the $k_0$ games $X$ plays where $s_i = '0'$. $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\nConsider the $k_1$ games $X$ plays where $s_i = '1'$. $X$ must be larger than its opponent.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"Find all winning integers $x$\".\nThe crucial part is that the permutation $p$ can be chosen.\nSuppose $s$ has $k_0$ zeros and $k_1$ ones.\nTo win, a team with skill $X$ must defeat $k_0$ opponents $O_j$ such that $X < O_j$, and $k_1$ opponents $O_k$ such that $X > O_k$.\nThese $n$ opponents are distinct.\nThe minimum value $X$ can take is $k_1+1$.\nThe maximum value $X$ can take is $2^n-k_0$.\n\nWhy is the example output different?\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$. $2^n=8$.\nMy range $[3, 7]$. Example output $[4, 7]$.\nThe number $3$ is missing. Why can't skill $3$ win?\nIf $X=3$, it needs $k_1=2$ opponents smaller than $3$ (can be $1, 2$) and $k_0=1$ opponent larger than $3$ (can be $4$).\nThis set of skills $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ is available.\nThe remaining $8-4=4$ skills $\\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$ can be assigned to other teams.\nThis setup seems valid. Why would $3$ not be a winner?\n\nCould it be that the *number of teams* that are guaranteed to be smaller or larger than the winner is not just $k_0$ and $k_1$?\nConsider the teams that are eliminated *before* they play $X$.\nIf $X$ has skill $x$.\nFor $X$ to win, it needs to defeat $n$ opponents.\nThe $k_1$ opponents $X$ beats in phases where $s_i='1'$ must have skill less than $x$.\nThe $k_0$ opponents $X$ beats in phases where $s_i='0'$ must have skill greater than $x$.\n\nLet's think about the total number of teams that $X$ must be greater than, and the total number of teams $X$ must be smaller than.\nSuppose $X$ wins.\nIn phase $i$, if $s_i='1'$, $X$ beats an opponent $O_i$ where $X > O_i$. $O_i$ itself might have beaten some teams.\nIn phase $i$, if $s_i='0'$, $X$ beats an opponent $O_i$ where $X < O_i$. $O_i$ itself might have beaten some teams.\n\nThis is a common pattern for \"find all winning integers\" problems. The $k_0$ and $k_1$ values are about the *winner's direct matches*.\nThe total number of teams that are eliminated by the winner, or by teams that the winner eventually eliminates, and so on, forms a set of $2^n-1$ teams.\nThe winner is the one team that is never eliminated.\n\nLet's consider the final game (phase $n$). The winner $X$ plays an opponent $O_n$.\nIf $s_{n-1}='1'$, $X > O_n$. $O_n$ is one of the $2^{n-1}$ teams that survived phase $n-1$.\nIf $s_{n-1}='0'$, $X < O_n$. $O_n$ is one of the $2^{n-1}$ teams that survived phase $n-1$.\n\nThe crucial part is that the $s$ string applies to *all* games in a phase.\nLet's consider the total number of teams that are eliminated by $X$ or by teams that $X$ eventually eliminates. This is $2^n-1$.\nThe winner $X$ must have defeated $n$ direct opponents.\nThe $k_1$ values where $s_i = '1'$ mean $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nThe $k_0$ values where $s_i = '0'$ mean $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nWhat if $s_i='0'$ for *all* $i$? Then $k_0=n, k_1=0$.\nMy formula: $X_{min}=0+1=1$, $X_{max}=2^n-n$. So range $[1, 2^n-n]$.\nExample $n=2, s=\"01\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=1$.\nMy range: $[1+1, 2^2-1] = [2, 3]$. Output: `2 3`. This matches example.\nSo for this example, my formula is correct.\n\nExample $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $k_0=0, k_1=1$.\nMy range: $[1+1, 2^1-0] = [2, 2]$. Output: `2`. This matches example.\nSo for this example, my formula is correct.\n\nThe only problematic example is $n=3, s=\"101\"$. My range $[3, 7]$, output $[4, 7]$.\nThis suggests that $X_{min}$ might be $k_1+1$ only if $k_0=0$.\nOr $X_{max}$ might be $2^n-k_0$ only if $k_1=0$.\n\nLet's re-examine $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): Higher skill wins.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): Lower skill wins.\nPhase 3 ($s_2='1'$): Higher skill wins.\n\nConsider a team that wins. Let its skill be $X$.\nIt plays 3 games.\nGame 1 (phase 1): $s_0='1'$. $X$ must be higher than its opponent $O_1$.\nGame 2 (phase 2): $s_1='0'$. $X$ must be lower than its opponent $O_2$.\nGame 3 (phase 3): $s_2='1'$. $X$ must be higher than its opponent $O_3$.\n\nSo $X > O_1$, $X < O_2$, $X > O_3$.\nThe opponents $O_1, O_2, O_3$ must be distinct.\nAlso, $O_2$ must have won its previous game(s). $O_3$ must have won its previous game(s).\nThe values $O_1, O_2, O_3$ are chosen from $1, \\dots, 2^n$ excluding $X$.\n\nLet's try to construct a permutation for $X=3$ to win for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nWe need $O_1 < 3$, $O_2 > 3$, $O_3 < 3$.\nPossible values for $O_1, O_3$ from $\\{1, 2\\}$. They must be distinct. So $O_1=1, O_3=2$ (or vice versa).\nPossible value for $O_2$ from $\\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$. Let $O_2=4$.\nSo $X=3$, opponents are $1, 2, 4$.\nThe set of skills used for $X$ and its direct opponents is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe remaining skills are $\\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$.\n\nNow we need to assign these skills to teams and make sure the tournament plays out correctly.\nLet's fix the winner's position in the bracket. Say team 1 wins.\nTeam 1 plays team 2 in phase 1. $s_0='1'$, so $p_1 > p_2$. Let $p_1=3, p_2=1$.\nWinner is $p_1=3$.\nNext, winner of (1 vs 2) plays winner of (3 vs 4). Let's say winner of (3 vs 4) is team 3, with skill $p_3$.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): $p_1 < p_3$. So $3 < p_3$. We need $p_3=4$.\nWinner is $p_1=3$.\nNext, winner of (1-4) plays winner of (5-8). Let's say winner of (5-8) is team 5, with skill $p_5$.\nPhase 3 ($s_2='1'$): $p_1 > p_5$. So $3 > p_5$. We need $p_5=2$.\nWinner is $p_1=3$.\n\nSo we need:\n$p_1=3$.\n$p_2=1$ (opponent in phase 1, $p_1 > p_2$).\n$p_3=4$ (opponent in phase 2, $p_1 < p_3$).\n$p_5=2$ (opponent in phase 3, $p_1 > p_5$).\nThe skills used are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nWhat about team 4 (opponent of team 3)? $p_3 > p_4$ (phase 1, $s_0='1'$). So $4 > p_4$. Let $p_4=5$. (This is where it goes wrong, $p_4$ must be from unused skills. $p_4$ must be from $\\{5,6,7,8\\}$, but $p_4$ must be less than $p_3=4$. This is impossible).\n\nThe issue is that an opponent of $X$ in a later phase, say $O_j$, must itself have won some games. And those games also follow the $s$ rules.\nExample: $X=3$ wants to win.\nGame 1 ($s_0='1'$): $X$ plays $O_1$. $X > O_1$.\nGame 2 ($s_1='0'$): $X$ plays $O_2$. $X < O_2$. $O_2$ won its phase 1 game.\nGame 3 ($s_2='1'$): $X$ plays $O_3$. $X > O_3$. $O_3$ won its phase 1 and phase 2 games.\n\nConsider $O_2$. It won its phase 1 game. Let $O_2$ play $O_{2}'$ in phase 1.\nIf $s_0='1'$, then $O_2 > O_{2}'$.\nConsider $O_3$. It won its phase 1 game and phase 2 game.\nLet $O_3$ play $O_{3,1}'$ in phase 1. If $s_0='1'$, then $O_3 > O_{3,1}'$.\nLet $O_3$ play $O_{3,2}'$ in phase 2. If $s_1='0'$, then $O_3 < O_{3,2}'$.\n\nThis structure means that $X$ isn't just compared to $n$ skills. It's compared to $n$ skills *and* those $n$ skills are compared to their opponents, and so on.\nThis is similar to counting how many teams are in the \"subtree\" of the winner in the bracket.\nA winner $X$ eliminates $n$ direct opponents.\nEach of these $n$ opponents has a \"subtree\" of teams they eliminated.\nThe total number of teams $X$ is \"better than\" is the number of teams in the bracket that end up in its $k_1$ '1'-phases.\nThe total number of teams $X$ is \"worse than\" is the number of teams in the bracket that end up in its $k_0$ '0'-phases.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum number of teams that $X$ must be greater than is $2^{N_1}-1$.\nThe minimum number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{N_0}-1$.\nWait, this is not quite right.\nIf $s_i='1'$, then $X$ beats an opponent $O_i$. The number of teams $O_i$ could possibly have beaten is $2^{i-1}-1$.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's simplify.\nA team with skill $X$ wins.\nIt plays $n$ games.\nIn $k_1$ of these games, it must have higher skill than its opponent.\nIn $k_0$ of these games, it must have lower skill than its opponent.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"behind\" $X$ in the bracket.\nFor $X$ to win, it must be assigned a skill value $x$.\nThe number of teams that are in $X$'s half of the bracket (the $2^{n-1}$ teams that could meet $X$ in the final) is $2^{n-1}$.\nThe number of teams in $X$'s quarter of the bracket (the $2^{n-2}$ teams that could meet $X$ in the semi-final) is $2^{n-2}$.\n...\nThe number of teams in $X$'s initial pair is $1$.\n\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skill values.\nFor $X$ to win, it must be the highest skill in some set of $2^{k_1}$ teams, and the lowest skill in some set of $2^{k_0}$ teams.\nThis implies $X$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ other skills and smaller than $2^{k_0}-1$ other skills.\nThis is not quite right either.\n\nLet $L_i$ be the number of teams that are \"lower\" than $X$ if $X$ wins in phase $i$.\nLet $H_i$ be the number of teams that are \"higher\" than $X$ if $X$ wins in phase $i$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ beats its opponent $O$. $X > O$. $O$ could have beaten $2^{i-1}-1$ teams. So $X$ is greater than $1 + (2^{i-1}-1) = 2^{i-1}$ teams.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ beats its opponent $O$. $X < O$. $O$ could have beaten $2^{i-1}-1$ teams. So $X$ is smaller than $1 + (2^{i-1}-1) = 2^{i-1}$ teams.\nThis is also not quite right.\n\nLet's use the actual string $s$.\n$k_0 = \\text{number of '0's in } s$.\n$k_1 = \\text{number of '1's in } s$.\n\nThe minimal skill $X_{min}$ that can win.\nTo make $X$ as small as possible, we want $X$ to beat opponents with small skills, and be beaten by opponents with large skills.\n$X$ must be greater than $k_1$ skills. The smallest $k_1$ skills are $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$.\nSo $X \\ge k_1+1$.\n$X$ must be smaller than $k_0$ skills. The smallest $k_0$ skills greater than $X$ are $X+1, \\dots, X+k_0$.\nSo $X$ must be able to find $k_1$ smaller values and $k_0$ larger values.\nThe *lowest possible* skill value $X$ can take is $1$. If $X=1$, then all $s_i$ must be '0'. So $k_1=0$. In this case, $X_{min}=1$.\nThe *highest possible* skill value $X$ can take is $2^n$. If $X=2^n$, then all $s_i$ must be '1'. So $k_0=0$. In this case, $X_{max}=2^n$.\n\nThe number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $k_1$.\nThe number of teams $X$ must be smaller than is $k_0$.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nMy range was $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output was $[4, 7]$.\nThe value $3$ is excluded. This means $X=3$ cannot win.\n\nWhat is special about the $s_i$ values?\n$s = s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}$.\nThe *rank* of the winner is what we are looking for.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner of that game has lower skill.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner of that game has higher skill.\n\nLet $min\\_rank$ be the minimum possible rank a winner can have.\nLet $max\\_rank$ be the maximum possible rank a winner can have.\nThe problem is asking for integers $x$ in $[min\\_rank, max\\_rank]$.\n\nConsider the number of teams that end up being eliminated by $X$ or by teams $X$ eventually eliminates.\nFor each $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent. This opponent has eliminated $2^{i-1}-1$ teams to reach $X$. So $X$ is greater than $1 + (2^{i-1}-1)$ teams, if we could always arrange skills.\nThis is the key: \"it is possible to find a permutation $p$\".\n\nLet $k_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nLet $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum possible skill for a winner:\nThe winner must be greater than $k_1$ opponents. The minimum values for these $k_1$ opponents are $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe winner must be smaller than $k_0$ opponents. The minimum values for these $k_0$ opponents are $k_1+1, k_1+2, \\dots, k_1+k_0$.\nIf $X$ is to win, it must be able to be placed such that it is greater than $k_1$ values and smaller than $k_0$ values.\nThe minimum possible $X$ is $k_1+1$.\nThe maximum possible $X$ is $2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis logic is sound for the direct opponents. What if the structure of the bracket imposes further constraints?\nThe problem text says \"in the first one of them, the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\". This is a fixed bracket.\nA team $T$ plays $n$ games. The $i$-th game $T$ plays is in phase $i$.\nSo $s_0$ affects $T$'s first game, $s_1$ affects $T$'s second game, ..., $s_{n-1}$ affects $T$'s $n$-th game.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"inferior\" to $X$ and \"superior\" to $X$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent. This opponent has won $i$ games.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent. This opponent has won $i$ games.\n\nThe total number of teams that $X$ needs to be greater than is $k_1$.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ needs to be smaller than is $k_0$.\nThis is the number of *direct* opponents.\n\nLet's look at the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nMy range is $[3, 7]$.\nExample output is $[4, 7]$.\nThe smallest value $X$ can take is $2^{k_1-1}+1$ if $k_1 \\ge 1$. If $k_1=0$, then $X_{min}=1$.\nThis is because if $s_i = '1'$, the winner needs to be greater than its opponent.\nThe total number of teams that *must* be smaller than the winner is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThe total number of teams that *must* be larger than the winner is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis is the key.\nFor $X$ to win, it must be the largest skill among $2^{k_1}$ teams, and the smallest skill among $2^{k_0}$ teams.\nSo $X$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ other skill values.\nAnd $X$ must be smaller than $2^{k_0}-1$ other skill values.\n\nLet $N_L = 2^{k_1}-1$ be the number of values $X$ must be larger than.\nLet $N_H = 2^{k_0}-1$ be the number of values $X$ must be smaller than.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $N_L+1$.\nThe largest $X$ can be is $2^n-N_H$.\n\nLet's test this new formula.\n$X_{min} = (2^{k_1}-1) + 1 = 2^{k_1}$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0=1, k_1=2$.\n$X_{min} = 2^{k_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nRange is $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output!\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$k_0=0, k_1=1$.\n$X_{min} = 2^{k_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^1 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\nRange is $[2, 2]$. This matches the example output!\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$k_0=1, k_1=1$.\n$X_{min} = 2^{k_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^2 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\nRange is $[2, 3]$. This matches the example output!\n\nThis new formula seems to be correct.\nThe reasoning behind $2^{k_1}-1$ and $2^{k_0}-1$ is as follows:\nConsider the path of the winner $X$ through the bracket.\nThere are $k_1$ phases where $X$ wins by having higher skill ($s_i='1'$).\nFor each such phase $i$, $X$ must defeat an opponent $O$. $X > O$.\nThis opponent $O$ comes from a sub-bracket of $2^{i-1}$ teams. $O$ is the winner of that sub-bracket.\nIf $X$ is to be greater than $O$, and $O$ is the winner of its sub-bracket, then $X$ can be greater than *all* $2^{i-1}$ teams in $O$'s sub-bracket. This is the most permissive assignment for $X$.\nIf all $k_1$ phases where $s_i='1'$ are such that $X$ is greater than *all* $2^{i-1}$ teams in the opponent's sub-bracket, then $X$ must be greater than $\\sum_{j \\text{ s.t. } s_j='1'} 2^{j-1}$ teams. This is not $2^{k_1}-1$.\n\nLet's re-state what $k_0$ and $k_1$ mean.\n$k_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$.\n$k_0$ is the number of '0's in $s$.\nThe total number of teams in the tournament is $2^n$.\nThe winner $X$ needs to be greater than $k_1$ opponents, and smaller than $k_0$ opponents.\nThe minimum possible rank for the winner: $1 + (\\text{number of teams } X \\text{ must be greater than})$.\nThe maximum possible rank for the winner: $2^n - (\\text{number of teams } X \\text{ must be smaller than})$.\n\nConsider the set of teams that are *guaranteed* to be smaller than $X$ if $X$ wins.\nThese are the teams that $X$ directly beats in phases where $s_i='1'$. There are $k_1$ such teams.\nThese are also the teams that are in the sub-brackets of those $k_1$ opponents, and are eliminated by those opponents in phases where $s_j='1'$.\nThis means that if a team $T$ wins $k_1$ games as the higher skill and $k_0$ games as the lower skill, then:\nThe highest possible skill it can have is $2^n - k_0$. (It must be smaller than $k_0$ opponents, so $k_0$ skills are 'above' it. $2^n-k_0$ is the highest possible skill if $k_0$ skills are above it).\nThe lowest possible skill it can have is $k_1+1$. (It must be larger than $k_1$ opponents, so $k_1$ skills are 'below' it. $k_1+1$ is the lowest possible skill if $k_1$ skills are below it).\nThis was my initial interpretation.\n\nThe problem is subtle. The phrasing \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), *in each match*, the team with the lower skill level wins\" means that the rule applies uniformly across the phase.\nThis implies that if $X$ wins its phase $i$ game by being lower skill ($s_i='0'$), then *all* $2^{n-i}$ winners of phase $i$ games are lower skilled than their opponents.\nSimilarly, if $X$ wins its phase $i$ game by being higher skill ($s_i='1'$), then *all* $2^{n-i}$ winners of phase $i$ games are higher skilled than their opponents.\n\nLet's analyze the number of teams that survive each phase, and their relative skill ranges.\nPhase 1: $2^{n-1}$ winners.\nIf $s_0='0'$, these $2^{n-1}$ winners are the lower-skilled teams from each pair.\nIf $s_0='1'$, these $2^{n-1}$ winners are the higher-skilled teams from each pair.\n\nThis means that the *set* of winning teams in a given phase $i$ will either be the $2^{n-i}$ lowest-skilled teams from their respective matches, or the $2^{n-i}$ highest-skilled teams from their respective matches.\nThis implies that the $2^{n-i}$ winners of phase $i$ games are either all in the lower half of the skills of the $2^{n-i+1}$ teams that entered phase $i$, or all in the upper half.\n\nLet $N_{low}$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_{high}$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe winner of the tournament must survive $N_{low}$ phases by being the lower skill, and $N_{high}$ phases by being the higher skill.\n\nConsider the minimum possible skill for the winner. Let it be $X$.\n$X$ must be greater than some number of teams, and smaller than some number of teams.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be greater than is $2^{N_{high}}-1$.\nThis is because if $X$ wins $N_{high}$ games by being the higher skill, and these games are in phases $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_{N_{high}}$.\nFor each such game, $X$ beats an opponent $O$. $X>O$. $O$ itself is a winner of a sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner is the higher skill.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner is the lower skill.\n\nThis means that for the winner $X$ to have skill $x$:\n- The minimum $x$ must be $2^{N_{high}}$. This is because $X$ must be greater than $N_{high}$ opponents. If $s_i='1'$, $X$ beats $O_i$. The $2^{i-1}$ teams that could have been in $O_i$'s sub-bracket are all potentially smaller than $X$. If $X$ wins $N_{high}$ times by being the higher skill, it means $X$ is greater than all $2^{N_{high}}-1$ teams in the \"subtree\" defined by these $N_{high}$ higher-skill wins.\n- The maximum $x$ must be $2^n - (2^{N_{low}}-1)$. This is because $X$ must be smaller than $N_{low}$ opponents. If $s_i='0'$, $X$ beats $O_i$. The $2^{i-1}$ teams that could have been in $O_i$'s sub-bracket are all potentially larger than $X$. If $X$ wins $N_{low}$ times by being the lower skill, it means $X$ is smaller than all $2^{N_{low}}-1$ teams in the \"subtree\" defined by these $N_{low}$ lower-skill wins.\n\nThis is the standard interpretation for this type of problem.\nThe range of skills for the winner is $[2^{N_{high}}, 2^n - 2^{N_{low}} + 1]$.\nLet's verify this logic.\nConsider $N_{high}$ phases where higher skill wins. In these phases, the winner $X$ is greater than its opponent. Let's say these are phases $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{N_{high}}$.\nThe opponent $O_1$ in phase $p_1$ is the winner of a sub-bracket of $2^{p_1-1}$ teams.\nThe opponent $O_2$ in phase $p_2$ is the winner of a sub-bracket of $2^{p_2-1}$ teams.\n...\nThe total number of teams that $X$ needs to be greater than is not $2^{N_{high}}-1$.\nIt's simpler. $X$ must be greater than $N_{high}$ distinct opponents.\nThe minimum value $X$ can take is $1 + N_{high}$.\nThe maximum value $X$ can take is $2^n - N_{low}$.\n\nLet's use the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$N_{low} = 1$ (for $s_1='0'$).\n$N_{high} = 2$ (for $s_0='1', s_2='1'$).\nMy formula: $X_{min} = 2^{N_{high}} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - 2^{N_{low}} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nThe range is $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output.\n\nThis formula seems to be the correct one.\nThe logic is that if $X$ wins $N_{high}$ games by being higher skilled, it means $X$ must be able to be assigned a skill such that it is greater than $N_{high}$ opponents.\nBut the permutation $p$ can be chosen.\nTo make $X$ minimal, we assign $1, \\dots, 2^{N_{high}}-1$ to teams that $X$ must be greater than.\nAnd $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-(2^{N_{low}}-1)+1$ to teams that $X$ must be smaller than.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be greater than is $2^{N_{high}}-1$.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{N_{low}}-1$.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum winning skill is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - (2^{N_0} - 1) = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's test the reasoning for $2^{N_1}$.\nIf $s$ contains $N_1$ ones, then the winner $X$ will win $N_1$ games by having higher skill.\nIn each of these games, $X$ is greater than its opponent.\nThe opponent itself won some games.\nThe most 'restrictive' scenario for $X$ to win is if all $N_1$ '1' phases require $X$ to be higher than an opponent who is the highest in their respective sub-bracket.\nThis is not about $X$ being the highest in some $2^{N_1}$ teams.\nIt's about the $N_1$ direct opponents.\nIf $s_i='1'$, team $X$ beats opponent $O$. $X > O$.\nIf $s_i='0'$, team $X$ beats opponent $O$. $X < O$.\n\nThe number of teams that are \"in the path\" of the winner $X$ at phases where $s_i='1'$ is $2^{N_1}$.\nThis means $X$ must be greater than $2^{N_1}-1$ other teams.\nThe number of teams that are \"in the path\" of the winner $X$ at phases where $s_i='0'$ is $2^{N_0}$.\nThis means $X$ must be smaller than $2^{N_0}-1$ other teams.\n\nLet's consider the teams that are eliminated in phases where $s_i='1'$.\nIf $X$ wins its game in phase $i$ ($s_i='1'$), $X$ has higher skill than its opponent $O$.\n$O$ has won $i$ games before playing $X$.\nThe number of teams that $X$ *must* be greater than is $2^{N_1}-1$.\nThis is the number of teams that are in the $N_1$ sub-brackets where $X$ wins by higher skill.\nThe number of teams that $X$ *must* be smaller than is $2^{N_0}-1$.\nThis is the number of teams that are in the $N_0$ sub-brackets where $X$ wins by lower skill.\n\nThis implies the minimum possible skill for $X$ is $1 + (2^{N_1}-1) = 2^{N_1}$.\nThis implies the maximum possible skill for $X$ is $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\nThis is the range that matched all examples.\n\nFinal check on the logic for $X_{min} = 2^{N_1}$:\nTo make $X$ as small as possible, we assign skills $1, \\dots, 2^{N_1}-1$ to teams that $X$ must be greater than.\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $2^{N_1}-1$.\nThese $2^{N_1}-1$ teams are the ones that are in the $N_1$ sub-brackets where $X$ wins by being higher skill.\nE.g., if $s=\"1\"$, $N_1=1$. $X_{min}=2^1=2$. $X$ must be greater than $2^1-1=1$ team. This team is $O_1$. $X > O_1$. So $X=2, O_1=1$ works.\nE.g., if $s=\"11\"$, $N_1=2$. $X_{min}=2^2=4$. $X$ must be greater than $2^2-1=3$ teams.\n$X$ plays $O_1$ ($s_0='1'$), $X > O_1$.\n$X$ plays $O_2$ ($s_1='1'$), $X > O_2$.\n$O_2$ must have won its phase 1 game. Let $O_2$ play $O_3$ in phase 1. $s_0='1'$, so $O_2 > O_3$.\nSo $X$ must be greater than $O_1, O_2, O_3$. These are 3 distinct teams.\nSmallest possible values for these 3 teams are $1, 2, 3$. So $X$ must be at least $4$. This matches $2^{N_1}$.\n\nFinal check on the logic for $X_{max} = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$:\nTo make $X$ as large as possible, we assign skills $2^n, \\dots, 2^n-(2^{N_0}-1)+1$ to teams that $X$ must be smaller than.\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{N_0}-1$.\nThese $2^{N_0}-1$ teams are the ones that are in the $N_0$ sub-brackets where $X$ wins by being lower skill.\nE.g., if $s=\"0\"$, $N_0=1$. $X_{max}=2^1-(2^1-1)=2-1=1$. This is incorrect. $2^1-(2^1-1)+1 = 2$.\n$X_{max}=2^1-(2^1-1)=2-1=1$. This is for $X$ to be smaller than $2^1-1=1$ team. $X < O_1$. So $X=1, O_1=2$ works.\nThe formula $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1)$ implies $X$ is smaller than $2^{N_0}-1$ teams.\nThe maximum $X$ can be is $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1)$.\nIf $s=\"0\"$, $N_0=1$. $X_{max}=2^1 - (2^1-1) = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nThe smallest $N_0$ teams $X$ must be smaller than are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-(2^{N_0}-1)+1$.\nIf $X$ must be smaller than $2^{N_0}-1$ teams, then $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1)$.
