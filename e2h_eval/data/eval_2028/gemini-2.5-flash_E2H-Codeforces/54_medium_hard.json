Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, so here's my approach to this regular polygon problem.** I'm given an *n*-gon and a target angle *a*.  My goal is to find three distinct vertices that form an angle as close to *a* as possible.\n\nFirst, I know that all vertices of a regular *n*-gon lie on a circumcircle.  Angles formed by three vertices are *inscribed angles* in this circle.  The key insight is that an inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.\n\nLet's say one vertex, `v2`, is the vertex of the angle we're trying to form. I'm going to fix `v2` as vertex 1, because the solution should work no matter which vertex I choose as my central point.  Then, I need to find two other vertices, `v1` and `v3`, that form an angle with `v2`.\n\nIn a regular *n*-gon, the central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 360/*n* degrees.  The angle I'm looking for intercepts an arc. I realize the number of \"steps\" or edges between `v1` and `v3` on the arc *not* containing `v2` determines the inscribed angle.  Each \"step\" corresponds to a central angle of 360/*n*, and the inscribed angle is half of that.  So, the angle is equal to `steps * (180/n)`.  The key is to figure out the possible values for `steps`.\n\nNow, fixing `v2` as vertex 1, `v1` and `v3` have to be other distinct vertices. `v1` and `v3` can range from 2 to *n*. Let the number of \"steps\" or edges be `k`. I determine `k` by considering the difference in indices. If the vertices are numbered sequentially, I can calculate the angle as `k * (180/n)` where `k` can take integer values from 1 to *n*-2.  If I choose `v1` as vertex 2, and `v3` as `2 + best_k`, where `best_k` will be determined later, all the values are valid and distinct.  This makes the calculation easier and the logic simpler to trace.\n\nMy strategy is as follows: given the input *n* and *a*, I'll figure out what integer value `k` to choose.\n\n*   Calculate the base angle of each step: `180 / n`.\n*   Calculate a 'target' `k` using `a / (180 / n)`. This represents an ideal number of steps to make the angle *a*.\n*   Consider the integers surrounding this target: `floor(k)` and `ceil(k)`. These are my candidate values for the optimal number of steps. There's no need to find the `floor` and `ceil`, because that range is covered by integer candidates and boundary handling.\n*   The actual valid values of `k` will range from 1 to *n*-2.  Check for each candidate and keep the ones that are valid, using this range.\n*   Iterate through all these candidate `k` values from 1 up to *n*-2.\n*   For each `k` value, calculate `k * (180/n)` (the angle I'm forming)\n*   Calculate the absolute difference between this calculated angle and the target angle *a*.\n*   Track the `k` that minimizes the absolute difference.\n*   Let `v2 = 1` and `v1 = 2`. The correct `v3` is then `2 + best_k`.\n\nI can print the solution as `2 1 (2 + best_k)`.  I can choose another solution if the differences are equal, since the question states multiple answers are valid.  \n\nLet's test this with a triangle (*n*=3). The only valid angles should be `1 * (180/3) = 60`. Let's test this strategy with a square (*n*=4). My strategy should get me 45, 90, and all possible angles. My method ensures that all valid angles are within the range and boundary cases are handled correctly.\n\nGiven `n`, `a`, I know I'm looking for `k` in range `[1, n-2]` which gives the closest value `k * 180 /n` compared to `a`.  There is no need to worry about floating-point precision issues with standard float implementation.\n\nThis approach gives me a clean, efficient `O(n)` solution, and the logic is easy to trace, even with",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon:**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angle:** Any angle formed by three vertices of a polygon, with its vertex on the circumcircle (which is the case for a regular polygon), is an inscribed angle.\n2.  **Intercepted Arc:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n3.  **Central Angle per Edge:** In a regular `n`-gon, all vertices lie on a circumcircle. The angle subtended at the center of the circumcircle by each side (or the arc between adjacent vertices) is `360/n` degrees. This is the \"unit\" arc measure.\n4.  **Possible Angle Values:** If an angle `v1-v2-v3` intercepts an arc spanning `k` \"steps\" (i.e., `k` edges of the polygon), then the central angle for this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees. The inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` will therefore be `(k * (360/n)) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Range of `k`:**\n\nThe number of steps `k` must be an integer.\n*   The smallest possible angle occurs when `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2` (e.g., `v1=v2-1`, `v3=v2+1`). In this case, the intercepted arc spans 1 step. So, `k` minimum is 1.\n*   The largest possible angle occurs when `v1` and `v3` are separated by the maximum number of edges without including `v2`. If we fix `v2` and choose `v1` and `v3` from the remaining `n-1` vertices, the maximum number of steps between `v1` and `v3` (along the arc not containing `v2`) is `n-2`. For example, if `v2` is vertex 1, `v1` is vertex 2, and `v3` is vertex `n`, the arc from 2 to `n` (clockwise, not passing 1) spans `n-2` edges. So, `k` maximum is `n-2`.\nTherefore, `k` can be any integer from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`:**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `base_angle_per_step = 180.0 / n`. We are looking for `k` such that `k * base_angle_per_step` is closest to `a`.\nThis means `k` should be close to `a / base_angle_per_step`. Let `ideal_k_float = a / base_angle_per_step`.\nThe optimal integer `k` will typically be one of `floor(ideal_k_float)` or `ceil(ideal_k_float)`. We should check both these integer values, ensuring they fall within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\n**Algorithm to find `best_k`:**\n\n1.  Calculate `base_angle_per_step = 180.0 / n`.\n2.  Calculate `ideal_k_float = a / base_angle_per_step`.\n3.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n4.  Consider two candidate integer values for `k`: `k_cand1 = int(ideal_k_float)` (floor) and `k_cand2 = k_cand1 + 1` (ceil).\n5.  For each `k` in `[k_cand1, k_cand2]`:\n    *   Check if `1 <= k <= n-2`. This ensures `k` is within the valid range.\n    *   If valid, calculate `current_angle = k * base_angle_per_step`.\n    *   Calculate the absolute difference `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   If `diff < min_diff`, update `min_diff = diff` and `best_k = k`. (If `diff` is equal, any choice is fine as per problem statement).\n\n**Constructing `v1, v2, v3`:**\n\nOnce `best_k` is found, we need to pick three distinct vertices.\nA simple and consistent way to do this is:\n*   Let `v2 = 1`.\n*   Let `v1 = 2`.\n*   Let `v3 = 2 + best_k`.\n\nWith these choices:\n*   `v2` is vertex 1.\n*   `v1` is vertex 2.\n*   `v3` is vertex `2 + best_k`.\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` is `2-1-(2+best_k)`.\nThe intercepted arc is from `v1=2` to `v3=(2+best_k)` (clockwise, not containing `v2=1`).\nThe number of steps along this arc is `(2 + best_k) - 2 = best_k`.\nAll three vertices `1, 2, (2+best_k)` are distinct: `v2=1`, `v1=2`, and since `best_k >= 1`, `v3 >= 3`.\nAlso, `v3` will not exceed `n`: `best_k <= n-2`, so `v3 = 2 + best_k <= 2 + (n-2) = n`.\nThus, `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k` forms a valid set of distinct vertices for the angle.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=68):**\n\n1.  `n=4, a=68`.\n2.  `base_angle_per_step = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3.  `ideal_k_float = 68 / 45.0 = 1.511...`.\n4.  `k_cand1 = int(1.511...) = 1`.\n5.  `k_cand2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n6.  `min_diff = float('inf')`, `best_k = -1`.\n\n    *   **For `k=1`:**\n        *   `1 <= 1 <= 4-2=2`. Valid.\n        *   `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n        *   `diff = abs(45.0 - 68) = 23.0`.\n        *   `min_diff = 23.0`, `best_k = 1`.\n\n    *   **For `k=2`:**\n        *   `1 <= 2 <= 4-2=2`. Valid.\n        *   `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n        *   `diff = abs(90.0 - 68) = 22.0`.\n        *   `22.0 < 23.0`. Update `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 2`.\n\n7.  Final `best_k = 2`.\n8.  Output vertices: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k = 2+2=4`. So, `2 1 4`. (The example output `4 1 2` is equivalent, as `v1` and `v3` can be swapped).\n\nThis approach is efficient (`O(1)` after initial setup, as it only checks a constant number of `k` values) and handles all constraints and edge cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # The angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex\n    # is an inscribed angle.
