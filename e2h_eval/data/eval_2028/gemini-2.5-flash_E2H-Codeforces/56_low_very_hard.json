Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First thing's first: this is a matching problem.  We have rebels (R) and bases (B), and we need to pair them up. A key observation is that for a solution to even exist, *R must equal B*.  If they're not equal, it's an immediate \"No\". So, assuming `R = B = N`, we move forward.\n\nThe core constraint, the geometric element, is that the paths between each rebel-base pair must *not intersect*. We need to find assignments that avoid these crossings.  The \"easy\" tag is telling me to think about brute-force or something that, while maybe not the most elegant, will still execute quickly enough for the small input size, given that the maximum number of ships and bases is just 10.\n\nThinking about intersection: if two line segments cross, they're definitely not following a non-intersecting path.  The problem statement's guarantee of \"no three points on the same line\" is important. It means we don't have to worry about the complications of dealing with segments that overlap or share segments.\n\nOkay, non-crossing matching is a classic structure. We have two sets of points, rebels and bases, in a 2D plane. Since the points are small, an exponential solution (permutations, backtracking) could be viable. But how do we *efficiently* check for crossings?  Sorting!  We often sort points by their x-coordinates or angles to make geometric computations manageable.\n\nIf we sort based on x-coordinate, however, it's not immediately clear how that directly gives us a non-crossing path. The segments can \"cross over\" without having an easy way to eliminate or check for them.\n\nThe key insight is about *separation*. Two segments cross if and only if the endpoints of the first are separated by the second, and vice-versa.  We need to look for a method to calculate that efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a perfect matching exists between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two paths (straight line segments) from a spaceship to its assigned base intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching requires an equal number of spaceships and bases. If `R != B`, it's impossible, so we output \"No\".\n\nAssuming `R = B = N`, this problem can be solved using backtracking (or recursion with memoization, which is effectively dynamic programming, or a min-cost max-flow approach for larger `N`). Given `N <= 10`, a simple backtracking approach will be efficient enough.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Check `R == B`:** If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n2.  **Data Structures:** Store Rebel spaceship coordinates in a list `rebels` and base coordinates in a list `bases`.\n3.  **Backtracking Function:**\n    *   `solve(k, matched_bases)`: This function attempts to assign a base to the `k`-th Rebel spaceship.\n        *   `k`: The index of the current Rebel spaceship we are trying to assign (from `0` to `N-1`).\n        *   `matched_bases`: A set of indices of bases that have already been assigned to Rebels `0` through `k-1`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k == N`, it means all `N` Rebel spaceships have been successfully assigned to `N` distinct bases without any intersections. Return `True`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For each base `j` from `0` to `N-1`:\n        *   If base `j` has already been `matched_bases`, skip it.\n        *   **Check for Intersections:** For every previously made assignment `(rebel_idx, base_idx)` (where `rebel_idx < k` and `base_idx` is in `matched_bases` and corresponds to `rebel_idx`), check if the segment `(rebels[k], bases[j])` intersects with `(rebels[rebel_idx], bases[base_idx])`.\n            *   If an intersection is found, this assignment `(rebels[k], bases[j])` is invalid. Break and try the next base `j`.\n        *   If no intersections were found with previous assignments:\n            *   Add `j` to `matched_bases`.\n            *   Store the current assignment: `current_matching[k] = j`. (This is needed to reconstruct segments for future intersection checks).\n            *   Recursively call `solve(k + 1, matched_bases)`.\n            *   If the recursive call returns `True`, it means a valid matching was found. Return `True` immediately.\n            *   **Backtrack:** If the recursive call returns `False`, this path didn't lead to a solution. Remove `j` from `matched_bases` and clear `current_matching[k]` to explore other options.\n    *   If all bases have been tried for Rebel `k` and none led to a solution, return `False`.\n\n4.  **Intersection Check Function `segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)`:**\n    *   This function determines if two line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect.\n    *   It uses the concept of orientation (cross product) to check if points lie on opposite sides of a line.\n    *   `orientation(p, q, r)`: Returns 0 if `p, q, r` are collinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise.\n        *   Calculated as `(q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])`.\n    *   `on_segment(p, q, r)`: Returns `True` if point `q` lies on segment `pr`. (Only needed for collinear cases, which are guaranteed not to happen for three points, but two points can be collinear with an endpoint of another segment).\n    *   Two segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if:\n        *   `o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)`\n        *   `o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)`\n        *   `o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)`\n        *   `o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)`\n        *   They intersect if `o1 != o2` and `o3 != o4`. This covers the general case where segments cross.\n        *   The problem statement guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", which simplifies things by removing tricky collinear cases where segments might share an endpoint or overlap. Thus, we only need to check for the general crossing case.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   `current_matching`: A list where `current_matching[i]` stores the index of the base assigned to `rebels[i]`. Initialize with `-1` or `None`.\n*   The `matched_bases` set tracks which bases are already taken.\n*   The `rebels` and `bases` lists store the `(x, y)` coordinates.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n\nRebels: `R0=(0,0), R1=(2,0), R2=(3,1)`\nBases: `B0=(-2,1), B1=(0,3), B2=(2,2)`\n\n`solve(0, {})`\n  Try `R0` with `B0`: `current_matching = [0, -1, -1]`. `matched_bases = {0}`.\n    `solve(1, {0})`\n      Try `R1` with `B1`: `current_matching = [0, 1, -1]`. `matched_bases = {0, 1}`.\n        Check `(R1, B1)` vs `(R0, B0)`: `((2,0), (0,3))` vs `((0,0), (-2,1))`. These do not intersect.\n        `solve(2, {0, 1})`\n          Try `R2` with `B2`: `current_matching = [0, 1, 2]`. `matched_bases = {0, 1, 2}`.\n            Check `(R2, B2)` vs `(R0, B0)`: `((3,1), (2,2))` vs `((0,0), (-2,1))`.
