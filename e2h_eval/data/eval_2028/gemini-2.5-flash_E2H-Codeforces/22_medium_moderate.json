After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Marks Problem - Python Script Development**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with writing a Python script to solve the \"Marks\" problem.  Let's break this down. The core is determining which students are \"successful,\" meaning they're the best at at least one subject.  The input format is straightforward: number of students (n), number of subjects (m), and then the marks for each student. I need to output the count of successful students.  The marks are single digits from 1 to 9, given as characters.  No problem.\n\nMy initial approach will be to read the input into a `gradebook` data structure.  Since the marks are characters, a list of strings will be efficient, with `gradebook[i]` being the marks for student `i`. Then, I'll iterate through the subjects to identify the maximum mark for each.  I'll store these maximums in a `max_marks_per_subject` list. For that step, I'll need to remember to initialize this list with some value smaller than any possible mark (like '0'), to make comparisons work correctly.\n\nOnce I have the maximums, I'll iterate through the students and subjects again. If a student's mark for a subject matches the maximum for that subject, they're successful. I'll use a `successful_students` set to store the student indices. A set will ensure I don't double-count students if they're best in multiple subjects.  As soon as a student is found to be best in *any* subject, I can break out of the inner subject loop for that student. That seems like an optimization. The count of successful students will be simply the size of that set.\n\nData structures look to be fine: a list of strings for the gradebook, a list of characters for `max_marks_per_subject`, and a set for successful students. The character comparisons will work directly since we're dealing with single digits, avoiding the need for int conversion. The Time and space complexity are both O(N*M), where N is number of students, M is number of subjects. Given that `N, M <= 100`, this should be sufficiently fast and efficient.\n\nI'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for input, it is faster input.  I need to remember to strip the newline characters. I'll then implement this solution, including the double loop that finds the maximum value for each column.\nI'll also include comments on each of the blocks of code that I have written to make it easier to follow. I will then test the script with some sample test cases, including edge cases like a single student or all students getting the same mark.  Finally, I will submit the solution.\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    gradebook = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        gradebook.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    max_marks_per_subject = ['0'] * m\n\n    for j in range(m):\n        current_max = '0'\n        for i in range(n):\n            if gradebook[i][j] > current_max:\n                current_max = gradebook[i][j]\n        max_marks_per_subject[j] = current_max\n\n    successful_students = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks_per_subject[j]:\n                successful_students.add(i)\n                break\n\n    print(len(successful_students))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\n",
