The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution**\n\nI've been asked to tackle the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" competitive programming problem.  It involves optimizing Xenia's travel time around a ring road with 'n' houses and 'm' tasks. The goal is to minimize the total time needed for Xenia to complete all tasks in sequence, starting from house 1.\n\nI start by understanding the setup: we have `n` houses, `m` tasks specified by house numbers (`a_i`), and movement is only clockwise. I then need to formulate the time calculation for each house transition. This involves determining the shortest distance between houses, considering the circular nature of the road and the constraint on clockwise movement. I figured that using the modulo operation would get overly complex in the simple case, and it's simpler to directly compute based on whether the target house is greater than or less than the current house.\n\nThe crux of my solution lies in tracking Xenia's position (`current_house`) and the accumulated travel time (`total_time`). For each task `a_i`, I calculate the time needed to move from `current_house` to `a_i` and add it to `total_time`. Then, I update `current_house` to `a_i`. The time calculation varies depending on whether the target house is ahead or behind Xenia's current location, taking into account the ring's circular nature.\n\nI've tested the logic thoroughly, checking with different examples. I walk through each test case manually, and then verify the total time is correctly computed for each one. The logic works well for all the test cases. Finally, I've considered the input constraints (n and m up to 10^5) and ensured my solution's time complexity, which is O(m), is efficient enough. No overflow issues should arise with large integers in Python, so I will not need a larger integer data type.\n\nI'm confident this will efficiently solve the problem. I've considered the input/output and Python's string splitting and mapping for input, and I'm ready to submit my code.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current_house = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for target_house in a:\n        if target_house >= current_house:\n            time_taken = target_house - current_house\n        else:\n            time_taken = (n - current_house) + target_house\n        total_time += time_taken\n        current_house = target_house\n    print(total_time)\nsolve()\n```\n",
