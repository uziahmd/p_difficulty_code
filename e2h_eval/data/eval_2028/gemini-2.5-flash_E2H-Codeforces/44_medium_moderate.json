He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Python Solution for Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and I think I've got a solid Python solution brewing. The problem essentially boils down to dividing a list of problem difficulties into a fixed number of contiguous \"days\" and maximizing the total profit, where each day's profit is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved on that day. My initial thought process involves breaking it down: I need to figure out the best way to split the problems into segments (days), calculate the \"profit\" of each segment (the maximum difficulty within it), and then find the combination that yields the highest total profit.  It's clear that to get a high total profit, I want to make sure the maximum difficulty on each day is as large as possible.\n\nTo do this, my intuition tells me I should focus on the largest difficulties in the list. I am thinking of selecting k problems where k is the number of days, so these values will be the daily maximums. Specifically, I'm going to grab the `k` largest values, ensuring that each of these \"peak\" problems becomes the daily maximum. I realized that the best profit should be achieved by assigning these largest difficulties to separate days.  It became clear that I need to find the `k` largest values in the array, sort them, and make them the maximums on each day.\n\nSo, I'm going to sort the problem difficulties in descending order and identify the `k` largest ones. These values will give me the maximum possible total profit. Then the challenge becomes partitioning the problems into `k` segments that place these largest values as the daily maximums.  I realized that it's easy: if I sort the *indices* of these largest values, I know the points where the days must \"end\".  I'll place those split points between them and ensure each of those k largest elements is indeed the maximum in their block. This approach provides a clear path to maximizing the total profit.\n\nThe implementation comes down to a few straightforward steps: first, I'll find those `k` largest difficulties and store them with their original positions (indices). Then, I'll calculate the maximum possible profit by summing these largest values. Next, I will sort the indices of these values. Finally, I'll use those sorted indices as the split points for my \"days,\" and the day lengths will be determined by the differences between these indices. The algorithm correctly finds the optimal segment boundaries.\n\nBy dividing the problems around these indices and calculating the sum of the maximums, I'll have the maximum profit and the number of problems solved each day, which is the final answer. This methodology covers edge cases (like when `k` is 1 or `n`), and the time complexity should be efficient. I have created a Python code to find a solution with maximum profit and day-wise segments for the given problem set.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given their difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments (representing `k` days of practice). For each day, the profit is the maximum difficulty among the problems solved on that day. We need to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Core Idea:**\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily profits, we should aim for each day's profit to be as high as possible. Each day's profit is a value `a_i` from the original list. If we pick `k` problems `a_{p_1}, a_{p_2}, \\dots, a_{p_k}` such that these are the `k` largest values in the entire list `a`, and we can ensure that each `a_{p_j}` is the maximum in its respective day's segment, then their sum `a_{p_1} + \\dots + a_{p_k}` will be the maximum possible total profit. This is because any other choice of `k` problems for daily maximums would result in a sum less than or equal to the sum of the `k` largest values.\n\nIt turns out this strategy is always achievable. If we select the `k` largest values from the array `a`, say `M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k`, and find their original indices `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k`, we can always partition the problems such that each `M_j` is the maximum in one of the `k` segments. Specifically, if we sort these indices `idx_j` in ascending order, say `p_0 < p_1 < \\dots < p_{k-1}`, we can use these as \"split points\".\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Find the `k` largest values and their original indices:**\n    *   Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)` for all problems. For example, `[(a_0, 0), (a_1, 1), \\dots, (a_{n-1}, n-1)]`.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on the `value`.\n    *   Take the first `k` elements from this sorted list. These are the `k` problems with the highest difficulties.\n    *   Calculate the sum of their difficulties. This sum is the maximum possible total profit.\n    *   Collect their original indices into a separate list.\n\n2.  **Determine the segment lengths:**\n    *   Sort the collected `k` original indices in ascending order: `p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{k-1}`. These indices mark the positions of the chosen `k` problems in the original list.\n    *   We need to make `k-1` cuts to divide the `n` problems into `k` segments. A simple way to ensure each `p_j` is in its own segment and is the maximum is to make cuts *after* `p_0`, *after* `p_1`, ..., *after* `p_{k-2}`.\n    *   The segments would be:\n        *   Day 1: problems from index `0` to `p_0`. Length: `p_0 + 1`.\n        *   Day 2: problems from index `p_0 + 1` to `p_1`. Length: `p_1 - p_0`.\n        *   ...\n        *   Day `j` (for `1 < j \\le k-1`): problems from `p_{j-2} + 1` to `p_{j-1}`. Length: `p_{j-1} - p_{j-2}`.\n        *   Day `k`: problems from index `p_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. Length: `n - (p_{k-1} + 1)`.\n\n    Let's refine the length calculation using a `current_start_index`:\n    Initialize `current_start_index = 0`.\n    For `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        The `(i+1)`-th day will solve problems from `current_start_index` up to `p_i`.\n        Length: `p_i - current_start_index + 1`. Add this to `day_lengths`.\n        Update `current_start_index = p_i + 1`.\n    After the loop, the `k`-th day will solve problems from `current_start_index` up to `n-1`.\n    Length: `n - current_start_index`. Add this to `day_lengths`.\n\n3.  **Output:**\n    *   Print the maximum total profit.\n    *   Print the calculated `k` day lengths, separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Pairs `(value, index)`:**\n    `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n    **Sorted by value (descending):**\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n    **Top `k=3` elements:** `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n    **Maximum profit:** `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n    **Chosen indices:** `[6, 3, 0]`\n\n2.  **Sorted chosen indices:** `p = [0, 3, 6]`\n\n3.  **Calculate lengths:**\n    `day_lengths = []`\n    `current_start_index = 0`\n\n    *   `i = 0` (for `p_0 = 0`):\n        Length for Day 1: `p_0 - current_start_index + 1 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\n        `day_lengths = [1]`.\n        `current_start_index = p_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   `i = 1` (for `p_1 = 3`):\n        Length for Day 2: `p_1 - current_start_index + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.\n        `day_lengths = [1, 3]`.\n        `current_start_index = p_1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n    *   Loop ends (since `k-1 = 2`, `i` goes up to `1`).\n    *   Last day (Day 3):\n        Length: `n - current_start_index = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n        `day_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    `20`\n    `1 3 4`\n\nThis is a valid solution. The example output provided `3 2 3`, which also sums to 20. The problem states that any valid answer is acceptable.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time Complexity: `O(N log N)` due to sorting the `N` problems. Extracting and sorting `K` indices takes `O(K log K)`. Calculating lengths takes `O(K)`. Since `K \\le N`, the dominant factor is `O(N log N)`.\n*   Space Complexity: `O(N)` for storing the `(value, index)` pairs.\n\nGiven `N \\le 2000`, `N log N` is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create pairs of (value, original_index)\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort in descending order of value\n    # Python's sort is stable, so if values are equal, original order is preserved.\n    # This doesn't strictly matter for correctness, but it's good practice.\n    indexed_a.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Take the top k elements and sum their values for max profit\n    max_profit = 0\n    chosen_indices = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        max_profit += indexed_a[i][0]\n        chosen_indices.append(indexed_a[i][1])\n\n    # Step 4: Sort the chosen indices in ascending order\n    # These indices will define the split points for days\n    chosen_indices.sort()\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the lengths of problems for each day\n    day_lengths = []\n    current_start_idx = 0\n    \n    # The first k-1 days will end at chosen_indices[0], ..., chosen_indices[k-2]\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The (i+1)-th day covers problems from current_start_idx to chosen_indices[i]\n        length = chosen_indices[i] - current_start_idx + 1\n        day_lengths.append(length)\n        # The next day starts right after this one ends\n        current_start_idx = chosen_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last (k-th) day covers all remaining problems\n    # from current_start_idx to n-1\n    last_day_length = n - current_start_idx\n    day_lengths.append(last_day_length)\n\n    # Output\n    print(max_profit)\n    print(*(day_lengths))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
