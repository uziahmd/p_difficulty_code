Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the longest substring that repeats at least twice within a given string.  It's all lowercase Latin letters, and the string's length is nicely constrained between 1 and 100, which suggests a brute-force approach will be perfectly acceptable.\n\nMy initial thinking is to go through all possible substring lengths, from 1 up to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the string. A substring of length `n` can only appear once in a string of length `n`. Then, for each of these lengths, I'll need to check all the substrings of that length within the input string.  For each substring, I'll count how many times it pops up.  The maximum length of any substring that meets the \"appears at least twice\" criteria will be my final answer. I'll need a variable, `max_len`, to keep track of the maximum length found so far.\n\nNow, let's refine this a bit. I realize I can be more efficient. Since I want the *longest* substring, I can start by checking the longest possible substring (`n-1`) and work my way down.  If I find a substring of length `L` that repeats, I can immediately return `L` because I know I won't find anything longer.\n\nMy refined approach is this:  I'll start with the maximum possible length, `L = n-1`, and decrement it down to 1. For each `L`, I'll iterate through all possible starting positions `i` for a substring of that length, from `0` up to `n-L`.  For each starting position `i`, I'll extract the substring `s[i:i+L]`. Then, I'll check if this substring appears again anywhere else in the string. I'll iterate a second position index `j` from `0` to `n-L`, making sure `j` isn't equal to `i`.  If I find a match, `s[j:j+L] == s[i:i+L]`, I can return `L`.\n\nIf I get through all these loops without finding a repeating substring for any length, the answer must be 0.\n\nLet me test this with the example, `s = \"ababa\"`. For `L=4`, I would check `\"abab\"`.  No other occurrences. For `L=3`, I would look for `\"aba\"`. It shows up again! Thus the length should be 3.\n",
