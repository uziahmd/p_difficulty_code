Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Disjoint Voucher Problem**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations add up to exactly *x* while minimizing the total cost. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nFirst, I identified the key constraints: we need two separate vouchers, they cannot intersect, their durations must sum to *x*, and we have to keep the cost minimal. The input sizes seemed manageable enough that an O(N log N) or O(N) solution should be possible, as brute-force O(N^2) would be too slow.\n\nMy initial approach involved fixing one voucher and then trying to find a suitable second one, considering duration and non-intersection. Sorting seemed like a promising strategy, either by start or end dates. I realized that a sweep-line approach combined with a duration-based lookup might work well.\n\nThe core idea is to use a sweep-line technique where we iterate through the days. For each day, we process vouchers that either end or start on that day. A key data structure, `min_cost_for_duration_so_far`, is the heart of the solution. It stores, for each possible voucher duration, the minimum cost of a voucher that has *already ended*.\n\nWe process vouchers by their end dates, updating `min_cost_for_duration_so_far` for each duration. When we encounter a voucher that starts on the current day, we search in the `min_cost_for_duration_so_far` for another voucher with the required duration whose minimum cost will give us the minimal total cost.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is in the `min_cost_for_duration_so_far` array, which ensures the cost we choose is valid for vouchers that end before the start time. This approach maintains the non-intersection condition and efficiently checks if there's a duration with valid cost.\n\nBy sorting vouchers by end day and processing them in the correct order, we ensure the cost data structure contains the *minimal* cost for each valid voucher duration when checking a voucher to make sure its disjoint. Finally, the total complexity should be linear in both the number of vouchers and the maximum value of the duration.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers, `i` and `j`, such that they do not intersect, the sum of their durations is exactly `x`, and their total cost (`cost_i + cost_j`) is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's define the duration of a voucher `k` as `duration_k = r_k - l_k + 1`.\nThe conditions are:\n1.  `i ≠ j` (implicitly handled by the non-intersection and duration sum, as a single voucher cannot satisfy `duration_k + duration_k = x` and `r_k < l_k` simultaneously).\n2.  **Non-intersection**: `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`. This means one voucher must end strictly before the other begins.\n3.  **Duration sum**: `duration_i + duration_j = x`.\n4.  **Minimal total cost**: Minimize `cost_i + cost_j`.\n\nGiven the constraints (`N, X, L_i, R_i <= 2 * 10^5`), an `O(N^2)` solution is too slow. We need something closer to `O(N log N)` or `O(N + max_coordinate)`.\n\nWe can solve this using a sweep-line algorithm. Let `MAX_COORD` be the maximum possible value for `r_i` (which is `2 * 10^5`). We will iterate through the days from 1 to `MAX_COORD + 1`.\n\nWe need to efficiently find a voucher `v_i` that ends before a given day `D` and has a specific duration `d_target` with minimum cost.\nWe also need to efficiently process vouchers that start on a given day `D`.\n\nLet's use two lists of lists to store vouchers, grouped by their start and end days:\n*   `vouchers_by_start_day[day]`: A list of `(r, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that start on `day`.\n*   `vouchers_by_end_day[day]`: A list of `(l, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that end on `day`.\n\nWe also need an array `min_cost_for_duration_so_far` of size `MAX_COORD + 1`. `min_cost_for_duration_so_far[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended* (i.e., its `r` value is less than the current sweep-line `day`). Initialize all entries to `infinity`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize `min_total_cost = infinity`.\n2.  Initialize `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day` as lists of empty lists, each of size `MAX_COORD + 1`.\n3.  Initialize `min_cost_for_duration_so_far` as a list of `infinity` values, also of size `MAX_COORD + 1`.\n4.  Read all `n` vouchers. For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n    *   Calculate its duration `d = r - l + 1`.\n    *   Add `(r, cost, d)` to `vouchers_by_start_day[l]`.\n    *   Add `(l, cost, d)` to `vouchers_by_end_day[r]`.\n\n5.  Iterate `day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD + 1`:\n    a.  **Update `min_cost_for_duration_so_far`**: For every voucher `v_k = (l_k, cost_k, duration_k)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[day-1]` (i.e., vouchers that ended on the previous day `day-1`):\n        *   Update `min_cost_for_duration_so_far[duration_k] = min(min_cost_for_duration_so_far[duration_k], cost_k)`.\n        This ensures that `min_cost_for_duration_so_far[d]` always holds the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has `r < day`.\n\n    b.  **Find potential pairs**: For every voucher `v_i = (r_i, cost_i, duration_i)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[day]` (i.e., vouchers that start on the current `day`):\n        *   Calculate the required duration for the second voucher: `d_target = x - duration_i`.\n        *   If `d_target > 0` (duration must be positive):\n            *   Check `min_cost_for_duration_so_far[d_target]`. If it's not `infinity`, it means there exists at least one voucher `v_j` with duration `d_target` that ended before `day`. Since `v_i` starts on `day`, this satisfies the non-intersection condition `r_j < l_i` (where `l_i = day`).\n            *   Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_i + min_cost_for_duration_so_far[d_target])`.\n\n6.  After the loop, if `min_total_cost` is still `infinity`, it means no valid pair was found. Print -1. Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n=4, x=5`\nVouchers: `(1,3,4)`, `(1,2,5)`, `(5,6,1)`, `(1,2,4)`\n`MAX_COORD = 6`\n\nInitial: `min_total_cost = inf`, `min_cost_for_duration_so_far = [inf, inf, ..., inf]` (size 7 for durations 0-6)\n\n**Building `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`:**\n`vouchers_by_start_day[1] = [(3,4,3), (2,5,2), (2,4,2)]`\n`vouchers_by_start_day[5] = [(6,1,2)]`\n`vouchers_by_end_day[2] = [(1,5,2), (1,4,2)]`\n`vouchers_by_end_day[3] = [(1,4,3)]`\n`vouchers_by_end_day[6] = [(5,1,2)]`\n\n**Sweep-line `day` from 1 to 7:**\n\n*   **day = 1**:\n    *   `vouchers_by_end_day[0]` is empty. `min_cost_for_duration_so_far` unchanged.\n    *   `vouchers_by_start_day[1]`:\n        *   `(r=3, cost=4, dur=3)`: `d_target = 5-3=2`. `min_cost_for_duration_so_far[2]` is `inf`.
