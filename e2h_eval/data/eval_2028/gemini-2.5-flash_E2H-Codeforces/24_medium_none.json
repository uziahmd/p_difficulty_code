She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Browser Problem: A Journey of Tab Management**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to tackle this competitive programming problem involving browser tabs. Let's break this down. We have `n` tabs, the current cursor position `pos`, and a target range `[l, r]` that needs to be preserved. Any tabs *outside* this range need to go. We can move the cursor left or right, or close tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each action costs one second. The goal is to minimize the total time.\n\nFirst, let's consider the simplest scenario: if the target range *is* the entire range of tabs (`l == 1` and `r == n`), we're done; the cost is zero.\n\nNext, I need to look at scenarios where only one side of the target range needs closure. If only tabs to the *left* need closing (`l > 1` and `r == n`), I need to move the cursor to `l` and close left.  Similarly, if only the *right* needs closing (`l == 1` and `r < n`), I'll go to `r` and close right. In both those cases, the calculation is straight-forward: the time is the distance to the closing location plus one for the close itself.\n\nNow comes the tricky part: when tabs need to be closed on *both* sides (`l > 1` and `r < n`).  I've identified two main strategies here. Strategy A is to move to `l`, close the left, move to `r`, close the right. Strategy B is to move to `r`, close the right, then move to `l` and close the left. In both of those cases, I have to compute the cost of moving, plus the 1 second cost to close each section. The key here is realizing that the move between `l` and `r` is just the absolute difference between them, because `l` is always less than or equal to `r`. I'm using the `min()` function to choose the optimal path.\n\nLet's make sure that's all covered. `n, pos, l, r` come in. Cover the simple scenario. Then the scenario where it's all on the left, only on the right. Finally, both left and right must be closed. And I'm getting the minimum for the case where both sides must be closed, the minimum from the two strategies. The whole thing seems sound, logically. I'll test it out with some examples to be sure. It feels right. I'm ready to code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We are given `n` (total tabs), `pos` (initial cursor position), `l` (leftmost tab to keep), and `r` (rightmost tab to keep). Each operation (moving the cursor one step left/right, or closing all tabs to the left/right of the cursor) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:**\n    If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, it means the desired segment `[l, r]` already includes all tabs. No operations are needed.\n    Cost: `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs when `l > 1` but `r = n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must move to tab `l`, and then the \"close left\" operation must be performed.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs when `r < n` but `l = 1`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must move to tab `r`, and then the \"close right\" operation must be performed.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Both tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs when `l > 1` and `r < n`. The cursor must visit both `l` (to close tabs `[1, l-1]`) and `r` (to close tabs `[r+1, n]`). There are two main strategies:\n\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n        1.  Move cursor from initial `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. (After this, the minimum unclosed tab index `a` becomes `l`).\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. (After this, the maximum unclosed tab index `b` becomes `r`).\n        Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n        1.  Move cursor from initial `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. (After this, the maximum unclosed tab index `b` becomes `r`).\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. (After this, the minimum unclosed tab index `a` becomes `l`).\n        Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n    The minimum time for this case is `min(cost_strategy_A, cost_strategy_B)`.\n\nThe provided Python code implements these conditions directly to calculate the minimum time.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, pos, l, r from standard input\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: The target segment [l, r] already covers all tabs [1, n].\n    # No tabs need to be closed.\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of 'l' need to be closed.\n    # This means r is already n (no tabs to close on the right).\n    # We need to close tabs [1, l-1].\n    if l > 1 and r == n:\n        # Time to move cursor from pos to l: abs(pos - l)\n        # Time to close tabs [1, l-1]: 1\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(cost)\n        return\n\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed.\n    # This means l is already 1 (no tabs to close on the left).\n    # We need to close tabs [r+1, n].\n    if l == 1 and r < n:\n        # Time to move cursor from pos to r: abs(pos - r)\n        # Time to close tabs [r+1, n]: 1\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(cost)\n        return\n\n    # Case 4: Both tabs to the left of 'l' AND to the right of 'r' need to be closed.\n    # This implies l > 1 and r < n.\n    # We compare two strategies:\n    \n    # Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.\n    # 1.
