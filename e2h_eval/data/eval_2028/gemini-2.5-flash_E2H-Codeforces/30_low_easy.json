Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core is about optimizing the sum of two numbers, `S1` and `S2`, built from digits of a given number `A`.  There are two players, Homer and Marge, and the goal is to find the sequence of moves (H or M) that maximizes `S1 + S2`.\n\nI see that `n` dictates the number of moves per player, so a total of `2n` moves. Each move takes the leftmost digit of `A`. The placement of each digit directly impacts its value in the final sum.\n\nThe constraints, `1 <= n <= 18`, make me think I need an efficient solution, likely involving some kind of search.  The example provided, with `n=2` and `A=\"1234\"`, illustrates how different move sequences result in different sums. I tried a few permutations, and it seems like picking the largest digits earlier might be a good heuristic, but I'll need to explore this more rigorously. `HHMM` and `MMHH` both maximize the sum in the example.\n\nMy initial thought is to develop a Python script. I will likely need a recursive function to explore possible move combinations, which I could optimize further with Dynamic Programming. I will need to devise an efficient way to represent the intermediate numbers, and probably use a string to store the final move sequence. I will need to ensure to convert the final strings of digits into integer equivalents.\n\nThe key observation is that digit position is crucial. The larger the digits and the earlier they are appended to a player's number, the greater the number they form. I need to think if there's an optimal strategy based on digit values. Let's get to coding!\n",
