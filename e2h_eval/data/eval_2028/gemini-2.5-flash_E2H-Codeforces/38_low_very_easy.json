    "thought": "**Understanding the Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this competitive programming problem and I need to figure out the most efficient way to solve it. It's asking for two things: first, the absolute minimum number of nodes (`n`) needed to construct a special kind of directed graph, a \"p-reachable graph,\" and second, the *maximum* number of unidirectional pairs possible *given* that minimum `n`.\n\nLet's break down the definitions. A \"unidirectional pair\" means there's a path from `u` to `v`, but crucially, *no* path from `v` back to `u`. A \"p-reachable graph\" is where we have exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is less than `v`, *and* `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. That mutual reachability is key.\n\nNow, my initial thought is, well, reachability in a directed graph screams \"strongly connected components\" (SCCs) to me. If `u` and `v` are mutually reachable, they *have* to be in the same SCC. So, `p` essentially counts the number of such mutually reachable pairs, where `u < v`.\n\nIf I have an SCC with size `k`, the number of such pairs within it is simply `k * (k - 1) / 2`.  Each pair of distinct nodes is mutually reachable within an SCC. This is just a combinatorial approach to find all the ordered pairs `(u,v)` in an SCC of size `k`.\n\nSo, the total number of nodes `n` will be the sum of all the sizes of all these SCCs in the graph, `n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`. The goal is to minimize `n` such that the sum of pairs from each SCC is equal to `p`. The crucial insight is to find a way to minimize `n` which would in turn maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nTo minimize the total number of nodes `n`, while keeping the sum of pairs from each SCC equal to `p`, I need to find the best way to choose the `k_i` values.  My instinct is to group nodes in such a way that minimizes the number of nodes while still arriving at exactly `p` pairs. It's about optimizing how I distribute nodes into SCCs. Larger SCCs seem efficient because that `k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically with `k`. But I need to be careful, it's not simply about maximizing SCC size.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n- A pair `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u != v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and no path `v -> u`.\n- A directed graph is **`p`-reachable** if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nThe condition \"u and v are reachable from each other\" means `u` and `v` must belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC). The condition `u < v` simply means we count each pair of distinct nodes `(u, v)` in an SCC exactly once (e.g., `(u, v)` but not `(v, u)`).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC satisfy the mutual reachability condition. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nLet `n` be the total number of nodes in the graph. Suppose the graph has SCCs of sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`.\nThe total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `P = sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` for `i = 1 to m`. We are given `P = p`.\n\nTo minimize `n` for a given `p`, we should try to make the SCCs as large as possible. This is because the function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically. For a fixed sum `sum(f(k_i)) = p`, `sum(k_i)` is minimized when we use fewer, larger `k_i` values.\n\nWe can find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`. Let this be `k_max`.\nWe can use one SCC of size `k_max`. This consumes `k_max` nodes and contributes `k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2` to `p`.\nThe remaining `p_rem = p - k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2` must be formed by other SCCs.\nWe can recursively apply this strategy: find the largest `k'` such that `k' * (k' - 1) / 2 <= p_rem`, add `k'` to `n`, and subtract `k' * (k' - 1) / 2` from `p_rem`. We continue this until `p_rem` becomes 0.\n\nThis greedy strategy works: at each step, we take the largest possible `k` that doesn't exceed the remaining `p`. This minimizes `n`.\nFor `p=0`, `n=0`.\nFor `p=1`, `k=2` gives `1` pair. `n=2`.\nFor `p=2`, `k=3` gives `3` pairs. We need `p=2`. `k=2` gives `1` pair. Remaining `p=1`. `k=2` gives `1` pair. Total `n=2+2=4`.\nBut `k=2` is `1` pair. `k=3` is `3` pairs. We need `p=2`.\nWe can't form `p=2` with a single SCC.\nLargest `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= 2` is `k=2`. `2(1)/2 = 1`. `p_rem = 2-1 = 1`.\nLargest `k'` such that `k'(k'-1)/2 <= 1` is `k'=2`. `2(1)/2 = 1`. `p_rem = 1-1 = 0`.\nSo, `n = 2 + 2 = 4`. This is correct.\n\nWe can find `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= p` by solving `k^2 - k - 2p <= 0`. The positive root is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`. So `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n\nLet `N_min` be the minimum number of nodes.\n```python\nN_min = 0\ncurrent_p = p\nwhile current_p > 0:\n    # Find largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n    # k^2 - k - 2*current_p <= 0\n    # k approx sqrt(2*current_p)\n    k = int((1 + (1 + 8 * current_p)**0.5) / 2)\n    # k might be one too high if (k * (k - 1) / 2) > current_p\n    # or k might be one too low if (k-1) * (k-2) / 2 is too small\n    # check k and k-1\n    if k * (k - 1) // 2 > current_p:\n        k -= 1\n    \n    N_min += k\n    current_p -= k * (k - 1) // 2\n```\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nA unidirectional pair `(u, v)` means `u -> v` but not `v -> u`. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from the SCC of `u` to the SCC of `v` in the condensation graph (DAG of SCCs).\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we should connect the SCCs in a chain.\nSuppose we have SCCs `S_1, S_2, ..., S_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` (these are the `k` values found in Part 1).\nLet's arrange them in a chain `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`.\nThis can be achieved by adding an edge from an arbitrary node in `S_i` to an arbitrary node in `S_{i+1}` for all `i=1, ..., m-1`.\nFor any `u` in `S_i` and `v` in `S_j` where `i < j`:\n- There is a path `u -> v`.\n- There is no path `v -> u` (because `S_i` and `S_j` are distinct SCCs and the condensation graph has an edge `S_i -> S_j` but not `S_j -> S_i`).\nSo, all pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is in `S_i`, `v` is in `S_j`, and `i < j` are unidirectional.\n\nThe total number of such pairs is `sum(k_i * k_j)` for all `1 <= i < j <= m`.\nThis sum can be computed efficiently:\n`Total unidirectional pairs = (k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m)^2 - (k_1^2 + k_2^2 + ... + k_m^2)`\nThen divide by 2? No, this is for undirected pairs.\nIt's `sum_{i<j} k_i k_j`.\nThis is equivalent to `( (sum k_i)^2 - sum(k_i^2) ) / 2`.\nHere, `sum k_i` is `N_min`. So the number of unidirectional pairs is `(N_min^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\nLet `U_max` be the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n```python\nN_min = 0\nsum_k_sq = 0\ncurrent_p = p\nwhile current_p > 0:\n    k = int((1 + (1 + 8 * current_p)**0.5) / 2)\n    if k * (k - 1) // 2 > current_p:\n        k -= 1\n    \n    N_min += k\n    sum_k_sq += k * k\n    current_p -= k * (k - 1) // 2\n\nU_max = (N_min * N_min - sum_k_sq) // 2\n```\nFor `p=0`, `N_min=0`, `sum_k_sq=0`. `U_max = (0*0 - 0)/2 = 0`. Correct.\n\n**Example 1: p = 3**\n1. `current_p = 3`\n   `k = int((1 + (1 + 8*3)**0.5)/2) = int((1 + 5)/2) = 3`.\n   `3 * (3-1) // 2 = 3`. `3 <= 3`. So `k=3`.\n   `N_min = 3`. `sum_k_sq = 3*3 = 9`. `current_p = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n2. `current_p = 0`, loop ends.\nResult: `N_min = 3`, `U_max = (3*3 - 9) // 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\n**Example 2: p = 4**\n1. `current_p = 4`\n   `k = int((1 + (1 + 8*4)**0.5)/2) = int((1 + 5.74)/2) = 3`.\n   `3 * (3-1) // 2 = 3`. `3 <= 4`. So `k=3`.\n   `N_min = 3`. `sum_k_sq = 3*3 = 9`. `current_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n2. `current_p = 1`\n   `k = int((1 + (1 + 8*1)**0.5)/2) = int((1 + 3)/2) = 2`.\n   `2 * (2-1) // 2 = 1`. `1 <= 1`. So `k=2`.\n   `N_min = 3 + 2 = 5`. `sum_k_sq = 9 + 2*2 = 13`. `current_p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n3. `current_p = 0`, loop ends.\nResult: `N_min = 5`, `U_max = (5*5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`. Matches example.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 * 10^5`.\n`sqrt(1 + 8 * 2 * 10^5) = sqrt(1600001) approx 1265`.\n`k` will be around `1265 / 2 = 632`.\nThe loop runs at most `sqrt(2p)` times in the worst case (if `k=2` always). `sqrt(4*10^5)` is `approx 632`. So the loop is very fast.\n`N_min` can be at most `p * 2 = 4 * 10^5` (if all SCCs are size 2).\n`N_min^2` can be `(4 * 10^5)^2 = 16 * 10^{10}`, which fits in standard integer types.\n\nThe solution seems robust and correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    min_nodes = 0\n    sum_k_squared = 0\n    current_p = p\n\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # k^2 - k - 2*current_p <= 0\n        # Using quadratic formula for roots of k^2 - k - 2*current_p = 0:\n        # k = (1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4*1*(-2*current_p))) / 2\n        # k = (1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        # We need the positive root, so k = (1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        \n        # Calculate k using floating point, then convert to int.\n        # This might be off by 1 due to precision or floor/ceil behavior.\n        # We need floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2)\n        k_float = (1 + (1 + 8 * current_p)**0.5) / 2\n        k = int(k_float)\n        \n        # Check if k is too large.
