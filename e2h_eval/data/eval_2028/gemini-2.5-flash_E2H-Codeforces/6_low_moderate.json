Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Let's crack this competitive programming problem!**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about finding two non-overlapping vouchers with a specific total duration and minimal cost.  It's pretty straightforward at first glance – two vouchers, durations add up to `x`, costs are minimized, and they don't intersect. But the `2 * 10^5` constraint screams that a naive O(N^2) solution won't cut it.  I need to be smart here.\n\nFirst, let's nail down these conditions.  We need *two* vouchers that don't overlap. That's key – one ends before the other starts. Their durations have to perfectly sum to `x`, and the total cost of these two vouchers needs to be as low as possible.  I'm thinking minimizing cost is the optimization target, so I need to keep that in mind.\n\nThe non-intersection condition, `ri < lj` or `rj < li`, is pretty critical. Let's assume `ri < lj` without loss of generality – that's voucher `i` ending before voucher `j` begins. We're looking for `(li, ri, costi)` and `(lj, rj, costj)` with these conditions: `ri < lj`, `(ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x` (duration condition), and minimize `costi + costj`.\n\nI initially thought of just brute-forcing all pairs, checking the conditions, and keeping track of the minimum cost. But that O(N^2) approach is clearly going to be too slow, and I can't let that happen.  I've got to find a more efficient solution.\n\nThe problem's constraints, where `li, ri <= 2 * 10^5`, are hinting at some optimization.  Maybe some data structure or technique that uses the range of `l` and `r` values. That's a strong lead.\n\nLet's define `duration_k = rk - lk + 1` to simplify things. So now the condition is `duration_i + duration_j = x`. Now I'm thinking, what if I fix one voucher, say `i`? Then, I want to find a voucher `j` such that `rj - lj + 1 = x - duration_i`, `ri < lj`, and minimize `costj` from the potential set of `j`s. That still seems like a potentially slow search.\n\nSorting is often a good strategy for these kinds of problems. What's a smart sorting key here? Sorting by start day `li` or end day `ri` might be helpful. I'm going to sort by `li`, the start day. Then, I'm thinking, iterate through the sorted vouchers and, for each `v_i = (li, ri, costi)`, I search for a `v_j = (lj, rj, costj)` such that `ri < lj` (no overlap), `duration_i + duration_j = x`, and `costi + costj` is minimal. That's a good place to start! Now to figure out the most effective way to efficiently search for that `v_j`.\n",
