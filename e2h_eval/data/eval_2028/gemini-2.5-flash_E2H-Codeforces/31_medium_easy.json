            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The core is figuring out the minimum cards Vanya needs to reach a zero sum. Right, so we're given the initial number of cards (`n`), the maximum absolute value (`x`) on any card (new or old), and the values of the existing cards.  The objective is to minimize the new cards added so that the final sum becomes zero.\n\nFirst, I've got to calculate the total sum (`S`) of the existing cards. The key insight here is that the number of new cards needed depends directly on the absolute value of `S`. If `S` is zero, we're done, no new cards. If `S` is positive, we need to bring it down to zero, and if `S` is negative, we need to push it up to zero.\n\n**Finding the Minimal Solution:**\n\nNow, the absolute value of the sum is how much we have to change.  The catch is that Vanya has an infinite supply of cards. The new cards can range from -x to x. To minimize the card count, we need to target the card with the greatest absolute value to decrease the impact of each card added. That's either `-x` or `x`. It would be ideal to use the largest value to change `S` at the fastest possible rate.\n\nThe minimum number of cards would involve using the largest card size possible. The amount we have to reduce the absolute sum of the new cards needs to be divided by `x`. We're going to use integer math. What's the number of cards `k` that satisfies `k * x >= |S|`? The answer is the ceiling division of `|S|/x`.  So, we need to find `ceil(|S| / x)`.\n\n**Optimization and Code Implementation:**\n\nRight, I'm going to determine a way of obtaining the ceiling value without using a math library.  For positive integers, the `(abs_sum_needed + x - 1) // x` expression should work. I'll use it to calculate the minimum number of additional cards and print it.\n\nI'll check the edge cases and constraints, such as `n=1000` and `x=1000`. The complexity will be linear in the input size, so it should be fine. I'm confident about my solution.\n",
