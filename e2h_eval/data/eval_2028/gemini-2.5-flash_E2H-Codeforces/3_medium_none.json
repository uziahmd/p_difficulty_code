Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the plan for tackling the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. First, I'll need a Python script to do the heavy lifting.**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nOkay, so we have a street of length `l` from 0 to `l`. There are `n` lanterns positioned at `a_i` locations. Each lantern shines with a certain radius `d`. We need to figure out the *smallest* possible `d` so that the entire street is lit up. Think of it like a line covered by segments, each centered around a lantern.\n\n**Input is Key:**\nThe inputs are `n` (number of lanterns), `l` (street length) and the `a_i` (lantern positions). The output will be the *minimum* `d`.  The constraints look manageable, `n` goes up to 1000 and `l` up to `10^9`.\n\n**The Approach:**\n\n1.  **Get Organized:** Sorting the lantern positions `a_i` is the first move. Makes it much easier to think about what the lanterns are covering. After sorting, let the new sorted positions be `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\n\n2.  **Find the Gaps:**\n    *   **The Start:**  The spot between 0 and the first lantern `a_1` needs some light. To cover point 0, `a_1` must extend its light to 0. So, `d` must be at least `a_1`.\n    *   **The End:** Similarly, the end of the street from the last lantern, `a_n`, to `l` needs to be lit. Lantern at `a_n` must cover `l`, so `d` must be at least `l - a_n`.\n    *   **Between Lanterns:**  Any gaps between adjacent lanterns are crucial. For `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the worst case is the midpoint, which is the farthest from either lantern in that segment and must be lit. So, the distance from `a_i` to the midpoint is `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. Thus `d` must be at least this value to cover it.\n\n3.  **Maximum of Minimums:** The trick is that the *overall minimum `d`* is the *biggest* of these individual minimums.  The final answer needs to satisfy *all* coverage needs.\n\n    Let's break it down further:\n    *   `d_start = a_1` for the first part of the street.\n    *   `d_end = l - a_n` for the end part.\n    *   `d_gaps = max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for i in range(n-1))` for the gaps between lanterns.\n\n    Final answer is `max(d_start, d_end, d_gaps)`.\n\n**Implementation Time:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `l`.\n2.  Read and sort the lantern positions `a`.\n3.  Set `max_d = 0.0`.\n4.  **Cover Start:** `max_d = max(max_d, a[0])`.\n5.  **Cover End:** `max_d = max(max_d, l - a[n-1])`.\n6.  **Cover Internal Gaps:** Loop from `i = 0` to `n-2`:\n    `max_d = max(max_d, (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0)`\n7.  Print the final `max_d` with 10 digits after the decimal point as per precision requirements.\n\n**Trace Through:**\n\n*   For `n=2`, `l=5`, `a=[2, 5]`: `d = 2`\n*   For `n=7`, `l=15`, `a=[15, 5, 3, 7, 9, 14, 0]`: `d=2.5`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n*   `n=1`: One lantern. The result will be `max(a[0], l-a[0])`. Correct.\n*   Lanterns at 0 and `l`: These boundary conditions are correctly handled as `d_start=a[0]` and `d_end=l-a[n-1]`.\n*   Multiple lanterns at the same point: Sorting handles this naturally, the gap calculation will result in `0` for the half-distance, so it",
