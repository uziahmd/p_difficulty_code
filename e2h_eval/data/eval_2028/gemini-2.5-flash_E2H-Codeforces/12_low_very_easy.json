The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Xenia and the Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break down my thought process. I need a Python script to figure this out, which means I have to precisely define the logic first.\n\nBasically, I'm given `n` houses in a circle, `m` tasks, and the houses where each task needs to be done, represented as `a_i`. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to move clockwise to complete the tasks in order. Each move to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n\nInitially, Xenia is at house 1, and the total time is zero. For the first task, I need to calculate the time it takes to get to `a_1`. That's simply `a_1 - 1`.\n\nNow, for each subsequent task, the logic gets a bit trickier. I need to consider whether the target house for the next task (`a_i`) is ahead of Xenia's current house (`current_house`) or behind.\n\nIf `target_house >= current_house`, the calculation is straightforward: `target_house - current_house`.\n\nIf `target_house < current_house`, this is where I have to account for the ring road's circular nature. Xenia has to go clockwise, which means going all the way around the ring. Thinking about it, the most efficient way to get there is from `current_house` to `n`, then wrapping around to `1`, and then to `target_house`. This equals `(n - current_house) + (target_house - 1) + 1` or, simplified, `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nSo, the generalized approach for each task `i` is this:\n\n1.  Check the relationship between `target_house` (`a_i`) and `current_house`.\n2.  If `target_house >= current_house`, the time taken is simply their difference. Add this to the `total_time`.\n3.  If `target_house < current_house`, calculate the time with the formula `n - current_house + target_house` and add that to `total_time`.\n4.  Update `current_house` to be `target_house` after each task.\n\nThat should be the core of the algorithm. Now, I need to translate this into Python code. The key is to iterate through each task, calculate the time for each step, and maintain `total_time` and `current_house` accurately.\n",
