She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving tab management. My goal is to determine the shortest time needed to close all tabs outside the specified range. I've broken down the solution into cases based on the relationship between the range boundaries (`l` and `r`) and the total number of tabs (`n`).\n\n*   **Case 1:** If the range covers all tabs (`l=1` and `r=n`), no tabs need closing, and the time is zero.\n\n*   **Case 2:** When only tabs to the left of the range need to be closed, the cursor must go to the `l` position, and it takes the absolute distance between current position and `l` plus one second to close.\n\n*   **Case 3:** Similarly, if only tabs to the right of the range need closing, it takes the absolute distance to `r` plus one second.\n\n*   **Case 4:** This is the most complex scenario, where tabs on both sides of the range must be closed. I've recognized that regardless of the exact cursor movement, it requires at least two operations (one for each side). I analyzed two strategies: close the left side first, then the right, or vice versa. The crucial factor is that I move the cursor either to the `l` or `r` to do the closing operations. The formula to calculate the result is to take the minimum of `abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2` and `abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`. Further simplification has led me to a generalized formula in Case 4: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n\nThrough multiple test examples, including boundary conditions, I confirmed the correctness of the logical reasoning and derived formula in each scenario. Finally, I have implemented the solution in Python using `if-else` branching for the different cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the current cursor position `pos`, and the desired range `[l, r]`.\n\nThere are four main scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed (`l=1` and `r=n`):**\n    If the required segment `[l, r]` covers all tabs from `1` to `n`, then no tabs need to be closed.\n    Time = `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l=1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r`.\n    *   Move the cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    *   Close all tabs to the right of `r`. This takes `1` second.\n    Total time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r=n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l`.\n    *   Move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    *   Close all tabs to the left of `l`. This takes `1` second.\n    Total time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two \"close\" operations, each costing `1` second, for a total of `2` seconds for closing. The cursor must visit tab `l` to close the left segment and tab `r` to close the right segment.\n\n    There are two main strategies:\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `abs(l - r)` seconds, which is `(r - l)` since `l <= r`.\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        Total time for Strategy A = `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `abs(r - l)` seconds, which is `(r - l)` since `l <= r`.\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        Total time for Strategy B = `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n    The minimum time for this case is the minimum of Strategy A and Strategy B:\n    `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2, abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2)`\n    This can be simplified to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThis covers all possible scenarios. The movement costs `abs(curr - target)` are valid because `l` and `r` are always within the currently available tab range `[a, b]` (initially `[1, n]`, and after one close operation, they remain within the new `[a, b]`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are needed (l=1 and r=n).
