Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I need to figure out how to maximize the total hours Vasily can light his room. Essentially, he starts with some new candles, each burns for an hour, and then a certain number of spent candles can be combined to make a new one.  This is a classic simulation problem. The key is to see that we want to *always* be making and burning candles if we can.\n\nI'm thinking I'll model this using a few variables to keep track of things. First, there's `total_hours`, which I want to maximize. Then, `current_new_candles`, which represents what I actually *can* burn right now. And finally, `burned_out_candles`, the collection of spent candles I can potentially use to make more.\n\nThe basic loop is going to be:\n1.  Burn all the `current_new_candles`, incrementing `total_hours`.\n2.  Add the burned candles to `burned_out_candles`.\n3.  Calculate how many new candles I can make from `burned_out_candles` (using integer division).\n4.  Update the `burned_out_candles` to the remainder (modulo operation).\n5.  Add those newly created candles to `current_new_candles`.\n\nI'm going to keep looping as long as I have `current_new_candles` that are greater than zero. The moment that hits zero, no more candles can be used.\n\nFor an example, if Vasily starts with 4 candles and it takes 2 burned out candles to make 1 new one (a=4, b=2). I start with:\n\n`total_hours = 0`\n`current_new_candles = 4`\n`burned_out_candles = 0`\n\nIn the first loop, `total_hours` becomes 4, `burned_out_candles` is 4, and `current_new_candles` becomes 2.\n\nThe second loop will then burn those 2 new candles. `total_hours` becomes 6, `burned_out_candles` 2, and `current_new_candles` becomes 1.\n\nThe third loop burns the last candle, giving us a final `total_hours` of 7.\n\nThis feels like the most efficient approach to solve it. It should get me the answer I'm looking for.\n",
