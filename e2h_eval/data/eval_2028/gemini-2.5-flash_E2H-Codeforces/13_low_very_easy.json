For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify a musical triad as major, minor, or something \"strange.\" Let's break this down. First, the core concept here is *semitones* between notes. I have a cyclic system of 12 notes, and the distance between them is measured in semitones. That's straightforward enough. The input will be three note names, and the output needs to be a single string identifying the triad type.\n\nMy initial approach will be to convert the note names into numerical representations for easier distance calculations. Since there are 12 notes and they're cyclic, I can map them to the numbers 0 through 11. C will be 0, C# is 1, and so on. A dictionary seems the most efficient way to handle this mapping.\n\nOnce I have numerical values, I need a function to calculate the semitone distance between two notes. The formula is going to be `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. I need to remember that the distance is always calculated upwards from the first note to the second. I quickly checked an example to confirm that formula works correctly.\n\nNext, I'll need to process the input. The script will read three note names, convert them to numbers using the mapping, and store them.\n\nThe crucial part is the major/minor triad classification. I can see that the order of the notes *does* matter to the definitions. But since triads are unordered *sets*, I need to consider all possible arrangements of the three notes. Sorting the notes numerically will help with this. If I sort them, say `a <= b <= c`, I can treat the smallest note, `a`, as the root or X, and test the semitone distances between the notes in that order. The major definition is X-Y is 4 semitones, Y-Z is 3; minor is X-Y 3 semitones and Y-Z is 4. I can calculate the distances and test these against the major and minor conditions. If it's neither major nor minor, it's \"strange\". I'm ready to write the code.\n",
