For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself.

    "thought": "**Solving a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I need to write a Python script, pretty straightforward. It's about a \"beautiful multiset\" of binary strings. The input is `n`, `k`, and `f`, and the output is the result modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this \"beautiful multiset\" means and what `c_s` represents.  I'm choosing an integer `c_s` between 0 and `k` for every binary string `s` of length from 1 to `n`. A multiset of binary strings of length *exactly* `n` is beautiful if, for any string `s` (length 1 to `n`), the number of strings in the multiset with `s` as a prefix is less than or equal to `c_s`.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the size of this beautiful multiset. So I have a multiset `M` of binary strings of length `n`. For any string `s` with a length less than `n`, it acts as a prefix of `2^(n-L)` strings with length `n`. If a string `t` is included in the multiset, it contributes 1 to the count of every prefix of `t`, including itself. This constraint, `count(t in M | s is prefix of t) <= c_s` has to hold for every `s`. \n\nEssentially, if `cnt[s]` is the number of strings in `M` that start with `s`, then `cnt[s] <= c_s` has to be true for all `s` lengths from 1 to `n`. Now, what can I do to maximize `|M|`? This seems like I could treat it as a maximum flow or a minimum cut, but the structure is actually a binary tree or trie-like structure. If the multiset includes a string, the prefix count must be limited by the values `c_s`. The prefixes are the nodes of a tree. The edges represent the substrings that the length of the string is increasing. `cnt[s]` is essentially `cnt[s0] + cnt[s1]`. The constraints limit the total size of each set of prefixes to be at most `c_s`, and so the multiset size is the number of leaves of the trie.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly $f$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how to determine the maximum size of a beautiful multiset given a set of $c_s$ values.\nLet $N_s$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe conditions are $N_s \\le c_s$ for all $s$ of length $1$ to $n$.\nAlso, for any string $s$ of length $L < n$, $s$ is a prefix of some strings of length $n$. These strings are partitioned into those prefixed by $s0$ and those prefixed by $s1$. Thus, $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$.\nThe total size of the multiset is the sum of $N_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $n$. This is equivalent to $N_0 + N_1$ (if we consider strings of length $n$ as leaves of a binary tree, and $0, 1$ as children of an implicit root).\n\nTo maximize the total size, we should try to make $N_s$ as large as possible.\nConsider a string $s$ of length $L < n$. We have $N_s \\le c_s$ and $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $N_s$ is $c_s$.\nAlso, $N_s$ must be at least $N_{s0} + N_{s1}$.\nThis implies that $N_s$ must be at least the sum of counts for its children.\nWorking from the leaves (strings of length $n$) upwards:\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $N_s$ is simply the count of $s$ in the multiset. So $N_s \\le c_s$. To maximize, we would pick $N_s = c_s$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$.\nTo maximize $N_s$, we should maximize $N_{s0}$ and $N_{s1}$.\nThis structure suggests a dynamic programming approach on the trie of binary strings.\nLet $M(s)$ be the maximum possible value for $N_s$.\nIf $s$ has length $n$, then $M(s) = c_s$.\nIf $s$ has length $L < n$, then $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $M(\"\") = M(0) + M(1)$, where $M(0)$ and $M(1)$ are calculated using the above recurrence.\nNote that the problem statement defines $c_s$ for $s$ of length $1$ to $n$. So, the root of our calculation would be $M(0)$ and $M(1)$. The total size is $M(0) + M(1)$.\n\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are suffixes of a fixed string of length $L-1$, such that $M(s)$ (for this fixed string $s$ of length $L-1$) would be $val$.\nThis DP state definition is a bit tricky because $M(s)$ depends on $c_s$ for the current node $s$, and $M(s0), M(s1)$ from children.\nA better DP state would be: $dp[L][val]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of a *single* node at level $L-1$, such that the maximum possible count for that node (if it were $s$) is $val$.\nThis means $dp[L][val]$ counts ways to assign $c_t$ for $t$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ such that $t$ starts with $s$, and $M(s)=val$.\nSince the structure of the binary tree is symmetric, the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ descending from $s_0$ is the same as for $s_1$.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values for a subtree rooted at a node of length $L-1$ such that $M(s)$ (for that root node $s$) is $val$.\nBase case: $L=n$. We are considering strings of length $n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. We can choose $c_s$ from $0$ to $k$. So, $dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\nFor $L < n$: To compute $dp[L][val]$ for a node $s$ of length $L-1$:\n$M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\n$c_s$ can be any value from $0$ to $k$.\n$M(s0)$ can be any value from $0$ to $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. $M(s1)$ can be any value from $0$ to $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet $S_L = \\sum_{j=0}^{k \\cdot 2^{n-L}} dp[L+1][j]$. This is the total number of ways to assign $c_t$ for descendants of $s0$ (or $s1$).\nThe number of ways to get $M(s0)=j_0$ and $M(s1)=j_1$ is $dp[L+1][j_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][j_1]$.\nThe sum $M(s0)+M(s1)$ can range from $0$ to $2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. Let $S = M(s0)+M(s1)$.\nWe need to calculate the number of ways to get a specific sum $S$. This is a convolution.\nLet $P_L[S]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_t$ for descendants of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $M(s0)+M(s1) = S$.\n$P_L[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp[L+1][j_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][j_1]$. This can be computed using FFT/NTT.\nThen, $dp[L][val] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, S)=val} P_L[S]$.\nThis sum can be split:\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S=0}^{val-1} P_L[S] \\cdot (\\text{number of } c_s \\text{ s.t. } c_s \\ge val) + P_L[val] \\cdot (\\text{number of } c_s \\text{ s.t. } c_s = val) + \\sum_{S=val+1}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S] \\cdot (\\text{number of } c_s \\text{ s.t. } c_s = val)$\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S=0}^{val-1} P_L[S] \\cdot (k-val+1) + P_L[val] \\cdot val + \\sum_{S=val+1}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S] \\cdot (val+1)$. No, this is incorrect.\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } S > val} P_L[S] \\cdot 1 \\quad (\\text{for } c_s=val)$\n$+ \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } S = val} P_L[S] \\cdot (val+1) \\quad (\\text{for } c_s=0, \\dots, val)$\n$+ \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } S < val} P_L[S] \\cdot (k-val+1) \\quad (\\text{for } c_s=val, \\dots, k)$\n\nLet's simplify:\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\left( \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, S)=val} P_L[S] \\right)$\nIf $c_s = val$: $M(s) = \\min(val, S)$. This is $val$ if $S \\ge val$, and $S$ if $S < val$.\nSo, if $c_s = val$, we need $S \\ge val$. The term is $\\sum_{S=val}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S]$.\nIf $c_s > val$: $M(s) = \\min(c_s, S)$. This is $val$ if $S = val$. The term is $P_L[val]$.\nSo, $dp[L][val] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^{val-1} 0 + \\sum_{c_s=val}^k \\left( \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, S)=val} P_L[S] \\right)$.\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S=val}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S] \\quad (\\text{for } c_s=val)$\n$+ P_L[val] \\cdot (k-val) \\quad (\\text{for } c_s=val+1, \\dots, k)$\nThis simplifies to:\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S=val+1}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S] + P_L[val] \\cdot (k-val+1)$.\nThis is equivalent to $dp[L][val] = \\left( \\sum_{S=val}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S] \\right) + P_L[val] \\cdot (k-val)$.\nLet $SuffSumP_L[X] = \\sum_{S=X}^{\\text{max_S}} P_L[S]$. This can be computed with a suffix sum array.\nThen $dp[L][val] = SuffSumP_L[val] + P_L[val] \\cdot (k-val)$.\nThe maximum possible value for $M(s)$ at level $L-1$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-(L-1)}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $S$ is $2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\n\nThe final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nComplexity:\nThere are $n$ levels of DP.\nAt each level $L$:\n1. Compute $P_L$ using convolution of $dp[L+1]$ with itself. The size of arrays for convolution is $2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. This takes $O(k \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\log(k \\cdot 2^{n-L}))$ using NTT.\n2. Compute $SuffSumP_L$. This takes $O(k \\cdot 2^{n-L})$.\n3. Compute $dp[L]$ using the formula. This takes $O(k \\cdot 2^{n-L})$.\nTotal time complexity: $\\sum_{L=1}^{n-1} O(k \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\log(k \\cdot 2^{n-L}))$.\nLet $M_L = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. The sum is $\\sum_{L=1}^{n-1} O(M_L \\log M_L)$.\n$M_L$ goes like $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}, k \\cdot 2^{n-2}, \\dots, k \\cdot 2^1$.\nThe largest term is for $L=1$, which is $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\nSo, roughly $O(k \\cdot 2^n \\log(k \\cdot 2^n))$.\nGiven $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$:\n$2^n = 2^{15} = 32768$.\n$k \\cdot 2^n = 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 32768 \\approx 6.5 \\cdot 10^9$. This is too slow for NTT.\n\nLet's recheck the maximum value of $M(s)$.\n$M(s)$ is the maximum count of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe maximum total count for strings of length $n$ is $k \\cdot 2^n$.\nThe maximum value for $c_s$ is $k$.\n$M(s) \\le c_s \\le k$.\nThis is the crucial observation. $M(s)$ can never exceed $k$, regardless of the number of descendants.\nSo, the maximum value for $M(s)$ is $k$.\nThe maximum value for $M(s0)+M(s1)$ is $k+k = 2k$.\nThe maximum length of the DP arrays is $2k+1$.\n\nRevised complexity:\nAt each level $L$:\n1. Compute $P_L$ using convolution of $dp[L+1]$ with itself. Array size is $2k+1$. This takes $O(k \\log k)$ using NTT.\n2. Compute $SuffSumP_L$. This takes $O(k)$.\n3. Compute $dp[L]$ using the formula. This takes $O(k)$.\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot k \\log k)$.\nGiven $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$:\n$15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This is feasible.\n\nLet's write down the DP states and transitions carefully.\n`MOD = 998244353`.\n`dp[L][val]` will store the count for $M(s)=val$ for a node $s$ at depth $L-1$.\n`dp` will be a list of lists/arrays, where `dp[i]` corresponds to $L=i$.\n`dp[n]` is the base case. `dp[n][val] = 1` for $0 \\le val \\le k$. All other values are $0$.\nFor $L = n-1, n-2, \\dots, 1$:\n  `curr_dp_arr = dp[L+1]`\n  `P_L = NTT_convolve(curr_dp_arr, curr_dp_arr)`\n  `SuffSumP_L` array: `SuffSumP_L[X] = sum(P_L[j] for j >= X)`\n  `dp[L]` array:\n    For `val` from $0$ to $k$:\n      `dp[L][val] = (SuffSumP_L[val] + P_L[val] * (k - val)) % MOD`\n\nThe final answer is `dp[1][f]`.\nMaximum value for $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. Max value for $val$ in $dp[L][val]$ is $k$.\nSo $f$ must be $\\le k$. If $f > k$, the answer is $0$.\n\nExample 1: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\nBase case: $L=1$. This is the final level.\n`dp[1][val] = 1` for $0 \\le val \\le 42$.\nThe answer is `dp[1][f] = dp[1][2] = 1`.\nWait, the example output is 3. What's wrong?\n\nThe definition of $M(s)$ is for a *node* $s$.\nThe total size of the multiset is $M(0) + M(1)$.\nSo, the problem asks for the number of ways to choose $c_s$ such that $M(0) + M(1) = f$.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for the subtree rooted at $s$ (length $L-1$) such that $M(s)=val$.\nThe final step is to sum $dp[1][j_0] \\cdot dp[1][j_1]$ for all $j_0+j_1=f$.\nThis means we need to compute $P_0[f]$ where $P_0$ is the convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself.\nSo, the final answer is $P_0[f]$.\n\nExample 1: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$dp[1]$ is the base case.\n`dp[1][val] = 1` for $0 \\le val \\le k=42$.\nWe need to calculate $P_0[f]$ which is the convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself.\n$P_0[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp[1][j_0] \\cdot dp[1][j_1]$.\nSince $dp[1][j]=1$ for $0 \\le j \\le k$:\n$P_0[S] = \\sum_{j_0=0}^S 1 \\cdot 1 = S+1$, provided $j_0 \\le k$ and $S-j_0 \\le k$.\nSo $P_0[S] = S+1$ for $0 \\le S \\le k$.\nFor $S > k$, the terms $j_0+j_1=S$ where $j_0, j_1 \\le k$.\nThe number of such pairs is $k - (S-k) + 1 = 2k-S+1$.\nSo $P_0[S] = \\min(S+1, 2k-S+1)$.\nFor $f=2$, $k=42$:\n$P_0[2] = \\min(2+1, 2 \\cdot 42 - 2 + 1) = \\min(3, 83) = 3$. This matches the example output!\n\nSo the overall algorithm is:\n1. Initialize `dp[n]` array: `dp[n][val] = 1` for $0 \\le val \\le k$. Max index is $k$.\n2. Iterate $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n   a. Let `prev_dp_arr = dp[L+1]`.\n   b. Compute `P_L = NTT_convolve(prev_dp_arr, prev_dp_arr)`. The size of `P_L` will be up to $2k$.\n   c. Compute `SuffSumP_L` array: `SuffSumP_L[X] = sum(P_L[j] for j >= X)`. Max index is $2k$.\n   d. Initialize `dp[L]` array of size $k+1$ to zeros.\n   e. For `val` from $0$ to $k$:\n      `dp[L][val] = (SuffSumP_L[val] + P_L[val] * (k - val)) % MOD`\n      (Here `P_L[val]` will be $0$ if `val > 2k`. `SuffSumP_L[val]` will be $0$ if `val > 2k`.)\n3. Compute `final_P = NTT_convolve(dp[1], dp[1])`.\n4. The answer is `final_P[f]`. If $f$ is out of bounds (e.g. $f > 2k$), the answer is $0$.\n\nNeed to implement NTT.\n`MOD = 998244353` is a prime suitable for NTT.\nPrimitive root `g = 3`.\n\nMaximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nMaximum value of $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum sum $f$ can be is $2k$.
