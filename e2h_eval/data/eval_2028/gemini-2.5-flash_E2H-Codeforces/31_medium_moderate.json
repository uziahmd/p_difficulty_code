Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya's Card Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vanya and Cards problem. The core is figuring out how many extra cards Vanya needs to zero out the sum of his existing cards, with the constraint that he can only use cards with values between -x and x. I've broken this down: first, calculate the current sum of the cards Vanya *already* has. If that sum is zero, boom, we're done; no extra cards needed. Otherwise, we need to find the absolute value of that current sum - that's our target. Each extra card can contribute at most 'x' (or '-x'). To minimize cards, we need to divide the absolute sum by x and round it up. That tells us how many additional cards we require to reach zero. I did a bunch of test cases in my head to check this: negative and positive numbers, big numbers, a zero current sum. The solution always seems to work. The math library's ceil function comes in handy for rounding. Finally, the code is structured to read in the necessary inputs, do the calculation, and print the answer. It's concise and should run quickly.",
