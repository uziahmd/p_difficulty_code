The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Tackling this Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm facing a graph problem, and it's all about maximizing the fan count. My initial thought is to build a Python script to handle the input, process the data, and format the output. Let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, the graph itself is a tree. That's a good starting point. Each district is connected to every other district by exactly one path. Now, there are contestants with fans based on powers of 2 (2<sup>i</sup> fans for district i). The challenge is removing `k` contestants such that the remaining districts are connected, and we want to maximize the sum of the fan counts. This translates to the highest possible sum of the 2<sup>i</sup> values of the remaining districts.\n\nThe key insight is that because of how quickly powers of 2 grow, keeping larger district indices is much more beneficial than smaller ones. I need to keep the districts with the largest possible `i` values. For instance, holding on to district 10 is much more valuable than holding all districts from 1 to 9. The sum of all districts from 1 to 9 combined will never be as valuable as just district 10.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the constraint. We need a connected subgraph. To maximize the sum, I need to keep the highest-indexed districts. So, I must prioritize keeping the largest districts (n, n-1, n-2, and so on) as long as they maintain a connected subgraph.\n\nThe algorithm I have in mind is this: remove the smallest districts until I'm left with `n-k` districts that are still connected.  Since maximizing the fan count means keeping the largest labels, it will always be best to keep district `n` whenever possible.\n\nTherefore, the main strategy will be to work from the largest-indexed districts down and remove the smallest ones (in index terms) as required, while always checking for and maintaining the connectivity constraint. This approach focuses on optimizing fan count while simultaneously handling the connected subgraph requirement.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts out of `n` total districts such that they form a connected subgraph (a subtree, since the original graph is a tree), and the total number of fans is maximized. The number of fans for a contestant from district `i` is `2^i`. We need to output the `k` districts that are removed, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. For any `x`, `2^x` is greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < x`. For example, `2^x > 2^(x-1) + 2^(x-2) + ... + 2^1`. This means that to maximize the total number of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. The optimal set of `n-k` districts will always include the district with the largest possible index, say `M`, and then try to include `M-1`, `M-2`, and so on, as long as they can form a connected component with the already chosen districts.\n\nThis greedy strategy suggests that we should try to keep the districts with the largest indices. Let's start by considering all districts `n, n-1, ..., 1`. We want to keep `n-k` districts. We will try to keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on, as long as adding the current district `i` to our set of chosen districts still allows the set to form a connected component. If adding `i` would disconnect the component or make it impossible to form a connected component of size `n-k`, we might have to skip `i`.\n\nHowever, a simpler greedy approach works due to the extreme dominance of `2^i`. We want to keep `n-k` districts. Let's try to keep the `n-k` districts with the largest indices: `n, n-1, ..., k+1`. This set `S = {k+1, k+2, ..., n}` has size `n-k`. If this set `S` forms a connected component, then this is the optimal solution because any other set of `n-k` districts would necessarily include at least one district `j < k+1` and exclude at least one district `i > k+1` (or be identical to `S`), which would result in a smaller sum of powers of 2.\n\nWhat if `S` is not connected? This means that `n, n-1, ..., k+1` do not form a connected component. In this case, we *must* include some districts with indices less than `k+1` to bridge the gaps and make the component connected, or to reach the required size `n-k`. To do this while maximizing the sum, we should keep the largest possible indices. This implies that we should keep district `n`, then `n-1`, and so on, making sure that the final set of `n-k` districts is connected.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to perform a \"pruning\" process:\n1.  Initialize the set of active districts to all `n` districts.\n2.  We need to remove `k` districts. To maximize the sum, we should remove districts with the smallest indices first.\n3.  Iterate through districts from `1` to `n`. For each district `i`:\n    a.  Check if `i` can be removed. A district `i` can be removed if:\n        i.  We still need to remove more districts (i.e., `k > 0`).\n        ii. Removing `i` does not disconnect the graph of *remaining* districts. Specifically, if `i` is a leaf node in the current graph of active districts, removing it is always safe. If `i` is not a leaf, removing it might disconnect its neighbors.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the largest connected component of size `n-k` that includes district `n`.\nA more direct approach based on the `2^i` dominance:\nThe optimal set of `n-k` vertices will always be the `n-k` largest-indexed vertices that form a connected component.\nThis means we should try to keep `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\n\nLet's consider the districts in decreasing order of their labels: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to select `n-k` districts.\nInitialize `kept_districts = {n}`.\nInitialize `removed_districts = []`.\nInitialize `count_kept = 1`.\n\nIterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n  If `count_kept < n-k`:\n    Check if `i` is adjacent to any district already in `kept_districts`.\n    If yes, add `i` to `kept_districts`, increment `count_kept`.\n    If no, add `i` to `removed_districts`. If `len(removed_districts) == k`, we are done.\n  Else (`count_kept == n-k`, meaning we have enough districts):\n    Add `i` to `removed_districts`. If `len(removed_districts) == k`, we are done.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that we prioritize keeping larger indexed districts. By always adding `i` if it connects to the current component and we still need more districts, we are building the largest possible connected component starting from `n` and extending to smaller indices. If we have already selected `n-k` districts, any further smaller-indexed district `i` must be removed to make space for the larger ones we've already kept.\n\nLet's refine the greedy strategy:\n1.  Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n2.  Initialize `removed_list = []`.\n3.  Create an adjacency list for the graph.\n4.  Create a `degree` array for each district, representing its degree in the *current* graph of active districts.\n5.  Create a boolean array `is_removed` initialized to `False` for all districts.\n\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  If `removed_count == k`, break. (We have removed enough districts)\n  If `is_removed[i]` is already `True`, continue. (This shouldn't happen with this specific iteration order)\n\n  Consider district `i`. We want to remove it if possible, because it has the smallest fan count.\n  A district `i` can be removed if:\n    a. We still need to remove districts (`removed_count < k`).\n    b. Removing `i` does not disconnect the remaining `n - removed_count - 1` districts.\n       This condition is met if `i` is a \"leaf\" in the current active graph, meaning its degree is 1. If `i` has degree 0, it's isolated, which means the graph is already disconnected or `n-k=1`. If `i` has degree > 1, removing it might split a path.\n\nThe correct approach is to identify the `n-k` districts to keep. The problem is asking us to maximize `sum(2^i)` for the remaining districts. This means we want to keep `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\nThe set of `n-k` districts we keep must form a connected component.\n\nLet `S` be the set of districts we keep.\nInitially, `S = {n}`.\n`num_kept = 1`.\n`removed = []`.\n`is_kept` array to track `S`.\n`visited` array for BFS/DFS.\n`q` for BFS.\n\nStart a BFS/DFS from district `n`. This will identify all districts reachable from `n`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` vertices.\nThe most valuable vertices are `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe must keep `n`.\nWe must keep `n-1` if it is connected to `n` (or to any other kept vertex).\nThis is a standard tree DP problem or a greedy approach.\n\nLet's reconsider the example: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `6-3=3` districts.\nGraph: `1-2`, `2-6`, `4-2`, `5-6`, `2-3`.\nDistricts: `1,2,3,4,5,6`. Fans: `2^1, ..., 2^6`.\nTo keep 3 districts, we want to maximize sum. Try to keep `6,5,4`.\n`{6,5,4}`: `5` is connected to `6`. `4` is connected to `2`. `6` is not connected to `4` (path `6-2-4`).\nSo `6,5` are connected. `4` is not connected to `6` or `5` directly. If we include `2`, then `6-2-4` and `5-6-2-4`.\nThe set `{6,5,2}` is connected. Size 3. Fans: `2^6+2^5+2^2 = 64+32+4 = 100`. Removed: `1,3,4`. This is the example output.\n\nThis means the strategy is:\n1.  Initialize `kept_set = {}`.\n2.  Initialize `removed_set = {}`.\n3.  Initialize `count_kept = 0`.\n4.  Initialize `count_removed = 0`.\n5.  Maintain a `degree` array for all nodes.\n6.  Maintain an adjacency list.\n\nThe key insight is that we want to keep the \"most valuable\" `n-k` nodes that form a connected component. The \"most valuable\" nodes are those with largest indices.\nSince `2^i` is so dominant, the optimal set of `n-k` nodes will *always* be the `n-k` largest-indexed nodes that form a connected component. This component must contain node `n`.\n\nSo, we can use a \"peeling\" approach:\n1.  Initialize `active_nodes = set(range(1, n+1))`.\n2.  Build adjacency list `adj`.\n3.  Calculate initial degrees for all nodes in the full graph.\n4.  Initialize a `deque` `q` with all nodes `i` such that `degree[i] == 1` and `i != n`. (We want to preserve `n` if possible).\n5.  While `q` is not empty and `len(active_nodes) > n-k`:\n    a.  Pop a node `u` from `q`.\n    b.  If `u` is already removed or `u == n`, continue. (This check is mostly for safety, `u==n` shouldn't be in `q` initially if `n` has degree > 1).\n    c.  Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n    d.  Remove `u` from `active_nodes`.\n    e.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.  Decrement `degree[v]`.\n        ii. If `v` is still active and `degree[v] == 1` and `v != n`, add `v` to `q`.\n\nThis process removes leaves iteratively. It will eventually leave a \"core\" connected component. The `n-k` condition ensures we stop removing nodes once we have `n-k` nodes left. By starting with nodes `1` to `n` and prioritizing removal of leaves, we are effectively removing the least \"important\" nodes first, and since we iterate `1` to `n` in the BFS, we prioritize removing smaller-indexed leaves.\n\nLet's apply this to `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep 3 nodes.\nInitial `adj`:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nInitial `degree`:\n1: 1\n2: 4\n3: 1\n4: 1\n5: 1\n6: 2\n\n`active_nodes = {1,2,3,4,5,6}`. `len(active_nodes) = 6`. Target `n-k = 3`.\n`q = deque([1,3,4,5])`. (Nodes with degree 1, excluding `n=6`).\n\nIteration 1: `len(active_nodes) = 6 > 3`.\nPop `u = 1`. `removed_list = [1]`. `active_nodes = {2,3,4,5,6}`. `degree[2]` becomes 3.\n`q` is now `deque([3,4,5])`.\n\nIteration 2: `len(active_nodes) = 5 > 3`.\nPop `u = 3`. `removed_list = [1,3]`. `active_nodes = {2,4,5,6}`. `degree[2]` becomes 2.\n`q` is now `deque([4,5])`.\n\nIteration 3: `len(active_nodes) = 4 > 3`.\nPop `u = 4`. `removed_list = [1,3,4]`. `active_nodes = {2,5,6}`. `degree[2]` becomes 1.\n`q` is now `deque([5])`. `degree[2]` is 1 and `2 != n=6`, so add `2` to `q`. `q = deque([5,2])`.\n\nIteration 4: `len(active_nodes) = 3`. This is `n-k`. So we stop.\nThe `removed_list` is `[1,3,4]`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis \"peeling\" strategy works because it removes the least \"important\" nodes first (nodes with degree 1, which are leaves in the current graph). Among degree-1 nodes, it prioritizes removing those with smaller labels due to the BFS queue order. This ensures that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component, and by removing the smallest-indexed leaves first, we implicitly maximize the sum of `2^i` for the remaining nodes.\n\nImplementation details:\n-   Adjacency list for graph.\n-   `degree` array.\n-   `is_removed` boolean array for quick checks.\n-   A `deque` for BFS.\n-   `removed_list` to store the output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degree[u] += 1\n        degree[v] += 1\n\n    # is_removed[i] will be True if district i is removed\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS-like peeling\n    # Add all initial leaves (degree 1 nodes) to the queue,\n    # except for node 'n' if it's a leaf.\n    # We want to keep node 'n' if possible, as it has the highest fan count.\n    q = deque()\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if degree[i] == 1 and i != n:\n            q.append(i)\n            is_removed[i] = True # Mark as \"to be removed\"\n    \n    removed_count = 0\n    removed_districts = []\n\n    # Perform peeling until k districts are removed or no more leaves can be removed\n    while q and removed_count < k:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        \n        removed_districts.append(u)\n        removed_count += 1\n        \n        # If we have removed k districts, stop\n        if removed_count == k:\n            break\n\n        # Decrement degree of neighbors and add new leaves to queue\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if not is_removed[v]: # Only process if neighbor v is not already removed\n                degree[v] -= 1\n                if degree[v] == 1 and v != n:\n                    q.append(v)\n                    is_removed[v] = True\n    \n    # After the peeling process, if we still need to remove more districts,\n    # it means all remaining active districts have degree > 1 (or are node n).\n    # In this case, we must remove districts from the remaining 'core' component.\n    # To maximize fans, we should remove the smallest-indexed districts among the remaining ones.\n    # These are districts that were not leaves in the peeling process.\n    if removed_count < k:\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if not is_removed[i]: # If district i is still active\n                removed_districts.append(i)\n                removed_count += 1\n                is_removed[i] = True\n                if removed_count == k:\n                    break\n    \n    # Sort the removed districts in increasing order as required\n    removed_districts.sort()\n    print(*(removed_districts))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
