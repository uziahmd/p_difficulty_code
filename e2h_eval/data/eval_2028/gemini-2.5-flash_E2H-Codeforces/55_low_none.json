Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Lexicographically Smallest String: My Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string manipulation problem. My goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible, given these rather specific swap rules. My first thought is to break down the allowed swaps and their implications.\n\nThe rules are pretty clear: '0' and '1' can swap, and '1' and '2' can swap. But, critically, '0' and '2' *can't* swap. This gives me a clear idea of the hierarchy. '1's are the most flexible, as they can \"move around\" both '0's and '2's, while '0's and '2's have a more rigid relationship.\n\nSince I want the lexicographically smallest string, I want to get the smaller characters as far to the left as possible.  My initial instinct is to put the '0's first, then the '1's, and then the '2's, but the constraint on '0' and '2' complicates this.\n\nNow, because of that \"no swap\" rule between '0' and '2', their *relative* order is fixed. If I have a '0' before a '2', that order must be preserved. So, I need to preserve the relative positioning of '0's and '2's while inserting '1's.\n\nI can count the frequencies of each character, `count0`, `count1`, and `count2`, but the key observation is that the relative positions of '0's and '2's in the final string must match their positions in the original string, *if I remove all the '1's*. This is key. For example, if I have \"0102\", the final string's 0's and 2's must appear as \"002\" if I strip out the 1's. This \"002\" sequence will determine where I insert the '1's later.\n\nSo, I will take the string, remove all the 1s and note the order of 0s and 2s. This gives me my backbone. The freedom comes with the '1's. Since the '1's can freely move past both '0's and '2's, I should strategically insert them into the \"0...2\" sequence to generate the smallest string.\n",
