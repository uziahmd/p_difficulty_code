The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition & Approach**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to tackle the \"Frog Jumping\" problem. It's a classic competitive programming challenge.  Let's break this down.  My initial reaction is to figure out the most efficient way to compute `f(x)`, the number of reachable integers within the range `[0, x]`.\n\nThe frog's movement is pretty straightforward: jump `a` forward or `b` backward. The crucial constraint here is staying within `[0, x]`.  If a jump takes the frog outside this range, it's invalid. My first thought is Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) or, at the least, an iterative process to discover those reachable integers, but the large constraint on *m* suggests this probably won't be a viable method of computation and I need to start looking at time complexities and alternate approaches.\n\nThinking about the constraints, I immediately see the limitation on `m` (up to 10^9).  An O(m) solution is out of the question. I need to be aiming for something much faster â€“ ideally, O(a + b),  O(log m), or maybe O(sqrt(m)) combined with O(a + b).  It's that m constraint that is the key.\n\nNow, let's analyze `f(x)` a bit more closely.  I need to understand its behavior.  What does the set of reachable positions look like?  Well, I know any reachable point `p` can be expressed as `c1*a - c2*b` where `c1` and `c2` are non-negative integers.  This implies that `p` must be a multiple of `gcd(a, b)`. Aha! That `gcd(a, b)` relationship is a huge clue.  Since everything must be a multiple of `gcd(a, b)`, I can probably simplify the problem by dividing everything by the greatest common divisor.\n\nSo, I think the critical insight is to divide everything by `g = gcd(a, b)`. That should simplify the problem significantly, perhaps allowing me to work with smaller numbers and discover a more efficient calculation strategy for `f(x)` and therefore the sum.  I'm starting to see a path forward, and the next step is to actually start forming some equations and see how everything works out.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, given it can jump `+a` or `-b`, and *never* jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position reachable by the frog must be a multiple of `g`.\nLet `dist[k]` be the minimum number of `+a` jumps required to reach position `k` (modulo `g`) from `0` using only `+a` and `-b` jumps, such that all intermediate positions are non-negative. If `k` is unreachable from `0` without going negative, `dist[k]` can be considered infinity.\nMore precisely, `dist[k]` is the minimum non-negative `k'` such that `k' = k + c * b` for some `c >= 0`, and `k'` is reachable from `0` by only `+a` jumps (i.e., `k'` is a multiple of `a`).\nThis is equivalent to finding the smallest `k'` such that `k' % a == 0` and `k' % g == k % g`, and `k'` can be written as `k + c * b` for some `c >= 0`. This is the standard \"shortest path in a graph where nodes are residues modulo `a`\" problem.\nWe can use Dijkstra's algorithm. The nodes are `0, 1, ..., a-1`. An edge from `u` to `(u+b)%a` has weight `b`. An edge from `u` to `(u-a)%a` has weight `a`. Wait, this is not quite right.\nThe `dist[k]` array (for `k` from `0` to `a-1`) stores the minimum non-negative position `P` such that `P % a == k` and `P` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, *and all intermediate positions are non-negative*. This is crucial.\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `p` such that `p % a == r` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps while staying non-negative. We initialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[r] = infinity` for `r \\neq 0`.\nWe use a 0-1 BFS (deque) or Dijkstra's algorithm.\n- From `u`, we can reach `u+a`. This is an `a`-jump. `dist[u]` implies `u` is reachable. So `u+a` is reachable.\n- From `u`, we can reach `u-b`. This is a `-b`-jump. If `u-b >= 0`, then `u-b` is reachable.\nThis is not what we want. We need `dist[k]` to be the minimum `x` such that `x \\equiv k \\pmod g` and `x` is reachable from `0` using only `+a` jumps (i.e. `x` is a multiple of `a`).\n\nLet `min_val[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable from `0` by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps, *and all intermediate positions are non-negative*.\nInitialize `min_val[0] = 0`, and `min_val[r] = infinity` for `r \\in \\{1, \\dots, g-1\\}$.\nWe can use a Dijkstra-like approach. A priority queue stores `(value, remainder_mod_g)`.\nStart with `(0, 0)` in PQ.\nWhen extracting `(v, r)` from PQ:\n1. If `v > min_val[r]`, continue.\n2. Consider jumping `+a`: `v_next = v + a`. `r_next = (r + a) % g`. If `v_next < min_val[r_next]`, update `min_val[r_next] = v_next` and add `(v_next, r_next)` to PQ.\n3. Consider jumping `-b`: `v_next = v - b`. If `v_next >= 0` and `v_next < min_val[(r - b % g + g) % g]`, update `min_val[(r - b % g + g) % g] = v_next` and add `(v_next, (r - b % g + g) % g)` to PQ.\nThis finds the minimum reachable point for each residue modulo `g`.\nThe maximum value `min_val[r]` can take is about `a+b`. The number of states is `g`. Dijkstra takes `O(g log g)` or `O(g)` with a deque (since edge weights are `a` or `b`).\n\nAfter computing `min_val[r]` for all `r \\in \\{0, \\dots, g-1\\}$:\nFor a given `x`, `f(x)` is the count of all `k \\in [0, x]` such that `k` is reachable from `0` without ever going below `0`.\nA position `k` is reachable without going below `0` if and only if `k >= min_val[k % g]`.\nSo `f(x)` is the number of `k \\in [0, x]` such that `k \\ge min_val[k % g]`.\nThis means `f(x) = \\sum_{r=0}^{g-1} \\left( \\lfloor \\frac{x - \\max(0, min\\_val[r])}{g} \\rfloor + 1 \\right) \\text{ if } x \\ge \\max(0, min\\_val[r]) \\text{ else } 0`.\nMore simply, `f(x) = \\sum_{r=0}^{g-1} \\text{count of } k \\text{ such that } k \\in [min\\_val[r], x] \\text{ and } k \\equiv r \\pmod g`.\nThis count is `max(0, (x - min_val[r]) // g + 1)`.\n\nWe need to calculate `S = \\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n`S = \\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\sum_{r=0}^{g-1} \\max(0, (i - min\\_val[r]) // g + 1)`.\nWe can swap the summations:\n`S = \\sum_{r=0}^{g-1} \\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\max(0, (i - min\\_val[r]) // g + 1)`.\nLet `k_r = min_val[r]`.\nThe inner sum for a fixed `r` is `\\sum_{i=k_r}^{m} ((i - k_r) // g + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - k_r`. The sum becomes `\\sum_{j=0}^{m-k_r} (j // g + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - k_r`. We need to compute `\\sum_{j=0}^{N} (j // g + 1)`.\nThis sum can be split into blocks of `g`.\nFor `j` from `0` to `g-1`, `j//g + 1 = 1`. Sum is `g * 1`.\nFor `j` from `g` to `2g-1`, `j//g + 1 = 2`. Sum is `g * 2`.\n...\nFor `j` from `qg` to `(q+1)g-1`, `j//g + 1 = q+1`. Sum is `g * (q+1)`.\nLet `q_N = N // g`.\nThe sum is `g * \\sum_{p=1}^{q_N} p` (for full blocks) `+ \\sum_{j=q_N g}^{N} (j // g + 1)` (for the partial block).\nThe first part is `g * q_N * (q_N + 1) // 2`.\nThe second part is `(N - q_N g + 1) * (q_N + 1)`.\nThis formula is for `N >= 0`. If `N < 0`, the sum is `0`.\nLet's define a helper function `calc_sum(N, g)`:\nIf `N < 0`, return `0`.\n`q = N // g`\n`rem = N % g`\n`ans = g * q * (q + 1) // 2`\n`ans += (rem + 1) * (q + 1)`\nReturn `ans`.\n\nThe total sum is `\\sum_{r=0}^{g-1} calc_sum(m - min\\_val[r], g)`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. Initialize `min_val` array of size `g` with infinity, `min_val[0] = 0`.\n3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to fill `min_val`:\n   - Priority queue `pq` stores `(value, remainder)`.\n   - Add `(0, 0)` to `pq`.\n   - While `pq` is not empty:\n     - Pop `(v, r)` with smallest `v`.\n     - If `v > min_val[r]`, continue.\n     - `next_r_plus_a = (r + a) % g`.\n     - If `v + a < min_val[next_r_plus_a]`:\n       - `min_val[next_r_plus_a] = v + a`.\n       - Push `(v + a, next_r_plus_a)` to `pq`.\n     - `next_r_minus_b = (r - b % g + g) % g`.\n     - If `v - b >= 0` and `v - b < min_val[next_r_minus_b]`:\n       - `min_val[next_r_minus_b] = v - b`.\n       - Push `(v - b, next_r_minus_b)` to `pq`.\n     - Note: The `v-b` case is tricky. The problem says \"never jumps on an integer outside `[0, x]`\". `min_val[r]` represents the smallest `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable *and all intermediate steps are non-negative*. So `v-b` must be non-negative. If `v-b < 0`, it's not a valid state for `min_val`.\n       \n4. Implement `calc_sum(N, g)` function:\n   ```python\n   def calc_sum(N, g):\n       if N < 0:\n           return 0\n       q = N // g\n       rem = N % g\n       ans = g * q * (q + 1) // 2\n       ans += (rem + 1) * (q + 1)\n       return ans\n   ```\n5. Calculate the total sum:\n   `total_sum = 0`\n   For `r` from `0` to `g-1`:\n     `total_sum += calc_sum(m - min_val[r], g)`\n6. Print `total_sum`.\n\n**Example 1: m=7, a=5, b=3**\n`g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`.\n`min_val` array of size 1: `min_val[0] = 0`.\nDijkstra:\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\nPop `(0, 0)`.\n  `next_r_plus_a = (0+5)%1 = 0`. `min_val[0]` is `0`. `0+5` is not `< 0`.\n  `next_r_minus_b = (0-3%1+1)%1 = 0`. `0-3 < 0`. Invalid.\nSo `min_val[0] = 0` remains.\n`total_sum = calc_sum(7 - 0, 1)`\n`calc_sum(7, 1)`: `N=7, g=1`. `q=7//1=7`, `rem=7%1=0`.\n`ans = 1 * 7 * (7+1) // 2 = 7 * 8 // 2 = 28`.\n`ans += (0+1) * (7+1) = 1 * 8 = 8`.\n`ans = 28 + 8 = 36`.\nWait, example output is 19. My `f(x)` definition is wrong.\nThe problem states \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means `f(x)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, x]` *if the maximum allowed position is `x`*.\nMy `min_val[r]` is the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable *without ever going below 0*. This is a fixed set of reachable points.\nThe `f(x)` definition is much stricter. It means for each `x`, we have a different set of reachable points.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `f(x)`.\n`f(x)` is the size of `S_x = {p | p \\text{ is reachable from } 0 \\text{ staying in } [0, x]}`.\n`S_x` can be found using BFS/Dijkstra on nodes `0, ..., x`.\nNodes are `0, ..., x`. Edges: `k -> k+a` (if `k+a <= x`), `k -> k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\nThis is `O(x)` for each `f(x)`. `O(m * x)` total, too slow.\n\nObserve the behavior of `f(x)`.\n`f(x)` is non-decreasing.\n`f(x)` is constant for a while, then increases.\nThe values `min_val[r]` computed earlier are for `x = infinity`. Let's call them `min_reach_non_neg[r]`.\nFor a given `x`, the set of reachable points `S_x` is determined by `0` and the allowed jumps.\nThe maximum value of `k` for which `f(k)` can change is `max(a, b)`.\nFor `x` large enough, `f(x)` might become simple.\nThe maximum `min_reach_non_neg[r]` is bounded by `a+b`. Let `MAX_K = max(min_reach_non_neg)`.\nFor `x >= MAX_K`, `f(x)` will be `(x//g + 1) * g` (if all `min_reach_non_neg[r]` are `<= x`).\nNo, `f(x)` is simply `(x // g + 1)` if `g=1` and all points are reachable.\nIf `g=1`, `min_reach_non_neg[0] = 0`. All integers `k >= 0` are reachable without going below `0`.\nSo for `g=1`, `f(x)` is the number of integers `k \\in [0, x]` such that `k` is reachable staying in `[0, x]`.\nIf `a=1`, then any `k \\in [0, x]` is reachable from `0` by `k` jumps of `+1`. No jump `k-b` is needed. So `f(x) = x+1`.\nIf `a=1`, `g=1`. `min_reach_non_neg[0]=0`.\n`calc_sum(m, 1)`: `N=m, g=1`. `q=m, rem=0`.\n`ans = 1 * m * (m+1) // 2 = m*(m+1)//2`.\n`ans += (0+1) * (m+1) = m+1`.\n`total_sum = m*(m+1)//2 + m+1 = (m+1)(m+2)//2`. This is `sum_{i=0}^m (i+1)`.\nThis matches example 2 (`m=10^9, a=1, b=2019`). So the `calc_sum` part is correct for `a=1`.\n\nThe issue is with `min_val[r]`. This should be `min_val[r]` for the full `[0, x]` constraint, not just `[0, infinity)`.\nThe problem states \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means we can only jump `k+a` if `k+a <= x`. And `k-b` if `k-b >= 0`.\nThis implies that the set of reachable points for `x` depends on `x`.\nLet `R_x` be the set of reachable points for a given `x`. `f(x) = |R_x|`.\n`R_x` can be found using a BFS.\n`q = deque([0])`\n`visited = {0}`\n`while q:`\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `if curr + a <= x and curr + a not in visited:`\n    `visited.add(curr + a)`\n    `q.append(curr + a)`\n  `if curr - b >= 0 and curr - b not in visited:`\n    `visited.add(curr - b)`\n    `q.append(curr - b)`\n`f(x) = len(visited)`.\n\nThe crucial observation from similar problems (e.g., Coin problem with limited capacity) is that the reachable states `k` within `[0, x]` can be characterized by `k % g == 0` (where `g = gcd(a, b)`).\nAnd for each `r \\in [0, g-1]`, we are interested in the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable.\nLet `dp[r]` be the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable from `0` *without going below 0*.\nThis is exactly what the Dijkstra finds. `dp[r]` is `min_val[r]` from my previous thought.\n`dp[0] = 0`.\n`dp[r] = infinity` for `r \\ne 0`.\nUse a deque for 0-1 BFS:\n`q = deque()`\n`q.append(0)`\n`while q:`\n  `u = q.popleft()`\n  `# Try to jump +a`\n  `v = u + a`\n  `r_v = v % g`\n  `if v < dp[r_v]:`\n    `dp[r_v] = v`\n    `q.append(v)`\n  `# Try to jump -b`\n  `v = u - b`\n  `r_v = (u - b % g + g) % g`\n  `if v >= 0 and v < dp[r_v]:`\n    `dp[r_v] = v`\n    `q.appendleft(v)` (0-weight edge, so add to front)\nThe maximum value `dp[r]` can take is `a+b`. The states are residues modulo `g`.\nThe max value for `dp[r]` is `a+b` because `a` and `b` are the step sizes. If `a` and `b` are large, `g` can be small.\nThe actual states in the BFS are `0, 1, ..., max(dp)`. The number of reachable states `u` from `0` is bounded by `a+b`.\nThe BFS states should be actual positions, not residues modulo `g`.\nThe maximum value `dp[r]` can reach is `a * b / g - a - b` (Frobenius coin problem upper bound for 2 numbers).\nLet's use the standard Dijkstra:\n`dist[i]` = minimum value `k` such that `k % a == i` and `k` is reachable from `0` by only `+a` and `-b` jumps.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[i] = infinity` for `i \\in [1, a-1]`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\nWhen extracting `(d, u)` from `pq`:\n1. If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n2. Consider `u+b`: `v = (u+b)%a`. `cost = d+b`. If `cost < dist[v]`, update `dist[v] = cost` and add `(cost, v)` to `pq`.\nThis Dijkstra finds the minimum positive `k` such that `k % a == i` and `k` is reachable from `0` by `+a` and `-b` jumps. But it does not ensure that all intermediate steps are non-negative.\nFor example, if `a=5, b=3`. `dist[0]=0`.\nPath `0 -> 0+5=5`. `dist[0]` from `5` is `5`.\nPath `0 -> 0-3` (not allowed).\nPath `0 -> 0+5=5 -> 5-3=2`. `dist[2]` from `2` is `2`.\nPath `0 -> 0+5=5 -> 5+5=10 -> 10-3=7 -> 7-3=4`. `dist[4]` from `4` is `4`.\nPath `0 -> 0+5=5 -> 5+5=10 -> 10+5=15 -> 15-3=12 -> 12-3=9 -> 9-3=6 -> 6-3=3`. `dist[3]` from `3` is `3`.\nPath `0 -> 0+5=5 -> 5+5=10 -> 10-3=7 -> 7-3=4 -> 4+5=9 -> 9-3=6 -> 6-3=3 -> 3+5=8 -> 8-3=5`. No.\nThe `dist[i]` should be the smallest non-negative value `k` such that `k \\equiv i \\pmod a`, and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, *and all intermediate positions are non-negative*. This is exactly the `min_val` from the first approach, but modulo `a` instead of `g`.\nLet `min_reach[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`.\nInitialize `min_reach[0] = 0`, others `infinity`.\nUse Dijkstra with a min-priority queue:\n`pq = [(0, 0)]` (cost, remainder_mod_a)\nWhen extracting `(d, u_rem)` from `pq`:\n1. If `d > min_reach[u_rem]`, continue.\n2. Jump `+a`: `next_d = d + a`. `next_u_rem = u_rem`. If `next_d < min_reach[next_u_rem]`, update and push.\n3. Jump `-b`: `next_d = d - b`. `next_u_rem = (u_rem - b % a + a) % a`. If `next_d >= 0` AND `next_d < min_reach[next_u_rem]`, update and push.\nThis Dijkstra correctly finds `min_reach[r]`. The maximum value in `min_reach` can be `a * b / g`. The number of states is `a`. This takes `O(a log a)` time.\n\nNow, for a given `x`, `f(x)` is the number of integers `k \\in [0, x]` such that `k` is reachable from `0` *staying within `[0, x]`*.\nA point `k` is reachable from `0` staying within `[0, x]` if and only if `k >= min_reach[k % a]` AND for any path from `0` to `k` (using `+a` and `-b` jumps) that doesn't go below `0`, all intermediate points are `<= x`.\nThis is exactly the condition for `min_reach[k%a]` being the minimum *non-negative* value.\nThe problem is that if `k` is reachable by `0 \\to 5 \\to 2`, but `x=3`, `k=2` is reachable. `min_reach[2]` would be `2`. But if `x=1`, `k=2` is not reachable.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values are for `x = infinity`.\nThe constraint \"never jumps on an integer outside `[0, x]`\" means that the set of reachable points changes with `x`.\n\nConsider `dp[k]` as the maximum `x` for which `k` is reachable.\nNo, that's not right either.\n\nLet's look at the example `m=7, a=5, b=3`.\n`g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`.\n`f(0)`: `S_0 = {0}`. `f(0)=1`.\n`f(1)`: `S_1 = {0}`. `f(1)=1`. (Cannot jump to `0+5=5`, cannot jump `0-3`).\n`f(2)`: `S_2 = {0}`. `f(2)=1`.\n`f(3)`: `S_3 = {0}`. `f(3)=1`.\n`f(4)`: `S_4 = {0}`. `f(4)=1`.\n`f(5)`: `S_5 = {0, 5}`. (Can jump `0+5=5`). `f(5)=2`.\n`f(6)`: `S_6 = {0, 5}`. `f(6)=2`.\n`f(7)`: `S_7 = {0, 5}`. Can we reach `2`? `0+5=5`. Can jump `5-3=2`? Yes, `2 \\in [0, 7]`. So `S_7 = {0, 2, 5}`. `f(7)=3`.\nWait, example output says `f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8`. My calculation is wrong for example 1.\nThe example output for `f(5)=3`: `S_5 = {0, 2, 5}`. How is `2` reachable? `0 \\to 5 \\to 2`. Both `5` and `2` are in `[0, 5]`. Yes.\n`f(6)=3`: `S_6 = {0, 2, 5}`.\n`f(7)=8`: `S_7 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`. All numbers in `[0, 7]` are reachable.\nHow to reach `1`? `0 \\to 5 \\to 2 \\to ?` `2+5=7`. `7-3=4`. `4-3=1`. `1 \\in [0,7]`.

This assumes that for any `k \\in [0, x]` that is a multiple of `g`, there is a path from `0` to `k` that stays within `[0, x]`.\nThis is true if `x` is large enough. The maximum value `max_val_in_min_reach` is about `max(a, b)`.\nIf `x >= max(a, b)` (and `g=1`), then `f(x) = x+1`.\nFor `a=5, b=3, m=7`. `g=1`.\n`min_reach[0] = 0`.\n`pq = [(0,0)]`\nPop `(0,0)`.\n `(0+5, 0%1)=(5,0)`. `min_reach[0]` is still `0`.\n `(0-3, 0%1)` is negative.\nThis means `min_reach[0]=0` is the only value.\nSo for `x >= 0`, `f(x)` is `x // 1 + 1 = x+1`.\nThis still gives `f(0)=1, f(1)=2, ..., f(7)=8`.\nSum `1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36`. This is wrong for example 1.\n\nThe critical part is \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means that the BFS for `f(x)` is restricted to `[0, x]`.\nThe `min_reach` values I computed are for `x = infinity`.\nLet's call the `min_reach` values `min_val_inf[r]`.\nFor `x` sufficiently large (e.g., `x >= a+b`), we can reach any `k` such that `k \\ge min_val_inf[k % g]` and `k \\le x`.\nThe value of `x` where this behavior starts is `k_0`.\nFor `x < k_0`, `f(x)` is not simply `(x - min_val_inf[r]) // g + 1`.\n\nLet `reachable[k]` be the minimum `x` required for `k` to be reachable from `0` staying within `[0, x]`.\nIf `k=0`, `reachable[0]=0`.\nOtherwise, `reachable[k]` is `max(k, reachable[k-a])` if `k-a` is reachable, or `max(k, reachable[k+b])` if `k+b` is reachable.\nThis is a complex state.\n\nLet's use the `min_reach[r]` definition as the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`. This is the standard definition for \"Frobenius Coin Problem\" type questions.\nThe Dijkstra for `min_reach[r]` (modulo `a`):\n`min_reach[0] = 0`, `min_reach[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, a-1]`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\nWhile `pq`:\n  `d, u_rem = heappop(pq)`\n  If `d > min_reach[u_rem]`, continue.\n  `# Jump +b`\n  `v_rem = (u_rem + b) % a`\n  `cost = d + b`\n  If `cost < min_reach[v_rem]`:\n    `min_reach[v_rem] = cost`\n    `heappush(pq, (cost, v_rem))`\n  `# Jump -a`\n  `v_rem = u_rem` (because `u_rem - a` is still `u_rem` mod `a`)\n  `cost = d - a`\n  If `cost >= 0` and `cost < min_reach[v_rem]`:\n    `min_reach[v_rem] = cost`\n    `heappush(pq, (cost, v_rem))` (This is a 0-weight edge if `a` is the modulus, not `g`)\nThis is the standard Dijkstra for finding minimum `k` for each `k % a`. The edge weights are `b` and `-a`.\nThis Dijkstra is incorrect if `-a` is treated as a 0-weight edge. It should be `dist[u] + a` to reach `u+a` and `dist[u] + b` to reach `u+b`.\nThe correct Dijkstra for `min_reach[r]` (min non-negative `k` for `k \\equiv r \\pmod g`):\n`min_reach[0] = 0`, `min_reach[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, g-1]`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]` (cost, remainder_mod_g)\nWhile `pq`:\n  `d, u_rem = heappop(pq)`\n  If `d > min_reach[u_rem]`, continue.\n  `# Jump +a`\n  `v_rem_a = (u_rem + a) % g`\n  `cost_a = d + a`\n  If `cost_a < min_reach[v_rem_a]`:\n    `min_reach[v_rem_a] = cost_a`\n    `heappush(pq, (cost_a, v_rem_a))`\n  `# Jump -b`\n  `v_rem_b = (u_rem - b % g + g) % g`\n  `cost_b = d - b`\n  If `cost_b >= 0` and `cost_b < min_reach[v_rem_b]`:\n    `min_reach[v_rem_b] = cost_b`\n    `heappush(pq, (cost_b, v_rem_b))`\n\nThis `min_reach` array (let's call it `dp`) stores `dp[r]` = minimum non-negative `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`. The maximum value in `dp` is at most `a+b`. Let `K_MAX = max(dp)`.\nFor any `x >= K_MAX`, `f(x)` is the number of integers `k \\in [0, x]` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` for some `r` where `dp[r] \\le k`.\nSince `k \\ge dp[r]` is always true for `k \\ge K_MAX`, `f(x)` is simply the number of multiples of `g` in `[0, x]`, which is `x // g + 1`. This is for `x >= K_MAX`.\n\nSo we can split the sum `\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` into two parts:\n1. `\\sum_{i=0}^{K_{MAX}-1} f(i)`: For `i` up to `K_{MAX}-1`, we need to compute `f(i)` explicitly.\n2. `\\sum_{i=K_{MAX}}^{m} (i // g + 1)`: For `i` from `K_{MAX}` to `m`, `f(i)` is `i // g + 1`. This can be computed using `calc_sum(m, g) - calc_sum(K_{MAX}-1, g)`.\n\nThe first part `\\sum_{i=0}^{K_{MAX}-1} f(i)`:\n`K_{MAX}` can be up to `a+b`. Max `a, b` is `10^5`, so `K_{MAX}` can be `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nWe can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `K_{MAX}-1` using BFS.\n`reachable_points = [False] * (K_MAX)`\n`reachable_points[0] = True`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`count = 1`\n`f_values = [0] * K_MAX`\n`f_values[0] = 1`\n`curr_max_reachable = 0`\n\nThis is still not right. `f(i)` is `|S_i|`. `S_i` is the set of points reachable staying in `[0, i]`.\n`f(i)` needs to be computed for each `i`.\nIterate `i` from `0` to `K_{MAX}-1`.\nFor each `i`, we need `f(i)`.\n`f(i)` can be computed by starting a BFS from `0` and only allowing jumps that stay in `[0, i]`.\nThis is `O(K_MAX * K_MAX)`, too slow if `K_MAX` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\n\nThe trick is that `f(i)` can be computed incrementally.\nWhen going from `f(i-1)` to `f(i)`:\nThe set `S_i` includes `S_{i-1}`.\nAdditionally, `i` itself might become reachable.\nAnd points `p` that were previously unreachable because `p+a > i-1` but now `p+a = i` might become reachable.\nLet `R` be the set of reachable points for the current `x`.\nWhen `x` increments to `x+1`:\n1. `R` remains the same.\n2. If `x+1` is reachable from some `p \\in R` via `p+a = x+1` or `p-b = x+1` (but this is impossible, `p-b < p`), then `x+1` is added to `R`.\n3. If `x+1` is added to `R`, then other points might become reachable from `x+1`.\nThis looks like a BFS that extends its range.\nLet `is_reachable[k]` be `True` if `k` is reachable staying in `[0, x]`.\nMaintain `is_reachable` array up to `K_MAX`.\n`is_reachable = [False] * (K_MAX + a + b)` (to allow temporary jumps outside `K_MAX`)\n`is_reachable[0] = True`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`current_f = 1`\n`total_sum = 0`\n`max_val_in_dp = max(dp)` (computed by Dijkstra)\n\nFor `i` from `0` to `min(m, max_val_in_dp + a + b)`:\n  `# Add i to the set of reachable points if it becomes reachable`\n  `# This means checking if i-a or i+b is reachable`\n  `# If i-a >= 0 and is_reachable[i-a] then i is reachable`\n  `# If i+b < K_MAX (or some limit) and is_reachable[i+b] then i is reachable`\n  `# (The second case is not how BFS works, it's about extending from existing points)`\n\nLet's maintain `reachable_set` and `q_bfs`.\n`reachable_set = {0}`\n`q_bfs = deque([0])`\n`f_val = 1`\n`sum_f = 0`\n`MAX_A_B = max(a, b)`\n`limit = min(m, 2 * MAX_A_B + g)` (A heuristic limit for the explicit computation)\n`limit = min(m, max_val_in_dp + a + b)` (This is a more robust limit)\n\nFor `i` from `0` to `limit`:\n  `while q_bfs:`\n    `curr = q_bfs.popleft()`\n    `# Check jump +a`\n    `next_pos_a = curr + a`\n    `if next_pos_a <= i and next_pos_a not in reachable_set:`\n      `reachable_set.add(next_pos_a)`\n      `f_val += 1`\n      `q_bfs.append(next_pos_a)`\n    `# Check jump -b`\n    `next_pos_b = curr - b`\n    `if next_pos_b >= 0 and next_pos_b not in reachable_set:`\n      `reachable_set.add(next_pos_b)`\n      `f_val += 1`\n      `q_bfs.append(next_pos_b)`\n  `sum_f += f_val`\n  `# Re-add points to q_bfs that might enable new jumps because x increased to i+1`\n  `# This is not how BFS works.

So we only care about `k <= m`.\nThe maximum `k` for which `dist[k]` is finite is `max(min_reach_mod_g) + a + b`.\nThe `min_reach_mod_g` values are bounded by `max(a, b)`.\nSo `max(min_reach_mod_g)` is bounded by `max(a, b)`.\nThus `K_LIMIT` (the max `k` for which `dist[k]` should be computed) is bounded by `max(a, b) + a + b`.\nThis is `2*max(a, b) + min(a, b)`. Max value `3 * 10^5`.\nThe `dist` array size is `3 * 10^5`. Dijkstra is `O((a+b) log (a+b))`.\nThis is efficient enough.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Initialize `dist` array of size `3 * 10^5 + 5` (a bit generous) with infinity.\n2. `dist[0] = 0`.\n3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm with a min-priority queue:\n   `pq = [(0, 0)]` (min_x_required, position)\n   `max_k_to_consider = 2 * max(a,b) + min(a,b) + 1` (This is `max_dp_val + a + b + 1` from my analysis, where `max_dp_val` is bounded by `max(a,b)`).\n   While `pq` is not empty:\n     Pop `(x_req, k)` with smallest `x_req`.\n     If `x_req > dist[k]`, continue.\n     `# Jump +a`\n     `next_k_a = k + a`\n     If `next_k_a < max_k_to_consider`:\n       `next_x_req_a = max(x_req, next_k_a)`\n       If `next_x_req_a < dist[next_k_a]`:\n         `dist[next_k_a] = next_x_req_a`\n         `heappush(pq, (next_x_req_a, next_k_a))`\n     `# Jump -b`\n     `next_k_b = k - b`\n     If `next_k_b >= 0`:\n       `next_x_req_b = x_req`\n       If `next_x_req_b < dist[next_k_b]`:\n         `dist[next_k_b] = next_x_req_b`\n         `heappush(pq, (next_x_req_b, next_k_b))`\n4. Calculate `total_sum = 0`.\n   For `k` from `0` to `min(m, max_k_to_consider - 1)`:\n     If `dist[k]` is finite (not infinity):\n       `total_sum += max(0, m - dist[k] + 1)`\n5. Print `total_sum`.\n\nWait, the bound `max_k_to_consider` for `k` in the Dijkstra.\nThe maximum `k` value for which `dist[k]` can be finite is `a * b / g` (Frobenius number for `a,b` when `g=1`) plus `a` or `b`.\nThe true bound is `a+b`. The `max_k_to_consider` can be `a+b`.\nThe `min_reach_mod_g` values are bounded by `max(a,b)`. This is not correct. They are bounded by `a*b/g`.\nFor example, if `a=100, b=101, g=1`. `min_reach[r]` can be up to `100*101 - 100 - 101 = 9999-201 = 9798`.\nSo `max_k_to_consider` should be `a*b/g + a + b`.\nThis can be `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^{10}`. This is too large for the `dist` array.\n\nThe constraint `m <= 10^9`, `a,b <= 10^5`.\nIf `a, b` are large, `g` can be small.\nIf `g=1`, then `a*b/g` can be `10^{10}`.\nThe `dist` array must be bounded by `a+b` or `2*max(a,b)`.\nThe number of distinct reachable points `k` such that `dist[k]` is finite, and `k` is less than `a+b`, is at most `a+b`.\nThe maximum value in `dist` array is `m`.\nThe `dist` values are `x_req`.\nThe `k` values in `dist[k]` can go up to `m`.\nThe Dijkstra must run for `k` up to `m`. This is `O(m log m)`. Too slow.\n\nThe `max_k_to_consider` must be small. Let's call it `C`.\nFor `k > C`, `dist[k]` must follow a pattern.\nFor `k > C`, `dist[k] = k` (if `k` is reachable and `g=1`).\nThe `min_reach[r]` (modulo `g`) values are bounded by `max(a,b)`. This is a property of `min_reach` values if `g=1`.\nIf `g=1`, then `min_reach[r]` values for `r \\in [0, a-1]` are bounded by `a*b/g - a - b` (Frobenius number for `a,b`).\nThis means that for `k > a*b/g - a - b`, all `k` are reachable without going below 0.\nLet `F = a*b/g - a - b` (Frobenius number for `a/g, b/g` scaled by `g`).\nFor `k > F`, `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`.\nLet `C = max(a,b)`.\nThe `dist[k]` values are `k` if `k` is reachable by only `+a` jumps.\nIf `a=1`, `dist[k]=k`. Sum is `(m+1)(m+2)/2`.\nIf `b=1`, `dist[k]=k` for `k` reachable.\nThe `max_k_to_consider` is actually `a+b`.\nThe number of states in Dijkstra is `a+b`. `dist` array size is `a+b`.\nThis is because if `k > a+b`, then `k` can be reduced to `k-a` or `k-b` without going below `0`.\nA state `k` in Dijkstra represents the position.\nThe `x_req` is the minimum `x` needed.\nIf `k > a+b`, then `k-a > b` and `k-b > a`.\nThe maximum value `k` can take in the `dist` array is `a+b`. For `k > a+b`, `dist[k]` will be `k`.\nThis is not necessarily true. `dist[k]` can be `k'` where `k' > k`. E.g., `dist[2]=5` for `a=5, b=3`.\nThe `max_k_to_consider` should be `max(a, b) + max(a, b)`. No, it should be `a+b`.\nLet's use `K_UPPER = a + b`.\nThe Dijkstra only needs to compute `dist[k]` for `k` up to `K_UPPER`.\nFor `k > K_UPPER`, `dist[k]` will be `k` if `k` is a multiple of `g`.\nThis is because for `k > K_UPPER`, `k-a >= 0` and `k-b >= 0`.\nIf `k > K_UPPER`, and `k` is a multiple of `g`, then `k` can be reached from `k-a` or `k-b`.\nIf `k-a` is reachable with `x_req = k-a`, then `k` is reachable with `x_req = k`.\nThis implies `dist[k] = k` for `k > K_UPPER` and `k % g == 0`.\nSo, the `dist` array only needs to store values up to `K_UPPER = a+b`.\nFor `k > K_UPPER` and `k % g == 0`, `dist[k] = k`.\nThe `total_sum` calculation:\n`total_sum = 0`\nFor `k` from `0` to `K_UPPER`:\n  If `dist[k]` is finite:\n    `total_sum += max(0, m - dist[k] + 1)`\n`# Now handle k from K_UPPER + 1 to m`\n`# These are k such that k % g == 0`\n`# For these k, dist[k] = k`\n`# So we sum max(0, m - k + 1)`\nFor `k` from `K_UPPER + 1` to `m`:\n  If `k % g == 0`:\n    `total_sum += max(0, m - k + 1)`\nThis second part is `\\sum_{j=(K_UPPER+1)//g}^{m//g} (m - j*g + 1)`.\nLet `first_j_idx = (K_UPPER + 1 + g - 1) // g * g`. (Smallest multiple of `g` greater than `K_UPPER`)\nIf `first_j_idx > m`, this sum is `0`.\nOtherwise, `k` goes `first_j_idx, first_j_idx + g, ..., last_j_idx`.\nThis is `\\sum_{p=0}^{(m - first_j_idx) // g} (m - (first_j_idx + p*g) + 1)`.\nThis is an arithmetic progression.\n`\\sum_{p=0}^{N} (A - p*g)` where `A = m - first_j_idx + 1`.\n`N = (m - first_j_idx) // g`.\nSum is `(N+1)*A - g * N*(N+1)//2`.\nThis is `calc_sum(m - (K_UPPER+1), g)` essentially.\nNo, it's `calc_sum(m - (K_UPPER+1), g)` but for a fixed `dist[k]=k`.\nLet `N_start = K_UPPER + 1`.\n`count_func(N) = N+1`. `sum_{i=X}^{m} (i//g+1)`\nThe sum `\\sum_{k=N_{start}, k\\%g=0}^{m} (m-k+1)` can be computed as:\nLet `k_0 = (N_start + g - 1) // g * g`. If `k_0 > m`, sum is `0`.\n`num_terms = (m - k_0) // g + 1`.\nThe terms are `m - k_0 + 1`, `m - (k_0+g) + 1`, ..., `m - (k_0 + (num_terms-1)g) + 1`.\nThis is an arithmetic series: `a_1 = m - k_0 + 1`, `d = -g`, `n = num_terms`.\nSum = `n * (2*a_1 + (n-1)*d) / 2`.\nThis part can be computed in `O(1)`.\n\nSo, `K_UPPER = a+b` is the correct bound. `dist` array size `2 \\cdot 10^5`. Dijkstra `O((a+b) log (a+b))`.\nThis is feasible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate gcd\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Function to calculate the sum of f(i) for i from K_UPPER_PLUS_1 to m\n# where f(i) = (i // g + 1)\ndef sum_arithmetic_progression(m, g, k_upper_plus_1):\n    # We need to sum (m - k + 1) for k from k_upper_plus_1 to m, where k % g == 0\n    # Let k_0 be the smallest multiple of g >= k_upper_plus_1\n    k_0 = ((k_upper_plus_1 + g - 1) // g) * g\n\n    if k_0 > m:\n        return 0\n\n    # The terms are: (m - k_0 + 1), (m - (k_0 + g) + 1), ..., (m - (k_0 + (num_terms-1)*g) + 1)\n    # This is an arithmetic progression with:\n    # first_term = m - k_0 + 1\n    # common_difference = -g\n    # num_terms = (m - k_0) // g + 1\n\n    first_term = m - k_0 + 1\n    num_terms = (m - k_0) // g + 1\n\n    # Sum = n * (2*a_1 + (n-1)*d) / 2\n    total_sum = num_terms * (2 * first_term + (num_terms - 1) * (-g)) // 2\n    return total_sum\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # K_UPPER is the maximum k for which we explicitly compute dist[k]\n    # Beyond K_UPPER, dist[k] = k for k % g == 0\n    # A safe upper bound for K_UPPER is a+b.\n    # The actual max value of k for which dist[k] can be different from k\n    # is bounded by a*b/g + a + b.
