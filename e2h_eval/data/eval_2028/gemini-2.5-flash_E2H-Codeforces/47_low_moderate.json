    "thought": "**Solving the \"Neko Does Maths\" Problem: Minimizing LCM**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Neko Does Maths\" problem. The objective is clear: find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a + k` and `b + k`.  Essentially, I need to minimize `lcm(a+k, b+k)`.  \n\nMy initial thought is to transform this problem by setting `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`. Then I can rewrite the LCM as `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. The relationship between x and y is key:  `y - x = b - a`, which I'll call `d`.\n\nI've got a good handle on some edge cases too. If `a` equals `b`, then the LCM is simply `a + k`.  Therefore, the smallest k is 0 and the LCM is `a`.  If `a > b` I'll just swap them since the LCM is symmetric.\n\nNow, assuming `a <= b`, `d` is non-negative.  Since `x = a + k`, I know that `x >= a`. The next step is to understand how to express `lcm(x, x+d)`. The GCD simplifies things;  `gcd(x, x+d)` is actually `gcd(x, d)`. So the LCM becomes `(x * (x+d)) / gcd(x, d)`.\n\nThis is where the real insight comes in. Let `g = gcd(x, d)`. I can express `x` and `d` as multiples of `g`. `x = m * g` and `d = n * g`, where `gcd(m, n) = 1`. Substituting this back into the LCM expression is neat!  `lcm(x, x+d)` simplifies to `m * g * (m+n)`. This further transforms to `(x * (x + d)) / g`.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through all possible values of `g`, divisors of `d`. For each `g`, I need to find the smallest suitable value of `x` (knowing `x = a+k >=a`) such that `gcd(x, d) = g`. Since `g` must be a divisor of `d`, I'll check that `x` is a multiple of `g`. That helps in the calculation of `m`. Once I find such an `x`, `k` can be easily derived using `k = x - a`.  I'll keep track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k`. This iteration will give me the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\nLet `diff = b - a`. If `a > b`, we can swap `a` and `b` because `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is symmetric. So, without loss of generality, assume `a <= b`. Then `diff = b - a >= 0`.\nWe have `y = x + diff`.\nSo we want to minimize `lcm(x, x + diff) = (x * (x + diff)) / gcd(x, x + diff)`.\nA fundamental property of GCD is `gcd(A, B) = gcd(A, B-A)`. Applying this, `gcd(x, x + diff) = gcd(x, diff)`.\nThus, we need to minimize `(x * (x + diff)) / gcd(x, diff)`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(x, diff)`. This implies that `g` must be a divisor of `diff`.\nAlso, `x` must be a multiple of `g`. So `x = m * g` for some integer `m`.\nSince `k = x - a`, we need `k >= 0`, which means `x >= a`.\nSubstituting `x = m * g` into the LCM expression:\n`lcm(x, x + diff) = (m * g * (m * g + diff)) / g = m * (m * g + diff)`.\nSince `g` is a divisor of `diff`, let `diff = n * g` for some integer `n`.\nThen `lcm(x, x + diff) = m * (m * g + n * g) = m * g * (m + n)`.\nThis can also be written as `(x/g) * x + (x/g) * diff = (x/g) * (x + diff)`.\n\nThe strategy is to iterate through all possible values of `g`. Since `g` must be a divisor of `diff = b - a`, we can find all divisors of `diff`.\nFor each divisor `g` of `diff`:\n1. We need `x` to be a multiple of `g`.\n2. We need `x >= a`.\n3. We want to minimize `(x * (x + diff)) / g`.\n\nTo minimize `(x * (x + diff)) / g` for a fixed `g`, we should choose the smallest possible `x` that satisfies `x >= a` and `x` is a multiple of `g`.\nThe smallest multiple of `g` that is greater than or equal to `a` is `g * ceil(a / g)`.\nLet `x_candidate = g * ceil(a / g)`.\nThis can be calculated as `x_candidate = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g`. (Using integer division)\nIf `a` is already a multiple of `g`, then `x_candidate = a`. Otherwise, `x_candidate` is the smallest multiple of `g` strictly greater than `a`.\n\nSo, for each divisor `g` of `diff`:\n1. Calculate `x_candidate = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g`.\n2. Calculate the `lcm_value = (x_candidate * (x_candidate + diff)) // g`.\n3. Calculate `k_value = x_candidate - a`.\n4. Keep track of the minimum `lcm_value` found so far, and the corresponding smallest `k_value`.\n\nEdge case: If `diff = 0` (i.e., `a = b`), then `gcd(x, diff) = gcd(x, 0) = x`.\n`lcm(x, x) = (x * x) / x = x`.\nTo minimize `x = a+k`, we choose `k=0`. The minimum LCM is `a`.\nOur formula works: `diff = 0`. Divisors of 0 are technically all integers, but in `gcd(x, 0) = x`, `g` is `x`.\nIf we iterate divisors of `diff` (which is 0), this approach might be problematic.\nHowever, `gcd(x, diff)` implies `g` is a divisor of `diff`. If `diff = 0`, then `gcd(x, 0) = x`.\nThe expression `(x * (x + diff)) / gcd(x, diff)` becomes `(x * x) / x = x`.\nWe need to minimize `x = a+k` for `k >= 0`. The minimum `x` is `a` when `k=0`. So, `min_lcm = a` and `min_k = 0`.\nThe code should handle `diff = 0` separately or ensure divisor finding handles it. A common way to handle `diff=0` is to just return `k=0`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read `a` and `b`.\n2. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3. If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b`.\n4. Calculate `diff = b - a`.\n5. Initialize `min_lcm_overall = infinity` and `min_k_overall = 0`. (Smallest `k` is preferred, so if `min_k_overall` is initialized to 0, it will be chosen if `k=0` yields the minimum LCM).\n6. Find all divisors of `diff`. We only need to check up to `sqrt(diff)`.\n   For each `i` from `1` to `sqrt(diff)`:\n   If `i` divides `diff`:\n     `g = i` and `g_prime = diff // i`.\n     Consider both `g` and `g_prime` as potential `gcd(x, diff)` values.\n     For each `current_g` (which is `g` or `g_prime`):\n       a. Calculate `x_candidate = ((a + current_g - 1) // current_g) * current_g`.\n       b. Calculate `current_lcm = (x_candidate * (x_candidate + diff)) // current_g`.\n       c. Calculate `current_k = x_candidate - a`.\n       d. If `current_lcm < min_lcm_overall`:\n          `min_lcm_overall = current_lcm`\n          `min_k_overall = current_k`\n       e. Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm_overall`:\n          `min_k_overall = min(min_k_overall, current_k)`\n7. Print `min_k_overall`.\n\nThe maximum value of `a, b` is `10^9`. So `diff` can be up to `10^9`.\n`sqrt(10^9)` is approximately `31622`. Iterating up to `sqrt(diff)` is efficient enough.\n`x_candidate` can be up to `10^9 + 10^9 = 2 * 10^9`.\n`lcm_value` can be up to `(2 * 10^9 * 2 * 10^9) / 1 = 4 * 10^{18}`. This fits within a standard 64-bit integer type (Python integers handle arbitrary size, so no overflow issues).\n\nExample 1: `a=6, b=10`\n1. `a=6, b=10`. Not equal. Not `a > b`.\n2. `diff = 10 - 6 = 4`.\n3. `min_lcm_overall = infinity`, `min_k_overall = 0`.\n4. Divisors of `4`:\n   - `i = 1`: `g = 1`, `g_prime = 4`.\n     - `current_g = 1`:\n       `x_candidate = ((6 + 1 - 1) // 1) * 1 = 6`.\n       `current_lcm = (6 * (6 + 4)) // 1 = 6 * 10 = 60`.\n       `current_k = 6 - 6 = 0`.\n       `min_lcm_overall = 60`, `min_k_overall = 0`.\n     - `current_g = 4`:\n       `x_candidate = ((6 + 4 - 1) // 4) * 4 = (9 // 4) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`.\n       `current_lcm = (8 * (8 + 4)) // 4 = (8 * 12) // 4 = 96 // 4 = 24`.\n       `current_k = 8 - 6 = 2`.\n       `current_lcm (24) < min_lcm_overall (60)`.\n       `min_lcm_overall = 24`, `min_k_overall = 2`.\n   - `i = 2`: `g = 2`, `g_prime = 2`.\n     - `current_g = 2`:\n       `x_candidate = ((6 + 2 - 1) // 2) * 2 = (7 // 2) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`.\n       `current_lcm = (6 * (6 + 4)) // 2 = (6 * 10) // 2 = 60 // 2 = 30`.\n       `current_k = 6 - 6 = 0`.\n       `current_lcm (30) > min_lcm_overall (24)`. No update.\n5. Print `min_k_overall = 2`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    diff = b - a\n\n    min_lcm_overall = float('inf')\n    min_k_overall = 0\n\n    # Iterate through divisors of diff\n    # We only need to check up to sqrt(diff)\n    # Each divisor i gives two potential gcd values: i and diff // i\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            divisors = [i]\n            if i * i != diff:\n                divisors.append(diff // i)\n            \n            for current_g in divisors:\n                # x_candidate is the smallest multiple of current_g that is >= a\n                # This is equivalent to current_g * ceil(a / current_g)\n                x_candidate = ((a + current_g - 1) // current_g) * current_g\n                \n                # Calculate LCM for this x_candidate and current_g\n                # lcm(x, x+diff) = (x * (x+diff)) / gcd(x, diff)\n                # Here, x = x_candidate, gcd(x, diff) = current_g\n                current_lcm = (x_candidate * (x_candidate + diff)) // current_g\n                \n                # Calculate k for this x_candidate\n                current_k = x_candidate - a\n\n                # Update min_lcm_overall and min_k_overall\n                if current_lcm < min_lcm_overall:\n                    min_lcm_overall = current_lcm\n                    min_k_overall = current_k\n                elif current_lcm == min_lcm_overall:\n                    # If LCMs are equal, choose the smallest k\n                    min_k_overall = min(min_k_overall, current_k)\n\n    print(min_k_overall)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
