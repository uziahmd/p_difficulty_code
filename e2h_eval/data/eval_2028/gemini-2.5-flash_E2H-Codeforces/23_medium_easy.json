            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is figuring out the minimum number of tile draws needed to form a \"mentsu,\" which is either a \"koutsu\" (three identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (three sequential tiles of the same suit).  We're given three initial tiles, and we can draw any number of additional tiles. The crucial bit is recognizing that we're guaranteed a solution within at most *two* draws. That immediately sets the framework: test for zero draws being sufficient, then one, and if those fail, declare victory with two draws.\n\n**Data Representation and Initial Analysis**\n\nFirst, let's get a clean representation of the input. Each tile has a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, or s). I'll represent the tiles as tuples: `(number, suit)`. Sorting the tiles is a smart move.  Sorting by suit first, and then by number within the suit, makes sequence detection much easier, especially for shuntsu. For example, if we have [3p, 9m, 2p], after sorting, we'd get [(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')].\n\n**Zero Draws - Checking for Mentsu with Existing Hand**\n\nThe simplest scenario is where the three initial tiles already form a mentsu.  So, we need to check two conditions:\n\n1.  **Koutsu Check:** Are all three tiles identical?  `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`\n2.  **Shuntsu Check:** Are the tiles a sequence (same suit and consecutive numbers)? The tiles must share the same suit, and after sorting the numbers, the difference between consecutive numbers should be 1. After sorting, if `n2 == n1 + 1` and `n3 == n2 + 1`, then it's a shuntsu.\n\n**One Draw - Can a Single Tile Complete a Mentsu?**\n\nIf zero draws don't cut it, we move to one draw. The challenge here is efficiently checking whether *adding* one tile can create a mentsu. We need to find a tile t\\_draw which, when combined with our current three, results in some subset of four tiles forming a koutsu or shuntsu. We can look at what situations of pairs can be made into a mentsu with a single additional tile:\n\n1.  **Koutsu Potential:** If we have two identical tiles (e.g., [1m, 1m]), drawing the same tile completes the koutsu.  So, check if any pair from our three tiles is identical.\n2.  **Shuntsu Potential:** If we have two tiles of the same suit which are consecutive(e.g., `[1m, 2m]`, we can draw `3m`) or which differ by 2 (e.g. `[1m, 3m]` we can draw `2m`.\n\nInstead of checking 27 potential drawn tiles one-by-one, we can look at all pairs in the existing hand. This optimizes the process, reducing it to a few simple comparison steps, and if those checks fail, we are left to declare that 2 draws will be needed.\n\n**Two Draws - The Guaranteed Solution**\n\nIf zero and one draws don't work, we *know* we can get a mentsu with two draws. Why? Because you can always take the first tile in hand and draw two more instances of it to build a koutsu. The problem specifically states you can draw tiles already in your hand, so we can always achieve this result.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nSo, the plan:\n\n1.  Parse input into tuples (number, suit).\n2.  Sort tiles by suit, then number.\n3.  Check if 0 draws are needed (koutsu or shuntsu with existing hand).\n4.  If not, check if 1 draw is needed based on pair comparisons for koutsu/shuntsu potential.\n5.  If not, print 2 (two draws).\n\nThis should be a fast, efficient solution. The logic for the \"1 draw\" scenario needs to be tight to avoid unnecessary computations, and the \"2 draw\" scenario is straightforward because of the problem constraint.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). She starts with three tiles. A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She can draw any tiles, and the supply is infinite.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws, which means we should check for 0 draws, then 1 draw, and if neither is sufficient, the answer must be 2.\n\nLet the three tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile is represented as a (number, suit) tuple, e.g., \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\n**1. Case 0 Draws:**\nCan Tokitsukaze form a mentsu with her current three tiles?\n-   **Koutsu Check:** Are all three tiles identical? `t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`.\n-   **Shuntsu Check:** Are all three tiles of the same suit AND their numbers are sequential (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`)? To check this, we sort the numbers of the three tiles and see if they form a consecutive sequence.\n\nIf either of these conditions is true, the answer is 0.\n\n**2. Case 1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can she form a mentsu by drawing one tile? This means if she draws a tile `t_new`, then among `t1, t2, t3, t_new`, there must be at least three tiles that form a mentsu. This can happen in two ways:\n\n-   **To complete a Koutsu:** If she has two identical tiles among `t1, t2, t3` (e.g., `[1m, 1m, 5p]`), she can draw a third identical tile (`1m`) to form a koutsu `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\n    -   Check if `t1 == t2` OR `t1 == t3` OR `t2 == t3`. If any pair is identical, 1 draw is sufficient.\n\n-   **To complete a Shuntsu:** If she has two tiles of the same suit among `t1, t2, t3` that are either consecutive (e.g., `[1m, 2m, 5p]`) or have a gap of one (e.g., `[1m, 3m, 5p]`).\n    -   Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles `(t_i, t_j)` from `t1, t2, t3`.\n    -   If `t_i` and `t_j` are of the same suit:\n        -   If their numbers differ by 1 (e.g., `1m, 2m`): She can draw the tile `(n-1, suit)` (if `n > 1`) or `(n+2, suit)` (if `n+1 < 9`) to complete a shuntsu. For example, with `1m, 2m`, she can draw `3m` to get `[1m, 2m, 3m]`.\n        -   If their numbers differ by 2 (e.g., `1m, 3m`): She can draw the middle tile `(n+1, suit)` to complete a shuntsu. For example, with `1m, 3m`, she can draw `2m` to get `[1m, 2m, 3m]`.\n    -   If any such pair exists, 1 draw is sufficient.\n\nIf any of these conditions (for koutsu or shuntsu with 1 draw) is true, the answer is 1.\n\n**3. Case 2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 draws nor 1 draw is enough, the answer must be 2. This is because Tokitsukaze can always form a mentsu with 2 draws. For example, she can pick any tile from her hand (say `t1`) and draw two more tiles identical to `t1`. This will form a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (3p 9m 2p):**\nInput tiles: `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')`\n\n1.  **0 Draws Check:**\n    -   **Koutsu:** Are `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')` identical? No.\n    -   **Shuntsu:** Are they all same suit? No (`p`, `m`, `p`).\n    Result: 0 draws is not enough.\n\n2.  **1 Draw Check:**\n    -   **Koutsu completion:** Are there any two identical tiles?\n        -   `(3, 'p') == (9, 'm')`? No.\n        -   `(3, 'p') == (2, 'p')`? No.\n        -   `(9, 'm') == (2, 'p')`? No.\n        Result: Cannot form a koutsu with 1 draw from an existing pair.\n\n    -   **Shuntsu completion:** Check pairs:\n        -   Pair `((3, 'p'), (9, 'm'))`: Different suits. Skip.\n        -   Pair `((3, 'p'), (2, 'p'))`: Same suit ('p'). Numbers are 3 and 2. Difference is `abs(3-2) = 1`. This pair can form a shuntsu with one draw (e.g., draw `1p` to get `[1p, 2p, 3p]` or `4p` to get `[2p, 3p, 4p]`).\n        Result: 1 draw is sufficient. Print 1.\n\nThe provided solution implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to parse a tile string into a (number, suit) tuple\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\n# Function to check if three tiles form a koutsu (triplet)\ndef is_koutsu(t_list):\n    # A koutsu must have exactly 3 tiles\n    if len(t_list) != 3:\n        return False\n    # All three tiles must be identical\n    return t_list[0] == t_list[1] and t_list[1] == t_list[2]\n\n# Function to check if three tiles form a shuntsu (sequence)\ndef is_shuntsu(t_list):\n    # A shuntsu must have exactly 3 tiles\n    if len(t_list) != 3:\n        return False\n    # All three tiles must be of the same suit\n    if not (t_list[0][1] == t_list[1][1] and t_list[1][1] == t_list[2][1]):\n        return False\n    # Their numbers must be sequential (e.g., n, n+1, n+2)\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in t_list])\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\n# Main function to solve the problem\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three tile strings from input\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    # Parse them into a list of (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = [parse_tile(s) for s in input_line]\n\n    # --- Case 0 Draws ---\n    # Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu\n    if is_koutsu(tiles) or is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Case 1 Draw ---\n    # Check if drawing one tile can complete a mentsu.\n    # This involves checking if any pair of existing tiles can form a mentsu with one drawn tile.\n\n    # 1.
