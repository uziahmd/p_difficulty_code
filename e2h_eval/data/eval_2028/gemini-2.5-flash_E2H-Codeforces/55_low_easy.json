Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Invariant Nature of '0' and '2'**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the lexicographically smallest string after allowed swaps.  The core idea just clicked, and it's all about the *relative immutability* of '0' and '2'. I'm seeing that '1's are basically the free agents, the intermediaries. '0' can swap with '1', '2' can swap with '1', but '0' and '2' can *never* directly swap.\n\nThis is the key. No matter how many '1's are in the string and how much swapping occurs, the order of any '0' and any '2' *will always be preserved*. If a '0' is initially before a '2', that order remains fixed. This '0' and '2' interaction is the fundamental constraint. '1' is the flexible element that can rearrange between them.\n\nSo, if I've got a string, what I actually need to do is preserve the initial relative orders of '0' and '2'.  '1' can roam free. I can reorder all the '0's amongst themselves, all the '2's amongst themselves, and all the '1's amongst themselves. But I can't move a '0' to the right of a '2' or vice-versa. That's the core of the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means '0's and '1's can reorder among themselves. To get the lexicographically smallest string, all '0's would want to move as far left as possible, past any '1's.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means '1's and '2's can reorder among themselves. To get the lexicographically smallest string, '1's would want to move as far left as possible, past any '2's.\n3. '0' and '2' cannot swap. This is the crucial constraint. If we have a '0' at position `i` and a '2' at position `j`, their relative order is fixed. If `i < j`, then the '0' will always remain to the left of that '2'. If `i > j`, the '0' will always remain to the right of that '2'. This means '0's cannot cross '2's, and '2's cannot cross '0's.\n\nConsider the characters '0' and '2'. Their relative order is fixed. The '1's are \"flexible\" and can move past both '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n- `count_0`: number of '0's\n- `count_1`: number of '1's\n- `count_2`: number of '2's\n\nSince '0's cannot move past '2's, any '0' that appears *after* any '2' in the original string must remain after that '2'. Similarly, any '2' that appears *before* any '0' in the original string must remain before that '0'.\n\nThis implies that the '0's and '2's effectively partition the string. If we remove all '1's, the remaining string of '0's and '2's cannot change its order. For example, if the string is \"020\", it can never become \"002\" because the middle '2' cannot swap with the last '0'.\n\nThe '1's are special. A '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'. This means all '1's can be grouped together. Where should this group of '1's be placed to minimize the string lexicographically?\n\nTo minimize the string lexicographically, we want to put '0's first. Then, we want to put '1's. Finally, '2's.\nHowever, the '0'-'2' restriction means we can't just sort all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nLet's find the first occurrence of '1' in the string. If there are no '1's, the string is already sorted according to the '0'-'2' rule (e.g., \"00220\"). In this case, no swaps are possible, and the string remains unchanged.\n\nIf there are '1's, all '1's can be moved to any position where a '1' can exist.\nSince '0's want to go left and '2's want to go right, and '1's can move past both, the '1's will naturally gather at a position that allows '0's to go left and '2's to go right.\n\nConsider the characters in the original string `s`:\n- All '0's can be moved to the left as much as possible, as long as they don't cross any '2's.\n- All '2's can be moved to the right as much as possible, as long as they don't cross any '0's.\n- All '1's can be moved anywhere between '0's and '2's.\n\nThis means that all '0's that appear before any '2' can be grouped together at the very beginning of the string.\nAll '2's that appear after any '0' can be grouped together at the very end of the string.\nAll '1's can be grouped together. Where do they go?\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, '1's should come after '0's and before '2's.\n\nLet's try this strategy:\n1. Count all '0's. These will form the prefix of our result string.\n2. Find the first occurrence of '1' in the original string `s`. Let its index be `first_one_idx`.\n3. All '0's that appear *before* `first_one_idx` can be moved to the very beginning.\n4. All '2's that appear *after* `first_one_idx` can be moved to the very end.\n5. All '1's can be grouped and placed.\n\nA simpler observation:\nThe '0's that appear before any '1' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\nThe '2's that appear after any '1' in the original string can be moved to the very end.\nThe '1's can all be collected and placed together.\n\nWhat about '0's that appear after a '1'? E.g., \"10\". This becomes \"01\". So '0's can move past '1's.\nWhat about '2's that appear before a '1'? E.g., \"21\". This becomes \"12\". So '2's can move past '1's.\n\nThis means that all '0's can be moved past any '1' to their left. All '2's can be moved past any '1' to their right.\nEssentially, all '1's can be moved to a contiguous block.\nTo minimize lexicographically, we want '0's, then '1's, then '2's.\nThe only restriction is that a '0' cannot cross a '2'.\n\nLet's count all '1's in the string. Let this be `num_ones`.\nNow, construct a new string `temp_s` by taking the original string `s` and removing all '1's from it.\nFor example, if `s = \"100210\"`, then `temp_s = \"0020\"`.\nThe characters in `temp_s` are '0's and '2's. Their relative order is fixed. No '0' can cross a '2' in `temp_s`.\nSo, the string `temp_s` determines the fixed structure of '0's and '2's.\n\nNow, we need to insert the `num_ones` '1's into `temp_s` to make the resulting string lexicographically smallest.\nTo achieve this, we want to place the '1's as early as possible, but after all possible '0's.\nThe optimal position for the block of '1's is right after all the '0's that appear in `temp_s` *before* the first '2'.\nMore precisely, we iterate through `temp_s`. If we encounter a '0', we append it to our result. If we encounter a '2', we know that all subsequent '0's in `temp_s` cannot move to the left of this '2'.\nSo, all '1's should be placed *before* the first '2' in `temp_s`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize an empty string `result`.\n2. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `count_ones`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n   - If the current character `c` is '0', append '0' to `result`.\n   - If the current character `c` is '1', do nothing (we will add all '1's later).\n   - If the current character `c` is '2':\n     - Append all `count_ones` '1's to `result`.\n     - Append '2' to `result`.\n     - After this, all remaining characters in `s` (from this point onwards) must be appended to `result` as they are (except for '1's which are already handled). This is because we've found the first '2', and all '1's must be placed before it to be lexicographically minimal. Any '0' after this '2' cannot move before it, and any '2' after this '2' cannot move before it.\n     - So, iterate from the current position `i+1` to the end of `s`. If a character is '0' or '2', append it to `result`.\n     - Break the loop (the rest of the string is appended, and all '1's are placed).\n\n4. After the loop, if `count_ones` is not zero, and we haven't appended them yet (this happens if there were no '2's in the string), append all `count_ones` '1's to `result`.\n\nLet's refine step 3 and 4:\n1. Initialize `result = []` (list of characters for efficiency).\n2. Count `count_ones = s.count('1')`.\n3. Initialize `first_two_found = False`.\n4. Iterate through each character `char` in `s`:\n   - If `char == '0'`: append '0' to `result`.\n   - If `char == '1'`: do nothing (these will be inserted as a block).\n   - If `char == '2'`:\n     - If `first_two_found` is `False`:\n       - Append `count_ones` '1's to `result`.\n       - Set `first_two_found = True`.\n     - Append '2' to `result`.\n\n5. After the loop, if `first_two_found` is `False` (meaning there were no '2's in the original string), append `count_ones` '1's to `result`.\n\n6. Join `result` to form the final string.\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `result = []`\n2. `count_ones = 2`\n3. `first_two_found = False`\n4. Iterate:\n   - `char = '1'`: skip.\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['0']`.\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['0', '0']`.\n   - `char = '2'`:\n     - `first_two_found` is `False`. Append `count_ones` (2) '1's: `result = ['0', '0', '1', '1']`.\n     - Set `first_two_found = True`.\n     - Append '2': `result = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2']`.\n   - `char = '1'`: skip.\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`.\n5. Loop ends. `first_two_found` is `True`.\n6. Final string: `\"001120\"`. Correct.\n\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `result = []`\n2. `count_ones = 4`\n3. `first_two_found = False`\n4. Iterate:\n   - `char = '1'`: skip.\n   - `char = '1'`: skip.\n   - `char = '2'`:\n     - `first_two_found` is `False`. Append 4 '1's: `result = ['1', '1', '1', '1']`.\n     - Set `first_two_found = True`.\n     - Append '2': `result = ['1', '1', '1', '1', '2']`.\n   - `char = '2'`: `first_two_found` is `True`. Append '2': `result = ['1', '1', '1', '1', '2', '2']`.\n   - `char = '2'`: `first_two_found` is `True`. Append '2': `result = ['1', '1', '1', '1', '2', '2', '2']`.\n   - `char = '1'`: skip.\n   - `char = '2'`: `first_two_found` is `True`. Append '2': `result = ['1', '1', '1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '2']`.\n   - `char = '1'`: skip.\n5. Loop ends. `first_two_found` is `True`.\n6. Final string: `\"11112222\"`. Correct.\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `result = []`\n2. `count_ones = 0`\n3. `first_two_found = False`\n4. Iterate:\n   - `char = '2'`:\n     - `first_two_found` is `False`. `count_ones` is 0, so append 0 '1's. `result = []`.\n     - Set `first_two_found = True`.\n     - Append '2': `result = ['2']`.\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['2', '0']`.\n5. Loop ends. `first_two_found` is `True`.\n6. Final string: `\"20\"`. Correct.\n\nExample 4: `s = \"000\"` (no '1's, no '2's)\n1. `result = []`\n2. `count_ones = 0`\n3. `first_two_found = False`\n4. Iterate:\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['0']`.\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['0', '0']`.\n   - `char = '0'`: `result = ['0', '0', '0']`.\n5. Loop ends. `first_two_found` is `False`. `count_ones` is 0, so append 0 '1's.\n6. Final string: `\"000\"`. Correct.\n\nThis algorithm seems robust. The time complexity will be O(N) because we iterate through the string once, and string operations (like `count` and list appends) are efficient. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = s.count('1')\n    \n    result_chars = []\n    first_two_encountered = False\n\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '0':\n            result_chars.append('0')\n        elif char_s == '2':\n            # If this is the first '2' we encounter, insert all '1's here\n            if not first_two_encountered:\n                result_chars.extend(['1'] * count_ones)\n                first_two_encountered = True\n            result_chars.append('2')\n        # If char_s == '1', we skip it.
