He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's the plan I've come up with to solve this competitive programming problem.**  I need to write a Python script that figures out all the numbers `n` for which `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` zeroes.  The script needs to tell us how many such `n`s there are and then list them in order.\n\nThe key to this is understanding how trailing zeroes in `n!` are created.  It all boils down to factors of 10, but 10 is 2 * 5.  In any factorial, there are always more factors of 2 than 5.  So, the number of trailing zeroes is just the number of factors of 5.\n\nThis is where Legendre's formula comes in handy. It tells us how many times 5 appears as a factor: `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` This sum keeps going as long as `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`. I'll call this function `Z(n)`.\n\nNow, `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. It increases only when `n` is a multiple of 5. It increases by 1 if `n` is a multiple of 5 but not 25, by 2 if `n` is a multiple of 25 but not 125, and so on.  A crucial observation is that `Z(n)` is constant for a block of five consecutive integers. For example, `Z(5)` to `Z(9)` are all the same. If `Z(n) = m` and  `n` is a multiple of 5, then the output will always contain 5 values (`n`, `n+1`, `n+2`, `n+3`, `n+4`).\n\nFor a given `m`, I have two cases:\n\n1.  **There's no solution.** If `m` falls between two values of `Z(n)`, like between `Z(24) = 4` and `Z(25) = 6` (so if `m` is 5).\n\n2.  **There is a solution.**  If `Z(n) = m`, then the answers are always going to be the next 5 values.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n\n*   I'll use binary search to find the smallest number `n_min_candidate` for which `Z(n) >= m`. I'm going to start my search from `1` to `5 * m`.  Why `5 * m`?  Well, `Z(n)` is roughly `n/4`. So, for a large `m` like 100,000, `n` would be roughly `400,000`. So, `500,000` is enough to be safe.\n*   After the binary search, I'll calculate `Z(n_min_candidate)`.\n    *   If `Z(n_min_candidate) == m`, then the solutions will be the next 5 consecutive integers (`ans_n, ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4`)\n    *   If `Z(n_min_candidate) > m`, it means I've overshot (e.g., if m=5). So, there is no solution, and I output 0.\n\nTo efficiently calculate `Z(n)`, I'll define a function `count_trailing_zeros(n)`. This function is my implementation of Legendre's formula.\n\nThe code will use a binary search approach with a safe upper bound and checks to ensure overflow for large values of `n`, but the binary search makes the runtime relatively quick.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s, and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**1. Counting Trailing Zeroes in n!**\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of factors of 5 and 2. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is equal to the number of factors of 5 in its prime factorization.\nLegendre's formula provides this count:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\n**2. Properties of Z(n)**\nThe function `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nFor any integer `k`, `Z(5k)`, `Z(5k+1)`, `Z(5k+2)`, `Z(5k+3)`, `Z(5k+4)` all have the same value. The value of `Z(n)` strictly increases when `n` becomes `5k+5`.\nFor example:\n`Z(4) = 0`\n`Z(5) = 1, Z(6) = 1, Z(7) = 1, Z(8) = 1, Z(9) = 1`\n`Z(10) = 2`\n`Z(24) = 4`\n`Z(25) = 6` (because 25 contributes two factors of 5: one from 5 and one from 25)\n\nThis property implies two important things:\n* If a value `m` is reachable by `Z(n)` (i.e., there exists some `n` such that `Z(n) = m`), then there will always be exactly 5 such consecutive integers `n` that produce `m` trailing zeroes. For instance, if `Z(N) = m`, then `N, N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4` will all yield `m` zeroes, provided `N` is the smallest such integer.\n* If `m` is not reachable (e.g., `m=5` is skipped because `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`), then there are no `n` values that produce `m` trailing zeroes.\n\n**3. Strategy**\n1. **Find the smallest `n`:** We need to find the smallest positive integer `n_min_candidate` such that `Z(n_min_candidate) >= m`. Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to efficiently find this `n_min_candidate`.\n   * The lower bound for `n` is 1.\n   * The upper bound for `n`: `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`. So, `n` is approximately `4m`. A safe upper bound for `n` can be `5 * m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` would be around `400,000` (e.g., `Z(400005) = 100000`). So `5 * m = 500,000` is a reasonable upper bound for binary search.\n\n2. **Check if `m` is reachable:** After the binary search, `n_min_candidate` will be the smallest `n` for which `Z(n) >= m`. We then calculate `Z(n_min_candidate)`.\n   * If `Z(n_min_candidate) == m`: This means `m` is a reachable value. Furthermore, `n_min_candidate` must be a multiple of 5. (If `n_min_candidate` were not a multiple of 5, say `n_min_candidate = 5k+j` for `j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}`, then `Z(5k)` would also be `m`, contradicting `n_min_candidate` being the *smallest* `n` with `Z(n)=m`). In this case, the `k=5` solutions are `n_min_candidate, n_min_candidate+1, n_min_candidate+2, n_min_candidate+3, n_min_candidate+4`.\n   * If `Z(n_min_candidate) > m`: This means `m` is a skipped value (e.g., we searched for `m=5`, and `n_min_candidate=25` with `Z(25)=6`). In this case, there are no solutions, so `k=0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1):**\n1. Binary search for smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= 1`.\n   * `low = 1`, `high = 5` (since `m=1`, `5*m=5`). `ans_n = 5`.\n   * `mid = (1+5)//2 = 3`. `Z(3) = 0`. `0 < 1`, so `low = 4`.\n   * `low = 4`, `high = 5`. `mid = (4+5)//2 = 4`. `Z(4) = 0`. `0 < 1`, so `low = 5`.\n   * `low = 5`, `high = 5`. `mid = (5+5)//2 = 5`. `Z(5) = 1`. `1 >= 1`, so `ans_n = 5`, `high = 4`.\n   * Loop terminates (`low > high`). `n_min_candidate = 5`.\n2. Check `Z(n_min_candidate)`.\n   * `Z(5) = 1`. This is equal to `m`.\n   * So, there are 5 solutions: `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n* `count_trailing_zeros(n)`: The loop runs `log_5(n)` times. For `n` up to `5 * 10^5`, `log_5(5 * 10^5)` is about 8.\n* Binary search: The loop runs `log_2(5 * m)` times. For `m = 100,000`, `log_2(500,000)` is about 19.\n* Total complexity: `O(log_2(5m) * log_5(5m))`, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! using Legendre's formula.\n    Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while i <= n:\n        count += n // i\n        # Check for potential overflow before multiplying i by 5,\n        # though for the given constraints (n up to 5*10^5),\n        # i will not exceed 5^9 (1.95M) which fits within standard integer types.\n        if i > sys.maxsize // 5: # Prevent i from overflowing in subsequent multiplication\n            break\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n    # The upper bound for n is estimated as 5 * m.
