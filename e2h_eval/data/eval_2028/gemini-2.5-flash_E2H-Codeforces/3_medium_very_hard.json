            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Lanterns\n\nVanya walks late at night along a straight street of length l, lit by n lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan, as I see it:**\n\nWe've got this street of length *l*, and *n* lanterns scattered along it at positions *a\\_i*.  Each lantern shines a light radius *d* around itself. The goal is to find the *smallest* possible *d* that ensures *every single point* on the street is illuminated.\n\nFirst things first, I'm going to sort those lantern positions. It's going to make the analysis of the light coverage a lot easier.  Once they're in order, I can start looking at the gaps.\n\nThere are three key gaps I need to check:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street:** The first lantern's light has to reach all the way to 0. So, its light has to extend at least its own position which means *d* has to be greater than or equal to the position of the first lantern.\n2.  **The end of the street:** The last lantern's light needs to hit *l*.  So, *d* must be greater than or equal to the difference between *l* and the last lantern's position.\n3.  **The spaces between lanterns:**  This is a bit more involved. For any two adjacent lanterns, the lights need to overlap so there are no unlit areas. Specifically, the amount each lantern contributes to cover that space needs to be considered.  I need to find the distance between the lanterns, divide it by two, and make sure *d* is at least that size.\n\nTo find the minimum possible *d*, I'm going to calculate the *d* required for each of these three conditions.  The final *d* value is just the *largest* of all the *d*s that cover all gaps and the beginnings/ends of the street.\n",
