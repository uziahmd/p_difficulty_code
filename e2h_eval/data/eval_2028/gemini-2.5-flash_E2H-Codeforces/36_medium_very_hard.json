The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$.

The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Signal Power Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a tricky competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the probability of a valid setup for radio towers in a line of towns. Each town can have a tower built in it (or not), and the tower's power dictates how far its signal reaches. There are a few key constraints: town 0 and town n+1 have to be silent, and all the towns in the middle (1 to n) must each get a signal from exactly one tower.\n\nMy first thought is to break down the constraints to understand the conditions required to solve the problem. I need to make sure the signal powers for each tower I set up satisfy these conditions. For a tower in town `i`, the power `p_i` must be less than or equal to both `i` and `n + 1 - i` to avoid interfering with towns 0 and n+1. That gives me a maximum possible power level for each tower, and this power also has to be at least 1.\n\nThe critical part is the \"exactly one\" coverage constraint. This implies that the signal ranges from the towers must perfectly tile the towns from 1 to n without overlapping. This essentially creates a partition. This means if I build a tower in town `i` with power `p_i`, then the towns covered would start from town `i - p_i + 1` to town `i + p_i - 1`. I then need to make sure that each of the ranges from a tower doesn't overlap with any other tower's range, and that all of the towns are covered. \n\nI'm starting to think dynamic programming or maybe a clever greedy approach might be the way to go. I need to find a sequence of towers, which must \"tile\" the interval `[1, n]`. If I pick a tower in town `s_1`, then towns `1, ..., 2s_1` have to be covered. Town `s_2` has to start where `s_1` left off, and each consecutive town must pick up from there. The last tower is at town `s_k`.\n\nI can represent the starting and ending points of each tower's range using `L` and `R`, where `L_i` is the town *after* the last one covered by tower `s_{i-1}`, and `R_i` is the last one covered by tower `i`. Then the intervals look like `(L_1, R_1), ..., (L_k, R_k)`, and they must not overlap. So, tower `s_i` is built such that `s_i = L_i + p_{s_i} = R_i - p_{s_i}`. I now have two equations I need to solve for.\n\nThe core idea I'm converging on is to build a `dp[i]` array. `dp[i]` represents how many ways there are to cover the towns up to `i` with towers, and make the very last point covered by a tower `s_k` to be exactly `i`. So I'm essentially storing the number of valid ways to set up the towers such that they \"tile\" the region.\n\nTo calculate `dp[i]`, I iterate through all possible previous values of `L_k`, which I call `j`. I pick `j < i`, such that `i = 2s_k - j`. If `j` is a valid previous state, then I extend the setup with this new tower at town `s_k`. The condition becomes `dp[i] = sum_{j < i, j \\equiv i \\pmod 2, (i+j)/2 \\le n} dp[j]`. This ensures that each `dp[i]` is independent of all previous towers.\n\nLet's reindex. `dp[i]` is the number of valid sequences `s_1, ..., s_k` such that `L_k = i`. Now it looks like I may have found the right track. I start with `dp[0]=1`, and for each `i`, I need to sum the previous valid cases, where I now pick a tower in location `(i+j)/2`, such that each case is properly \"tiled.\" I'm pretty sure I have the recurrence relationship correct now. The goal is to find `dp[n + 1]`.\n\nSo I've got this approach down; now I just have to code it up and see if it works. I need to handle all the edge cases correctly, and also remember to take the modulo. Wish me luck!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, after building radio towers in towns $1, \\dots, n$ (each with probability $1/2$), we can set signal powers $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ for the chosen towers such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a power $p_i$. A tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means $i - p_i < c < i + p_i$. The towns covered are $i - p_i + 1, \\dots, i + p_i - 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n**Constraint 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.**\n- For town $0$: $i - p_i \\ge 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n- For town $n+1$: $i + p_i \\le n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1 - i$.\nSo, for each tower $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThis implies that the interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ is always within $[0, n+1]$. Specifically, the towns covered, $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$, are always within $[1, n]$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.**\nThis means the intervals of towns covered by towers in $S$ must form a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, if $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ with $s_1 < s_2 < \\dots < s_k$, and we choose powers $p_{s_1}, \\dots, p_{s_k}$, then the intervals $(s_j - p_{s_j}, s_j + p_{s_j})$ must be disjoint, and their union must be $(0, n+1)$.\nThis implies a specific structure:\nLet $L_0 = 0$. For $j=1, \\dots, k$:\n- The tower $s_j$ must cover towns starting from $L_{j-1}+1$. This means $s_j - p_{s_j} = L_{j-1}$.\n- The tower $s_j$ must be the midpoint of its covered interval: $s_j - p_{s_j} = s_j + p_{s_j} - 2p_{s_j}$.\n  From $s_j - p_{s_j} = L_{j-1}$ and $s_j + p_{s_j} = R_j$ (where $R_j$ is the end of the interval), we have $p_{s_j} = s_j - L_{j-1}$ and $p_{s_j} = R_j - s_j$.\n  Thus, $s_j - L_{j-1} = R_j - s_j \\implies 2s_j = L_{j-1} + R_j$.\n  This means $R_j = 2s_j - L_{j-1}$.\n- The sequence of intervals must tile $(0, n+1)$, so $R_k = n+1$.\n- The powers must be valid: $1 \\le p_{s_j} \\le \\min(s_j, n+1-s_j)$.\n  - $p_{s_j} \\ge 1 \\implies s_j - L_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\implies s_j > L_{j-1}$.\n  - $p_{s_j} \\le s_j \\implies s_j - L_{j-1} \\le s_j \\implies L_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is true since $L_0=0$ and $L_j$ are increasing.\n  - $p_{s_j} \\le n+1-s_j \\implies s_j - L_{j-1} \\le n+1-s_j \\implies 2s_j - L_{j-1} \\le n+1 \\implies R_j \\le n+1$.\n\nSo, a set of towers $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ allows a valid assignment if and only if:\n1. $s_1 < s_2 < \\dots < s_k$.\n2. Let $L_0 = 0$. For $j=1, \\dots, k$, define $L_j = 2s_j - L_{j-1}$.\n3. For all $j=1, \\dots, k$: $s_j > L_{j-1}$ and $L_j \\le n+1$.\n4. $L_k = n+1$.\n\nWe need to count the number of such sets $S$. Let $dp[i]$ be the number of valid sets $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ such that $L_k = i$.\nThe base case is $dp[0] = 1$ (representing an empty set of towers, having covered towns up to $0$).\nFor $i=1, \\dots, n+1$:\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{j} dp[j]$, where $j$ is a valid previous $L_{k-1}$.\nIf $L_k = i$ and $L_{k-1} = j$, then the last tower $s_k$ must satisfy $i = 2s_k - j$, so $s_k = (i+j)/2$.\nThe conditions for $s_k$ to be valid are:\n1. $s_k$ must be an integer, so $i+j$ must be even, i.e., $i \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\n2. $s_k > j \\implies (i+j)/2 > j \\implies i+j > 2j \\implies i > j$.\n3. $s_k \\le n \\implies (i+j)/2 \\le n$. This means $j \\le 2n-i$.\n4. $s_k \\ge 1 \\implies (i+j)/2 \\ge 1 \\implies i+j \\ge 2$. (Since $j \\ge 0$ and $i \\ge 1$, this is always true for $i \\ge 1$.)\n\nSo, for $i \\ge 1$:\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < i \\\\ j \\equiv i \\pmod 2 \\\\ (i+j)/2 \\le n}} dp[j]$.\n\nLet's compute the first few values:\n- $dp[0] = 1$.\n- $dp[1] = 0$ (no $j < 1$ with $j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$).\n- $dp[2]$: $j=0$ is valid ($0 < 2$, $0 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$). $s_k=(2+0)/2=1$. $1 \\le n$ (true for $n \\ge 1$). So $dp[2] = dp[0] = 1$.\n- $dp[3]$: $j=1$ is valid ($1 < 3$, $1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$). $s_k=(3+1)/2=2$. $2 \\le n$ (true for $n \\ge 2$). So $dp[3] = dp[1] = 0$.\n- $dp[4]$: $j=0$ ($s_k=2$, $2 \\le n$). $j=2$ ($s_k=3$, $3 \\le n$). So $dp[4] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n- $dp[5]$: $j=1$ ($s_k=3$, $3 \\le n$). $j=3$ ($s_k=4$, $4 \\le n$). So $dp[5] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n- $dp[6]$: $j=0$ ($s_k=3$, $3 \\le n$). $j=2$ ($s_k=4$, $4 \\le n$). $j=4$ ($s_k=5$, $5 \\le n$). So $dp[6] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4$.\n\nObserve the pattern for $i \\le n$:\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < i \\\\ j \\equiv i \\pmod 2}} dp[j]$.\nIf $i$ is even: $dp[i] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[i-2]$.\nIf $i$ is odd: $dp[i] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[i-2]$.\nThis can be simplified:\nFor $i \\ge 2$:\n$dp[i] = dp[i-2] + (dp[i-4] + \\dots + dp[i \\pmod 2])$.\nThe term in parentheses is $dp[i-2]$ if $i-2 \\ge 0$.\nSo, for $2 \\le i \\le n$: $dp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-2] = 2 \\cdot dp[i-2]$.\n\nLet's re-calculate with this recurrence:\n- $dp[0] = 1$\n- $dp[1] = 0$\n- $dp[2] = 2 \\cdot dp[0] = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. (Matches `F_2` in my scratchpad, but not $dp[0]$ as calculated above).\n  The formula `dp[i] = sum_{j < i, j \\equiv i \\pmod 2} dp[j]` means `dp[2] = dp[0]` (only $j=0$ satisfies $j<2, j \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$). So $dp[2]=1$.\n  The simplified `dp[i] = 2 * dp[i-2]` is only true if $dp[i-2]$ itself is a sum of previous terms.\n  $dp[2] = dp[0] = 1$.\n  $dp[3] = dp[1] = 0$.\n  $dp[4] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n  $dp[5] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n  $dp[6] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4$.\n  $dp[7] = dp[1] + dp[3] + dp[5] = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\n  $dp[8] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] + dp[6] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8$.\n\nIt appears:\n- If $i$ is odd, $dp[i] = 0$.\n- If $i$ is even, $dp[i] = 2^{i/2 - 1}$ for $i \\ge 2$. And $dp[0]=1$.\n  Let's verify:\n  $dp[0] = 1$\n  $dp[2] = 2^{2/2 - 1} = 2^0 = 1$. Correct.\n  $dp[4] = 2^{4/2 - 1} = 2^1 = 2$. Correct.\n  $dp[6] = 2^{6/2 - 1} = 2^2 = 4$. Correct.\n  $dp[8] = 2^{8/2 - 1} = 2^3 = 8$. Correct.\nThis pattern holds for $i \\le n$.\n\nNow consider $dp[n+1]$.\nThe sum for $dp[n+1]$ is $\\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < n+1 \\\\ j \\equiv n+1 \\pmod 2 \\\\ (n+1+j)/2 \\le n}} dp[j]$.\nThe condition $(n+1+j)/2 \\le n \\implies n+1+j \\le 2n \\implies j \\le n-1$.\nSo, $dp[n+1] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le n-1 \\\\ j \\equiv n+1 \\pmod 2}} dp[j]$.\n\nCase 1: $n+1$ is odd. This means $n$ is even.\nThen $j$ must be odd.\n$dp[n+1] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le n-1 \\\\ j \\text{ is odd}}} dp[j]$.\nSince $dp[j]=0$ for odd $j$, $dp[n+1] = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $n+1$ is even. This means $n$ is odd.\nThen $j$ must be even.\n$dp[n+1] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le n-1 \\\\ j \\text{ is even}}} dp[j]$.\nUsing our pattern for $dp[j]$:\n$dp[n+1] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] + \\dots + dp[n-1]$ (since $n-1$ is even).\n$dp[n+1] = 1 + 2^0 + 2^1 + \\dots + 2^{(n-1)/2 - 1}$.\nThis is $1 + (1 + 2 + \\dots + 2^{(n-1)/2 - 1})$.\nThe sum $1 + 2 + \\dots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1$.\nHere $k = (n-1)/2 - 1$. So the sum is $2^{(n-1)/2} - 1$.\nThus, $dp[n+1] = 1 + (2^{(n-1)/2} - 1) = 2^{(n-1)/2}$.\n\nSummary of $dp[n+1]$:\n- If $n$ is even ($n+1$ is odd): $dp[n+1] = 0$.\n- If $n$ is odd ($n+1$ is even): $dp[n+1] = 2^{(n-1)/2}$.\n\nThe total number of valid sets of towers is $dp[n+1]$.\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{dp[n+1]}{2^n}$.\n\n- If $n$ is even: probability is $\\frac{0}{2^n} = 0$.\n- If $n$ is odd: probability is $\\frac{2^{(n-1)/2}}{2^n} = 2^{(n-1)/2 - n} = 2^{-(n+1)/2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{(n+1)/2}$.\n\nLet's check the examples:\n- $n=2$ (even): Probability is $0$. Output: `748683265`. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. My result is $0$. There is a mismatch.\n\nWhat went wrong?\nThe condition \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" does not imply that *all* towers built must be used in the tiling.\nThe problem states: \"After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers...\". This implies that we choose a subset of built towers to form the tiling.\nIf we build towers $S_{built}$, we need to find if there exists a subset $S_{use} \\subseteq S_{built}$ such that $S_{use}$ forms a valid tiling as described.\nAnd for towers in $S_{built} \\setminus S_{use}$, they must not cover any towns in $1, \\dots, n$, and also not $0$ or $n+1$.\nIf a tower $i \\in S_{built} \\setminus S_{use}$ has power $p_i$, then $i-p_i \\ge 0$ and $i+p_i \\le n+1$. But if it covers any town $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, then that town $c$ would be covered by two towers (one from $S_{use}$ and one from $S_{built} \\setminus S_{use}$), violating the \"exactly one\" rule.\nSo, towers in $S_{built} \\setminus S_{use}$ must not cover any towns in $1, \\dots, n$.\nThis means $i-p_i+1 > n$ or $i+p_i-1 < 1$.\nSince $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $i-p_i+1 \\le i \\le n$. $i+p_i-1 \\ge i \\ge 1$.\nThis can only happen if the range of covered towns is empty, i.e., $i-p_i+1 > i+p_i-1$, which means $2p_i < 2$, so $p_i < 1$. But $p_i \\ge 1$.\nThis means any tower built must be part of the tiling. So $S_{built} = S_{use}$.\nMy interpretation $S_{built} = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ is correct.\n\nLet's re-check the example $n=2$.\nTowns $0, 1, 2, 3$. Towers in $1, 2$.\nPossible tower configurations (4 total):\n1. No towers: $S=\\emptyset$. No way to cover $1,2$. Invalid.\n2. Tower in $1$ only: $S=\\{1\\}$. $L_0=0$. $s_1=1$. $L_1 = 2s_1 - L_0 = 2(1)-0=2$.\n   $s_1 > L_0$ ($1>0$ true). $L_1 \\le n+1$ ($2 \\le 3$ true).\n   $L_1 = n+1$? $2 = 3$? No. Invalid.\n3. Tower in $2$ only: $S=\\{2\\}$. $L_0=0$. $s_1=2$. $L_1 = 2s_1 - L_0 = 2(2)-0=4$.\n   $s_1 > L_0$ ($2>0$ true). $L_1 \\le n+1$ ($4 \\le 3$? No. Invalid).\n4. Towers in $1, 2$: $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n   Try $s_1=1, s_2=2$.\n   $L_0=0$.\n   For $s_1=1$: $L_1 = 2(1)-0=2$. ($1>0$ true, $2 \\le 3$ true).\n   For $s_2=2$: $L_2 = 2(2)-L_1 = 4-2=2$.\n   Wait, $L_2$ must be $n+1=3$. $L_2=2 \\ne 3$. Invalid.\n   This means the $dp[n+1]$ for $n=2$ should be $0$.\n   The example output for $n=2$ is $1/4$. This suggests that one configuration is valid.\n   The example explanation for $n=2$: \"towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\n   Let's check this: $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n   Tower $1$ with $p_1=1$: covers $c$ s.t. $|c-1|<1 \\implies 0<c<2 \\implies c=1$.\n   Tower $2$ with $p_2=1$: covers $c$ s.t. $|c-2|<1 \\implies 1<c<3 \\implies c=2$.\n   Towns $0, n+1=3$ are not covered.\n   Town $1$ covered by tower $1$. Town $2$ covered by tower $2$.\n   This configuration is valid! My DP model does not find it.\n\nThe issue is with $s_j = (L_{j-1} + R_j)/2$. This implies $s_j$ is the *center* of its covered interval.\nThe problem statement: \"The signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$.\"\nThis means $c \\in \\{i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1\\}$.\nThe condition \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" means that the set of all towns covered by towers in $S$ must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and each town must be covered by exactly one tower.\nThis means the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must form a partition of $[1, n]$.\nLet $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ with $s_1 < \\dots < s_k$.\nThe interval covered by $s_j$ is $[s_j - p_{s_j} + 1, s_j + p_{s_j} - 1]$.\nFor a partition, we need:\n1. $s_1 - p_{s_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{s_1} = s_1$.\n2. $s_k + p_{s_k} - 1 = n \\implies p_{s_k} = n+1 - s_k$.\n3. For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $s_{j+1} - p_{s_{j+1}} + 1 = s_j + p_{s_j} - 1 + 1 \\implies s_{j+1} - p_{s_{j+1}} = s_j + p_{s_j} - 1$.\nThe powers must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n- $p_{s_1}=s_1$: requires $s_1 \\le s_1$ (true) and $s_1 \\le n+1-s_1 \\implies 2s_1 \\le n+1$.\n- $p_{s_k}=n+1-s_k$: requires $n+1-s_k \\le s_k \\implies n+1 \\le 2s_k$ and $n+1-s_k \\le n+1-s_k$ (true).\n\nThe general relation is $s_{j+1} - p_{s_{j+1}} = s_j + p_{s_j} - 1$. This is a \"gap\" of 1 between intervals.\nThis is not what I used in my DP. My DP assumed $s_j$ is the center, which means $(s_j - p_{s_j}, s_j + p_{s_j})$ are disjoint and abut exactly at their endpoints.\nThe condition $|c-i|<p$ means an open interval. So towns $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nThe length of this interval of towns is $(i+p-1) - (i-p+1) + 1 = 2p-1$.\nIf intervals are disjoint and cover $1 \\dots n$, then for $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$, the covered towns are:\n$[s_1-p_{s_1}+1, s_1+p_{s_1}-1]$, then $[s_2-p_{s_2}+1, s_2+p_{s_2}-1]$, etc.\nThese intervals must be consecutive.\nThe first interval must start at 1: $s_1-p_{s_1}+1=1 \\implies p_{s_1}=s_1$.\nThe last interval must end at $n$: $s_k+p_{s_k}-1=n \\implies p_{s_k}=n+1-s_k$.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $s_{j+1}-p_{s_{j+1}}+1 = (s_j+p_{s_j}-1)+1 \\implies s_{j+1}-p_{s_{j+1}} = s_j+p_{s_j}-1$.\n\nLet $x_0 = 0$. For $j=1, \\dots, k$, let $x_j = s_j + p_{s_j} - 1$.\nThen $p_{s_j} = s_j - (x_{j-1}+1) + 1 = s_j - x_{j-1}$.\nSo $x_j = s_j + (s_j - x_{j-1}) - 1 = 2s_j - x_{j-1} - 1$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $x_k = n$.\n2. $1 \\le p_{s_j} \\le \\min(s_j, n+1-s_j)$.\n   $s_j - x_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\implies s_j > x_{j-1}$.\n   $s_j - x_{j-1} \\le s_j \\implies x_{j-1} \\ge 0$. (True)\n   $s_j - x_{j-1} \\le n+1-s_j \\implies 2s_j - x_{j-1} \\le n+1 \\implies x_j+1 \\le n+1 \\implies x_j \\le n$. (True, as $x_k=n$ and $x_j$ are increasing).\n\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of valid sequences $s_1, \\dots, s_k$ such that $x_k = i$.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty sequence, $x_0=0$).\nFor $i=1, \\dots, n$:\n$dp[i] = \\sum dp[j]$ where $j$ is a valid previous $x_{k-1}$.\n$s_k = (i + j + 1)/2$.\nConditions for $s_k$:\n1. $i+j+1$ must be even, so $i+j$ must be odd. $j \\not\\equiv i \\pmod 2$.\n2. $s_k > j \\implies (i+j+1)/2 > j \\implies i+j+1 > 2j \\implies i+1 > j$.\n3. $s_k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ implies $1 \\le (i+j+1)/2 \\le n$.\n   $(i+j+1)/2 \\ge 1 \\implies i+j+1 \\ge 2 \\implies i+j \\ge 1$. (True for $i \\ge 1, j \\ge 0$).\n   $(i+j+1)/2 \\le n \\implies i+j+1 \\le 2n \\implies j \\le 2n-i-1$.\n\nSo, for $i \\ge 1$:\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < i+1 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv i \\pmod 2 \\\\ j \\le 2n-i-1}} dp[j]$.\n\nLet's compute again:\n- $dp[0] = 1$.\n- $dp[1]$: $j=0$ valid ($0 < 1+1$, $0 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, $0 \\le 2n-1-1=2n-2$).\n  $s_k=(1+0+1)/2=1$. $1 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$.\n- $dp[2]$: $j=1$ valid ($1 < 2+1$, $1 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$, $1 \\le 2n-2-1=2n-3$).\n  $s_k=(2+1+1)/2=2$. $2 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$.\n- $dp[3]$: $j=0$ valid ($0 < 3+1$, $0 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$, $0 \\le 2n-3-1=2n-4$).\n  $s_k=(3+0+1)/2=2$. $2 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $j=2$ valid ($2 < 3+1$, $2 \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$, $2 \\le 2n-4$).\n  $s_k=(3+2+1)/2=3$. $3 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n- $dp[4]$: $j=1$ valid ($1 < 4+1$, $1 \\not\\equiv 4 \\pmod 2$, $1 \\le 2n-4-1=2n-5$).\n  $s_k=(4+1+1)/2=3$. $3 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $j=3$ valid ($3 < 4+1$, $3 \\not\\equiv 4 \\pmod 2$, $3 \\le 2n-5$).\n  $s_k=(4+3+1)/2=4$. $4 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n- $dp[5]$: $j=0$ valid ($0 < 5+1$, $0 \\not\\equiv 5 \\pmod 2$, $0 \\le 2n-5-1=2n-6$).\n  $s_k=(5+0+1)/2=3$. $3 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $j=2$ valid ($2 < 5+1$, $2 \\not\\equiv 5 \\pmod 2$, $2 \\le 2n-6$).\n  $s_k=(5+2+1)/2=4$. $4 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $j=4$ valid ($4 < 5+1$, $4 \\not\\equiv 5 \\pmod 2$, $4 \\le 2n-6$).\n  $s_k=(5+4+1)/2=5$. $5 \\le n$. Valid.\n  $dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5$.\n\nThe sequence $dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], dp[4], dp[5], \\dots$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$.\nThis is $F_{i+1}$, where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$. So $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$.\nThis pattern holds as long as $j \\le 2n-i-1$ is not a binding constraint.\nFor $i \\le n$, the maximum $j$ in the sum is $i-1$.\nWe need $i-1 \\le 2n-i-1 \\implies 2i \\le 2n \\implies i \\le n$.\nSo for $i \\le n$, $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$.\n\nThe total number of valid configurations is $dp[n] = F_{n+1}$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{F_{n+1}}{2^n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's check $n=2$:\n$dp[2] = F_{2+1} = F_3 = 2$.\nProbability is $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nExample output for $n=2$ is $1/4$. Still a mismatch.\n\nThe example $n=2$ says: \"towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis is $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$s_1=1, p_1=1$: covers $1$. $x_1 = s_1+p_1-1 = 1+1-1=1$.\n$s_2=2, p_2=1$: covers $2$. $x_2 = s_2+p_2-1 = 2+1-1=2$.\n$x_k=n \\implies x_2=2$. This is $n$. So this is a valid sequence.\nThis is counted by $dp[n]=dp[2]=F_3=2$.\nThe sequence is $s_1=1, s_2=2$. This is one way to achieve $x_2=2$.\nThe other way to achieve $x_2=2$ is $s_1=2, p_1=1$.\n$s_1=2, p_1=1$: covers $2$. $x_1=2+1-1=2$. $x_k=n \\implies x_1=2$. This is $n$.\nThis is a sequence with $k=1$, $s_1=2$.\nBut $p_{s_1}=s_1$ must be satisfied. So $p_2=2$.\nIf $s_1=2, p_1=2$: covers $1,2,3$. This covers town $3$, which is $n+1$. This is not allowed.\nSo $p_1=1$ for $s_1=2$ is the only valid choice.\nThis means $p_1=s_1$ is not a universal requirement. It's $p_{s_1} = s_1 - (x_0)$.\nThe conditions $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ are hard constraints.\nFor $s_1=2$, $p_1=1$: $p_1=1 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2,1)=1$. This is allowed.\nSo $S=\\{2\\}$ with $p_2=1$ covers town $2$. But it does not cover town $1$. So this is not a valid tiling of $1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe tiling must cover $1, \\dots, n$.\nFor $n=2$:\n- $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $1,2$. Valid. This is 1 way.\n- $S=\\{1\\}$, $p_1=1$. Covers $1$. Does not cover $2$. Invalid.\n- $S=\\{2\\}$, $p_2=1$. Covers $2$. Does not cover $1$. Invalid.\n- $S=\\emptyset$. Invalid.\nSo only 1 configuration is valid for $n=2$. Probability $1/4$.\n\nMy DP counts sequences $s_1, \\dots, s_k$ such that $x_k=n$.\nFor $n=2$: $dp[2]=F_3=2$.\nThe two sequences are:\n1. $s_1=1, s_2=2$.\n   $x_0=0$. $s_1=1$. $p_1 = s_1-x_0 = 1$. $x_1 = 2s_1-x_0-1 = 2(1)-0-1=1$.\n   $s_2=2$. $p_2 = s_2-x_1 = 2-1=1$. $x_2 = 2s_2-x_1-1 = 2(2)-1-1=2$.\n   $x_2=n=2$. Valid. This is $S=\\{1,2\\}$, powers $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This is the example.\n2. $s_1=2$.\n   $x_0=0$. $s_1=2$. $p_1 = s_1-x_0 = 2$. $x_1 = 2s_1-x_0-1 = 2(2)-0-1=3$.\n   This sequence ends with $x_1=3$. This is not $n=2$. So this sequence is not counted by $dp[n]$.\n   This is sequence $s_1=2$ that reaches $x_1=3$.\n   The problem is that $dp[n]$ is for $x_k=n$. What if $x_k=n+1$?\n\nThe problem states: \"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\".\nThis means $s_j - p_{s_j} \\ge 0$ and $s_j + p_{s_j} \\le n+1$.\nMy current definition of $p_{s_j} = s_j - x_{j-1}$ means $s_j - p_{s_j} = x_{j-1}$.\nSo $x_{j-1} \\ge 0$ is required. This is true.\nAnd $s_j + p_{s_j} \\le n+1$.\n$s_j + (s_j - x_{j-1}) \\le n+1 \\implies 2s_j - x_{j-1} \\le n+1$.\n$x_j+1 \\le n+1 \\implies x_j \\le n$.\nThis is exactly what I used. So $x_k=n$ is the correct final state.\n\nWhat if $n=3$?\n$dp[3]=F_4=3$.\nThe sequences are:\n1. $s_1=1, s_2=2, s_3=3$.\n   $x_0=0$. $p_1=1, x_1=1$. $p_2=1, x_2=2$. $p_3=1, x_3=3$.\n   $x_3=n=3$. Valid. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $p=\\{1,1,1\\}$. This is 1 way.\n2. $s_1=2, s_2=3$.\n   $x_0=0$. $s_1=2$. $p_1=2$. $x_1=2(2)-0-1=3$.\n   $p_1=2$ is valid since $2 \\le \\min(2, 3+1-2=2)$.\n   $s_2=3$. $p_2=s_2-x_1 = 3-3=0$. This is not allowed ($p_i \\ge 1$). Invalid.\n   So $s_1=2, s_2=3$ is not a valid sequence. My DP counts it.\n   The condition $s_j > x_{j-1}$ means $p_j \\ge 1$.\n   The condition $s_j \\le n$ is also important.\n   For $s_1=2$, $p_1=2$, $x_1=3$. This is valid.\n   For $s_2=3$, $x_1=3$. $s_2=3 \\ngtr x_1=3$. So this path is invalid. My DP should not count it.\n   The condition was $s_k > j \\implies (i+j+1)/2 > j \\implies i+1 > j$.\n   For $dp[3]$, $j=2$: $i=3$. $3+1 > 2 \\implies 4 > 2$. This is true. So $dp[2]$ is included.\n   But $s_k=(i+j+1)/2 = (3+2+1)/2=3$.\n   The condition $p_{s_j} \\ge 1$ is $s_j - x_{j-1} \\ge 1$.\n   This means $3-2 \\ge 1 \\implies 1 \\ge 1$. This is true. So $p_2=1$.\n   The sequence $s_1=2, s_2=3$ has $p_1=2, p_2=1$.\n   $s_1=2, p_1=2$: covers towns $1,2,3$.\n   $s_2=3, p_2=1$: covers town $3$.\n   This means town $3$ is covered by two towers. This is invalid.\n\nThe assumption that $S_{built}$ must be $S_{use}$ is correct.\nThe problem is that $p_{s_j}$ must be $s_j - x_{j-1}$ for the *first* part of the interval, and $p_{s_j}$ must be $x_j - s_j + 1$ for the *second* part. These must be equal.\n$s_j - x_{j-1} = x_j - s_j + 1 \\implies 2s_j = x_{j-1} + x_j + 1$.\nThis is the equation I used to define $s_k$ in the DP: $s_k = (i+j+1)/2$.\nThe intervals $[s_j - p_{s_j} + 1, s_j + p_{s_j} - 1]$ must be disjoint and tile $[1, n]$.\nThe example for $n=2$ works with $S=\\{1,2\\}$ and $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$s_1=1, p_1=1$. Covered: $[1-1+1, 1+1-1] = [1,1]$.\n$s_2=2, p_2=1$. Covered: $[2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2,2]$.\nThese are disjoint and tile $[1,2]$.\nThis corresponds to the sequence $s_1=1, s_2=2$ where $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\nThis is counted by $dp[2]=F_3=2$.\nThe other sequence counted by $dp[2]=F_3=2$ is $s_1=2$ with $p_1=1$.\n$x_0=0$. $s_1=2$. $p_1 = s_1-x_0 = 2$. $x_1 = 2s_1-x_0-1 = 3$. This is for $dp[3]$, not $dp[2]$.\nThe $dp[i]$ counts sequences $s_1, \\dots, s_k$ such that $x_k=i$.\n$dp[2]=F_3=2$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$. This is $s_1=1, p_1=1$, $x_1=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_3=2$.\nPath 1: $s_1=1 \\implies x_1=1$. From $x_1=1$, can we reach $x_2=2$?\n  $s_2 = (2+1+1)/2 = 2$. $p_2=s_2-x_1=2-1=1$. This is $S=\\{1,2\\}, p_1=1, p_2=1$. Valid.\nPath 2: $s_1=2 \\implies x_1=3$. This is not part of $dp[2]$.\n\nThe $F_{n+1}$ sequence is correct for the number of ways to pick $s_j$ and $p_{s_j}$ such that they form a tiling.\nThe problem is that the $p_{s_j}$ must satisfy $p_{s_j} \\le \\min(s_j, n+1-s_j)$.\nThe $p_{s_j} = s_j - x_{j-1}$ means $s_j - x_{j-1} \\le s_j$ (true).\nBut $s_j - x_{j-1} \\le n+1-s_j$ must hold.\n$2s_j - x_{j-1} \\le n+1$.\nSince $x_j = 2s_j - x_{j-1} - 1$, this condition is $x_j+1 \\le n+1 \\implies x_j \\le n$.\nThis condition is already enforced by the DP's state definition $dp[i]$ for $i \\le n$.\nSo the $F_{n+1}$ counts valid sequences of towers and powers.\n\nLet's re-examine $n=2$. $dp[2]=F_3=2$.\n1. $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This is valid.\n2. What is the other sequence?\n   $dp[i] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < i+1 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv i \\pmod 2 \\\\ j \\le 2n-i-1}} dp[j]$.\n   $dp[2] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < 3 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 2 \\\\ j \\le 2(2)-2-1=1}} dp[j]$.\n   This sum only includes $j=1$. So $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$.\n   $s_k = (i+j+1)/2 = (2+1+1)/2 = 2$. This gives $S=\\{1,2\\}$ where $s_1=1$ and $s_2=2$.\n   $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This is valid.\n   My previous $dp[2]=1$ was correct.\n   $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$\n   $dp[0]=1$.\n   $dp[1]=dp[0]=1$. (for $n=2$, $j=0 \\le 2(2)-1-1=2$. $s_1=1 \\le 2$).\n   $dp[2]=dp[1]=1$. (for $n=2$, $j=1 \\le 2(2)-2-1=1$. $s_1=2 \\le 2$).\n   So for $n=2$, $dp[n]=dp[2]=1$. The probability is $1/2^2 = 1/4$. This matches the example!\n\nLet's re-derive $dp[i]$ with the constraint $j \\le 2n-i-1$ carefully.\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j < i+1 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv i \\pmod 2 \\\\ j \\le 2n-i-1}} dp[j]$.\nLet $M = \\min(i, 2n-i-1)$.\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le M \\\\ j \\not\\equiv i \\pmod 2}} dp[j]$.\nThis is not $F_{i+1}$ for all $i$.\nFor $i \\le n$: $M = \\min(i, 2n-i-1)$.\nIf $i \\le n/2$, then $i \\le 2n-i-1$ is true. $M=i$.\nIf $i > n/2$, then $i > 2n-i-1$ is true. $M=2n-i-1$.\n\nLet's calculate $dp[i]$ for $n=5$:\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=dp[0]=1$. ($j=0 \\le \\min(1, 2(5)-1-1=8)$).\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$. ($j=1 \\le \\min(2, 2(5)-2-1=7)$).\n$dp[3]=dp[0]+dp[2]=1+1=2$. ($j=0,2 \\le \\min(3, 2(5)-3-1=6)$).\n$dp[4]=dp[1]+dp[3]=1+2=3$. ($j=1,3 \\le \\min(4, 2(5)-4-1=5)$).\n$dp[5]=dp[0]+dp[2]+dp[4]=1+1+3=5$. ($j=0,2,4 \\le \\min(5, 2(5)-5-1=4)$).\nThis is $dp[5]=dp[0]+dp[2]+dp[4]=1+1+3=5$.\nThe upper bound for $j$ is $M = \\min(i, 2n-i-1)$.\nFor $i=5, n=5$, $M=\\min(5, 2(5)-5-1) = \\min(5, 4) = 4$.\nSo $dp[5] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le 4 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv 5 \\pmod 2}} dp[j] = dp[0]+dp[2]+dp[4] = 1+1+3=5$.\nThe result for $n=5$ is $dp[5]=5$. Probability $5/2^5 = 5/32$. This matches the example!\n\nSo the recurrence is $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$ as long as $i \\le n$ and $j \\le 2n-i-1$ is not restrictive.\nThis condition is $i \\le 2n-i-1 \\implies 2i \\le 2n-1 \\implies i \\le n - 1/2$. So for $i \\le n-1$.\nSo $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$ for $i \\le n-1$.\nFor $i=n$:\n$dp[n] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le 2n-n-1 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv n \\pmod 2}} dp[j] = \\sum_{\\substack{0 \\le j \\le n-1 \\\\ j \\not\\equiv n \\pmod 2}} dp[j]$.\nIf $n$ is even: $j$ must be odd.\n$dp[n] = dp[1]+dp[3]+\\dots+dp[n-1]$.\nUsing $dp[j]=F_{j+1}$ for $j \\le n-1$:\n$dp[n] = F_2+F_4+\\dots+F_n$.\nThis is a known Fibonacci identity: $\\sum_{k=1}^m F_{2k} = F_{2m+1}-1$.\nSo $dp[n] = (F_3-1) + (F_5-F_3) + \\dots + (F_{n+1}-F_{n-1})$. No, this is not correct.\nThe identity $\\sum_{i=1}^k F_{2i} = F_{2k+1}-1$.\nHere $k$ goes from $1$ to $(n-1)/2$.\n$dp[n] = F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_{n-1}$. Let $m=(n-1)/2$.\nThis is $\\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2} F_{2k} = F_{2((n-1)/2)+1}-1 = F_n-1$.\nSo if $n$ is even, $dp[n] = F_n-1$.\n\nIf $n$ is odd: $j$ must be even.\n$dp[n] = dp[0]+dp[2]+\\dots+dp[n-1]$.\nUsing $dp[j]=F_{j+1}$ for $j \\le n-1$:\n$dp[n] = dp[0] + F_3 + F_5 + \\dots + F_n$.\nThe identity $\\sum_{i=0}^k F_{2i+1} = F_{2k+2}$.\n$dp[n] = F_1 + F_3 + F_5 + \\dots + F_n$.\nHere $k$ goes from $0$ to $(n-1)/2$.\n$dp[n] = F_{2((n-1)/2)+2} = F_{n+1}$.\n\nSo final answer for $dp[n]$:\n- If $n$ is even: $dp[n] = F_n-1$.\n- If $n$ is odd: $dp[n] = F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's recheck $n=2$ (even): $dp[2]=F_2-1 = 1-1=0$.\nThis is still $0$. But example gives $1/4$.\nThe problem is that $dp[0]=1$ is $F_1$. So $dp[j]=F_{j+1}$ is not consistent for $j=0$.\n$dp[0]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_3=2$.\nWait, $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5$.\nThis is $F_1, F_2, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5$.\nNo, this is $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5$.\nThe $dp[i]$ sequence is: $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$\nThis is $F_{i+1}$ for $i=0,1,3,4,5,\\dots$ but $dp[2]$ is $F_2=1$ not $F_3=2$.\n$dp[0]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=F_4=2$.\n$dp[4]=F_5=3$.\n$dp[5]=F_6=5$.\nThe sequence is $F_1, F_2, F_2, F_4, F_5, F_6, \\dots$.\nIn general, $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$ for $i \\ne 2$. And $dp[2]=F_2=1$.\nThis is $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$ with $F_3$ replaced by $F_2$.\nThis means $F_3=2$ becomes $F_2=1$.\n\nLet's use the actual computed values for $dp[i]$:\n$dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5, \\dots$\nFor $n=2$: $dp[2]=1$. Probability $1/4$. Correct!\nFor $n=3$: $dp[3]=2$. Probability $2/8 = 1/4$. Correct!\nFor $n=5$: $dp[5]=5$. Probability $5/32$. Correct!\n\nSo the values $dp[i]$ are Fibonacci numbers, $F_{i+1}$, but with $F_3$ replaced by $F_2$.\n$F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\n$dp[0]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=F_4=2$.\n$dp[4]=F_5=3$.\n$dp[5]=F_6=5$.\nFor $i \\ge 3$, $dp[i] = F_{i+1}$.\nFor $i=0,1,2$, $dp[i]$ are $1,1,1$.\n$dp[0]=F_1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2$.\n$dp[2]=F_2$.\n\nThe final answer is $dp[n]$.\nWe need to calculate $F_k \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe can use matrix exponentiation for $F_k$.\nThe matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{k-1} \\begin{pmatrix} F_2 \\\\ F_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{k-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nIf $n=0$: $dp[0]=1$. Prob $1/1=1$. (Not in constraints, $n \\ge 1$).\nIf $n=1$: $dp[1]=1$. Prob $1/2$. ($F_2=1$).\nIf $n=2$: $dp[2]=1$. Prob $1/4$. ($F_2=1$).\nIf $n=3$: $dp[3]=2$. Prob $2/8=1/4$. ($F_4=2$).\nIf $n \\ge 3$: $dp[n]=F_{n+1}$.\nSo for $n=1,2$, $dp[n]=1$. For $n \\ge 3$, $dp[n]=F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's define $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\n$n=1: dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$n=2: dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$n \\ge 3: dp[n]=F_{n+1}$.\nSo we need $F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_2$. For $n=2$, $F_2$.\nThis can be written as $F_{max(2, n+1)}$? No.\nIt's just $F_{n+1}$ except when $n=2$, it's $F_2$.\nSo, if $n=2$, compute $F_2=1$. Otherwise, compute $F_{n+1}$.\n\nFunction for Fibonacci using matrix exponentiation:\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mat_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, n):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = mat_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef fibonacci(k):\n    if k == 0:\n        return 0\n    if k == 1 or k == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Calculate F_k using matrix exponentiation\n    # [[F_{k+1}], [F_k]] = M^(k-1) * [[F_2], [F_1]]\n    # M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    M_pow_k_minus_1 = mat_pow(M, k - 1)\n    \n    # F_k is the (1,0) element of M_pow_k_minus_1 * [[1],[1]]\n    # [[F_k+1], [F_k]] = [[a, b], [c, d]] * [[1], [1]]\n    # F_k = c*1 + d*1 = c + d\n    return (M_pow_k_minus_1[1][0] + M_pow_k_minus_1[1][1]) % MOD\n\n```\nThe value to compute is `fibonacci(n+1)` if $n \\ne 2$, and `fibonacci(2)` if $n=2$.\nThis can be simplified: `fibonacci(n_val)` where `n_val = 2 if n == 2 else n + 1`.\n\nThe final probability is `dp_n * pow(2, n, MOD_INV)`.\n`MOD_INV = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)`.\n`pow(2, n, MOD_INV)` is `pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD - 2, MOD)`.\nThis is `pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD-2, MOD)`. Or simply `pow(pow(2, n), MOD-2, MOD)`.\nActually, it's `pow(2, n, MOD)` inverse. So `pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD-2, MOD)`.\nThis is `pow(2, -n, MOD)`.\n\nFinal calculation:\n`ans = fibonacci(n_val)`\n`inv_2_pow_n = pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD - 2, MOD)`\n`result = (ans * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD`\n\nLet's test `fibonacci(k)` for small values:\n`fibonacci(0) = 0`\n`fibonacci(1) = 1`\n`fibonacci(2) = 1`\n`fibonacci(3) = (M_pow_2[1][0] + M_pow_2[1][1]) % MOD`\n$M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$F_3 = 1+1=2$. Correct.\n`fibonacci(4) = (M_pow_3[1][0] + M_pow_3[1][1]) % MOD`\n$M^3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$F_4 = 2+1=3$.
