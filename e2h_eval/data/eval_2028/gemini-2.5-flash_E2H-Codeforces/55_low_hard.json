    "thought": "**Understanding Ternary String Swaps and Lexicographical Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this interesting problem of finding the lexicographically smallest string after applying specific swaps to a ternary string. My goal is to figure out the most efficient way to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I need to clearly understand the allowed and forbidden swaps. We can swap '0' and '1', and '1' and '2', but *not* '0' and '2'. This immediately tells me that the relative order of '0's and '2's is crucial – they can't cross each other. If I start with \"0...2\", it'll always remain that way, and vice versa for \"2...0\".\n\nI'm thinking about how the characters can move. A '0' can effectively move left, a '2' can move right, and a '1' can move freely through either. Since the prohibited '0' and '2' swaps maintain their relative order, this helps me see that my overall strategy should prioritize getting the smallest characters (i.e., '0's) as far left as possible and the largest characters (i.e., '2's) as far right as possible. '1's are flexible, but I will need to consider their optimal position.\n\nTherefore, the key insight is to consider how to group the '1's. It's clear that I need to place as many '0's at the beginning as possible, followed by the '1's, and then the '2's. Since I know the counts of each character type from the input, I can use that to generate the output, placing the '0's based on where they appear, then inserting the '1's, and finally filling the rest with '2's.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and a '1' can move past a '0'.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and a '2' can move past a '1'.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' <-> '2' swaps are *not* allowed. This means that a '0' cannot move past a '2', and a '2' cannot move past a '0'. The relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. For example, if the original string contains \"0...2\", then in any reachable string, that specific '0' must still appear before that specific '2'. Similarly, if it contains \"2...0\", that '2' must appear before that '0'.\n\nConsider the characters '0' and '2' as \"barriers\" for each other.\nAll '1's, however, can move freely past both '0's and '2's. This implies that all '1's can effectively be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as they don't violate the '0'/'2' relative order.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's in the string. Let this be `count_1`.\nSince '1's can move past '0's and '2's, all '1's can be grouped together. Where should this group of '1's be placed?\n\nConsider the string formed by removing all '1's from the original string. This new string will consist only of '0's and '2's. Let's call this `s_no_ones`. For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `s_no_ones = \"0020\"`.\nSince '0's cannot cross '2's, the relative order of characters in `s_no_ones` is fixed. We cannot change `s_no_ones` itself.\n\nNow, we need to insert the `count_1` ones back into `s_no_ones` to form the lexicographically smallest string.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nAll '0's that appear in `s_no_ones` can be moved to the left, but they cannot move past any '2's.\nAll '1's can be moved to the left past any '0's.\nAll '1's can be moved to the left past any '2's.\n\nThis means that any '0' can move to the left until it hits a '2' or the beginning of the string.\nAny '2' can move to the right until it hits a '0' or the end of the string.\nAny '1' can move freely.\n\nTherefore, we can move all '0's to the very beginning of the string, *as long as they don't cross any '2's*.\nSimilarly, we can move all '2's to the very end of the string, *as long as they don't cross any '0's*.\nThe '1's can be placed anywhere.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. All '0's should come first.\n2. Then all '1's.\n3. Then all '2's.\n\nHowever, the '0'/'2' restriction complicates this.\nIf there are '2's before '0's in `s_no_ones`, those '2's must remain before those '0's.\n\nLet's find the first occurrence of '2' in the original string `s`. If there are no '2's, then the string consists only of '0's and '1's. In this case, we can move all '0's to the left of all '1's. The result is `count_0` zeros followed by `count_1` ones.\n\nIf there are '2's, let `first_two_idx` be the index of the first '2' in `s`.\nAll '0's that appear *before* this `first_two_idx` can be moved to the very beginning of the string.\nAll '1's can be moved.\nAll '0's that appear *after* this `first_two_idx` cannot move past this `first_two_idx` (or any '2').\n\nThe optimal strategy is:\n1. Collect all '0's from the input string `s`.\n2. Collect all '2's from the input string `s`.\n3. Count all '1's from the input string `s`. Let this be `count_1`.\n\nThe resulting string will be formed by:\n- All '0's from `s`.\n- All '1's (repeated `count_1` times).\n- All '2's from `s`.\n\nThe key insight is that the '1's act as a \"movable block\". Since '1's can swap with both '0's and '2's, they can effectively be moved past any '0' or '2'. This means all '1's can be gathered together and placed anywhere in the sequence of '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's first. The '1's should come after the initial block of '0's. The '2's must come last.\n\nSo, the optimal string structure is:\n(all '0's that appear in `s`) + (all '1's from `s`) + (all '2's from `s`)\nThis is wrong. This would imply that '0's and '2's can swap if there are '1's between them. For example, \"210\" -> \"201\" (swap 1 and 0) -> \"021\" (swap 2 and 0, NOT ALLOWED).\n\nLet's re-think.\nThe relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\nThis means we can form a \"base string\" by removing all '1's and keeping the '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n`s_no_ones = \"0020\"`\nNumber of '1's = 2.\n\nNow, we need to insert the two '1's into \"0020\" to get the lexicographically smallest string.\nTo make it smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nThe '1's should come *after* all '0's that can be moved to the beginning, but *before* any '2's that cannot be moved left.\nThe '1's can be moved past *any* '0' or *any* '2'.\nSo, all '1's can be collected and placed at a single position.\nWhere is this optimal position? After all '0's that are not blocked by '2's, and before all '2's.\nThis means all '1's should be placed right after the last '0' that appears *before* the first '2'.\n\nConsider the string `s`.\nIterate through `s`.\nIf we see a '0', it contributes to the initial block of '0's.\nIf we see a '1', it contributes to the block of '1's that will be inserted.\nIf we see a '2', this '2' and all subsequent characters (including '0's and '1's) cannot have any '0's from *before* this '2' moved past them.\n\nThe simplest way to think about it is:\n1. All '0's can move to the left past any '1'.\n2. All '2's can move to the right past any '1'.\n3. '0's cannot move past '2's. '2's cannot move past '0's.\n\nThis implies that the sequence of '0's and '2's is fixed.\nExample: `s = \"010210\"`\n`s_no_ones = \"0020\"`\nNumber of '1's = 2.\n\nOutput string structure:\nPrefix of '0's.\nThen all '1's.\nThen the remaining '0's and '2's.\n\nLet's find the first '2' in the original string `s`.\nAll '0's that appear *before* this first '2' can be moved to the very beginning of the string.\nAll '1's can be moved.\nAll '0's that appear *after* this first '2' (if any) cannot move before this '2'.\n\nSo, the resulting string will look like this:\n(all '0's from `s` that appear before the first '2') + (all '1's from `s`) + (all '0's from `s` that appear after the first '2', and all '2's from `s` in their original relative order).\n\nThis can be simplified:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in `s`. Let it be `count_1`.\n2. Construct a new string `res` by iterating through `s`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to `res`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '2', append '2' to `res`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', do nothing (we will insert all '1's later).\n\nNow `res` contains only '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`. `count_1 = 2`. `res = \"0020\"`.\n\nWe need to insert `count_1` ones into `res` to make it lexicographically smallest.\nTo make it smallest, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nThe '1's should be inserted right after the last '0' that appears *before* the first '2' in `res`.\nIf `res` contains no '2's, then all '0's come first, then all '1's.\nIf `res` contains no '0's, then all '1's come first, then all '2's.\n\nIn general, find the first occurrence of '2' in `res`. Let its index be `idx_first_two`.\n- If `res` contains no '2's, then `res` is like \"000\". The final string is `res` + (`count_1` ones).\n- If `res` contains '2's, then `res` is like \"0020\". We want to insert `count_1` ones at `idx_first_two`.\n  So, `res[:idx_first_two]` + (`count_1` ones) + `res[idx_first_two:]`.\n\nLet's test this logic with examples:\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `count_1 = 2`.\n2. `res = \"0020\"`. (Remove '1's, keep '0's and '2's in relative order)\n3. Find first '2' in `res`. It's at index 2 (`res[2]`).\n4. Result: `res[:2]` + \"11\" + `res[2:]`\n   `\"00\"` + `\"11\"` + `\"20\"` = `\"001120\"`\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `count_1 = 4`.\n2. `res = \"2222\"`. (Remove '1's)\n3. Find first '2' in `res`. It's at index 0 (`res[0]`).\n4. Result: `res[:0]` + \"1111\" + `res[0:]`\n   `\"\"` + `\"1111\"` + `\"2222\"` = `\"11112222\"`\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `count_1 = 0`.\n2. `res = \"20\"`.\n3. Find first '2' in `res`. It's at index 0 (`res[0]`).\n4. Result: `res[:0]` + \"\" + `res[0:]`\n   `\"\"` + `\"\"` + `\"20\"` = `\"20\"`\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 4: `s = \"000\"`\n1. `count_1 = 0`.\n2. `res = \"000\"`.\n3. Find first '2' in `res`. No '2's.\n4. Result: `res` + \"\" = `\"000\"`.\nThis is correct.\n\nExample 5: `s = \"111\"`\n1. `count_1 = 3`.\n2. `res = \"\"`.\n3. Find first '2' in `res`. No '2's.\n4. Result: `res` + \"111\" = `\"\"` + `\"111\"` = `\"111\"`.\nThis is correct.\n\nThe logic seems solid. The reasoning is that '1's are \"neutral\" and can move past '0's and '2's. Therefore, all '1's can be grouped together. To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, this group of '1's should be placed as far left as possible, but not before any '0' that is itself blocked by a '2'. The '0's and '2's maintain their relative order. Thus, the optimal position for the block of '1's is right before the first '2' in the '0'/'2' subsequence. If there are no '2's, they go at the end of all '0's. If there are no '0's, they go before all '2's. This is precisely what `res[:idx_first_two]` + (`count_1` ones) + `res[idx_first_two:]` achieves.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string once to build `res` (string of '0's and '2's) and count `count_1`.\n- Find the index of the first '2' in `res`. Python's `str.find('2')` returns -1 if not found.\n- Construct the final string using string slicing and concatenation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    # Use a list to build the string of '0's and '2's for efficient concatenation\n    zeros_and_twos = [] \n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            zeros_and_twos.append(char)\n    \n    # Convert list of chars to string\n    s_no_ones = \"\".join(zeros_and_twos)\n\n    # Find the position to insert the '1's\n    # We want to insert '1's after all '0's that can be moved to the front,\n    # and before any '2's.
