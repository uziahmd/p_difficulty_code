String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Beautiful Strings\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to count \"beautiful strings.\" These are binary strings with a specific number of zeros (`n`) and ones (`m`), and a final character `g` derived from a modified version of the string. The modification is a reduction operation, acting on the last two characters in the string, using the `NOT (x OR y)` logic.\n\nMy initial thought was to break down the modification operation. It boils down to `NOT (x | y)`, making the whole string evaluation right-associative reduction. If any '1' appears early in the string, it will eventually force the entire result to be '0' due to the `OR` nature of the operator.\n\nIf the target character, `g`, is '1', the operation demands that only strings starting with `0` can qualify. This restricts the problem to strings such that the remaining portion of the string evaluates to a '0'. The core of the problem becomes calculating how many such strings there are.\n\nI considered a dynamic programming (DP) approach. Let `dp[n][m][g]` represent the count of beautiful strings with `n` zeros, `m` ones, and target `g`.\n\nThe base cases are strings of length 1, where the result directly matches the character. For larger strings, the value becomes dependent on the initial character and the rest of the string.\n\nIf `g` is '1', the string must start with '0'.  The remaining substring must evaluate to '0', which maps to `dp[n-1][m][0]`.\n\nIf `g` is '0', there are two possibilities: the string starts with '1', or the string starts with '0'. When it starts with '1', any string with n zeros and m-1 ones works. When it starts with '0', we should get a one if `g=0` but since we negate the substring, the resulting substring must evaluate to 1. This maps to `dp[n-1][m][1]`.\n\nSo, the recurrence relations become:\n- `dp[n][m][1] = dp[n-1][m][0]`\n- `dp[n][m][0] =  (dp[n][m-1][0] + dp[n][m-1][1]) + dp[n-1][m][1]`\n\nMy focus now is implementing this dynamic programming, making sure to handle edge cases like when we run out of zeros or ones. The core is using the properties of this `NOT(x | y)` operation and tracing the logic of the transformation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of \"beautiful strings\" of length `N+M` with `N` zeros and `M` ones, such that applying a specific reduction operation results in a character `G`. The result should be modulo 1000000007.\n\nLet `val(s)` be the character obtained from string `s` by repeated application of the modification operation. The operation replaces the two last characters `x, y` with `1` if `x=0, y=0`, and `0` otherwise. This can be expressed as `val(..., x, y) = NOT (x OR y)`, where `0` is `False` and `1` is `True`. The operations are applied from right to left: `val(c_1 c_2 ... c_k) = val(c_1, val(c_2, ..., val(c_{k-1}, c_k) ... ))`.\n\nLet's analyze `val(s)`:\n`val(c_1 c_2 ... c_k) = NOT (c_1 OR val(c_2 ... c_k))` for `k >= 2`.\n\nCrucial observations:\n1.  **If `c_1 = 1`**: `val(1 c_2 ... c_k) = NOT (1 OR val(c_2 ... c_k)) = NOT (1) = 0`.\n    This means if a string starts with '1', its final value is always '0'.\n2.  **If `c_1 = 0`**: `val(0 c_2 ... c_k) = NOT (0 OR val(c_2 ... c_k)) = NOT (val(c_2 ... c_k))`.\n    This means if a string starts with '0', its final value is the negation of the value of the suffix `c_2 ... c_k`.\n\nEdge case: `N+M = 1`.\nThe problem states \"It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.\"\n- If `N=1, M=0`, the string is \"0\". Its value is '0'.\n- If `N=0, M=1`, the string is \"1\". Its value is '1'.\nSo, if `N+M=1`, the answer is 1 if `G` matches the single character, and 0 otherwise.\n\nFor `N+M >= 2`, we can use dynamic programming. Let `dp[n][m][g_target]` be the number of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that evaluate to `g_target`.\nThe total length of the string is `k = n+m`.\n\n**Base Cases for DP (N+M = 1):**\n`dp[1][0][0] = 1` (string \"0\")\n`dp[1][0][1] = 0`\n`dp[0][1][0] = 0`\n`dp[0][1][1] = 1` (string \"1\")\n\n**Recursive Relations for DP (N+M >= 2):**\n\n1.  **`dp[n][m][1]` (strings evaluating to '1'):**\n    -   From observation 1, the string cannot start with '1'. So `c_1` must be '0'. This implies `n >= 1`.\n        If `n=0`, then `dp[0][m][1] = 0` for `m >= 1`.\n    -   If `n >= 1`, the string starts with '0'. From observation 2, `val(s) = NOT val(s')`.\n        For `val(s)=1`, we need `val(s')=0`.\n        `s'` is a string of length `n+m-1` with `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n    -   Therefore, `dp[n][m][1] = dp[n-1][m][0]` for `n >= 1`.\n\n2.  **`dp[n][m][0]` (strings evaluating to '0'):**\n    This can happen in two ways:\n    a.  **String starts with '1' (`c_1=1`):** This implies `m >= 1`.\n        From observation 1, if `c_1=1`, `val(s)=0` always.\n        The remaining `n` zeros and `m-1` ones can be arranged in any way. The number of such strings is `dp[n][m-1][0] + dp[n][m-1][1]`.\n        This sum is equivalent to `(n+m-1) choose n`, the total number of strings with `n` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n    b.  **String starts with '0' (`c_1=0`):** This implies `n >= 1`.\n        From observation 2, `val(s) = NOT val(s')`.\n        For `val(s)=0`, we need `val(s')=1`.\n        `s'` is a string of length `n+m-1` with `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n        The number of such strings is `dp[n-1][m][1]`.\n\n    Combining these:\n    -   If `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`: `dp[n][m][0] = (dp[n][m-1][0] + dp[n][m-1][1]) + dp[n-1][m][1]`.\n    -   If `n = 0` (and `m >= 2` since `N+M >= 2`): Only case (a) is possible. `dp[0][m][0] = (dp[0][m-1][0] + dp[0][m-1][1])`.\n    -   If `m = 0` (and `n >= 2` since `N+M >= 2`): Only case (b) is possible. `dp[n][0][0] = dp[n-1][0][1]`.\n\nAll additions are modulo 1000000007.\n\n**Special handling for `m=0` (all zeros):**\n-   `n=1, m=0`: `val(\"0\") = 0`. `dp[1][0][0]=1, dp[1][0][1]=0`.\n-   `n=2, m=0`: `val(\"00\") = NOT (0 OR 0) = 1`. `dp[2][0][1]=1, dp[2][0][0]=0`.\n-   `n=3, m=0`: `val(\"000\") = NOT (0 OR val(\"00\")) = NOT (0 OR 1) = 0`. `dp[3][0][0]=1, dp[3][0][1]=0`.\n-   In general, for `m=0` and `n >= 1`: `val(0^n) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\n    This means `dp[n][0][1] = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\n    And `dp[n][0][0] = 1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\n    This can be directly used instead of the DP relations for `m=0`.\n\n**Special handling for `n=0` (all ones):**\n-   `n=0, m=1`: `val(\"1\") = 1`. `dp[0][1][0]=0, dp[0][1][1]=1`.\n-   `n=0, m=2`: `val(\"11\") = NOT (1 OR 1) = 0`. `dp[0][2][0]=1, dp[0][2][1]=0`.\n-   `n=0, m=3`: `val(\"111\") = NOT (1 OR val(\"11\")) = NOT (1 OR 0) = 0`. `dp[0][3][0]=1, dp[0][3][1]=0`.\n-   In general, for `n=0` and `m >= 1`: `val(1^m) = 1` if `m=1`, `0` if `m >= 2`.\n    This means `dp[0][m][1] = 1` if `m=1`, `0` if `m >= 2`.\n    And `dp[0][m][0] = 0` if `m=1`, `1` if `m >= 2`.\n    This can be directly used instead of the DP relations for `n=0`.\n\nThe maximum value for `n, m` is `10^5`. A 2D DP table would be `10^5 x 10^5`, which is too large.\nNotice that `dp[n][m][g_target]` only depends on `dp[n-1][m][...]` and `dp[n][m-1][...]`. This is similar to Pascal's triangle for combinations. We can compute values iteratively.\n\nIterative computation:\nInitialize `dp[n][m][0]` and `dp[n][m][1]` to 0.\nHandle `N+M=1` base cases.\nThen iterate `k` from 2 to `N+M`. For each `k`, iterate `n` from 0 to `k`. Let `m = k-n`.\nCompute `dp[n][m][0]` and `dp[n][m][1]` using the relations.\nRemember to handle `n=0` or `m=0` specifically.\n\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Handle N+M = 1 edge case\n    if n + m == 1:\n        if n == 1: # String \"0\"\n            print(1 if g == 0 else 0)\n        else: # String \"1\"\n            print(1 if g == 1 else 0)\n        return\n\n    # dp[i][j][0] = count of strings with i zeros, j ones, evaluating to 0\n    # dp[i][j][1] = count of strings with i zeros, j ones, evaluating to 1\n    # We only need the previous row (i-1) and current row (i) or previous column (j-1) and current column (j)\n    # Since we iterate by total length k = i+j, we can use 2D arrays (current and previous) or observe dependencies.\n    # The dependencies are (n-1, m) and (n, m-1).
