You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

It essentially means that each partition set forms a clique.\n    # Since it's bipartite, the only way this can happen is if one of the partition sets is empty or contains only one node.\n    # Example: A component is A-B-C. A(0), B(1), C(0). If A,C are connected, it's an odd cycle. But we checked that.\n    # If A,C are not connected, we add it. This is `ways_t1_corrected`.\n    # So if `ways_t1_corrected` is 0, it means for all components, for all u,v in the same partition, (u,v) is an edge.\n    # This means each component is a complete bipartite graph K_{X,Y} where X or Y has size at most 1.\n    # Or, it means the graph is a collection of disjoint cliques.\n    # If a component is K_{X,Y} where |X| >= 2 and |Y| >= 2, then any two nodes in X are same color, but they are not connected.\n    # This would contribute to ways_t1_corrected.\n    # So, if ways_t1_corrected is 0, then for every component, one of the color sets has size at most 1.\n    # This means each component is a \"star\" graph or a path of length 1 (single edge) or isolated vertices.\n    # e.g., A-B-C-D.

Contradiction to `has_odd_cycle` check.\n    # So, `ways_t1_corrected` must be > 0 unless the graph has very specific structure.\n    # The only way `ways_t1_corrected` can be 0 is if for every component, at least one of the color sets has size 0 or 1.\n    # This means each component is a collection of isolated vertices, or a single edge, or a star graph.\n    # In such a graph, there are no two non-adjacent vertices of the same color.\n    # For example, in a star graph with center C and leaves L1, L2, L3.\n    # If C is color 0, L1, L2, L3 are color 1.\n    # No two leaves are connected. So (L1, L2) would be a pair of same-colored non-adjacent vertices.\n    # This would contribute to ways_t1_corrected.\n    # This means that for `ways_t1_corrected` to be 0, each component must be a collection of isolated vertices or a single edge.\n    # This is wrong. Consider a path A-B-C. A(0), B(1), C(0). No edge A-C. So ways_t1_corrected would be 1.\n    # So `ways_t1_corrected` will only be 0 if there are no two nodes of the same color that are not already connected.\n    # This means for each component, if we take nodes of color 0, they form a clique. Same for color 1.\n    # Since it's bipartite, this implies one of the color sets has size at most 1.\n    # E.g., if color 0 has nodes {u, v} and color 1 has {w}. Then (u,v) is an edge.\n    # And (u,w), (v,w) are edges. This is a triangle. But we checked for odd cycles.\n    # This means that if `ways_t1_corrected` is 0, then for every component, all nodes are of distinct colors,\n    # or there is only one node of a particular color.\n    # This means each component is a set of isolated vertices or a single edge.\n    # If the graph is a set of isolated vertices, or a set of single edges, then `ways_t1_corrected` is 0.\n    # Example: 3 0 (3 vertices, 0 edges). All isolated. colors[0]=0, colors[1]=0, colors[2]=0.\n    # nodes_color0 = {0,1,2}. Pairs (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). All not edges. ways_t1_corrected = 3.\n    # My example 3 output is 3 1. This means t=3, w=1.\n    # This implies that `ways_t1_corrected` is not what I thought.\n    # The example output 3 0 -> 3 1 means t=3. So t=1 and t=2 must be 0 ways.\n\n    # Let's re-read the problem: \"simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex\".\n    # A simple cycle means no repeated vertices.\n    # My interpretation of t=1 is: add one edge (u,v) such that u and v are in the same component, and colors[u] == colors[v].\n    # This creates an odd cycle. This is the minimum possible number of edges if such a pair exists.\n\n    # What if the graph is 3 0?\n    # n=3, m=0.\n    # colors = [-1, -1, -1].\n    # First component: node 0. dfs_bipartite(0,0,...) -> colors[0]=0.\n    # Second component: node 1. dfs_bipartite(1,0,...) -> colors[1]=0.\n    # Third component: node 2. dfs_bipartite(2,0,...) -> colors[2]=0.\n    # has_odd_cycle = False.\n    # `ways_t1_corrected`:\n    # For component 0 (node 0): nodes_color0 = {0}. No pairs.\n    # For component 1 (node 1): nodes_color0 = {1}. No pairs.\n    # For component 2 (node 2): nodes_color0 = {2}. No pairs.\n    # `ways_t1_corrected` is 0. This is consistent with example 3 0 -> 3 1.\n    # So if `ways_t1_corrected` is 0, it means all components are single nodes or single edges.\n    # This means that there are no two non-adjacent nodes of the same color *within the same component*.\n    # This is a key insight. If `ways_t1_corrected` is 0, then each component must be a collection of isolated vertices or a single edge.\n    # This means each connected component is either K_1 or K_2.\n    # This is incorrect. Consider a path graph P_3: 0-1-2.\n    # colors[0]=0, colors[1]=1, colors[2]=0.\n    # nodes_color0 = {0,2}. (0,2) is not an edge. So ways_t1_corrected would be 1.\n    # The example 3 0 -> 3 1 means t=3. So t=1 and t=2 must be 0 ways.\n    # This implies my `ways_t1_corrected` logic is wrong for the 3 0 case.\n    # Ah, the `dfs_bipartite` function only colors nodes within a single connected component.\n    # If the graph is disconnected, each component is colored independently.\n    # So if nodes 0, 1, 2 are isolated, they are in 3 separate components.\n    # colors[0]=0, colors[1]=0, colors[2]=0 (because each is the start of a new component DFS).\n    # Then `ways_t1_corrected` would be 0 because for component {0}, nodes_color0={0}, no pairs. Same for {1} and {2}.\n    # This is correct for 3 0. `ways_t1_corrected` = 0.\n\n    # Now consider t = 2.\n    # To form an odd cycle with 2 added edges:\n    # Case 2a: Add two edges within the same component.\n    # This would mean connecting three nodes A, B, C. E.g., A-B, B-C are existing. Add A-C (t=1).\n    # If t=1 is 0, then we can't do this.\n    # Another way: we have A, B, C, D in a component. Add A-B, C-D. This forms an odd cycle if A,B,C,D are part of a path.\n    # e.g., A-X-Y-Z-B. Add A-B. This is t=1.\n    # If t=1 is 0, it means all components are sets of isolated nodes or single edges.\n    # If a component is a single isolated node (say, node U). We need to add 2 edges.\n    # To form an odd cycle, we need at least 3 vertices.\n    # If we have isolated nodes U, V, W. Add U-V, V-W, W-U. This is t=3.\n    # If we have U-V, W, X.
