He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down.** I'm looking at a competitive programming problem where I'm given a bunch of prefixes and suffixes of a hidden string, and I need to figure out which is which. The length of the string, `n`, is given, and I have `2n-2` strings to work with.  The key insight, as I see it, is that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. This is critical.  \n\nFirst, I need to understand that I'm essentially reconstructing the original string by matching the proper prefixes and suffixes. I'm imagining the original string `s = s_1 s_2 ... s_n`. The problem is that I don't know the exact order. This information will be used to determine if a candidate `s_cand` is valid.\n\nI started thinking about the two strings of length `n-1`.  Let's call them `str1` and `str2`. One of them is the prefix of length `n-1`, and the other is the suffix of length `n-1`. Let's explore two scenarios:  \n\n**Scenario 1:** If `str1` is the prefix, then `s = str1 + s_n`, where `s_n` is the last character of the original string. This means that `str2` must be `s_2 s_3 ... s_n`.  In this case, `str2` is the same as `str1`, but with the first letter cut off and the last letter added to create a candidate. More precisely, `str1[1:]` should be equal to `str2[:-1]`. If this doesn't hold, then this combination is not valid. The candidate string, in this scenario is `candidate_s1 = str1 + str2[-1]`.\n\n**Scenario 2:**  Alternatively, If `str2` is the prefix, then `s = str2 + s_n`, where `s_n` is the last character of the original string, meaning that `str1` must be `s_2 s_3 ... s_n`. In this case, `str1` is the same as `str2` but with the first character omitted and an additional character. This means that `str2[1:]` must be equal to `str1[:-1]`. Here, the candidate string, is `candidate_s2 = str2 + str1[-1]`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a solution exists, I'm confident that *at least* one of these scenarios will be valid.  I can check for consistency based on this logic.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the algorithm itself.  I need to take the provided strings, and check the two longest strings, which will be length `n-1`. I'll try constructing the candidate string in the first scenario and validating. If that fails, I can switch the roles and try constructing the string in the second scenario.\n\nThe way I'm planning to validate is to compare the constructed string with the input. After I have the valid `candidate_s` string (either `candidate_s1` or `candidate_s2`), I need to check every given string to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of the `s_candidate` string. The problem is complicated by the presence of strings that are both prefixes *and* suffixes (or multiple occurrences of identical prefix or suffix strings). So, simply comparing a set of prefixes and suffixes I generate from s_candidate with the input won't work. The goal is to keep track of *which* prefix/suffix matches *which* input string. So, I will need to process input and candidate at the same time.\n\nIn the first step, I need to read the `n` value, and then the strings. The main part is a nested loop that builds the candidate string. I am thinking, I have to keep track of the original index of each string to build the \"P/S\" string to output. I need to output \"P\" if it is a prefix, and \"S\" if it is a suffix.\n\nSo, I have to construct a function that will take the `s_candidate` and the input strings and, for each given string, determines if it is the prefix, the suffix, or none of them. I'll need to create a list of length `2n-2` to store \"P\" and \"S\". I will iterate over each of the candidate prefixes and suffixes, using length as the main index, while also checking against the input strings. So, to keep track of duplicates, I will use a mutable copy of the input strings, and assign each the value of \"P\" or \"S\". I need to be careful about not assigning twice to the",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of `2n-2` given strings, whether it is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that the input strings are exactly all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`) of some valid string `s`. Crucially, there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe most important observation is that for any length `k` (where `1 <= k < n`), there are two input strings of length `k`. One of these must be the prefix of `s` of length `k`, and the other must be the suffix of `s` of length `k`.\n\nLet's focus on the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these be `strA` and `strB`.\nOne of them must be `s[0:n-1]` (the prefix of `s` of length `n-1`), and the other must be `s[1:n]` (the suffix of `s` of length `n-1`).\n\nThis gives us two possibilities for constructing the original string `s`:\n\n**Possibility 1:**\nAssume `strA` is the prefix `s[0:n-1]` and `strB` is the suffix `s[1:n]`.\nFor this to be consistent, `strA[1:]` (suffix of `strA` of length `n-2`) must be equal to `strB[:-1]` (prefix of `strB` of length `n-2`).\nIf this condition holds, then the candidate string `s` would be `strA + strB[-1]` (or equivalently, `strA[0] + strB`).\n\n**Possibility 2:**\nAssume `strB` is the prefix `s[0:n-1]` and `strA` is the suffix `s[1:n]`.\nFor this to be consistent, `strB[1:]` must be equal to `strA[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, then the candidate string `s` would be `strB + strA[-1]` (or equivalently, `strB[0] + strA`).\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, at least one of these two possibilities must lead to a valid string `s`. We can try the first possibility. If it leads to a valid `s`, we use it. Otherwise, the second possibility must be valid.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Read Input and Store:**\n    *   Read `n`.\n    *   Read the `2n-2` input strings. Store each string along with its original index to reconstruct the output later.\n    *   It's helpful to group these strings by their length. A dictionary `strings_by_length = {length: [(string, original_index), ...], ...}` is suitable.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidate `s`:**\n    *   Find the two strings of length `n-1` from `strings_by_length[n-1]`. Let them be `(str1, idx1)` and `(str2, idx2)`.\n    *   **Candidate `s_cand1`:** Assume `str1` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str2` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n        *   Check if `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`.\n        *   If true, `s_cand1 = str1 + str2[-1]`.\n    *   **Candidate `s_cand2`:** Assume `str2` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str1` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n        *   Check if `str2[1:] == str1[:-1]`.\n        *   If true, `s_cand2 = str2 + str1[-1]`.\n\n3.  **Validate and Choose `s`:**\n    *   We need a function `is_valid(candidate_s, all_input_strings)` that checks if `candidate_s` generates all the given `2n-2` input strings as its prefixes and suffixes.\n        *   Generate all prefixes `candidate_s[0:k]` and suffixes `candidate_s[n-k:n]` for `k` from 1 to `n-1`.\n        *   Collect these generated strings into a list, sort it.\n        *   Collect just the string values from `all_input_strings`, sort it.\n        *   If the sorted lists are identical, `candidate_s` is valid.\n    *   Try `s_cand1`. If it's valid, pick `s_actual = s_cand1` and remember that `str1` was the prefix of length `n-1`.\n    *   Otherwise (if `s_cand1` was not valid or couldn't be formed), `s_cand2` must be valid (due to problem guarantees). Pick `s_actual = s_cand2` and remember that `str2` was the prefix of length `n-1`.\n\n4.  **Construct Output String:**\n    *   Initialize an array `ans_arr` of size `2n-2` with empty strings.\n    *   For each length `k` from 1 to `n-1`:\n        *   Identify the expected prefix `p_k = s_actual[0:k]` and suffix `s_k = s_actual[n-k:n]`.\n        *   From `strings_by_length[k]`, get the two input strings `(in_s1, in_idx1)` and `(in_s2, in_idx2)`.\n        *   Assign 'P' and 'S':\n            *   If `in_s1 == p_k` and `in_s2 == s_k`, then `ans_arr[in_idx1] = 'P'` and `ans_arr[in_idx2] = 'S'`.\n            *   Otherwise (it must be `in_s1 == s_k` and `in_s2 == p_k`), then `ans_arr[in_idx1] = 'S'` and `ans_arr[in_idx2] = 'P'`.\n    *   Join `ans_arr` into a single string and print it.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (with original indices):\n`('ba', 0), ('a', 1), ('abab', 2), ('a', 3), ('aba', 4), ('baba', 5), ('ab', 6), ('aba', 7)`\n\n`strings_by_length`:\n`1: [('a', 1), ('a', 3)]`\n`2: [('ba', 0), ('ab', 6)]`\n`3: [('aba', 4), ('aba', 7)]`\n`4: [('abab', 2), ('baba', 5)]`\n\nStrings of length `n-1 = 4`: `str1 = 'abab'` (idx 2), `str2 = 'baba'` (idx 5).\n\n**Possibility 1:** `str1` is prefix, `str2` is suffix.\n`str1 = 'abab'`, `str2 = 'baba'`\nCheck `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`: `'bab' == 'bab'`. True.\n`s_cand1 = str1 + str2[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'`.\nCheck `is_valid('ababa', ...)`:\nGenerated prefixes ('a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab') and suffixes ('a', 'ba', 'aba', 'baba').\nSorted generated: `['a', 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'aba', 'abab', 'ba', 'baba']`\nSorted input: `['a', 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'aba', 'abab', 'ba', 'baba']`\nThey match. So `s_actual = 'ababa'`.\n\n**Construct Output:** `ans_arr = [''] * 8`\n`k=1`: `p_1 = 'a'`, `s_1 = 'a'`. Input: `('a', 1), ('a', 3)`.
