    "thought": "**Array Stabilization: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of this problem is about making an array \"stable\", which translates to minimizing the difference between the largest and smallest numbers after removing *one* element. My immediate thought is, to minimize the range (max - min), I should target either the current smallest or largest number for removal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The input is an array `a` of size `n`, and I need to find the minimum possible instability, which is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element of the remaining array *after* removing one element. There are constraints on `n` and the values within the array.\n\nThinking through examples, the idea solidifies. If I have `[1, 3, 3, 7]`, removing `1` or `7` seems to give the lowest instability (2). If I had `[1, 100000]`, removing either element results in an instability of 0, leaving just one number. This aligns with the understanding: I need to get the max and min as close as possible.\n\nTo formalize this, I'll sort the array, let's call it `a_sorted`. Now, after removing an element, the minimum and maximum of the remaining array will either be the second smallest and the largest, or the smallest and the second largest. This is key!\n\nI reason through the possible cases. If I remove the smallest element (`a_sorted[0]`), the new instability is `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]`. If I remove the largest (`a_sorted[n-1]`), the instability becomes `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]`. Removing any other element in the middle keeps the original max and min, which will *never* lead to a smaller instability because the range would be the original `max - min`.\n\nTherefore, the *minimum* instability is simply the minimum of the two cases: removing the smallest, and removing the largest! I can express this with code: `min(a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1], a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0])`.\n\nThe algorithm is pretty straightforward: sort the array, calculate those two instabilities, and then return the smaller one.\n\nI need to quickly test with a few edge cases: arrays of size 2, and all elements the same. Both should give correct answers.\n\nNow, for implementation details: I'll use Python's built-in `sort()` for simplicity and efficiency (knowing that Python's `sort` is efficient enough for this problem). For I/O, I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for speed. The algorithm has time complexity `O(n log n)` due to sorting, which is well within the acceptable limit. Space complexity will be `O(n)` which is also fine in the context.\n\nI've got the Python script ready to go!\n",
