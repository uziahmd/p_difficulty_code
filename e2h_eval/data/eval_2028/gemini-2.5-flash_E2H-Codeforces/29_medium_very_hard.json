Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy initial task is to develop a Python script to address the \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, a competitive programming challenge. I need to handle a string of digits (`s`) and a series of queries, each defining a digit-to-string replacement rule. The goal is to determine the final numerical value of the modified string, modulo a specific prime number (`10^9 + 7`).\n\nThe primary challenge lies in the potential for exponential string growth due to repeated substitutions. Direct string manipulation would be computationally expensive. Therefore, I need an approach that avoids explicit string construction. I've identified that I need to calculate the final value of each digit individually and track its position (power of 10) in the final number.\n\n**Mathematical Foundation and Modular Arithmetic**\n\nI've established that the value of a number is determined by the values and positions of its digits. Each digit `D_k` contributes `D_k * 10^k` to the total value. Crucially, the final result needs to be calculated modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFermat's Little Theorem is key here. Since `10^9 + 7` is prime, `10^(10^9 + 6)` is equivalent to `1 (mod 10^9 + 7)`. This means that when calculating powers of 10 (which dictate digit positions), I can take the exponent modulo `10^9 + 6`. I need to define `val[d]` which will hold the final numeric value of a digit, after all transformations.  I need a `len[d]` that will track the length of the string to which digit `d` transforms.\n\n**Query Processing and Algorithm Design**\n\nI realize that the order of query processing is critical. If I process queries in the order given, it's difficult to know the final value of a digit when I need to perform a subsequent substitution that involves that digit. I've concluded that processing the queries in *reverse* order is the best way to determine `val` and `len` accurately. When applying a query `di -> ti`, I can assume that all digits in `ti` have already been transformed by subsequent queries.\n\nSo, I initialize a `val_map` with single digits, and their starting length `len_map = 1`. Processing queries in reverse, I update `val[di]` to the value of `ti` after transforming characters within it, and `len[di]` with the same logic. This means I'm iteratively building up the final form of each digit, taking modular exponentiations into account for both the values and lengths.\n\nAfter all queries are processed, I iterate through the initial string `s` and calculate the final result using the transformed values and lengths from `val_map` and `len_map`, applying modular arithmetic throughout.\n\n**Implementation Details and Optimizations**\n\nThe Python implementation involves reading input (initial string and queries), storing queries in a list, and initializing two dictionaries (`val_map` and `len_map`). The reverse processing loop iterates through the queries, and the final calculation loop processes the original string. I will use Python's built-in `pow(base, exp, mod)` function for efficient modular exponentiation. It's time complexity for modular exponentiation is `O(log(exp))` which is fine.\n\nTo avoid redundant computations, the `len` is stored modulo (`10^9 + 6`) to handle exponent calculations efficiently. The code can also handle edge cases where a query maps a digit to an empty string; the values of those digit will be 0 and the length will also be 0. It takes care of leading zeros during the final calculation, so the result is correct.\n\nI'm confident the logic is sound, time-efficient, and covers all relevant cases. I have included example walkthroughs and will now implement and test.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit substitutions in a string `s` and then find the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become very long, so a direct simulation of string operations is not feasible.\n\nThe key idea is to calculate, for each digit `d` from 0 to 9, what its final numerical value `val[d]` and its final length `len[d]` will be after all substitutions.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nWhen we concatenate numbers, say `A` followed by `B`, the value is `A * 10^(length of B) + B`. All calculations must be done modulo `MOD`.\nFor the powers of 10, `10^k % MOD`, if `MOD` is prime, by Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^(MOD-1) % MOD = 1`. This means exponents can be taken modulo `MOD-1`. So, `len[d]` values should be calculated modulo `MOD-1`. Let `MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`.\n\nThe substitutions are applied sequentially. This means a query `d -> t` affects all occurrences of `d` that are currently in the string. If `t` itself contains digits, those digits will be further transformed by *subsequent* queries. This suggests that to determine the final `val[d]` and `len[d]` for an initial digit `d`, we need to process the queries in *reverse order*.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Create two maps (or arrays of size 10): `val_map` and `len_map`.\n    *   For each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n        *   `val_map[str(d)] = d` (initially, a digit `d` represents itself).\n        *   `len_map[str(d)] = 1` (initially, a digit `d` has length 1).\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse**:\n    *   Store all `n` queries.\n    *   Iterate through the queries from the last query (`n-1`) down to the first query (`0`).\n    *   For each query `di -> ti`:\n        *   Initialize `current_val = 0` and `current_len = 0`.\n        *   If `ti` is an empty string:\n            *   Set `val_map[di] = 0` and `len_map[di] = 0`. This correctly represents an empty string having value 0 and length 0.\n            *   Continue to the next query.\n        *   Otherwise (if `ti` is not empty):\n            *   Iterate through each character `char_in_ti` in `ti` from left to right.\n            *   For each `char_in_ti`, retrieve its current `digit_val = val_map[char_in_ti]` and `digit_len = len_map[char_in_ti]`. These values represent the final value and length of `char_in_ti` after all *subsequent* queries have been applied.\n            *   Update `current_val`: `current_val = (current_val * pow(10, digit_len, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD`. This effectively appends the transformed string of `char_in_ti` to the current accumulated string.\n            *   Update `current_len`: `current_len = (current_len + digit_len) % MOD_EXP`.\n        *   After processing all characters in `ti`, update `val_map[di] = current_val` and `len_map[di] = current_len`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Result from Initial String `s`**:\n    *   Initialize `final_result = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `char_s` in the original string `s` from left to right.\n    *   For each `char_s`, retrieve its final `digit_val = val_map[char_s]` and `digit_len = len_map[char_s]`.\n    *   Update `final_result`: `final_result = (final_result * pow(10, digit_len, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD`.\n\n4.  **Output**: Print `final_result`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Reading input and storing queries: `O(|s| + N + sum(|ti|))`.\n    *   Processing queries in reverse: The loop runs `N` times. Inside the loop, we iterate over `ti`. The total number of `char_in_ti` processed across all queries is `sum(|ti|)`. For each `char_in_ti`, we perform modular exponentiation `pow(10, digit_len, MOD)`, which takes `O(log(MOD_EXP))` time. So, this part is `O(sum(|ti|) * log(MOD))`.\n    *   Calculating final result from `s`: The loop runs `|s|` times. Each step involves modular exponentiation. So, this part is `O(|s| * log(MOD))`.\n    *   Total time complexity: `O((|s| + sum(|ti|)) * log(MOD))`. Given `|s| <= 10^5`, `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5`, and `log(MOD)` is around 30, this is approximately `(2 * 10^5) * 30 = 6 * 10^6` operations, which is efficient enough.\n*   **Space Complexity**:\n    *   Storing queries: `O(N + sum(|ti|))`.\n    *   `val_map` and `len_map`: `O(1)` (fixed size 10).\n    *   Total space complexity: `O(N + sum(|ti|))`. This is also within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = 1000000006 # For exponents, use M-1 (Fermat's Little Theorem)\n\n    # Initialize val_map and len_map for single digits\n    # val_map[d] stores the numerical value of the string that digit d transforms into, modulo MOD\n    # len_map[d] stores the length of the string that digit d transforms into, modulo MOD_EXP\n    val_map = {str(d): d for d in range(10)}\n    len_map = {str(d): 1 for d in range(10)}\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    # This ensures that when we process a query di -> ti,\n    # the val_map and len_map for characters in ti already reflect\n    # the transformations from subsequent queries.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di, ti = queries[i]\n\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n\n        if not ti: # If ti is an empty string\n            val_map[di] = 0\n            len_map[di] = 0\n            continue\n        \n        # Calculate new_val and new_len for di based on ti\n        # Iterate through ti from left to right\n        for char_in_ti in ti:\n            digit_val = val_map[char_in_ti]\n            digit_len = len_map[char_in_ti]\n\n            # The value of the number formed by appending digit_val (which has length digit_len)\n            # to current_val (which has length current_len)\n            # is (current_val * 10^digit_len + digit_val)\n            current_val = (current_val * pow(10, digit_len, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD\n            current_len = (current_len + digit_len) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        val_map[di] = current_val\n        len_map[di] = current_len\n\n    # Calculate the final result from the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n\n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_val = val_map[char_s]\n        digit_len = len_map[char_s]\n\n        # Same calculation as above for building the final number\n        final_result = (final_result * pow(10, digit_len, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
