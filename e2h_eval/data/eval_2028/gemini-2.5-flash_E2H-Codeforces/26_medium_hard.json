Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Quest for Valid Triangles**\n\nAlright, so I'm tasked with counting those delightful, non-degenerate triangles. Integer sides, gotta love it!  The setup is pretty clear: we've got sides *x, y, z* and a bunch of constraints: *A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D*.  The key is that for a triangle to actually *be* a triangle, the sum of any two sides has to be greater than the third. That's our golden rule, and since we know *x ≤ y ≤ z*, we only really have to worry about *x + y > z*. That simplifies things considerably.\n\nMy initial thought was to brute-force it, triple-looping through all possible values of *x, y, and z*.  But my expert intuition (and a little math) tells me that's going to be a computational disaster!  With *D* potentially reaching 500,000, that triple loop would blow up into something ridiculously slow. Nope, we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, let's fix *x* and *y* and see what happens to *z*.  We already know *C ≤ z ≤ D* and we want *z < x + y*. Combining these, *z* has to be in the range from *C* up to the *minimum* of *D* and *x + y - 1*.  Boom!  We've got a range for *z*. The number of valid *z* values for a given *x* and *y* is easily calculated.\n\nNow, instead of the triple loop, we'll do a double loop for *x* and *y*, running their ranges (A to B, B to C). Inside this double loop, we'll calculate our count of valid *z* values. This reduces our problem significantly, but the double loop is still too slow!\n\nA lightbulb goes off!  I realize that *x + y* comes up so often, it makes sense to consolidate it into a single variable, which I’ll call *k*. Since we’re adding two variables, *k=x+y* must take value from *A+B to B+C*. Let's introduce a function *f(k)*: the number of pairs *(x, y)* that give us *k*, within our ranges. Then another function called count(k), which will hold our number of *z* possible from *k*. This means we can count all these valid triangles like this: we have our outer loop from k= A+B to B+C. Then we have f(k) and count(k) calculation for all possible *k*. Finally, we can use *f(k)* and *count(k)* to get the final total:\n\nSo,  `total = sum(f(k)*count(k))`\n\nTo calculate *f(k)*, we think about *k* (x+y), and solve for one of the variables. For all possible *k=x+y*, we will find the number of pairs *(x, y)* that add up to *k*, within those *A, B, C, D* ranges. And finally, *count(k)* which takes advantage of the fact that the sum x+y limits the values of z we can use. This means for *k* less than C, there are 0 valid z, from C to D there are k-C, and when greater than D, the count(k) is just D-C+1. We're going to use this approach for our double-nested iteration.\n\nNow to optimize it, let’s see if we can find any shortcuts. The functions *f(k)* and *count(k)* might be tricky.  *f(k)* is limited to *k = x+y* for the triangle condition. *count(k)* counts the values of z that can be paired up with x and y.\n\nBut let's think about this: when calculating *f(k)* there is a range.\n*A <= x <= B and B <= y <= C* and since *k = x+y*, that means  *x = k-y* (solving this is just a quick algebraic manipulation). So we are checking for which y’s are valid within range:\n\nWe need *A ≤ k-y ≤ B* so we also need *max(A, k-C) ≤ y ≤ min(B, k-B)*.\nThen count the values of x and y (the pair) to get our *f(k)*.\n\nAs for *count(k)*, we need to consider 3 cases:\n(1) If *k - 1 < C*, then there are no valid *",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` satisfying the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nThis simplifies the triangle inequalities:\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= 1`, `y + z >= x + z > x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= 1`, `x + z >= x + y > y`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, we only need to satisfy the first inequality: `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to count integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nThe condition `x + y > z` can be rewritten as `z <= x + y - 1`.\nCombining this with `C <= z <= D`, the valid range for `z` for fixed `x` and `y` is `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate over `x`, `y`, and `z`, which would be `O((B-A)(C-B)(D-C))`, too slow for `D` up to `5 \\cdot 10^5`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, and then directly calculating the count of `z`.\nLet `k = x + y`. The number of valid `z` values depends only on `k`.\nLet `count_z(k)` be the number of valid `z` values for a given sum `k = x + y`.\n`count_z(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe possible values for `k = x + y` range from `A + B` (minimum `x` and `y`) to `B + C` (maximum `x` and `y`).\nSo, we can iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`.\nFor each `k`, we need to find how many pairs `(x, y)` exist such that `x + y = k` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\nLet `f(k)` be this number of pairs `(x, y)`.\nThe total number of triangles will be `sum_{k=A+B}^{B+C} f(k) * count_z(k)`.\n\nLet's derive `f(k)`:\nWe have `x + y = k`, so `y = k - x`.\nThe conditions on `x` and `y` are:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n\nSubstitute `y = k - x` into the second condition:\n`B <= k - x <= C`\nThis implies two inequalities for `x`:\n   `B <= k - x  =>  x <= k - B`\n   `k - x <= C  =>  x >= k - C`\n\nCombining all conditions for `x`:\n`max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B)`\n\nThe number of integer values for `x` in this range is `max(0, min(B, k - B) - max(A, k - C) + 1)`. This is `f(k)`.\n\nLet's refine `count_z(k)`:\n`count_z(k)` is the number of integers `z` such that `C <= z <= D` and `z <= k-1`.\n1. If `k - 1 < C`: There are no `z` values that satisfy `z >= C` and `z <= k-1`. So, `count_z(k) = 0`. This is equivalent to `k <= C`.\n2. If `C <= k - 1 <= D`: Valid `z` values are `C, C+1, ..., k-1`. The count is `(k-1) - C + 1 = k - C`. This is equivalent to `C+1 <= k <= D+1`.\n3. If `k - 1 > D`: Valid `z` values are `C, C+1, ..., D`. The count is `D - C + 1`. This is equivalent to `k > D+1`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C` (inclusive).\n3. For each `k`:\n    a. Calculate `x_min_k = max(A, k - C)`\n    b. Calculate `x_max_k = min(B, k - B)`\n    c. Calculate `f_k = max(0, x_max_k - x_min_k + 1)`. If `f_k` is 0, no pairs `(x, y)` exist for this `k`, so continue to the next `k`.\n    d. Calculate `count_k`:\n        If `k <= C`: `count_k = 0`\n        Else if `k <= D + 1`: `count_k = k - C`\n        Else (`k > D + 1`): `count_k = D - C + 1`\n    e. Add `f_k * count_k` to `total_triangles`.\n4. Print `total_triangles`.\n\nThe loop for `k` runs `(B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1` times. Given `A, C <= 5 \\cdot 10^5`, this is at most `5 \\cdot 10^5` iterations. Each iteration involves a constant number of arithmetic operations. This complexity is efficient enough to pass within typical time limits. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the potentially large `total_triangles` value (up to `2.5 \\cdot 10^{11}`).\n\nExample: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n- `k` ranges from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n- `k=3`:\n    - `x_min_k = max(1, 3-3) = 1`, `x_max_k = min(2, 3-2) = 1`. `f_k = 1-1+1 = 1` (pair (1,2)).\n    - `count_k`: `k=3 <= C=3` is true. `count_k = 0`.\n    - `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n- `k=4`:\n    - `x_min_k = max(1, 4-3) = 1`, `x_max_k = min(2, 4-2) = 2`. `f_k = 2-1+1 = 2` (pairs (1,3), (2,2)).\n    - `count_k`: `k=4 > C=3` and `k=4 <= D+1=5`. `count_k = k-C = 4-3 = 1`.\n    - `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n- `k=5`:\n    - `x_min_k = max(1, 5-3) = 2`, `x_max_k = min(2, 5-2) = 2`. `f_k = 2-2+1 = 1` (pair (2,3)).\n    - `count_k`: `k=5 > C=3` and `k=5 <= D+1=5`. `count_k = k-C = 5-3 = 2`.\n    - `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`.\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    # Iterate k = x + y.\n    # x ranges from A to B.\n    # y ranges from B to C.\n    # Thus, k = x + y ranges from (min x + min y) to (max x + max y).\n    # Minimum k = A + B.\n    # Maximum k = B + C.\n    for k in range(A + B, B + C + 1):\n        # Calculate f_k: number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y = k\n        # and A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C.\n        # From y = k - x, the conditions become:\n        # A <= x <= B\n        # B <= k - x <= C  =>  k - C <= x <= k - B\n        \n        # Combining these, x must satisfy:\n        # max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B)\n        \n        x_min_k = max(A, k - C)\n        x_max_k = min(B, k - B)\n        \n        # Number of x values in this range (inclusive)\n        f_k = max(0, x_max_k - x_min_k + 1)\n        \n        # If no (x, y) pairs exist for this k, move to the next k.\n        if f_k == 0:\n            continue\n            \n        # Calculate count_k: number of z such that C <= z <= D and z < k (i.e., z <= k - 1).\n        # So z must be in the range [C, min(D, k - 1)].\n        \n        count_k = 0\n        if k <= C:\n            # If k-1 < C, then min(D, k-1) < C.
