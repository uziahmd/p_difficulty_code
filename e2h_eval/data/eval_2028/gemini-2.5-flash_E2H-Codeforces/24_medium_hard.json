She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI'm given a competitive programming problem where I need to find the minimum time to close tabs outside a specific range. I have `n` tabs, my cursor's initially at `pos`, and the tabs I want to keep open are `[l, r]`. My actions are moving the cursor left or right, or closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.  `a` and `b` track the current range of open tabs.\n\nThe core idea is to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means closing `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. There are two main approaches:\n1.  Close the left side first, then the right side.\n2.  Close the right side first, then the left side.\n\nI need to analyze different scenarios:\n\n*   **If `l == 1` and `r == n`:** No tabs need to be closed; the answer is `0`.\n*   **If `l == 1` (only right tabs need closing):** The time is the distance to `r` from the current position `pos` plus 1 (to close the tabs to the right). That is, `|pos - r| + 1`.\n*   **If `r == n` (only left tabs need closing):** The time is the distance to `l` from the current position `pos` plus 1 (to close the tabs to the left). That is, `|pos - l| + 1`.\n*   **If `l > 1` and `r < n`:** We must close both left and right sides. I calculate the cost for closing left first and closing right first. The costs for each option are the distance from `pos` to `l` or `r` plus `r - l` (move within tabs) and 2 to close the tabs. I choose the path that has the lowest cost. The final formula becomes `min(|pos-l|+(r-l)+2, |pos-r|+(r-l)+2)`.\n\nI also noticed that the `a` and `b` in each of the move operations signify the minimum and maximum indices of the *current* unclosed tab. For example, if I'm at position `i` and closing the tabs `[i+1, b]`, then the new maximum unclosed tab is the position where the cursor is at i.\n\nI've carefully considered different test cases, especially edge ones, and derived the optimal approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the target range `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's analyze the actions and their costs:\n1.  **Move cursor left/right:** 1 second per step. The cursor can only move within the currently unclosed tabs. If the current unclosed range is `[a, b]`, moving left from `i` goes to `max(i-1, a)`, and moving right from `i` goes to `min(i+1, b)`.\n2.  **Close tabs left/right:** 1 second per operation. If the cursor is at `i`, closing tabs to the left closes `[a, i-1]`, making `i` the new `a`. Closing tabs to the right closes `[i+1, b]`, making `i` the new `b`.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where the minimum unclosed tab index `a` is `l` and the maximum unclosed tab index `b` is `r`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nWe can categorize the scenarios:\n\n**1. No tabs need to be closed (`l=1` and `r=n`):**\n   If the desired range `[l, r]` covers all tabs from `1` to `n`, then no action is needed.\n   Time: `0`\n\n**2. Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l=1` and `r<n`):**\n   We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at `r`, and then we perform the \"close tabs right\" operation.\n   -   Move the cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n   -   Perform the \"close tabs right\" operation. This takes `1` second.\n   Time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n\n**3. Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`r=n` and `l>1`):**\n   We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at `l`, and then we perform the \"close tabs left\" operation.\n   -   Move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n   -   Perform the \"close tabs left\" operation. This takes `1` second.\n   Time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`\n\n**4. Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l>1` and `r<n`):**\n   We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two \"close\" operations, so at least 2 seconds for closing. We also need to move the cursor to `l` (to close left) and to `r` (to close right). The order of closing matters for the total movement cost.\n\n   *   **Option A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n      1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n      2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now, the minimum unclosed tab is `l`).\n      3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds. (The cursor moves within the remaining unclosed tabs `[l, n]`).\n      4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now, the maximum unclosed tab is `r`).\n      Total time for Option A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\n   *   **Option B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n      1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n      2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now, the maximum unclosed tab is `r`).\n      3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds. (The cursor moves within the remaining unclosed tabs `[1, r]`).\n      4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now, the minimum unclosed tab is `l`).\n      Total time for Option B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\n   The minimum time for this case is `min(Option A, Option B)`.\n\nThese four cases cover all possibilities and are mutually exclusive. The logic ensures that the cursor always moves efficiently to the required position for closing, and the movement costs between `l` and `r` are correctly calculated as `r-l` because `l <= r`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed (r is n)\n    elif r == n:\n        # Move cursor from pos to l, then close left\n        # Cost = (movement to l) + (close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed (l is 1)\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Move cursor from pos to r, then close right\n        # Cost = (movement to r) + (close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    # Case 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed\n    else:\n        # Option A: Close left first, then right\n        # 1.
