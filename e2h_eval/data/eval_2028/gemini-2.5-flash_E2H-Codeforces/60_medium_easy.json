Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and formulate a dynamic programming solution in Python.**\n\nThe core challenge revolves around counting distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing substrings of a binary string `S`.  The binary string is built by appending '0's and '1's. '0' is dot and '1' is dash in morse code.\n\nMy strategy involves dynamic programming and requires careful consideration of what defines a \"distinct sequence\" within the constraints of valid Morse codes.  A brute-force approach, checking all substrings and parsing, is too slow given the problem's size constraints.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n1.  **Understand the Morse Code Rules**:  Dots are '0', Dashes are '1'. English letters' Morse code representations are 1 to 4 in length. There are 26 valid Morse codes, and 4 specific strings are invalid.\n2.  **Define \"Distinct Sequence\"**: A sequence of English letters is formed when a substring `sub` can be broken down into valid Morse codes. We need the count of *unique* sequences.\n3.  **Data Structure for Sequences**:  The `set` structure sounds promising to store the sequences because it's designed to contain unique elements.\n4.  **Dynamic Programming**:  `dp[i]` could store distinct sequences formed by the suffix, `S[i:]`. I tried a number of variations of the `dp` array. I also considered a `memo` structure.\n5.  **Append Operation**: When a new character is appended to `S`, the newly formed sequences depend on the substrings that end at the new character's position.\n6.  **Hashing**: I considered polynomial hashing to ensure uniqueness of the sequences, since the number of distinct sequences could be very big. I had to count hashes with modulo `10^9 + 7`, which implied I couldn't simply use a `set` of hashes.\n7.  **Complexity Analysis**: The complexity must be low since `m=3000`. So I have to use DP properly. I have to avoid a nested loop that is `O(m^2)` or `O(m^3)`.\n8.  **Re-evaluate and Optimize**: I kept the maximum code length of 4 in mind as it's the key constraint to reduce complexity and use the DP structure appropriately.\n\nMy best strategy is to think about using a DP approach with the key observation that the largest valid Morse code is of length 4. This means I only have to consider up to 4 characters when forming a new sequence by adding a new character to `S`.\n\nThis problem is a tough one and I have to be careful with my implementation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of *distinct non-empty sequences of English letters* that can be formed by parsing *any substring* of a growing Morse code string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet's first define what constitutes a valid Morse code for an English letter:\nA string `code` is valid if its length is between 1 and 4, and it's not one of the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". Since we are only counting distinct sequences, we don't need to know which letter a code represents, only that it is a valid code. We can assign a unique integer ID to each valid code (e.g., 1 to 26).\n\nThe challenge is to count *distinct* sequences modulo `10^9 + 7`. This typically implies using polynomial hashing. We'll use two hash functions to minimize collisions, although for competitive programming problems, one hash function is often sufficient if parameters are chosen carefully.\n\nLet `S` be the current Morse code string. Its length is `k`.\nWe need to find all sequences of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` such that `L_1` is represented by `S[i:j_1]`, `L_2` by `S[j_1:j_2]`, ..., `L_p` by `S[j_{p-1}:j]`, for some `0 <= i <= j < k`.\n\nLet `dp[idx]` be a set of hashes. Each hash in `dp[idx]` represents a distinct sequence of letters that can be formed by parsing the suffix `S[idx:]`.\nWhen a new character `char` is appended to `S` (making its length `k`):\n1.  We initialize `S_current = S_old + char`.\n2.  We need to update `dp` values for suffixes `S_current[j:]` where `j` is close to `k-1`. Specifically, since a letter's code has length at most 4, `dp[j]` depends on `dp[j+1]`, `dp[j+2]`, `dp[j+3]`, `dp[j+4]`. So, we only need to recompute `dp[j]` for `j` from `k-1` down to `max(0, k-4)`.\n3.  We maintain a global set `total_hashes` to store all distinct hashes found from *any* substring of `S`.\n\nLet's refine the DP state and update process:\n`S_list` will be a list of characters representing `S`.\n`memo[j]` will be a set of `(hash1, hash2)` tuples, representing sequences formed by `S_list[j:]`.\n`total_distinct_hashes` will be a set of `(hash1, hash2)` tuples, storing all distinct sequences found so far.\n\nConstants for hashing:\n`MOD1 = 10^9 + 7`\n`MOD2 = 10^9 + 9`\n`P1 = 31` (or some other prime, e.g., 37, 53)\n`P2 = 53` (another prime)\n\nMapping Morse codes to letter IDs:\nWe need a consistent way to map valid Morse codes to integer IDs for hashing. Since there are 26 English letters, we can map them to integers `1` through `26`. We can create a `dict` or `set` of valid codes.\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`valid_code_id_map = {}`\n`current_letter_id = 1`\nFor `length` from 1 to 4:\n  For `code` in `all_binary_strings_of_length(length)`:\n    If `code` not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n      `valid_code_id_map[code] = current_letter_id`\n      `current_letter_id += 1`\n\nAlgorithm for each append:\n1.  Read `new_char` (either '0' or '1'). Append it to `S_list`. Let `k = len(S_list)`.\n2.  `dp = [set() for _ in range(k + 1)]` (reinitialize `dp` for new `S_list` length, or just keep `memo` and extend it).\n    Actually, we can use `memo` as a global list of sets, where `memo[j]` stores results for `S_list[j:]`. When `k` increases, we only need to compute `memo[k-1]`, `memo[k-2]`, etc. up to `memo[max(0, k-4)]`.\n    `memo[k]` is an empty set (representing the \"empty sequence\" after `S_list[k-1]` if it's the last char).\n\n3.  For `j` from `k-1` down to `0`: (We only need to iterate down to `max(0, k-4)` for new results, but iterating from `k-1` down to `0` for all `j` ensures `memo[j]` is fully computed for `S_list[j:]`. This is actually `O(k)` iterations.)\n    `current_suffix_hashes = set()`\n    For `l` from 1 to 4:\n        If `j + l <= k`:\n            `code = \"\".join(S_list[j : j + l])`\n            If `code` in `valid_code_id_map`:\n                `letter_id = valid_code_id_map[code]`\n                `h1_letter, h2_letter = letter_id, letter_id` (simple hash for a single letter)\n\n                If `j + l == k`: # `code` is the last part of the substring `S_list[j:k]`\n                    `current_suffix_hashes.add((h1_letter, h2_letter))`\n                Else: # `code` is followed by other letters from `S_list[j+l:]`\n                    For `h1_suffix, h2_suffix` in `memo[j+l]`:\n                        `new_h1 = (h1_letter * P1 + h1_suffix) % MOD1`\n                        `new_h2 = (h2_letter * P2 + h2_suffix) % MOD2`\n                        `current_suffix_hashes.add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n    `memo[j] = current_suffix_hashes`\n    `total_distinct_hashes.update(current_suffix_hashes)`\n\n4.  Print `len(total_distinct_hashes) % MOD1`. (The problem asks for modulo `10^9+7`, which is `MOD1`. The number of distinct hashes itself is not taken modulo, only the final count.)\n\nComplexity Analysis:\n*   `m` appends.\n*   In each append, `k` goes from `1` to `m`.\n*   The outer loop `for j from k-1 down to 0` iterates `k` times.\n*   The inner loop `for l from 1 to 4` iterates 4 times.\n*   String slicing `\"\".join(S_list[j : j + l])` takes `O(l)` time.\n*   `memo[j+l]` can contain up to `O(26^k)` hashes in the worst case (if all sequences of length `k` are distinct and valid). This is the problematic part.\n    However, the number of *distinct sequences* that can be formed from a substring of length `L` (max `m`) is bounded.\n    The maximum size of `memo[j]` is actually bounded by `m * 4` (number of ways to start a sequence at `j` with a letter of length 1-4, then recursively). The total number of sequences is `O(26^L)` where `L` is the maximum length of a letter sequence.\n    The crucial insight is that the number of distinct sequences that can be formed from `S[j:]` is not necessarily exponential. It's bounded by `k * 4 * (max_size_of_memo_entry_at_k+l)`.\n    The maximum number of distinct sequences from `S[j:]` is `O(k * 26)`.\n    `memo[j]` stores hashes for `S[j:]`. The number of elements in `memo[j]` could be `O(k)`.\n    So, `total_distinct_hashes` could grow up to `O(m^2)` elements.\n    Each `update` operation for `current_suffix_hashes` to `total_distinct_hashes` takes `O(|current_suffix_hashes|)`.\n    The total complexity would be `O(m * k * 4 * O(k)) = O(m^3)`.\n    `3000^3 = 2.7 * 10^10`, which is too slow.\n\nLet's re-examine the `j` loop.\nWhen `S_list` gets a new character at index `k-1`, only `memo[k-1]`, `memo[k-2]`, `memo[k-3]`, `memo[k-4]` (and `memo[k-5]` if `k-5 >= 0`) might change.\n`memo[j]` depends on `memo[j+1], memo[j+2], memo[j+3], memo[j+4]`.\nSo, when `S_list[k-1]` is added:\n`memo[k]` is implicitly empty.\nWe compute `memo[k-1]` using `memo[k]`.\nThen `memo[k-2]` using `memo[k-1], memo[k]`.\nThen `memo[k-3]` using `memo[k-2], memo[k-1], memo[k]`.\nThen `memo[k-4]` using `memo[k-3], memo[k-2], memo[k-1], memo[k]`.\nAny `memo[j]` for `j < k-4` would depend on `memo[j+1]`...`memo[j+4]`, which haven't changed.\nSo, we only need to compute `memo[j]` for `j` from `k-1` down to `max(0, k-4)`. This is a constant number of iterations (at most 4).\n\nRevised Complexity:\n*   `m` appends.\n*   For each append (new length `k`):\n    *   Iterate `j` from `k-1` down to `max(0, k-4)`: `O(1)` iterations (at most 4).\n    *   Iterate `l` from 1 to 4: `O(1)` iterations (at most 4).\n    *   String slicing `O(l)` (constant, max 4).\n    *   `memo[j+l]` can have size up to `O(k)`.\n    *   Looping `h_suffix` in `memo[j+l]` takes `O(k)` time in worst case.\n    *   Set operations `add` and `update` take `O(1)` average.\n    *   Total per append: `O(1) * O(1) * (O(1) + O(k)) = O(k)`.\n*   Total complexity: `sum_{k=1 to m} O(k) = O(m^2)`.\n*   `3000^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is acceptable.\n\nMax size of `total_distinct_hashes`: `O(m^2)` unique sequences. For `m=3000`, this is `9 * 10^6`.
