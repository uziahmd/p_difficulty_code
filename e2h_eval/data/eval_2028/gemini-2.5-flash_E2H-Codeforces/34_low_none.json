And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Clarifying the Sleep Time Average Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" in this dataset. I need to be absolutely clear on what constitutes a \"week\" and how the average is calculated.\n\nInitially, I thought it was the average of the weekly averages. That is, calculate the average for each week (sum of sleep times in a week divided by k), and then average *those* averages. However, the example provided seems to indicate this isn't the intended calculation.\n\nLet's re-examine the example with `k=2`, `n=3`, and `a=[3, 4, 7]`.\n\nMy initial thought was:\n\n*   Week 1: [3, 4], Average = 3.5\n*   Week 2: [4, 7], Average = 5.5\n*   Average of Weekly Averages = (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 4.5.\n\nBut the example shows the output to be 9.0.  This implies a different calculation.\n\nAfter a closer look, and more careful re-reading, it seems the script should calculate:\n\n1.  Sum the sleep times for each week (consecutive `k` days).\n2.  Sum up all these weekly sums.\n3.  Divide the total sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nSo, for the example:\n\n*   Week 1 Sum: 3 + 4 = 7\n*   Week 2 Sum: 4 + 7 = 11\n*   Total Sum: 7 + 11 = 18\n*   Average: 18 / 2 = 9.0\n\nThat aligns perfectly with the example output. Therefore, the core logic is to sum up all the elements for each consecutive `k` day \"week\" and then average these sums together, across all the weeks. This final division should yield the correct average sleep time as per the prompt's requirements. Now, I have a clear understanding of the calculation and can write the script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" of `k` consecutive days. There are `n - k + 1` such weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times for its `k` days. Then, we sum up all these weekly sums and divide by the total number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nLet `a` be the sequence of sleep times.\nThe weeks are:\n1.  `a[0], ..., a[k-1]`\n2.  `a[1], ..., a[k]`\n...\n`n - k + 1`. `a[n-k], ..., a[n-1]`\n\nLet `S_i` be the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (0-indexed).\n`S_0 = a[0] + ... + a[k-1]`\n`S_1 = a[1] + ... + a[k]`\n...\n`S_{n-k} = a[n-k] + ... + a[n-1]`\n\nWe need to calculate `(S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}) / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `n - k + 1` weeks, and for each week, sum its `k` elements. This would take `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time, which could be up to `O(n*k)`. Given `n` up to `2 * 10^5`, `n*k` could be `(2 * 10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}`, which is too slow.\n\nWe can optimize this using a sliding window sum.\n1.  Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements (`S_0`). This takes `O(k)` time.\n2.  To get `S_1` from `S_0`, we can subtract `a[0]` and add `a[k]`. `S_1 = S_0 - a[0] + a[k]`. This takes `O(1)` time.\n3.  In general, `S_i = S_{i-1} - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`. This also takes `O(1)` time.\n\nSo, we can calculate `S_0`, then `S_1`, ..., `S_{n-k}` by performing `O(1)` operations for each subsequent sum. The total time complexity would be `O(k)` for the initial sum + `O(n - k)` for the remaining sums, which simplifies to `O(n)`. This is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nThe algorithm would be:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements: `current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])`.\n4. Initialize `total_sum_of_weeks = current_week_sum`.\n5. Iterate from `i = 1` to `n - k`:\n    a. Update `current_week_sum` by subtracting `a[i-1]` and adding `a[i+k-1]`.\n    b. Add `current_week_sum` to `total_sum_of_weeks`.\n6. The final average is `total_sum_of_weeks / (n - k + 1)`.\n7. Print the result with sufficient precision.\n\nExample: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n1. `n=3, k=2`.\n2. `a=[3, 4, 7]`.\n3. `current_week_sum = sum(a[0:2]) = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n4. `total_sum_of_weeks = 7`.\n5. Iterate `i` from `1` to `3 - 2 = 1`. So, only for `i=1`.\n    a. `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n       `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n       `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n       `current_week_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`.\n    b. `total_sum_of_weeks = total_sum_of_weeks + current_week_sum = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n6. Average = `total_sum_of_weeks / (n - k + 1) = 18 / (3 - 2 + 1) = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n7.
