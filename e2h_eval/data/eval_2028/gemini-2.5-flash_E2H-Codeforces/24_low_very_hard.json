She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and I need to figure out the fastest way to close tabs outside a given range. I've got to find the minimum time to shut down all tabs outside the bounds `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's break down the key parts. I've got `n` tabs total, my initial cursor position `pos`, and the crucial range `[l, r]` that I need to keep open.\n\nThe problem defines these operations, each taking a second: I can move the cursor left (bounded by the leftmost open tab), move it right (bounded by the rightmost open tab), close tabs to the left of the cursor, and close tabs to the right of the cursor.  My goal is to close everything outside `[l, r]`.\n\nInitially, `a` will be the index of the leftmost open tab and `b` is the index of the rightmost. I was initially thinking `a` and `b` would simplify to `l` and `r` respectively, however on closer inspection I realized that `a` and `b` are dynamic.\n\nI realized I need to consider what I have to close: everything from `1` to `l-1` (if `l > 1`) and everything from `r+1` to `n` (if `r < n`). I can see there are a few main cases:\n\n1.  **`l = 1` and `r = n`:** No tabs to close, time is zero. This is a trivial case.\n2.  **`l = 1` and `r < n`:** I need to close `[r+1, n]`.\n3.  **`l > 1` and `r = n`:** I need to close `[1, l-1]`.\n4.  **`l > 1` and `r < n`:** I need to close both `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is analyze each of these scenarios carefully and determine the most efficient sequence of moves. I'll need to figure out whether it's faster to move the cursor to one end and close from there, or if there's a more clever strategy.  I'm going to start with scenario 2, and consider a specific example to figure this out.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. Each operation (moving cursor, closing tabs to left/right) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n1.  **Move cursor left/right**: Takes 1 second per step.\n2.  **Close tabs to the left of cursor `i`**: Closes `[a, i-1]`. This operation effectively changes the minimum unclosed tab index `a` to `i`.\n3.  **Close tabs to the right of cursor `i`**: Closes `[i+1, b]`. This operation effectively changes the maximum unclosed tab index `b` to `i`.\n\nThe goal is to keep tabs `[l, r]` and close `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`).\n\nWe can categorize the problem into four cases based on `l` and `r`:\n\n**Case 1: `l = 1` and `r = n`**\nAll tabs are within the desired range `[1, n]`. No tabs need to be closed.\nMinimum time = 0.\n\n**Case 2: `l = 1` and `r < n`**\nWe need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Tabs `[1, r]` must remain open.\nThe cursor must eventually reach tab `r` to perform the \"close right\" operation.\n*   **Move cursor to `r`**: The cursor starts at `pos`. It needs to move to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n*   **Close tabs to the right**: Once at `r`, Luba can close `[r+1, n]`. This takes 1 second.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: `l > 1` and `r = n`**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Tabs `[l, n]` must remain open.\nThe cursor must eventually reach tab `l` to perform the \"close left\" operation.\n*   **Move cursor to `l`**: The cursor starts at `pos`. It needs to move to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n*   **Close tabs to the left**: Once at `l`, Luba can close `[1, l-1]`. This takes 1 second.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Case 4: `l > 1` and `r < n`**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` AND tabs `[r+1, n]`. Tabs `[l, r]` must remain open.\nThis requires two \"close\" operations: one at `l` (to close left) and one at `r` (to close right).\nThe cursor must visit both `l` and `r`. The path from `pos` to `l` and `r` can be optimized.\nThe total distance traveled by the cursor will be `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + abs(l - r)`.\nThis is because the cursor first moves from `pos` to either `l` or `r`, and then traverses the remaining segment `[l, r]` to reach the other end.\nFor example, if `pos` is between `l` and `r`:\n    `pos -> l` (cost `pos - l`) then `l -> r` (cost `r - l`). Total `pos - l + r - l`.\n    `pos -> r` (cost `r - pos`) then `r -> l` (cost `r - l`). Total `r - pos + r - l`.\n    This is equivalent to `abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r)` or `abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l)`.\n    The sum is `abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r)` if we go `pos -> l -> r`.\n    The sum is `abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l)` if we go `pos -> r -> l`.\n    These are the total moves.\nThe number of moves will be:\n*   If `pos` is to the left of `l` (`pos < l`): The cursor must move right past `l` and then to `r`. The path will be `pos -> l -> r`. Total moves: `(l - pos) + (r - l) = r - pos`.\n*   If `pos` is to the right of `r` (`pos > r`): The cursor must move left past `r` and then to `l`. The path will be `pos -> r -> l`. Total moves: `(pos - r) + (r - l) = pos - l`.\n*   If `pos` is between `l` and `r` (`l <= pos <= r`):\n    *   Option A: Go `pos -> l`, then `l -> r`. Moves: `(pos - l) + (r - l)`.\n    *   Option B: Go `pos -> r`, then `r -> l`. Moves: `(r - pos) + (r - l)`.\n    We choose the minimum of these two.\nIn all cases, the total number of moves is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l)`.\nAfter all the moves, there are two \"close\" operations, each taking 1 second.\nTotal time = `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations into a single logic:\n\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ntime = 0\n\n# Check if left boundary needs closing\nif l > 1:\n    # We need to close tabs [1, l-1]\n    # This requires moving to 'l' and performing a 'close left' operation\n    # The cost of this operation is 1 (close) + abs(pos - l) (move)\n    # This is a potential cost component\n    pass # We'll calculate total cost based on path\n\n# Check if right boundary needs closing\nif r < n:\n    # We need to close tabs [r+1, n]\n    # This requires moving to 'r' and performing a 'close right' operation\n    # The cost of this operation is 1 (close) + abs(pos - r) (move)\n    # This is a potential cost component\n    pass # We'll calculate total cost based on path\n\n# Scenario 1: No tabs to close\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    time = 0\n# Scenario 2: Only close right side\nelif l == 1: # and r < n (implicitly)\n    time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n# Scenario 3: Only close left side\nelif r == n: # and l > 1 (implicitly)\n    time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n# Scenario 4: Close both sides\nelse: # l > 1 and r < n\n    # Cursor must visit both l and r.\n    # It starts at pos.\n    # It moves to one end (l or r), performs close op.\n    # Then moves to the other end, performs close op.\n    \n    # Cost = (moves to first end) + (moves between ends) + (2 close operations)\n    \n    # Moves to first end: min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n    # Moves between ends: r - l (since l < r)\n    # Close operations: 2\n    \n    # Total = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    \n    # Example 1: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4\n    # abs(3-2)=1, abs(3-4)=1. min(1,1)=1.\n    # (4-2)=2.\n    # 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
