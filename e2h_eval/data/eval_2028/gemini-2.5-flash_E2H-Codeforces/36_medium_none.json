The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my breakdown of this competitive programming problem and my thought process for approaching it.**  The goal is to determine the probability of a valid signal power assignment in a network of towns, modulo a prime number. The constraints are clearly defined: towns 0 and n+1 cannot receive any signal, and each of the middle towns (1 to n) must receive a signal from *exactly* one tower.  The towers are built independently, each with a 50% chance.\n\nMy first instinct is to analyze the constraints and see if I can derive any key properties.  The signal power 'p' for a tower at town 'i' must be such that it doesn't cover towns 0 or n+1, which leads me to the power limitations. We get `p <= min(i, n - i + 1)`. That's a crucial observation. Now, it's about partitioning the range [1, n] using those towers.  The *unique* signal constraint from each town is what makes the structure.\n\nThis leads me to think about segments and how the intervals covered by each tower need to \"tile\" [1, n].   The condition of a \"valid\" signal assignment boils down to partitioning [1, n] into contiguous segments. For any such segment, the midpoint is where the tower exists. The length of the covered interval is odd, and that middle must be a tower. I'm focusing on those midpoints and the required segment parity.\n\nIt seems I can formulate a dynamic programming approach. I define `dp[i]` to be the number of valid ways to partition the prefix {1, ..., i}. However, the \"no other towers are built\" constraint complicates the DP.  I realize that it's important to consider which towns have a tower built *before* checking if any partition is valid. This has to do with how the segments are chosen in the partitioning.\n\nThen, I switch gears. The problem's phrasing \"a valid way to set signal powers\" suggests that if the towers are fixed, we *must* have a partitioning of the remaining cities with those towers. I then think of checking if the set of towers *allows* such a partitioning.\nNow the DP is to count the valid configurations for building towers where valid means a partitioning exists.\n\nSo, I redefine `dp[i]` as the *number of valid configurations* of towers for the prefix [1, i] . This leads to an `O(N)` solution and I think I've cracked it. A segment means the endpoints have the same parity. And the tower must be built at the segment center. I consider the last segment and work backwards.\n\nI formulate a DP relationship, with the final answer being `dp[n] / 2^n`. The crucial part is figuring out that it's the number of *valid* configurations, divided by the total possible tower configurations. Then I optimize the DP recurrence, noting that the contribution depends on whether i is odd or even. Using sum for even and odd elements, `S_0[k]` and `S_1[k]` gives `O(N)` computation with clever precomputation of inverses modulo prime. I precompute powers and inverse powers of 2 modulo the prime. I double-check the logic and the base cases to verify correctness. Now, I have a clear path to implementing this in code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, given `n` potential tower locations (towns `1` to `n`), a valid configuration of signal powers can be chosen after towers are built. Each tower in towns `1, \\dots, n` is built with probability `1/2` independently.\n\nLet `S` be the set of towns where towers are built. The constraints are:\n1. Towns `0` and `n+1` receive no signal.\n2. Towns `1, \\dots, n` receive signal from exactly one tower each.\n\nA tower at town `i` with signal power `p` covers towns `c` such that `|c - i| < p`. This means the interval `[i - p + 1, i + p - 1]`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on `p`:\n- Town `0` receives no signal: `i - p + 1 > 0 \\implies p < i + 1 \\implies p \\le i`.\n- Town `n+1` receives no signal: `i + p - 1 < n + 1 \\implies p < n - i + 2 \\implies p \\le n - i + 1`.\nSo, for a tower at `i`, its power `p` must satisfy `1 \\le p \\le \\min(i, n - i + 1)`.\n\nThe second constraint implies that the intervals `C_j = [i_j - p_j + 1, i_j + p_j - 1]` for towers `i_j \\in S` must form a partition of the set of towns `\\{1, \\dots, n\\}`. That is, `\\bigcup_{i_j \\in S} C_j = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}` and `C_j \\cap C_k = \\emptyset` for `j \\ne k`.\n\nIf a segment `[L, R]` is covered by a single tower at `i` with power `p`, then:\n- `L = i - p + 1`\n- `R = i + p - 1`\nFrom these equations, we can derive:\n- `i = (L + R) / 2`. For `i` to be an integer (a town location), `L + R` must be even. This implies `L` and `R` must have the same parity.\n- `p = (R - L + 2) / 2`.\n\nNow let's check if this `p` always satisfies `p \\le \\min(i, n - i + 1)` for `1 \\le L \\le R \\le n`:\n1. `p \\le i \\implies (R - L + 2) / 2 \\le (L + R) / 2 \\implies R - L + 2 \\le L + R \\implies 2 \\le 2L \\implies L \\ge 1`. This is true since `L \\ge 1`.\n2. `p \\le n - i + 1 \\implies (R - L + 2) / 2 \\le n - (L + R) / 2 + 1 \\implies R - L + 2 \\le 2n - L - R + 2 \\implies 2R \\le 2n \\implies R \\le n`. This is true since `R \\le n`.\nSo, any segment `[L, R]` with `1 \\le L \\le R \\le n` and `L, R` having the same parity can be covered by a tower at `i = (L+R)/2` with power `p = (R-L+2)/2`, and this power satisfies the boundary conditions for towns `0` and `n+1`.\n\nThe problem then simplifies to finding the probability that the set of built towers `S` satisfies the following:\nThere exists a partition of `\\{1, \\dots, n\\}` into contiguous segments `[L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]` such that:\n1. For each `j = 1, \\dots, k`, `L_j` and `R_j` have the same parity.\n2. The set of towns where towers are built, `S`, is exactly `\\{ (L_j + R_j) / 2 \\mid j = 1, \\dots, k \\}`. That is, a tower must be built at the center of each segment in the partition, and no other towers can be built.\n\nThis is a dynamic programming problem. Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to choose towers in towns `1, \\dots, i` such that `\\{1, \\dots, i\\}` can be partitioned into valid segments.\nThe base case is `dp[0] = 1` (an empty prefix has one way to be partitioned, with no towers).\nFor `i > 0`, we consider the last segment in the partition, say `[j+1, i]`.\nFor `[j+1, i]` to be a valid segment:\n1. `j+1` and `i` must have the same parity. This means `j` and `i-1` must have the same parity.\n2. A tower must be built at `m = ((j+1) + i) / 2`.\n3. No towers must be built at any other town `x` such that `j+1 \\le x \\le i` and `x \\ne m`.\nThe number of such `x` is `(i - (j+1) + 1) - 1 = i - j - 1`.\nSo, if we choose `[j+1, i]` as the last segment, the number of ways to pick towers for `\\{1, \\dots, i\\}` is `dp[j]` (for the prefix `\\{1, \\dots, j\\}`) multiplied by `1` (for `is_tower[m] = true`) multiplied by `(1/2)^{i-j-1}` (for `is_tower[x] = false` for the `i-j-1` other towns in `[j+1, i]`).\nTherefore, `dp[i] = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} dp[j] \\cdot (1/2)^{i-j-1}` where `j` and `i-1` have the same parity.\n\nThis DP can be optimized from `O(N^2)` to `O(N)` by maintaining prefix sums based on parity.\nLet `MOD = 998244353`.\n`inv2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` (modular multiplicative inverse of 2).\n\nWe need `pow2_inv[k] = (1/2)^k \\pmod{MOD}`.\n`pow2_inv[0] = 1`. `pow2_inv[k] = (pow2_inv[k-1] * inv2) % MOD`.\n\nLet `S_even[k] = \\sum_{x=0, x \\text{ even}}^k dp[x] \\cdot 2^x \\pmod{MOD}`.\nLet `S_odd[k] = \\sum_{x=0, x \\text{ odd}}^k dp[x] \\cdot 2^x \\pmod{MOD}`.\n\nFor `i = 1, \\dots, n`:\n- If `i` is odd: `i-1` is even. The sum is over `j` where `j` is even.\n  `dp[i] = (S_even[i-1] * pow2_inv[i-1]) % MOD`.\n- If `i` is even: `i-1` is odd. The sum is over `j` where `j` is odd.\n  `dp[i] = (S_odd[i-1] * pow2_inv[i-1]) % MOD`.\n\nUpdate `S_even` and `S_odd` for `i`:\n- If `i` is odd: `S_even[i] = S_even[i-1]`. `S_odd[i] = (S_odd[i-1] + dp[i] \\cdot 2^i) % MOD`.\n- If `i` is even: `S_even[i] = (S_even[i-1] + dp[i] \\cdot 2^i) % MOD`. `S_odd[i] = S_odd[i-1]`.\n\nThe initial values:\n`dp[0] = 1`.\n`S_even[0] = dp[0] \\cdot 2^0 = 1`.\n`S_odd[0] = 0`.\n\nThe final answer is `dp[n] \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{MOD}`.\n\nExample `n=3`:\n`MOD = 998244353`, `inv2 = 499122177`.\n`pow2_inv = [1, 499122177, 249561089, 124780545, \\dots]`\n`pow2 = [1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots]`\n\n`dp[0] = 1`.\n`S_even[0] = 1`. `S_odd[0] = 0`.\n\n`i=1` (odd): `i-1=0` (even).\n`dp[1] = (S_even[0] * pow2_inv[0]) % MOD = (1 * 1) % MOD = 1`.\n`S_even[1] = S_even[0] = 1`.\n`S_odd[1] = (S_odd[0] + dp[1] * pow2[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 * 2) % MOD = 2`.\n\n`i=2` (even): `i-1=1` (odd).\n`dp[2] = (S_odd[1] * pow2_inv[1]) % MOD = (2 * 499122177) % MOD = 1`.\n`S_even[2] = (S_even[1] + dp[2] * pow2[2]) % MOD = (1 + 1 * 4) % MOD = 5`.\n`S_odd[2] = S_odd[1] = 2`.\n\n`i=3` (odd): `i-1=2` (even).\n`dp[3] = (S_even[2] * pow2_inv[2]) % MOD = (5 * 249561089) % MOD = 1247805445 % MOD = 249561089`.\nThis is `5/4`. `5 * (1/4) = 5 * 249561089 = 1247805445`.\n`1247805445 % 998244353 = 249561092`. Wait, `5/4` is not `249561089`.\n`5 * pow(4, MOD-2, MOD) = 5 * 249561089 = 1247805445`.\n`1247805445 % 998244353 = 249561092`.\nLet's recheck calculation for `dp[3]`.\n`dp[3] = (S_even[2] * pow2_inv[2]) % MOD = (5 * 249561089) % MOD = 1247805445 % MOD = 249561092`.\nThis is `5/4`. `5 * 4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = 5 * 249561089 = 1247805445 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561092`.\nThe example output for `n=3` is `748683265`. This is `5/32`.\nMy `dp[n]` is `5/4`. The final probability is `dp[n] / 2^n`.\nSo `(5/4) / 2^3 = (5/4) / 8 = 5/32`.\n`dp[3] * pow2_inv[3] = 249561092 * 124780545 % MOD = 31145115984048040 % MOD = 748683265`.\nThis matches the example.
