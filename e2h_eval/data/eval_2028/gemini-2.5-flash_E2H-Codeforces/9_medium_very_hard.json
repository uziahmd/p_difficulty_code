Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle the \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, leveraging my knowledge of dynamic programming and knapsack variations. I see this as a slightly tweaked knapsack problem, where we aim to maximize the total cost of souvenirs while staying within a weight limit.**\n\nFirst, I recognize the crucial constraint: the item weights are small (1, 2, or 3). This is a strong hint that a naive O(n*m) DP approach might be overkill. I will categorize the souvenirs based on their weights (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) and sort each group by cost in descending order. This is a common strategy when dealing with cost-maximization problems. I will maintain three lists: `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, and `costs_w3`.\n\nThe core logic revolves around iterating through the number of heaviest items (weight 3). I'll consider picking `k3` items of weight 3, where `k3` ranges from 0 to `m/3`. For each `k3`, I'll calculate the cost and remaining weight.  The trick will then be to solve the subproblem: finding the maximum cost using the remaining weight capacity with only weight 1 and weight 2 items.\n\nTo solve this subproblem (which is a knapsack variant itself), I'll define `dp2[w_rem]` as the maximum cost achievable with a remaining weight `w_rem` using only weight 1 and 2 items. I plan to precompute prefix sums for my sorted cost lists to optimize cost calculations. Then my subproblem becomes `dp2[w_rem] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(costs_w2), w_rem/2)} (prefix_sum_w2[k2] + prefix_sum_w1[min(len(costs_w1), w_rem - k2*2)])`.  However, this method of nested loop would result in O(m^2) which is too slow.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to compute this sub-problem faster! That means I need to optimize the process of picking best items for weight 1 and 2, within the remianing weight constraint. Since the weights are small, it appears a standard DP or a greedy combination may be applicable.\n\nI'll try a DP table for only weight 1 and 2 and see whether it's possible.  Define `dp[w]` as the maximum cost for total weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.  The maximum cost `dp_val` to solve the subproblem is the core part I need to resolve.\n\nThis problem looks like a 0-1 knapsack, but since we sorted the costs, we can't simply apply the 0-1 knapsack formula.  So the dynamic programming table needs to be adjusted and take care of the bounded and ordered items.\n\nI think the best approach is to precompute the `dp_val` table for the sub-problem, and use it to calculate the solution for the whole problem.\n\nThe solution requires computing the sub problem with DP with O(m) complexity.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`, such that their total weight does not exceed `m` and their total cost is maximized. The key constraints are `n <= 100000`, `m <= 300000`, and `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThis is a variation of the knapsack problem. Since `n` and `m` are large, a standard `O(n*m)` dynamic programming solution is too slow. However, the very small range of weights (`w_i in {1, 2, 3}`) is a strong hint for an optimized approach.\n\n**1. Categorize and Sort Souvenirs:**\nFirst, we categorize the souvenirs by their weights and store their costs in separate lists. To maximize cost, for each weight type, we should always pick the most expensive items first. So, we sort these lists in descending order of costs.\n- `costs_w1`: list of costs for souvenirs with `w_i = 1`, sorted descending.\n- `costs_w2`: list of costs for souvenirs with `w_i = 2`, sorted descending.\n- `costs_w3`: list of costs for souvenirs with `w_i = 3`, sorted descending.\n\n**2. Precompute Prefix Sums:**\nTo quickly get the sum of the `k` most expensive items of a certain weight type, we compute prefix sums for each sorted cost list.\n- `prefix_sum_w1[k]`: sum of the top `k` costs from `costs_w1`.\n- `prefix_sum_w2[k]`: sum of the top `k` costs from `costs_w2`.\n- `prefix_sum_w3[k]`: sum of the top `k` costs from `costs_w3`.\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` time after sorting.\n\n**3. The Core Idea - Iterating on Weight 3 Items:**\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 we can take is `m/3`. Since `m` is up to 300,000, `m/3` is up to 100,000. We can iterate through all possible counts of weight 3 items, say `k3`.\nFor each `k3` from `0` up to `min(len(costs_w3), m/3)`:\n- The weight used by these `k3` items is `k3 * 3`.\n- The cost contributed by these `k3` items is `prefix_sum_w3[k3]`.\n- The remaining capacity is `m_rem = m - k3 * 3`.\n- We then need to find the maximum cost we can achieve for `m_rem` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n\n**4. Subproblem: Max Cost with Weight 1 and 2 Items:**\nLet `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` be the maximum cost achievable for a capacity `W` using only items of weight 1 and 2. If we can precompute this array for all `W` from `0` to `m` efficiently, the overall solution would be:\n`max_total_cost = max_{0 <= k3 <= min(len(costs_w3), m/3)} (prefix_sum_w3[k3] + max_cost_w1_w2[m - k3*3])`\nThe iteration for `k3` takes `O(m)` time (since `k3` can go up to `m/3`). If `max_cost_w1_w2` is precomputed in `O(m)` or `O(m log m)`, the total complexity will be acceptable.\n\n**5. Efficiently Computing `max_cost_w1_w2[W]`:**\nThis is the trickiest part. We need to find `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` for all `W` from `0` to `m`.\n`max_cost_w1_w2[W]` is the maximum of `prefix_sum_w1[k1] + prefix_sum_w2[k2]` such that `k1*1 + k2*2 = W`.\nLet `dp[W]` be `max_cost_w1_w2[W]`.\nWe can compute `dp[W]` for `W = 0...m` in `O(m)` time.\nThe idea is to iterate `W` from `0` to `m`. For each `W`:\n- We can potentially use `k1` items of weight 1 and `k2` items of weight 2.\n- The key observation is that for a given `W`, we want to find `max_{k2} (prefix_sum_w2[k2] + prefix_sum_w1[W - 2*k2])`.\n- This can be done in `O(M)` time by using a sliding window maximum (deque) technique, but a simpler `O(M)` approach exists.\n\nLet's maintain two \"pointers\" or indices, `idx1` for `costs_w1` and `idx2` for `costs_w2`, representing the number of items of each type we've \"virtually\" taken for some capacity.\nWe can compute `dp[W]` by considering two options for the \"last\" item added to reach weight `W`:\n1. The last item was a weight 1 item: `dp[W-1] + cost_of_next_w1_item`.\n2. The last item was a weight 2 item: `dp[W-2] + cost_of_next_w2_item`.\nThis greedy choice is problematic because `cost_of_next_wX_item` depends on how many items of that type have already been taken.\n\nA correct `O(M)` approach for `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` for all `W`:\nInitialize `dp[W] = 0` for all `W`.\nLet `current_sum_w1 = 0` and `current_idx_w1 = 0`.\nLet `current_sum_w2 = 0` and `current_idx_w2 = 0`.\nFor `W` from `1` to `m`:\n  `dp[W]` is the maximum cost for weight `W`.\n  We consider adding either a weight 1 item or a weight 2 item.\n  - Option 1 (add weight 1 item): If `W >= 1` and `current_idx_w1 < len(costs_w1)`, we can potentially take the `current_idx_w1`-th weight 1 item. The cost would be `dp[W-1] + costs_w1[current_idx_w1]`.\n  - Option 2 (add weight 2 item): If `W >= 2` and `current_idx_w2 < len(costs_w2)`, we can potentially take the `current_idx_w2`-th weight 2 item. The cost would be `dp[W-2] + costs_w2[current_idx_w2]`.\n\nThis again has the issue of not knowing which `current_idx_w1` or `current_idx_w2` applies to `dp[W-1]` or `dp[W-2]`.\n\nThe correct DP for `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` is as follows:\nLet `dp[W]` store the maximum value for weight `W`.\nInitialize `dp[W] = 0` for all `W`.\nWe iterate through `W` from `1` to `m`.\nAt each `W`, we consider two ways to achieve `dp[W]`:\n1. Use only weight 1 items: `prefix_sum_w1[min(W, len(costs_w1))]`.\n2. Use some weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n   The crucial insight is that if we decide to use `k2` items of weight 2, then we must use `min(len(costs_w1), W - 2*k2)` items of weight 1.\n   So `dp[W] = max_{0 <= k2 <= W/2} (prefix_sum_w2[k2] + prefix_sum_w1[min(len(costs_w1), W - 2*k2)])`.\nThis still looks like `O(M^2)`.\n\nHowever, we can compute `dp[W]` for all `W` in `O(M)` using a different perspective:\nInitialize `dp[W] = prefix_sum_w1[min(W, len(costs_w1))]` for all `W` from `0` to `m`. (This accounts for all weight 1 items.)\nNow, we iterate through the weight 2 items.\nFor `k2` from `1` to `len(costs_w2)`:\n  Let `c2 = costs_w2[k2-1]`.\n  For `W` from `m` down to `2`:\n    `dp[W] = max(dp[W], dp[W-2] + c2)`\nThis is the standard 0-1 knapsack DP for a single item type. But here, we are doing it for *all* items of weight 2. This would be `O(M * len(costs_w2))`, which is `O(M*N)`, too slow.\n\nThe actual `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` for all `W`:\nLet `dp[W]` be the maximum cost for capacity `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp[W] = 0` for all `W`.\n`idx1 = 0` (index for `costs_w1`)\n`idx2 = 0` (index for `costs_w2`)\n`current_cost = 0`\nFor `W` from `1` to `m`:\n  `option1_cost = -1` (cost if we only add weight 1 items)\n  `option2_cost = -1` (cost if we only add weight 2 items)\n\n  If `idx1 < len(costs_w1)` and `W >= 1`:\n    `option1_cost = current_cost + costs_w1[idx1]`\n  \n  If `idx2 < len(costs_w2)` and `W >= 2`:\n    `option2_cost = current_cost + costs_w2[idx2]`\n\n  This approach is also flawed. The `current_cost` must be associated with the state `dp[W-1]` or `dp[W-2]`, not a global `current_cost`.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` DP for `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` is based on the idea that we are building up the optimal solution for `W` by adding either a weight-1 item or a weight-2 item.\n`dp[W]` will store the maximum cost for weight `W`.\n`dp_w1_count[W]` will store the number of weight-1 items used to achieve `dp[W]`.\n`dp_w2_count[W]` will store the number of weight-2 items used to achieve `dp[W]`.\n\nInitialize `dp[0] = 0`, `dp_w1_count[0] = 0`, `dp_w2_count[0] = 0`.\nFor `W` from `1` to `m`:\n  `take_w1_cost = -1`, `take_w2_cost = -1`\n  \n  // Option 1: Add a weight 1 item to the solution for W-1\n  if `W >= 1` and `dp_w1_count[W-1] < len(costs_w1)`:\n    `take_w1_cost = dp[W-1] + costs_w1[dp_w1_count[W-1]]`\n  \n  // Option 2: Add a weight 2 item to the solution for W-2\n  if `W >= 2` and `dp_w2_count[W-2] < len(costs_w2)`:\n    `take_w2_cost = dp[W-2] + costs_w2[dp_w2_count[W-2]]`\n\n  if `take_w1_cost >= take_w2_cost`:\n    `dp[W] = take_w1_cost`\n    `dp_w1_count[W] = dp_w1_count[W-1] + 1`\n    `dp_w2_count[W] = dp_w2_count[W-1]`\n  else:\n    `dp[W] = take_w2_cost`\n    `dp_w1_count[W] = dp_w1_count[W-2]`\n    `dp_w2_count[W] = dp_w2_count[W-2] + 1`\n\nThis `O(M)` DP correctly computes `max_cost_w1_w2[W]` for all `W`. This is because at each step `W`, we are greedily choosing the option that gives the maximum cost using the *next available* best item of weight 1 or 2. This greedy choice is optimal due to the sorted costs and the nature of the weights (1 and 2).\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`, `m`.\n2. Create `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, `costs_w3` lists.\n3.
