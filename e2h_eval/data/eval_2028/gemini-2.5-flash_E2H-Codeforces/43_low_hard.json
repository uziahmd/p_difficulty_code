He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the String Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about how to validate this string `S`.  Essentially, I need a Python script to check if `S` adheres to a very specific structure. Let's see...\n\nFirst, it's pretty clear that `S` is built in three distinct steps, which translates into three distinct segments within the string. I'll need to recognize these segments.\n\n*   **Segment A:** This kicks things off with a sequence of 'a's. Crucially, there has to be *at least* one 'a' (let's call the count `count_a`).\n\n*   **Segment B:** Following the 'a's, there's a run of 'b's. This is the second segment, and again, we're guaranteed to have *at least* one 'b' (`count_b`).\n\n*   **Segment C:** Finally, we have the 'c's. This is the third and final segment. Now, here's where it gets interesting: the number of 'c's (`count_c`) has a *relationship* with the other counts. Specifically, it has to be equal to either `count_a` or `count_b`, or possibly both.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm dealing with a string that *must* have the structure: `a...a b...b c...c`, with those specific count constraints.\n\nNow, how do I go about actually *checking* this? I need to analyze the string's structure. It's got to follow this strict ordering: 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. No exceptions. Each segment must be consecutive. No interlacing.  Also, minimum lengths for each segment, that's crucial. I need to ensure there's at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' present.\n\nOne way to approach this in a script would be to iterate through the string, keeping track of my *state* as I go, expecting 'a', then transitioning to expecting 'b's, then expecting 'c's. If I encounter an unexpected character at any point, I know it's invalid. That could work.\n\nBut, I think a more robust approach could be to use indices to divide the string up into its three segments. Find the points where the segments *begin* and *end*:\n\n1.  Find the first position `i` where a non-'a' character appears.  That defines the end of segment A.\n2.  Then, starting from `i`, find the first position `j` where a non-'b' character appears.  That defines the end of segment B.\n3.  The remainder of the string from `j` to the end should be all 'c's.\n\nOnce I have those indices, I can do some simple checks.\n\n*   `S[0 ... i-1]` must be all 'a's.\n*   `S[i ... j-1]` must be all 'b's.\n*   `S[j ...]` (up to the end of the string) must be all 'c's.\n\nAnd then, I just need to verify that `count_c` (length of the 'c' segment) is equal to either `count_a` (length of the 'a' segment) or `count_b` (length of the 'b' segment), or both. If all those conditions are met, the string is valid! That should cover it.\n",
