Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to find the smallest radius (d) needed for lanterns to light up an entire street of length 'l'.**\n\n**The Core Idea:**\n\n*   I'll start by sorting the lantern positions (`a_i`). This makes it way easier to spot those tricky unlit gaps between lanterns.\n*   A lantern positioned at `a_i` can light a segment of the street, `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n*   The entire street, from 0 to 'l', needs to be covered.\n\n**Key Requirements for \"d\":**\n\n1.  **Left Edge (0):** The first lantern (after sorting) needs to reach all the way to 0. So, `d >= a_0` is the starting point.\n2.  **Right Edge (l):** The last lantern needs to illuminate all the way to 'l'. This means `d >= l - a_{n-1}` is a must.\n3.  **Gaps Between Lanterns:**  Here's where it gets interesting. I need to make sure the lanterns between each other have enough overlap.  Consider two consecutive lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. To cover the section between them, the radius must be big enough so that `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`.  This simplifies to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I'll need to find the *largest* gap and ensure the radius covers half that distance.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\n*   `d_left = a_0` (distance from the beginning of the street to the first lantern)\n*   `d_right = l - a_{n-1}` (distance from the last lantern to the end of the street)\n*   `d_gap = max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2)` for all gaps between lanterns.\n\nThe smallest radius I'm looking for is the biggest value among these three:  `d = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)`.\n\n**Steps in the Python Script:**\n\n1.  Read 'n' (number of lanterns) and 'l' (street length).\n2.  Read the lantern positions (`a_i`) and sort them.\n3.  Calculate `d_left`.\n4.  Calculate `d_right`.\n5.  Find `d_gap` by iterating through the sorted positions and calculating the half-gap between each pair.\n6.  Finally, find the maximum of `d_left`, `d_right`, and `d_gap`. This is the answer!\n7.  Print the result with sufficient precision (at least 10 decimal places to satisfy the output).\n\n**Edge Cases to Consider:**\n\n*   If there's only one lantern, I need to make sure the code works. It does.\n*   If all the lanterns are at the same point, I should ensure the code works. It does.\n\n**Data Types and Precision:**\n\n*   I'll be careful to use `float` when calculating `d` to avoid any integer division issues.\n*   Using f-strings, I will format the output to the required precision.\n\nI'm confident this logic will efficiently solve the problem and cover all the necessary cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns can light up an entire street of length `l`, from coordinate `0` to `l`. Each lantern is located at a point `a_i` and lights all points within distance `d` from it.\n\nTo solve this, we need to consider three types of \"unlit\" areas that must be covered:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street:** The point `0` must be lit. This means the first lantern (after sorting the lantern positions) must cover `0`. If the first lantern is at `a_0`, then `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`. The minimum `d` required to cover the start is `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street:** The point `l` must be lit. This means the last lantern must cover `l`. If the last lantern is at `a_{n-1}`, then `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. The minimum `d` required to cover the end is `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** Consider any two adjacent lanterns in sorted order, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. The segment between them `(a_i, a_{i+1})` must be fully lit. The lantern at `a_i` covers up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` covers from `a_{i+1} - d`. For the entire segment to be lit, their coverage must meet or overlap: `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum value of `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` among all adjacent pairs to ensure the largest gap is covered.\n\nThe minimum light radius `d` required to light the entire street is the maximum of these three requirements.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `l`.\n2.  Read the `n` lantern positions `a_i`.\n3.  Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n4.  Calculate `d_start = a[0]`. This is the distance from `0` to the first lantern.\n5.  Calculate `d_end = l - a[n-1]`. This is the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n6.  Initialize `max_gap_half = 0.0`.\n7.  Iterate through the sorted lantern positions from `i = 0` to `n-2`:\n    *   Calculate the gap between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` as `current_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]`.\n    *   Update `max_gap_half = max(max_gap_half, current_gap / 2.0)`.\n8.  The final minimum radius `d` is `max(d_start, d_end, max_gap_half)`.\n9.  Print `d` formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n = 2, l = 5`\nLanterns at `[2, 5]`\n\n1.  Sorted positions `a = [2, 5]`.\n2.  `d_start = a[0] = 2`.\n3.  `d_end = l - a[n-1] = 5 - 5 = 0`.\n4.  `max_gap_half`:\n    *   For `i = 0`: `current_gap = a[1] - a[0] = 5 - 2 = 3`.\n    *   `max_gap_half = max(0.0, 3 / 2.0) = 1.5`.\n5.  `min_d = max(2.0, 0.0, 1.5) = 2.0`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles edge cases like a single lantern, all lanterns at the same point, or lanterns at the ends of the street. The use of floating-point numbers ensures precision for the division by 2.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Calculate the maximum radius needed for the ends of the street\n    # 1.
