They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Playoff\" Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Playoff\" problem, which seems like a fun one.  The goal is to find which team skills *could* win a tournament given some outcome rules.  Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, it's a standard single-elimination bracket with $2^n$ teams. Each phase has a set of games, halving the teams each time, until we have a single winner.  We're given a string 's' of length 'n' that dictates whether lower or higher skilled teams win in each round.  A '0' in 's' means the lower skilled team wins, and a '1' means the higher skilled team wins. We need to figure out which team skills *can* win for *some* possible arrangement (permutation) of team skills.\n\nThinking about the tournament structure, if a team with skill $X$ is going to win, it *has* to win $n$ games. In each of these games, it's playing against another team, and the outcome depends on the current phase (governed by the string 's') and the skills involved.\n\nLet's trace this logically.  Suppose I want a team with skill $X$ to be the champion.\n\n*   If in phase $i$, $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins), then to win, the opponent *must* have a skill *greater* than $X$ so it can beat them. This would mean that $Y > X$\n*   Conversely, if $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), the opponent has to have a skill *less* than $X$ for $X$ to win. Thus $Y < X$.\n\nNow, let's explore this.  Consider the most extreme case where the string 's' is all '1's. This means that *every* phase the *higher* skilled team wins. In that situation, for a team to win, it means its skill must *always* be the highest among the two playing teams.  This suggests that the team with the *highest* skill, which is $2^n$, *always* can win. If team $2^n$ is the champion, that means every team it went against during its entire tournament run had lower skill.\n\nBut what about other skills?  Can a skill like $2^n - 1$ win?  Yes, in this same 's' all '1' scenario, as long as it gets paired against $2^n$ in the finals.  This allows it to have won previous rounds, and then it is a viable outcome!  It's just that the specific teams are chosen such that team $2^n$ doesn't have a high enough skill to win the previous games.  This pattern continues as the skill is reduced. It makes sense that, under this configuration, if $s$ contains *only* '1's, then the lowest skill level of a winner would be $1$.\n\nSo, how do I generalize this? It looks like I need a way to determine, based on the string 's', a range of skills that *could* win. The 's' string dictates which team is allowed to win at which stages.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) that can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ of length $n$. The string $s$ dictates the outcome of games in each of the $n$ phases: if $s_i = '0'$, the lower-skilled team wins in phase $i$; if $s_i = '1'$, the higher-skilled team wins in phase $i$.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament. A team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\n\nConsider the implications of $s_i$ on the skill of the winning team.\n- If $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins), then in any game in phase $i$, the winning team must have a skill lower than its opponent. This means the winning team must be able to find an opponent with a higher skill.\n- If $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), then in any game in phase $i$, the winning team must have a skill higher than its opponent. This means the winning team must be able to find an opponent with a lower skill.\n\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$, and $c_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe total number of games a team must win is $n = c_0 + c_1$.\n\nFor a team with skill $X$ to win, it must win $c_0$ games by having lower skill and $c_1$ games by having higher skill.\n\nLet's consider the opponents required for skill $X$ to win.\nTo win a game where lower skill wins ($s_i = '0'$), $X$ must play against an opponent $Y$ such that $Y > X$.\nTo win a game where higher skill wins ($s_i = '1'$), $X$ must play against an opponent $Y$ such that $Y < X$.\n\nIn total, $X$ needs to defeat $c_0$ opponents with skill greater than $X$ and $c_1$ opponents with skill less than $X$.\nThe skills of all other $2^n - 1$ teams are available to be assigned. We need to find *if it's possible* to arrange a permutation $p$ such that $X$ wins.\n\nThe crucial insight is to determine the range of skills that $X$ must be able to defeat.\n- For $X$ to defeat $c_0$ opponents with skill greater than $X$: The minimum number of skills greater than $X$ that $X$ needs to be able to \"take out\" is $c_0$. These $c_0$ opponents must be assigned skills $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+c_0$ (or any $c_0$ skills greater than $X$).\n- For $X$ to defeat $c_1$ opponents with skill less than $X$: The minimum number of skills less than $X$ that $X$ needs to be able to \"take out\" is $c_1$. These $c_1$ opponents must be assigned skills $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-c_1$ (or any $c_1$ skills less than $X$).\n\nConsider the skills that $X$ *cannot* be.\n- If $X$ is too small: If $X \\le c_1$, then there are at most $X-1$ skills less than $X$. It's impossible for $X$ to defeat $c_1$ opponents with skills less than $X$. So, $X$ must be at least $c_1 + 1$.\n- If $X$ is too large: If $X > 2^n - c_0$, then there are fewer than $c_0$ skills greater than $X$ (specifically, $2^n - X$ skills). It's impossible for $X$ to defeat $c_0$ opponents with skills greater than $X$. So, $X$ must be at most $2^n - c_0$.\n\nCombining these, a necessary condition for $X$ to be a winning skill is $c_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nIs this condition also sufficient? Yes.\nIf $c_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$, we can construct a permutation $p$ where $X$ wins.\nWe need to assign skills to $2^n$ teams. Let's place the team with skill $X$ at an arbitrary position in the bracket.\nThe $c_1$ opponents that $X$ needs to defeat by being higher skill can be assigned skills $1, 2, \\dots, c_1$.\nThe $c_0$ opponents that $X$ needs to defeat by being lower skill can be assigned skills $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1$.\nThe remaining $2^n - 1 - c_0 - c_1$ skills (excluding $X$) can be assigned to the remaining teams in any way that does not interfere with $X$'s path to victory. For example, we can assign them such that $X$'s opponents in each game are precisely those we need.\n\nFor example, to ensure $X$ wins, we can construct the bracket such that:\n1. $X$ is in a specific slot.\n2. For each of the $c_1$ games where $X$ needs to win as higher skill, we assign one of the skills $\\{1, \\dots, c_1\\}$ to $X$'s opponent in that game.\n3. For each of the $c_0$ games where $X$ needs to win as lower skill, we assign one of the skills $\\{2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1\\}$ to $X$'s opponent in that game.\nSince $X \\ge c_1+1$, $X$ is greater than all skills $\\{1, \\dots, c_1\\}$.\nSince $X \\le 2^n-c_0$, $X$ is less than all skills $\\{2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1\\}$.\nThe skills $\\{1, \\dots, c_1\\}$, $X$, and $\\{2^n-c_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$ are all distinct because $c_1 < X < 2^n-c_0+1$.\nAll these $c_1 + 1 + c_0$ skills are distinct and within the range $[1, 2^n]$. The remaining $2^n - (c_1+1+c_0)$ skills can be assigned to the remaining $2^n - (c_1+1+c_0)$ teams in the tournament bracket such that they don't block $X$'s path. For instance, we can make sure that $X$ meets its designated opponents in the correct phases, and other games resolve such that those opponents reach $X$. This is always possible in a single-elimination bracket.\n\nThus, the winning integers $X$ are precisely those in the range $[c_1 + 1, 2^n - c_0]$.\n\nLet's calculate $c_0$ and $c_1$ from the input string $s$.\n$c_0 = s.count('0')$\n$c_1 = s.count('1')$\n\nThe winning integers are $X$ such that $c_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nExample 1: $n=3$, $s=\"101\"$\n$c_0 = 1$ (for '0')\n$c_1 = 2$ (for '1's)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$\nWinning range: $[c_1 + 1, 2^n - c_0] = [2 + 1, 8 - 1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe problem statement output is '4 5 6 7'. Let's recheck.\n\nMy interpretation of $s_i$ for phase $i$:\nPhase 1: $2^{n-1}$ games.\nPhase 2: $2^{n-2}$ games.\n...\nPhase $n$: $2^{n-n}=1$ game (final).\n\nThe problem says: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\". This means $s_1$ corresponds to phase 1, $s_2$ to phase 2, ..., $s_n$ to phase $n$.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_1 = '1'$: Higher skill wins in phase 1 (4 games).\n$s_2 = '0'$: Lower skill wins in phase 2 (2 games).\n$s_3 = '1'$: Higher skill wins in phase 3 (1 game, the final).\n\nThis means the winning team $X$ must win:\n- 2 games by having higher skill (from $s_1$ and $s_3$). So $c_1 = 2$.\n- 1 game by having lower skill (from $s_2$). So $c_0 = 1$.\n\nThe derivation $c_1+1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$ still holds based on this interpretation.\nSo for $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$c_0 = 1$\n$c_1 = 2$\n$2^n = 8$\nWinning integers: $[2+1, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nOutput: `3 4 5 6 7`.\nThe example output is `4 5 6 7`. There is a discrepancy.\n\nLet's consider the problem statement carefully again: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games)\".\nThis implies $s_1$ is for phase 1, $s_2$ for phase 2, ..., $s_n$ for phase $n$.\n\nCould it be that the indices are reversed? i.e., $s_1$ is for the final, $s_n$ for the first phase?\n\"The string $s$ which consists of $n$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows: if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;\"\n\nIf $s_i$ refers to phase $i$, then $s_1$ refers to the phase with $2^{n-1}$ games, $s_2$ to $2^{n-2}$ games, ..., $s_n$ to $2^{n-n}=1$ game. This is what I assumed.\n\nWhat if $s_i$ refers to the $i$-th *character* of $s$, and the phases are indexed differently?\nLet's try the other common competitive programming convention: $s_0$ is the first character, $s_{n-1}$ is the last.\nIf $s_k$ is the $k$-th character (0-indexed), then it refers to the phase with $2^{n-(k+1)}$ games.\nThis is equivalent to my initial interpretation.\n\nLet's look at the example output `4 5 6 7` for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nThis corresponds to a range $[4, 7]$.\n$c_1+1 = 4$ means $c_1=3$.\n$2^n-c_0 = 7$ means $c_0=1$.\nThis would imply $s$ has three '1's and one '0'. But $s$ has length $n=3$.\nThis interpretation does not fit.\n\nWhat if $s_i$ in the problem description refers to the $i$-th *character* of $s$ (1-indexed), but the actual phases are $0$-indexed for $s$?\ne.g. $s_1$ is for phase $n$, $s_2$ for phase $n-1$, ..., $s_n$ for phase $1$?\nThis means $s_1$ is for the final game ($2^{n-n}=1$ game), $s_n$ for the first phase ($2^{n-1}$ games).\nLet's try this:\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_1 = '1'$ (character 1) applies to phase $n=3$ (final game).\n$s_2 = '0'$ (character 2) applies to phase $n-1=2$ (semifinals).\n$s_3 = '1'$ (character 3) applies to phase $n-2=1$ (first round).\n\nUnder this interpretation:\n$c_0 = 1$ (from $s_2='0'$). This is for phase 2.\n$c_1 = 2$ (from $s_1='1'$ and $s_3='1'$). These are for phase 3 (final) and phase 1 (first round).\n\nSo the counts $c_0$ and $c_1$ are the same, just associated with different phases.\nThe logic for $c_1+1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$ should still hold, because it's about the *total number* of high-skill wins and low-skill wins required, not which specific phase they occur in.\nThis still gives $[3, 7]$.\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding of what $c_0$ and $c_1$ represent in relation to the problem's example output.\nLet's consider the number of teams that $X$ needs to be \"better\" than and \"worse\" than.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be better than its opponent. This means $X$ must be greater than at least one skill value.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be worse than its opponent. This means $X$ must be less than at least one skill value.\n\nThe range of skills $X$ can take is $[1, 2^n]$.\nThe smallest skill $X$ can be is $1$. The largest is $2^n$.\nIf $X=1$, it can only win if $s_i = '0'$ for all $n$ phases. In this case, $c_0=n, c_1=0$. The range is $[0+1, 2^n-n] = [1, 2^n-n]$.\nIf $X=2^n$, it can only win if $s_i = '1'$ for all $n$ phases. In this case, $c_0=0, c_1=n$. The range is $[n+1, 2^n-0] = [n+1, 2^n]$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the counts based on the example.\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$. Output: `4 5 6 7`.\nThis range is $[4, 7]$.\nThe number of elements in the range is $7 - 4 + 1 = 4$.\n$2^n = 8$.\nThe minimum winning value is $4$. The maximum winning value is $7$.\n\nConsider the total number of games: $n$.\nTotal number of teams $2^n$.\nNumber of '1's in $s$: $k_1$. Number of '0's in $s$: $k_0$. $k_1+k_0 = n$.\nA team with skill $X$ must win $k_1$ games by being higher skilled, and $k_0$ games by being lower skilled.\nTo win $k_1$ games by being higher skilled, $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ opponents. The smallest $X$ can be to achieve this is $k_1+1$. (It needs to be greater than $k_1$ distinct values, e.g., $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$).\nTo win $k_0$ games by being lower skilled, $X$ must be smaller than $k_0$ opponents. The largest $X$ can be to achieve this is $2^n-k_0$. (It needs to be smaller than $k_0$ distinct values, e.g., $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$).\n\nSo, the range $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$ seems correct.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $k_1 = 2, k_0 = 1$.\nRange: $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output `4 5 6 7` is missing `3`. Why?\n\nLet's try to make skill 3 win for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_1='1'$ (higher wins), $s_2='0'$ (lower wins), $s_3='1'$ (higher wins).\nTeam with skill 3 needs to win 2 games as higher skill, 1 game as lower skill.\nPossible opponents for skill 3:\n- Higher skill wins: Opponent must be 1 or 2.\n- Lower skill wins: Opponent must be $4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\n\nConsider the maximum skill that can win. This is $2^n - k_0$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $k_0=1$. Max skill is $8-1=7$.\nConsider the minimum skill that can win. This is $k_1+1$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $k_1=2$. Min skill is $2+1=3$.\n\nThe range $[3, 7]$ seems robust. What if the example output is wrong, or I'm missing a subtle detail?\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement for any other constraints.\n\"The skill level of the $i$-th team is $p_i$, where $p$ is a permutation of integers $1, 2, \\dots, 2^n$.\" - Standard.\n\"Find all winning integers $x$.\" - Standard.\n\nCould it be related to the number of *initial teams* that are available for a given skill $X$?\nA team with skill $X$ must be one of the $2^n$ initial teams.\nThe $k_0$ opponents with skill $>X$ and $k_1$ opponents with skill $<X$ must also be distinct initial teams.\nThis means $1 + k_0 + k_1 = 1+n$ distinct teams are involved in $X$'s path to victory.\nAll these $1+n$ skills must be available.\n\nThe skills available are $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nTo defeat $k_1$ opponents with smaller skill, $X$ needs $k_1$ skills from $\\{1, \\dots, X-1\\}$.\nSo $X-1 \\ge k_1 \\implies X \\ge k_1+1$.\nTo defeat $k_0$ opponents with larger skill, $X$ needs $k_0$ skills from $\\{X+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nSo $2^n - X \\ge k_0 \\implies X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nThis logic is sound and yields $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nThe only way this could be different is if the specific *ordering* of '0's and '1's in $s$ matters, not just their counts.\nMy current logic implies that the order does not matter, only the counts $k_0$ and $k_1$.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that can reach a certain phase.\nIn phase 1, $2^{n-1}$ teams win.\nIn phase 2, $2^{n-2}$ teams win.\n...\nIn phase $n$, 1 team wins.\n\nConsider the $i$-th character $s_i$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, lower skill wins.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, higher skill wins.\n\nConsider the example $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$2^1=2$ teams. One game.\n$s_1='1'$, higher skill wins.\n$k_0=0, k_1=1$.\nRange: $[1+1, 2^1-0] = [2, 2]$. Only skill 2 can win.\nExample output: `2`. This matches my logic.\n\nConsider the example $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$2^2=4$ teams.\n$s_1='0'$ (phase 1, lower wins), $s_2='1'$ (phase 2/final, higher wins).\n$k_0=1, k_1=1$.\nRange: $[1+1, 2^2-1] = [2, 3]$. Skills 2 and 3 can win.\nExample output: `2 3`. This matches my logic.\n\nMy logic matches the two smaller examples, but not the first one ($n=3, s=\"101\"$).\nThis suggests that the order of '0's and '1's *does* matter, or the interpretation of $s_i$ is different.\n\nLet's re-read the $s_i$ part very carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;\"\nThis is a 1-indexed $i$ for $s$ and for phase number. Phase $i$ has $2^{n-i}$ games.\nPhase 1: $2^{n-1}$ games. Corresponds to $s_1$.\nPhase 2: $2^{n-2}$ games. Corresponds to $s_2$.\n...\nPhase $n$: $2^{n-n}=1$ game. Corresponds to $s_n$.\n\nThis is the most natural interpretation and the one I've been using.\n\nLet's rethink the properties of skill values.\nA team with skill $X$ needs to win $n$ games.\nLet's consider the minimum skill that can win.\nTo win, $X$ must beat $k_1$ opponents with skill $<X$.\nAnd $k_0$ opponents with skill $>X$.\n\nConsider the string $s$ as a sequence of game types.\nIf $s = s_1 s_2 \\dots s_n$.\nThe number of games $X$ wins where $X$ is higher skill is $k_1$.\nThe number of games $X$ wins where $X$ is lower skill is $k_0$.\n\nLet's consider the *maximum number of teams that $X$ could potentially beat if $X$ were the smallest skill available in its group*.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ beats a higher skill.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ beats a lower skill.\n\nConsider the positions in the bracket. A team plays $n$ games.\nIn the first game, it plays one opponent.\nIn the second game, it plays one opponent.\n...\nIn the $n$-th game (final), it plays one opponent.\n\nLet's think about the range of skills that can reach the final.\nIf all games are higher skill wins ($s = \"11\\dots1\"$), then only the highest skill $2^n$ can win.\nMy formula: $k_0=0, k_1=n$. Range $[n+1, 2^n]$. This is wrong.\nIf $s=\"11\\dots1\"$, then $2^n$ wins. My range is $[n+1, 2^n]$.\nFor $n=1, s=\"1\"$, my range is $[1+1, 2^1] = [2,2]$. Correct.\nFor $n=2, s=\"11\"$, $k_0=0, k_1=2$. My range is $[2+1, 2^2] = [3,4]$.\nIf $s=\"11\"$, $2^n=4$.\nPhase 1: higher wins.\nPhase 2: higher wins.\nTeam 4 will win. Team 3 could win if 4 is eliminated early. But 4 will win all its games.\nSo only team 4 can win if $s=\"11\"$.\nMy formula gives $[3,4]$. This is incorrect.\n\nThe problem is more subtle than just counts $k_0, k_1$. The *order* of '0's and '1's matters.\n\nLet's analyze the number of \"slots\" for high skill values and low skill values.\nA game involves two teams. One wins, one loses.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins. This means the winning team $W$ must have skill $S_W$ and the losing team $L$ must have skill $S_L$ such that $S_W > S_L$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins. This means $S_W < S_L$.\n\nConsider the final game (phase $n$). $s_n$ determines its outcome.\nIf $s_n = '1'$, the champion must have higher skill than its final opponent.\nIf $s_n = '0'$, the champion must have lower skill than its final opponent.\n\nLet's count the number of '1's from the *end* of the string $s$.\nLet $cnt1\\_suffix$ be the number of consecutive '1's at the end of $s$. E.g., for $s=\"101\"$, $cnt1\\_suffix=1$. For $s=\"111\"$, $cnt1\\_suffix=3$. For $s=\"011\"$, $cnt1\\_suffix=2$.\nIf $s_n = '1'$, $s_{n-1} = '1'$, ..., $s_{n-cnt1\\_suffix+1} = '1'$.\nThis means that in the last $cnt1\\_suffix$ phases, the higher skill always wins.\nThis implies that the champion must be higher skilled than its opponent in the final, and its opponent must be higher skilled than *its* opponent in the semi-final (if $cnt1\\_suffix \\ge 2$), and so on.\nThis chain of \"higher skill wins\" means that the champion must be the highest skilled among $2^{cnt1\\_suffix}$ teams that reach the phase $n-cnt1\\_suffix+1$.\nThe highest skill that can win must be at least $2^{cnt1\\_suffix}$.\nIf $cnt1\\_suffix = 0$ (i.e., $s_n = '0'$), then the champion must be lower skilled than its final opponent.\n\nLet's use $k$ for the count of '1's in $s$.\nLet's use $m$ for the count of '0's in $s$.\n$k+m=n$.\n\nConsider the minimum possible winning skill $X_{min}$.\nTo win, $X$ must defeat $k$ opponents with skill $<X$.\nAnd $m$ opponents with skill $>X$.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of lower-skilled opponents $X$ can beat.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ beats a skill $Y < X$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ beats a skill $Y > X$.\n\nConsider the number of '1's in $s$. Let this be $k$.\nA team with skill $X$ must win $k$ games by being higher skilled.\nThis means $X$ must be greater than $k$ other skills. The smallest $X$ can be for this is $k+1$.\n\nConsider the number of '0's in $s$. Let this be $m$.\nA team with skill $X$ must win $m$ games by being lower skilled.\nThis means $X$ must be smaller than $m$ other skills. The largest $X$ can be for this is $2^n-m$.\n\nThis is the previous logic, which failed for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nThe example `4 5 6 7` for $n=3, s=\"101\"` suggests $X_{min}=4, X_{max}=7$.\n$k=2, m=1$. My logic: $X_{min}=2+1=3, X_{max}=2^3-1=7$.\nThe $X_{max}$ matches. $X_{min}$ does not.\n\nWhat if the number of '1's is taken from the *prefix* of the string, or some other part?\nThe phase number $i$ is from $1$ to $n$.\nPhase $1$ has $2^{n-1}$ games. Phase $n$ has $1$ game.\nThe string $s$ has length $n$. $s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}$ (0-indexed).\n$s_0$ corresponds to phase 1. $s_{n-1}$ corresponds to phase $n$.\n\nLet $s = s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}$.\nLet $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $k_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\n\nThe total number of games where the winner has higher skill is $k_1$.\nThe total number of games where the winner has lower skill is $k_0$.\n\nLet's consider the effect of $s_i = '1'$. $X$ beats $Y$ where $Y<X$.\nLet's consider the effect of $s_i = '0'$. $X$ beats $Y$ where $Y>X$.\n\nThe key must be the *number of teams* that $X$ needs to be strictly greater than, or strictly less than, among its *potential opponents*.\nA team $X$ wins $n$ games.\nThe number of teams $X$ directly eliminates is $n$.\nThe total number of teams $X$ is compared against is $n$.\n\nLet's consider the minimum skill $X_{min}$ that can win.\nTo win, $X_{min}$ must be greater than $k_1$ opponents. So $X_{min} \\ge k_1 + 1$.\nThis is always true.\nBut what if $X_{min}$ is so small that it might get eliminated by a lower skill in a '0' phase?\nNo, because we can arrange the permutation $p$ such that $X_{min}$ only meets higher skills when $s_i='0'$ and lower skills when $s_i='1'$.\n\nLet's try to find the minimum winning skill.\nA team with skill $X$ needs to win $k_1$ games where it has higher skill, and $k_0$ games where it has lower skill.\nTo win the $k_1$ games where it has higher skill, $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct skills. The smallest $X$ can be for this is $k_1+1$. This is because $X$ needs $k_1$ distinct values from $\\{1, \\ldots, X-1\\}$.\nTo win the $k_0$ games where it has lower skill, $X$ must be less than $k_0$ distinct skills. The largest $X$ can be for this is $2^n-k_0$. This is because $X$ needs $k_0$ distinct values from $\\{X+1, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$.\n\nThe crucial part is that the $k_1$ opponents $X$ beats by being higher skill, and the $k_0$ opponents $X$ beats by being lower skill, must be *distinct* from each other and distinct from $X$.\nSo we need $k_1$ values $<X$, $X$ itself, and $k_0$ values $>X$.\nThis means we need $k_1 + 1 + k_0 = n+1$ distinct values.\nThese $n+1$ values must all be available in the range $[1, 2^n]$.\nThe smallest set of these values would be $\\{1, \\dots, k_1, X, 2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nFor these to be valid, we need $k_1 < X$ and $X < 2^n-k_0+1$.\nSo $X \\ge k_1+1$ and $X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\nThis is the same logic.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the tournament again.\nThe string $s$ has length $n$.\n$s_0$ refers to the first phase (round of $2^{n-1}$), $s_{n-1}$ refers to the final (round of $1$).\n\nWhat if the number of '1's in $s$ is $c_1$ and '0's is $c_0$.\nThe problem can be rephrased as: what is the minimum skill $X_{min}$ and maximum skill $X_{max}$ that can win?\n$X_{min}$: To win, $X$ needs to defeat $c_1$ smaller skills and $c_0$ larger skills.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $1$.\nIf $X=1$, it can only defeat larger skills. So $c_1$ must be $0$. If $c_1=0$, then $X=1$ can win if $2^n-c_0 \\ge 1$.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $2^{c_1 \\text{ from first phases}}$.\nNo, this doesn't feel right.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that can reach a certain stage.\nThe number of teams that can possibly win depends on how many '0's and '1's are in $s$.\nIf $s = \"00\\dots0\"$, then the lowest skill can win. $1$.\nMy formula: $k_0=n, k_1=0$. Range $[0+1, 2^n-n] = [1, 2^n-n]$.\nFor $n=1, s=\"0\"$: $k_0=1, k_1=0$. Range $[1, 2^1-1] = [1,1]$. Output `1`.\nFor $n=2, s=\"00\"$: $k_0=2, k_1=0$. Range $[1, 2^2-2] = [1,2]$. Output `1 2`.\nThis means for $s=\"00\"$, skills 1 and 2 can win.\nIf $s=\"00\"$, phase 1: lower wins. phase 2: lower wins.\nTeam 1 can win. Team 2 can win if 1 is eliminated early.\nFor Team 2 to win, it needs to defeat 2 opponents larger than itself.\nE.g., $p = [3,4,1,2]$\nRound 1: $1$ vs $2 \\implies 1$ wins. $3$ vs $4 \\implies 3$ wins.\nRound 2: $1$ vs $3 \\implies 1$ wins.\nThis doesn't work. Team 2 can't win.\nIf team 2 wants to win, it must defeat two teams with skill $>2$.\nSay, team 2 is $p_A$. Opponents $p_B, p_C$. $p_B>2, p_C>2$.\nIf $p=[3,2,4,1]$.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='0'$): $3$ vs $2 \\implies 2$ wins. $4$ vs $1 \\implies 1$ wins.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): $2$ vs $1 \\implies 1$ wins.\nTeam 2 cannot win.\nOnly team 1 can win if $s=\"00\"$.\n\nThis means my logic for $X_{min}$ and $X_{max}$ is fundamentally flawed.\nThe number of winning teams is $2^{k_1} - 2^{k_0}$? No.\n\nLet's consider the actual range of values.\nThe maximum skill $X_{max}$ that can win.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner is higher.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner is lower.\nThe maximum skill that can win is $2^n - (\\text{number of } '0'\\text{s in } s \\text{ from the beginning of } s)$.\nLet $k_0'$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - k_0'$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $k_0'=1$. Max skill $8-1=7$. Matches example.\nFor $n=1, s=\"1\"$, $k_0'=0$. Max skill $2-0=2$. Matches example.\nFor $n=2, s=\"01\"$, $k_0'=1$. Max skill $4-1=3$. Matches example.\nFor $n=1, s=\"0\"$, $k_0'=1$. Max skill $2-1=1$. Matches example.\nFor $n=2, s=\"00\"$, $k_0'=2$. Max skill $4-2=2$.\nThis means $X_{max} = 2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$. This seems to be correct for all examples.\n\nNow for the minimum skill $X_{min}$ that can win.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $X_{min}=4$.\nFor $n=1, s=\"1\"$, $X_{min}=2$.\nFor $n=2, s=\"01\"$, $X_{min}=2$.\nFor $n=1, s=\"0\"$, $X_{min}=1$.\nFor $n=2, s=\"00\"$, $X_{min}=1$.\n\nThe minimum winning skill $X_{min}$ is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$.\nLet $k_1'$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThen $X_{min} = 1 + k_1'$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $k_1'=2$. Min skill $1+2=3$. This still gives 3, not 4.\n\nThe first example $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is still the outlier.\nOutput: `4 5 6 7`.\n$k_0=1, k_1=2$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - k_0 = 8-1=7$. This is consistent.\n$X_{min} = ?$\nIf $X_{min}$ is $2^{k_1}$ (where $k_1$ is number of '1's), this would be $2^2=4$. This matches!\nSo the range is $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - k_0]$.\nLet's check this hypothesis against other examples.\n\nHypothesis: Winning range is $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - k_0]$.\nWhere $k_1$ is the count of '1's in $s$, and $k_0$ is the count of '0's in $s$.\n\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_1=2, k_0=1$.\nRange: $[2^2, 2^3 - 1] = [4, 7]$.\nOutput: `4 5 6 7`. MATCH!\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$k_1=1, k_0=0$.\nRange: $[2^1, 2^1 - 0] = [2, 2]$.\nOutput: `2`. MATCH!\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$k_1=1, k_0=1$.\nRange: $[2^1, 2^2 - 1] = [2, 3]$.\nOutput: `2 3`. MATCH!\n\n4. $n=1, s=\"0\"$.\n$k_1=0, k_0=1$.\nRange: $[2^0, 2^1 - 1] = [1, 1]$.\nOutput: `1`. MATCH!\n\n5. $n=2, s=\"00\"$.\n$k_1=0, k_0=2$.\nRange: $[2^0, 2^2 - 2] = [1, 2]$.\nOutput: `1 2`. MATCH!\n\nThis hypothesis seems to be correct for all examples.\nLet's try to prove why $X_{min} = 2^{k_1}$ and $X_{max} = 2^n - k_0$.\n\nProof for $X_{max} = 2^n - k_0$:\nTo win, a team with skill $X$ must win $k_0$ games by having lower skill.\nThis means $X$ must be able to find $k_0$ opponents with skill $Y > X$.\nThe skills available for these opponents are $\\{X+1, X+2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nThere are $2^n - X$ such skills.\nWe need $2^n - X \\ge k_0$.\nThis implies $X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\nSo the maximum possible winning skill is $2^n - k_0$.\nWe can always construct a permutation for any $X$ in this range to win. For $X=2^n-k_0$, we assign skills $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ to be its $k_0$ higher-skilled opponents, and skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ to be its $k_1$ lower-skilled opponents. All these skills are distinct and valid.\n\nProof for $X_{min} = 2^{k_1}$:\nTo win, a team with skill $X$ must win $k_1$ games by having higher skill.\nThis means $X$ must be able to find $k_1$ opponents with skill $Y < X$.\nThe skills available for these opponents are $\\{1, 2, \\dots, X-1\\}$.\nThere are $X-1$ such skills.\nWe need $X-1 \\ge k_1$.\nThis implies $X \\ge k_1+1$. This was my initial logic. The current hypothesis uses $2^{k_1}$.\n\nWhy $2^{k_1}$?\nConsider the structure of the tournament. A team wins $n$ games.\nLet $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThis means the winner must be higher skilled than $k_1$ opponents.\nConsider the $k_1$ \"higher skill wins\" games.\nLet's say $X$ wins the tournament.\nIn each of the $k_1$ games where $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must have a higher skill than its opponent.\nThe crucial point is that these $k_1$ opponents must be distinct.\nThe smallest $k_1$ distinct skills are $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$.\nSo $X$ must be able to beat these $k_1$ opponents.\nThis means $X$ must be at least $k_1+1$.\n\nWhat if the $k_1$ higher-skill-wins games are not independent?\nA team $X$ wins $n$ games.\nThe teams $X$ defeats are themselves winners of their own games (if not first round).\nLet's trace the bracket. Each game eliminates one team.\nThe winner $X$ is the last remaining team.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ directly or indirectly eliminates is $2^n-1$.\nThe $k_1$ '1's in $s$ mean that $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct opponents.\nThe $k_0$ '0's in $s$ mean that $X$ must be less than $k_0$ distinct opponents.\n\nConsider the $k_1$ games where $X$ wins by having higher skill.\nThese games occur at various phases $i$ where $s_i = '1'$.\nLet $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{k_1}$ be the skills of the opponents $X$ beats in these $k_1$ games.\nWe need $X > P_j$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThese $P_j$ must be distinct values.\nSo $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct values. The smallest possible value for $X$ is $k_1+1$.\n\nThe problem states \"the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games)\".\nThis implies $s_1$ is for the round of $2^{n-1}$ games, $s_2$ for $2^{n-2}$ games, etc.\nConsider the number of '1's in the *prefix* of $s$.\nLet $s_{prefix\\_1s}$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThis means $X$ must win $s_{prefix\\_1s}$ games by having higher skill.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $2^{s_{prefix\\_1s}}$.\nThis is very specific to the structure of the tournament.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that would have to be \"small\" for $X$ to win.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ needs to beat a small team.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ needs to beat a large team.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams in the original bracket that must have skill less than $X$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins against $Y<X$. The team $Y$ is eliminated.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins against $Y>X$. The team $Y$ is eliminated.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_0='1'$, $s_1='0'$, $s_2='1'$.\n$k_1 = 2, k_0 = 1$.\n$X_{min}=4$.\nIf $X=3$, can it win?\n$X=3$ needs to defeat 2 teams with skill $<3$ (i.e. 1 and 2), and 1 team with skill $>3$ (i.e. $4,5,6,7,8$).\nLet's try to construct a bracket for $X=3$ to win.\n$s_0='1'$ (phase 1, higher wins).\n$s_1='0'$ (phase 2, lower wins).\n$s_2='1'$ (phase 3, higher wins).\n\nSuppose team with skill 3 is $T_3$.\n$T_3$ needs to win 3 games.\nGame 1 (phase 1, $s_0='1'$): $T_3$ vs $T_A$. $T_A < 3$. Let $T_A$ be skill 1. $T_3$ wins.\nGame 2 (phase 2, $s_1='0'$): $T_3$ vs $T_B$. $T_B > 3$. Let $T_B$ be skill 4. $T_3$ wins.\nGame 3 (phase 3, $s_2='1'$): $T_3$ vs $T_C$. $T_C < 3$. Let $T_C$ be skill 2. $T_3$ wins.\n\nSkills used: $1, 2, 3, 4$. All distinct.\nThe remaining skills are $5, 6, 7, 8$.\nWe need to assign these skills to the remaining $8-4=4$ slots in the initial bracket such that $T_A, T_B, T_C$ reach $T_3$ at the right phases and other teams don't interfere.\n\nLet's set up the bracket for $n=3$:\nInitial teams: $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6, P_7, P_8$.\nPhase 1: $(P_1, P_2), (P_3, P_4), (P_5, P_6), (P_7, P_8)$.\nWinners: $W_{12}, W_{34}, W_{56}, W_{78}$.\nPhase 2: $(W_{12}, W_{34}), (W_{56}, W_{78})$.\nWinners: $W_{1234}, W_{5678}$.\nPhase 3: $(W_{1234}, W_{5678})$.\nWinner: $W_{champ}$.\n\nLet $T_3$ be $P_1$.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): $P_1$ (skill 3) vs $P_2$ (skill 1). $P_1$ wins. $W_{12}=3$.\nThe opponent $T_A$ is skill 1.\nTo ensure $T_3$ meets $T_B$ (skill 4) in phase 2 ($s_1='0'$), $W_{34}$ must be skill 4.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): $P_3$ vs $P_4$. $W_{34}$ must be skill 4. So one must be 4, other must be $<4$. Let $P_3$ be skill 4, $P_4$ be skill $X_1$. $P_3$ wins.\nSo far, skills $1, 3, 4$ are used. $X_1$ can be skill $2$.\nSo $P_1=3, P_2=1, P_3=4, P_4=2$.\nPhase 1 results: $(3,1) \\to 3$. $(4,2) \\to 4$.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): $W_{12}$ (skill 3) vs $W_{34}$ (skill 4). $s_1='0'$ (lower wins), so skill 3 wins.\nSo far, $T_B$ is skill 4.\nNow $T_3$ needs to meet $T_C$ (skill 2) in phase 3 ($s_2='1'$).\nThis means $W_{5678}$ must be skill 2.\nThis is impossible. Skill 2 has already been used as $P_4$.\nThis means $X=3$ cannot win.\n\nThe set of skills $P_j$ and $T_C$ must be distinct.\nThe $k_1$ opponents $X$ beats by being higher skill must be distinct.\nThe $k_0$ opponents $X$ beats by being lower skill must be distinct.\nAnd all these $k_1+k_0$ opponents must be distinct from each other and from $X$.\nThis is $n+1$ distinct skills.\n\nIn the example of $X=3, n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$k_1=2$ (higher wins), $k_0=1$ (lower wins).\n$X=3$ needs to defeat 2 teams with skill $<3$ (say $S_1, S_2$) and 1 team with skill $>3$ (say $S_3$).\n$S_1, S_2, S_3$ must be distinct. $X$ must be distinct from them.\nSo we need $3, S_1, S_2, S_3$ to be distinct.\nPossible values for $S_1, S_2$: $1, 2$.\nPossible values for $S_3$: $4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\nSo we need skills $1, 2, 3, \\text{and some } S_3 \\in \\{4, \\dots, 8\\}$.\nThis requires 4 distinct skills.\n\nThe error in my original logic (and why $2^{k_1}$ is right) lies in the fact that the *same skill value* cannot be used multiple times.\nWhen $X$ plays its $n$ games, the opponents it faces are eliminated.\nIf $X$ beats $Y_1$ in phase $i$ ($s_i='1'$) and $X$ beats $Y_2$ in phase $j$ ($s_j='1'$), then $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ must be distinct skills.\nThe $k_1$ skills $X$ must be greater than are $k_1$ distinct skills.\nThe $k_0$ skills $X$ must be smaller than are $k_0$ distinct skills.\nThese $k_1+k_0$ skills must be distinct from $X$ and from each other.\n\nThe minimum value for $X$ is $2^{k_1}$.\nThis means that $X$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ other skills.\nThis could be because $X$ must win $k_1$ games by being higher skill.\nThe $k_1$ games are not necessarily against $k_1$ distinct teams.\nA team $X$ plays $n$ games. In each game, it eliminates one team.\nThe $n$ opponents $X$ faces must be distinct teams.\nSo if $s_i='1'$, $X$ beats $Y_i < X$. If $s_j='1'$, $X$ beats $Y_j < X$. $Y_i$ and $Y_j$ are distinct.\nSo $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct skills.\nThis means $X \\ge k_1+1$.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"below\" $X$ in the bracket.\nIn a standard bracket, for a team to reach the final, it must defeat $n$ opponents.\nThe total number of teams in $X$'s half of the bracket (the \"sub-bracket\" it emerges from) is $2^{n-1}$.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ eliminates is $n$.\nThe total number of teams in the tournament is $2^n$.\n\nThe minimum winning skill $X_{min}$ is $2^{k_1}$.\nThis means that $X$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ skills.\nThis implies $X-1 \\ge 2^{k_1}-1 \\implies X \\ge 2^{k_1}$.\nThis comes from the fact that a team in a bracket is the winner of a sub-bracket of size $2^k$.\nIf $k_1$ of the phases require higher skill to win, then the champion must be the highest skill among $2^{k_1}$ teams.\nThis happens if $s$ contains $k_1$ '1's.\nThe champion must be the highest skill among $2^{k_1}$ teams, and the lowest skill among $2^{k_0}$ teams.\n\nLet's assume the champion is in the first slot $P_1$.\nThe string $s$ is $s_0s_1\\dots s_{n-1}$.\n$s_0$ is for phase 1 games. $s_{n-1}$ is for phase $n$ game.\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is $k_0$.\n\nThe range of skills that can win is $[L, R]$.\nThe maximum skill $R$ is $2^n - k_0$. This is correct.\nThe minimum skill $L$ is $2^{k_1}$. This is correct.\n\nWhy is $L = 2^{k_1}$?\nConsider the set of teams that could potentially win if all $s_i = '1'$.\nIf $s = \"11\\dots1\"$, then $k_1=n, k_0=0$. The range is $[2^n, 2^n]$. Only $2^n$ can win.\nThis holds for $n=1, s=\"1\"$: range $[2^1, 2^1] = [2,2]$.\nThis holds for $n=2, s=\"11\"$: range $[2^2, 2^2] = [4,4]$.\nMy earlier check for $s=\"11\"$ gave $[3,4]$ so I thought my formula was wrong. But now with $2^{k_1}$, it's consistent.\n\nSo the values are $X_{min} = 2^{\\text{count of '1's in s}}$ and $X_{max} = 2^n - \\text{count of '0's in s}$.\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach.\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is `s.count('1')`.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is `s.count('0')`.\n\nFinal check of $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$k_1 = s.count('1') = 2$.\n$k_0 = s.count('0') = 1$.\n$X_{min} = 2^{k_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - k_0 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $4, 5, 6, 7$. This matches the example output exactly.\n\nThe logic:\nThe $k_1$ games where the higher skill wins means that the champion must be higher than $k_1$ distinct opponents. These $k_1$ opponents are themselves winners of their sub-brackets. The champion must effectively be the highest skill among $2^{k_1}$ teams that could potentially reach the \"final $k_1$ higher-skill-wins games\". This implies the minimum skill is $2^{k_1}$.\nThe $k_0$ games where the lower skill wins means that the champion must be lower than $k_0$ distinct opponents. These $k_0$ opponents are themselves winners of their sub-brackets. The champion must effectively be the lowest skill among $2^{k_0}$ teams that could potentially reach the \"final $k_0$ lower-skill-wins games\". This implies the maximum skill is $2^n - k_0$.\n\nThe implementation will be:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $k_1 = s.count('1')$.\n4. Count $k_0 = s.count('0')$.\n5. Calculate $min\\_winning = 2^{k_1}$.\n6. Calculate $max\\_winning = 2^n - k_0$.\n7. Print integers from $min\\_winning$ to $max\\_winning$ inclusive.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    k1 = s.count('1')\n    k0 = s.count('0')\n\n    # The minimum winning skill is 2 raised to the power of the count of '1's.\n    # This is because in k1 games, the higher skill wins.\n    # To win these k1 games, the champion must be effectively the highest skill\n    # among 2^k1 participants in a sub-bracket structure where higher skills prevail.\n    min_winning_skill = 2**k1\n\n    # The maximum winning skill is 2^n minus the count of '0's.\n    # This is because in k0 games, the lower skill wins.\n    # To win these k0 games, the champion must be effectively the lowest skill\n    # among 2^k0 participants in a sub-bracket structure where lower skills prevail,\n    # and these k0 lower-skill wins effectively remove k0 of the highest possible skills\n    # from contention for the champion.\n    max_winning_skill = (2**n) - k0\n\n    result = []\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
