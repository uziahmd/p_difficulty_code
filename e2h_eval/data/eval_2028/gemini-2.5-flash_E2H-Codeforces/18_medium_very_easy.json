    "thought": "**My Strategy for the \"Frog Jumping\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Frog Jumping\" problem. The core of it is figuring out how many distinct positions a frog can reach within a certain range [0, x], given it can jump forward by 'a' or backward by 'b'. The total sum across different 'x' values is what I ultimately need.\n\nMy initial thought is that the constraint \"never jumps outside [0, x]\" is the real kicker. It's not just about ending up within the range; every single intermediate jump has to stay in bounds. This transforms what could be a simple modular arithmetic problem into something much more complex.\n\nI've broken down the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding Reachable Positions:** Any reachable position will be of the form (k \\* a) - (l \\* b). However, not all numbers of this form are reachable.  I need to consider that the frog's intermediate positions must also be within [0, x].\n2.  **f(x) Definition:** This is the number of distinct integers reachable when the frog stays within [0, x].\n3.  **The key challenge:** The fact that all jumps have to be in range [0, x]. This creates a path dependency.\n\nI'm thinking of building a graph where the nodes are the integers from 0 to x. Edges represent the jumps (+a, -b). Reachable nodes are those connected to 0. BFS or Dijkstra could be useful.\n\nI started trying to calculate `f(x)` for small values of 'x' to look for a pattern. This helps in understanding the reachability of positions.\n\nIt also got me considering cases with special numbers: `a=1` and `a>m`. In the `a=1` case, every number from 0 to x is reachable. When `a>m`, only the position 0 is reachable.\n\nI also looked into the `gcd(a,b)`.  All reachable points must be a multiple of the `gcd(a,b)`.\n\nThen the thought about using Dijkstra came. The state of the Dijkstra is the remainder `i` using modulo a. The cost is the actual jump value to some number mod a. I am now trying to find the values for the minimal jump by creating a graph with nodes as remainders modulo a.\n\nThe main idea is to use Dijkstra to compute the smallest reachable position for each remainder mod a. However, the requirement that the intermediate jumps must also respect [0, x] is the problem.\n\nMy goal is to first build a `dist[r]` array, where dist[r] is the smallest non-negative integer congruent to r (mod a) that the frog can reach, using the bounds within [0, x]. Once I have the distance for each `dist[r]`, calculating the `f(x)` is a matter of counting.\n\nThe `dist[r]` can be used to count the reachable points for each `x`. This involves the crucial constraint `p <= x`.\n\nThis seems like the most promising path forward: to use Dijkstra to compute the reachable values mod a, and then use those values to calculate `f(x)`. It's a matter of accurately accounting for the edge constraints in the Dijkstra part.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`. A crucial condition is that the frog *never* jumps on an integer outside `[0, x]`. This means all intermediate positions in any path must also be within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of `f(x)`:\n\n1.  **Special Case: `a=1`**\n    If `a=1`, the frog can jump `k+1` from `k` (if `k+1 <= x`). Since it can reach `0`, it can reach `1`, then `2`, ..., up to `x`. So, all integers `0, 1, ..., x` are reachable. In this case, `f(x) = x+1`.\n    The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} (i+1)` is `sum_{j=1}^{m+1} j = (m+1)(m+2)/2`. This is a direct calculation.\n\n2.  **Special Case: `a > m`**\n    If `a > m`, then for any `x <= m`, we have `x < a`. From `0`, the only possible jump `0+a` would land at `a`, which is outside `[0, x]`. The jump `0-b` would land at `-b`, also outside `[0, x]`. Thus, the frog cannot make any jumps and can only stay at `0`. So `f(x) = 1` for all `x <= m`.\n    The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} 1 = m+1`.\n\n3.  **General Case**\n    For a given `x`, the set of reachable points `S_x` is the set of all `p \\in [0, x]` such that there is a path `0=p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_k=p` where `0 \\le p_j \\le x` for all `j`.\n    This is a graph traversal problem on nodes `0, 1, ..., x`. We want to find all nodes reachable from `0`.\n    Since `m` can be `10^9`, we cannot iterate `x` from `0` to `m`. We need a more efficient approach.\n\n    Let `dp[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` *without any upper bound `x`* (i.e., only `p_j \\ge 0` is required for intermediate points).\n    This can be found using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n    *   Initialize `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, a-1]`.\n    *   Use a min-priority queue `pq` storing `(value, remainder)`. Start with `(0, 0)`.\n    *   When extracting `(d, u)` from `pq`:\n        *   If `d > dp[u]`, continue (already found a shorter path).\n        *   Consider jumping `-b`: The new remainder is `v = (u - b % a + a) % a`. The new value is `new_d = d - b`.\n        *   If `new_d >= 0` and `new_d < dp[v]`, update `dp[v] = new_d` and add `(new_d, v)` to `pq`.\n    This Dijkstra runs in `O(a log a)` time. After it finishes, `dp[r]` holds the minimum reachable value for each remainder `r \\pmod a`.\n\n    Now, consider the actual problem with the `[0, x]` constraint.\n    Let `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any reachable point must be a multiple of `g`.\n    The values `dp[r]` computed by Dijkstra are the smallest non-negative values `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable (only `p_j \\ge 0`).\n    If `p` is reachable, then `p+a` is also reachable (by simply jumping `+a`). This means if `dp[r]` is reachable, then `dp[r] + k*a` for any `k \\ge 0` is also reachable, provided all intermediate steps stay within `[0, x]`.\n\n    The critical observation is that the \"upper bound `x`\" constraint is only restrictive for small values of `x`. Once `x` is large enough, specifically `x >= max(dp[r])`, then for any `p` that is `dp[r] + k*a` and `p \\le x`, it can be reached.\n    The maximum value of any `dp[r]` is bounded by `a*b/g`. Since `a,b <= 10^5`, this can be up to `10^{10}`. This is too large.\n    However, the maximum `dp[r]` is actually bounded by `a^2` in the worst case, because `dp[r]` is a value `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`. The maximum value for `dp[r]` is `a * (a-1) / 2` (if `b` is `1`, it is `r`). A tighter bound is `a + b - g` for values that `b` can reach.\n    A safe upper bound for `max(dp[r])` is `a * b`. More precisely, it's `a * (a-1)` (if `b=1`).\n    The largest `dp[r]` can be around `a * (a-1)`. Max `a` is `10^5`, so `max(dp[r])` can be `10^{10}`. This is still too large.\n\n    Let's re-examine the `dist[r]` values. The maximum `dp[r]` is actually bounded by `a + b - g` if `g=1`. If `g>1`, then `dp[r]` could be `a + b - g` for `r` that are multiples of `g`.\n    The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` can be split into two parts:\n    1.  For `i` from `0` to `max_val_dp`, where `max_val_dp` is `max(dp[r])`.\n    2.  For `i` from `max_val_dp + 1` to `m`.\n\n    The maximum `dp[r]` value is actually bounded by `a * (a-1)` (for `b=1`) or `a * (b-1)` (for `a=1`).\n    The maximum value of `dp[r]` can be `a * (a-1)` (e.g., if `a=10^5, b=1`). This is `10^10`.\n    This `dp` array must be `dp[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]`.\n    The actual values `dp[r]` can be large.\n    Let `MAX_A_B = 2 * 10^5`.\n    The maximum value for `dp[r]` is actually bounded by `a+b`.\n    No, this is wrong. The minimum positive integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` is `r`.\n    The `dp[r]` values are the *actual integers*.\n    The maximum `dp[r]` can be `a*(b-1)`. If `a=10^5, b=10^5`, then `a*(b-1)` is `10^{10}`. This is too large to iterate.\n\n    The correct understanding of `dp[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod{g}` (where `g = gcd(a,b)`) and `p` is reachable.\n    The number of states in the Dijkstra is `a`.\n    `dp[i]` is the minimum non-negative value `k` such that `k \\equiv i \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable.\n    The maximum value of `dp[i]` is `a * (a-1)` if `b=1`. For example, if `a=10^5, b=1`, then `dp[a-1] = a-1, dp[a-2] = a-2, ..., dp[0]=0`.\n    If `a=5, b=3`. `g=1`.\n    `dp = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n    `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n    Pop `(0, 0)`. `d=0, u=0`.\n      `v = (0 - 3%5 + 5)%5 = 2`. `new_d = 0-3 = -3`.

Push `(9, 4)`.\n    `pq = [(1, 1), (9, 4), (10, 0), (12, 2)]`\n    Pop `(1, 1)`. `d=1, u=1`.\n      `v = (1 - 3%5 + 5)%5 = 3`. `new_d = 1-3 = -2`. Invalid.\n      `v = (1 + 5%5)%5 = 1`. `new_d = 1+5 = 6`. Push `(6, 1)`.\n    `pq = [(6, 1), (9, 4), (10, 0), (12, 2)]`\n    Pop `(6, 1)`. `d=6, u=1`.\n      `v = (1 - 3%5 + 5)%5 = 3`. `new_d = 6-3 = 3`. `dp[3] = 3`. Push `(3, 3)`.\n      `v = (1 + 5%5)%5 = 1`. `new_d = 6+5 = 11`. Push `(11, 1)`.\n    `pq = [(3, 3), (9, 4), (10, 0), (11, 1), (12, 2)]`\n    Pop `(3, 3)`. `d=3, u=3`.\n      `v = (3 - 3%5 + 5)%5 = 0`. `new_d = 3-3 = 0`. `dp[0]` is already `0`.\n      `v = (3 + 5%5)%5 = 3`. `new_d = 3+5 = 8`. Push `(8, 3)`.\n    ... Eventually `dp` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n    This implies that all `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` are reachable.\n    The maximum value in `dp` is `a-1`.\n    This `dp[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\n    The maximum value `dp[r]` can reach is `a-1` if `gcd(a,b)=1`.\n    If `gcd(a,b) = g > 1`, then only `dp[r]` where `r` is a multiple of `g` will be finite.\n    The maximum value for `dp[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` is always less than `a`.\n    The complexity of Dijkstra is `O(a log a)`. `a <= 10^5`, so this is fine.\n\n    After computing `dp[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\n    For any `x`, the set of reachable points `S_x` is `union_{r=0}^{a-1} {dp[r] + k*a | k >= 0, dp[r] + k*a <= x}`.\n    This is incorrect because of the \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" condition.\n    The values `dp[r]` are computed without an upper bound `x`. If `dp[r]` itself is greater than `x`, it cannot be reached.\n    More generally, if `dp[r] + k*a` is a candidate point, the path to it might temporarily exceed `x`.\n\n    The correct interpretation is that `f(x)` counts points `p` in `[0, x]` such that `p` is reachable by a path where all points `p_j` are in `[0, x]`.\n    This means `f(x)` is `f(x-1) + (number of new points reachable at x)`.\n    The number of new points at `x` is `1` if `x` is reachable and `x` was not reachable for `f(x-1)`.\n    This means `f(x)` is the number of points in `[0, x]` that are reachable by a path whose max value is `x`.\n    This is equivalent to: `f(x)` is the number of points `p \\in [0,x]` such that `p` is reachable from `0` when the graph is restricted to nodes `0, \\dots, x`.\n\n    Let `reachable[p]` be true if `p` is reachable from `0` using only `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate positions `p'` are `0 <= p' <= x`.\n    We need to compute `f(x)` for `x = 0, \\dots, m`.\n    The `dp[r]` values computed by Dijkstra (minimum `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable without upper bound) are correct.\n    For a fixed `x`, `f(x)` is the number of `p \\in [0, x]` such that `p` can be written as `dp[r] + k*a` for some `r \\in [0, a-1]` and `k \\ge 0`, AND `dp[r]` itself is less than or equal to `x`.\n    This is because if `dp[r] \\le x`, then any path to `dp[r]` (which only uses non-negative values) is valid within `[0, x]` (since `dp[r]` is the smallest such value, any intermediate values are likely smaller than `dp[r]` or `dp[r]+a`).\n    And once `dp[r]` is reached, we can reach `dp[r]+a, dp[r]+2a, \\dots` as long as these values are `\\le x`. This is because a `+a` jump increases the value and keeps the remainder same. If `dp[r]` is reachable within `[0, x]`, then `dp[r]+a` is reachable within `[0, x]` if `dp[r]+a \\le x`.\n\n    So, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, (x - dp[r])/a + 1)` IF we assume `dp[r]` is reachable within `[0, x]`.\n    The `dp[r]` values must be less than or equal to `x`.\n    This means the `dp[r]` values are the \"base\" points.\n    The maximum value in the `dp` array is bounded by `a`. So `max(dp[r]) < a`.\n    This is the key. The values `dp[r]` are always less than `a`.\n    Proof: If `dp[r] >= a`, then `dp[r]-a` is also reachable and `(dp[r]-a) \\equiv r \\pmod a`. But `dp[r]-a < dp[r]`, which contradicts `dp[r]` being the minimum. The only exception is `dp[0]=0`.\n    So `0 \\le dp[r] < a` for all `r`.\n\n    With this, the `f(x)` calculation simplifies:\n    `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, (x - dp[r])/a + 1)`\n    This is because `dp[r] < a`. If `x \\ge dp[r]`, then `dp[r]` is always within `[0, x]`.\n    The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` can be calculated efficiently.\n    `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, (i - dp[r])/a + 1)`\n    `= sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=0}^{m} max(0, (i - dp[r])/a + 1)`\n\n    Let `k_r(i) = max(0, (i - dp[r])/a + 1)`.\n    `k_r(i)` is `0` for `i < dp[r]`.\n    For `i >= dp[r]`, `k_r(i) = floor((i - dp[r])/a) + 1`.\n    Let `j = i - dp[r]`. Then `k_r(i) = floor(j/a) + 1`.\n    The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} k_r(i)` is `sum_{i=dp[r]}^{m} (floor((i - dp[r])/a) + 1)`.\n    Let `s = i - dp[r]`. The sum becomes `sum_{s=0}^{m-dp[r]} (floor(s/a) + 1)`.\n    This sum can be computed in `O(1)` for each `r`.\n    `S(N, A) = sum_{s=0}^{N} (floor(s/A) + 1)`\n    `S(N, A) = sum_{s=0}^{N} floor(s/A) + sum_{s=0}^{N} 1`\n    `S(N, A) = sum_{s=0}^{N} floor(s/A) + N+1`\n    The term `floor(s/A)` takes value `0` for `s=0, ..., A-1`.\n    `1` for `s=A, ..., 2A-1`.\n    `k` for `s=k*A, ..., (k+1)*A-1`.\n    Let `N = Q*A + R`, where `0 <= R < A`.\n    The sum `sum_{s=0}^{N} floor(s/A)` is:\n    `A*0 + A*1 + ... + A*(Q-1) + (R+1)*Q`\n    `= A * (Q-1)*Q/2 + (R+1)*Q`\n    `= Q * (A*(Q-1)/2 + R+1)`.\n    So `S(N, A) = Q * (A*(Q-1)/2 + R+1) + N+1`.\n    Here `N = m - dp[r]`, `A = a`.\n    `Q = (m - dp[r]) // a`.\n    `R = (m - dp[r]) % a`.\n\n    Total complexity: `O(a log a)` for Dijkstra + `O(a)` for summing.\n    This is efficient enough. `a <= 10^5`.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1.

What is wrong?\nThe formula for `f(x)` is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, (x - dp[r])/a + 1)`.\nLet's check `f(7)`:\n`dp=[0,1,2,3,4]`.\n`f(7) = max(0, (7-0)/5+1) + max(0, (7-1)/5+1) + max(0, (7-2)/5+1) + max(0, (7-3)/5+1) + max(0, (7-4)/5+1)`\n`= (1+1) + (1+1) + (1+1) + (0+1) + (0+1)`\n`= 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8`. This matches example `f(7)=8`.\nMy `sum_floor_s_div_a` formula is for `sum_{s=0}^{N} floor(s/A)`.\nThe sum `sum_{s=0}^{N} (floor(s/A) + 1)` is `(N+1)` terms.\n`sum_{s=0}^{N} (floor(s/A) + 1)`\n`= (floor(0/A)+1) + (floor(1/A)+1) + ... + (floor(N/A)+1)`\n`= (1) + (1) + ...

The example output `19`.\nThe issue must be in the `f(x)` definition or my interpretation of `dp[r]`.\nThe example `f(5)=3`, `S_5 = {0,2,5}`.\n`dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2, dp[3]=3, dp[4]=4`.\nMy `f(5)` calculation:\n`f(5) = max(0, (5-0)/5+1) + max(0, (5-1)/5+1) + max(0, (5-2)/5+1) + max(0, (5-3)/5+1) + max(0, (5-4)/5+1)`\n`= (1+1) + (0+1) + (0+1) + (0+1) + (0+1)`\n`= 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.

This is `0,1,2,3,4,5`. Total `6`.\n\nThe condition \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" means that the path `0=p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_k=p` must satisfy `0 \\le p_j \\le x` for all `j`.\nMy Dijkstra computes `dp[r]` which are minimum values that can be reached *only staying above 0*. It does not consider an upper bound `x`.\nThe `dp[r]` values are `0,1,2,3,4`.\nTo reach `1`, path `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1`. Max value on path is `7`.\nSo `1` is not reachable if `x < 7`.\nThis means `f(x)` is indeed the number of reachable points in the graph with nodes `0, ..., x`.\nThis is a standard BFS/Dijkstra on the actual nodes `0, ..., x`.\nSince `x` can be `10^9`, we can't do that.\n\nThe constraint `a,b <= 10^5` suggests that the solution complexity should depend on `a` or `b` or `a+b`.\nThe maximum value of `x` where the `dp[r]` values are restrictive is `max(dp[r])`.\nThe `dp[r]` values are the *minimum* values for each remainder.\nThe maximum value that `dp[r]` can reach is `a-1` if `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=g`, then `dp[r]` will be `r` if `r` is a multiple of `g`, otherwise `inf`.\nThis is what my Dijkstra computes. `dp[r]` is always `< a`.\n\nThe issue is that `f(x)` is not `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, (x - dp[r])/a + 1)`.\nThe example `f(5)=3` is `{0,2,5}`.\n`dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2, dp[3]=3, dp[4]=4`.\n`0` is reachable.\n`2` is reachable via `0 -> 5 -> 2`. Path is `0, 5, 2`. Max value on path is `5`. So `2` is reachable for `x=5`.\n`5` is reachable via `0 -> 5`. Path is `0, 5`. Max value on path is `5`. So `5` is reachable for `x=5`.\n`1` is not reachable for `x=5` because its path `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1` requires `7`.\n`3` is not reachable for `x=5` because its path `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3` requires `7, 6`.\n`4` is not reachable for `x=5` because its path `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4` requires `7`.\n\nThe definition of `f(x)` is: count `p` such that `0 \\le p \\le x` and `p` is reachable from `0` using only intermediate points `p'` with `0 \\le p' \\le x`.\nThis is equivalent to running a BFS/Dijkstra on the graph with nodes `0, ..., x`.\nLet `min_max_path[p]` be the minimum maximum value encountered on a path from `0` to `p`.\nInitialize `min_max_path[0] = 0`, `min_max_path[p] = infinity` for `p > 0`.\nUse a priority queue `pq` storing `(max_val_on_path, current_pos)`.\nStart with `(0, 0)`.\nWhen extracting `(max_path, k)` from `pq`:\n  If `max_path > min_max_path[k]`, continue.\n  1.

So `min_max_path` array size is `m+a`. This is too large.\nThe maximum value `max_path` can reach is `m`.\nThe number of distinct integers `p` that can be reached is limited.\nThe set of all reachable points `P = {k*a - l*b | k,l >= 0, k*a - l*b >= 0}` is `g, 2g, 3g, ...` where `g = gcd(a,b)`.\nSo we only need to compute `min_max_path[p]` for `p` that are multiples of `g`.\nThe maximum `p` that needs to be considered is `m`.\nSo `min_max_path` array size `m/g`. Still too large.\n\nThe maximum value of `a, b` is `10^5`.\nThe number of reachable points `p` such that `p < a+b` is relatively small.\nLet `MAX_COORD = 2 * (a + b)`. This is `4 * 10^5`.\nWe can compute `min_max_path[p]` for `p` up to `MAX_COORD`.\nInitialize `min_max_path = [infinity] * (MAX_COORD + 1)`.\nRun Dijkstra as described above.\nThe final `min_max_path` will contain the minimum maximum value on a path for all `p` up to `MAX_COORD`.\nFor `p > MAX_COORD`, `min_max_path[p]` will be `p` if `p` is reachable.\nThis is because if `p` is large enough, `p-b` is positive, and `p+a` is positive.\nIf `p` is sufficiently large, say `p >= a*b/g`, then any multiple of `g` can be reached from `p` while staying above `0`.\nThe values `min_max_path[p]` will eventually stabilize for `p` large enough.\nFor `p >= a`, `min_max_path[p]` will be `p`.\nThis is because if `p` is reachable, then `p-a` is also reachable (if `p-a >= 0`).\nIf `p >= a`, `p` is reachable. The path to `p` can be `0 \\to \\dots \\to p-a \\to p`.\nThe maximum value on the path to `p` is `max(min_max_path[p-a], p)`.\nIf `min_max_path[p-a] \\le p-a`, then `max(p-a, p) = p`.\nSo for `p \\ge a`, `min_max_path[p] = p`.\n\nThe `min_max_path` array should be of size `a`.\nLet `min_max_path[r]` be the minimum `max_val` such that `r` is reachable with `max_val` as the maximum point on the path.\nThe states are `0, ..., a-1`.\n`min_max_path_rem[r]` = minimum `max_val` to reach a point `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` where `p` is the first point `\\ge a`.\nNo, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the example `f(5)=3`. `S_5 = {0,2,5}`.\n`f(0) = 1` (`{0}`)\n`f(1) = 1` (`{0}`)\n`f(2) = 1` (`{0}`)\n`f(3) = 1` (`{0}`)\n`f(4) = 1` (`{0}`)\n`f(5) = 3` (`{0, 2, 5}`)\n`f(6) = 3` (`{0, 2, 5}`)\n`f(7) = 8` (`{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`)\n\nThe `f(x)` values are not `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, (x - dp[r])/a + 1)`.\nThe `dp[r]` values (computed by Dijkstra) are `0,1,2,3,4` for `a=5, b=3`.\nThe values `p` for which `min_max_path[p]` is `p` are `0` and `5` for `x=5`.\nThe value `2` has `min_max_path[2] = 5`.\nSo for `x=5`, `f(x)` is `count(p \\le x and min_max_path[p] \\le x)`.\nWe need to compute `min_max_path[p]` for `p` up to `m`.\nThe `min_max_path` array should be of size `a`.\nLet `min_max_path_rem[r]` be the minimum maximum value encountered on a path from `0` to some `p` where `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nInitialize `min_max_path_rem[0] = 0`, others `infinity`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]` (max_val_on_path, current_pos_mod_a).\nWhen extracting `(max_path, u)`:\n  If `max_path > min_max_path_rem[u]`, continue.\n  1. Jump `+a`: `next_k_mod_a = u`. `next_max_path = max_path + a`.\n     This is not correct. The `max_path` is the maximum value *seen on the path to `u`*.\n     If we jump `+a` from `p` (where `p \\pmod a = u`), the new point is `p+a`.\n     The new max on path is `max(max_path, p+a)`.\n     This means `min_max_path_rem[u]` should be `min_max_path_rem[u] + a`.\n     This looks like a standard \"shortest path on values mod A\" problem.\n     The values are `p` for `p \\in [0, \\sim 2a]`.\n     The number of states in Dijkstra is `a`.

This is feasible.\n\n     After computing `min_max_path[p]` for `p \\in [0, LIMIT]`:\n     For `p > LIMIT`, what is `min_max_path[p]`?\n     If `p` is reachable and `p > LIMIT`, then `p` can be reached by a path `0 \\to \\dots \\to p'` where `p'` is some value `\\le LIMIT`.\n     And from `p'`, we make `+a` jumps to reach `p`.\n     So `min_max_path[p] = max(min_max_path[p'], p) = p`.\n     This means for `p > LIMIT`, `min_max_path[p] = p`.\n     This is true for `p` that are multiples of `g = gcd(a,b)`.\n\n     So, `f(x) = count(p \\in [0, x] \\text{ s.t. } min\\_max\\_path[p] \\le x)`.\n     The `min_max_path` array size is `LIMIT = a+b`.\n     `f(x)` is `sum_{p=0}^{min(x, LIMIT)} (1 if min_max_path[p] <= x else 0)`.\n     For `p > LIMIT`, if `p` is reachable (i.e., `p % g == 0`), then `min_max_path[p] = p`.\n     So for `p \\in [LIMIT+1, x]`, `p` contributes to `f(x)` if `p % g == 0`.\n     Number of such points is `(x - (LIMIT+1))/g + 1` if `x \\ge LIMIT+1` and `(LIMIT+1)` is multiple of `g`.\n     This is `floor(x/g) - floor(LIMIT/g)`.\n\n     The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`:\n     `total_sum = 0`.\n     Iterate `i` from `0` to `m`.\n     `f(i) = 0`.\n     For `p` from `0` to `min(i, LIMIT)`:\n       If `min_max_path[p] <= i`: `f(i) += 1`.\n     If `i > LIMIT`:\n       `f(i) += max(0, floor(i/g) - floor(LIMIT/g))` (for multiples of `g` in `[LIMIT+1, i]`).\n       This is `(i - (LIMIT+1) + g) // g` if `LIMIT+1` is first multiple.\n       Number of multiples of `g` in `[A, B]` is `floor(B/g) - ceil(A/g) + 1`.\n       So for `p \\in [LIMIT+1, i]`, it's `floor(i/g) - floor(LIMIT/g)`. (assuming `LIMIT` is a multiple of `g`).\n       No, `floor(i/g) - floor((LIMIT+g-1)/g)`.\n       More simply: `(i // g) - (LIMIT // g)` if `(LIMIT // g) * g <= LIMIT`.\n       Number of multiples of `g` in `[0, K]` is `K//g + 1`.\n       So number of multiples of `g` in `[LIMIT+1, i]` is `(i//g + 1) - ((LIMIT+1)//g + 1)` if `LIMIT+1` is a multiple of `g`.\n       The number of multiples of `g` in `[LIMIT+1, i]` is `(i//g) - ((LIMIT+g-1)//g)`.\n\n     Let's calculate `count[k]` = number of `p \\in [0, LIMIT]` such that `min_max_path[p] = k`.\n     `count_prefix_sum[k]` = number of `p \\in [0, LIMIT]` such that `min_max_path[p] \\le k`.\n     `total_sum = 0`.\n     For `i` from `0` to `m`:\n       `current_f_i = count_prefix_sum[min(i, LIMIT)]`.\n       If `i > LIMIT`:\n         `current_f_i += (i // g) - (LIMIT // g)`. (This counts `p \\in [LIMIT+1, i]` where `p%g==0`).\n       `total_sum += current_f_i`.\n     This calculation is `O(m)`. Still too slow.\n\n     The `f(i)` function is piecewise linear.\n     `f(i)` is constant for `i < min_max_path[p]` for some `p`.\n     `f(i)` is `count_prefix_sum[i]` for `i \\le LIMIT`.\n     `f(i)` for `i > LIMIT`: `count_prefix_sum[LIMIT] + (i//g - LIMIT//g)`.\n     `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{LIMIT} f(i) + sum_{i=LIMIT+1}^{m} f(i)`.\n     `sum_{i=0}^{LIMIT} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{LIMIT} count_prefix_sum[i]`.
