And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Average Sleep Time - A More Efficient Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to compute the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a \"week\" consists of `k` consecutive days from a set of `n` sleep records, `a1, a2, ..., an`.  My goal is to be efficient because the constraints mention that I could be dealing with a large `n`, up to 2 * 10^5.\n\nI've got the basic logic down: I need to sum the sleep times for each week, sum *those* sums, and then divide by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`). I can already picture how a naive approach would involve nested loops, one to iterate over the weeks and another to calculate the sum for each week. But with `n` possibly reaching 200,000, that `O(n*k)` or even worse, `O(n^2)` complexity is going to be a problem. That's way too slow.\n\nSo, I need to optimize this. I have to think about the nature of these week sums, `S_i`. What would be an efficient way to calculate the cumulative sum of sleep for each week? If I could avoid recalculating everything from scratch for each week, that would be great. I need to make use of previous calculations. It's like a sliding window kind of problem.\n\nThe thing is, each subsequent week overlaps with the previous one.  `S_2` is very similar to `S_1` - it just has the first element of `S_1` removed and the next element added.  Aha! I could reuse the previous week's sum! I need a *running sum* or, more precisely, a *sliding window*. I'll calculate the sum for the first week. Then, to get the sum for the next week, I can subtract the first day's sleep and add the sleep time for the day that's newly included in the window. This way I can avoid recalculating the entire week's sum each time. The approach is O(n), this will drastically improve the efficiency of the calculation.\n",
