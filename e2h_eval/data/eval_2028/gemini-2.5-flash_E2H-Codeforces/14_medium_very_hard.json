He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nMy goal is to write a Python script that solves a competitive programming challenge.  The task is to find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeros.  We need to count how many such `n` exist and list them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to determine the number of trailing zeros in a factorial. This boils down to finding the number of factors of 10, which is the same as the number of factors of 5 (since there are always more factors of 2 than 5).  I'll use Legendre's formula to calculate this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`.\n\nNow, I recognize that the function `Z(n)` (the number of trailing zeros) is non-decreasing. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.  Crucially, when it *does* increase, it jumps by an amount determined by the powers of 5 within `n`.  For instance, `Z(24!) = 4` and `Z(25!) = 6`.\n\nIf I find an `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, I know that `Z(n+1)`, `Z(n+2)`, `Z(n+3)`, and `Z(n+4)` will also equal `m`, as long as they're not multiples of 5, otherwise, it jumps. However, there are exceptions. If `m` is a value that Z(n) never takes. So, if I find `Z(n) = m`, the solution will consist of a block of 5 consecutive integers:  `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`.\n\nTo solve this, I'll use binary search.  I'll search for the smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= m`.  The search range will be from 1 to a reasonable upper bound (probably around `5m`, or slightly larger).\n\nTo make the code efficient, I'll implement `Z(n)` function using a simple loop.\n\nOnce I have `n_min_zeroes` (the smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= m`), I'll calculate `actual_zeroes = Z(n_min_zeroes)`.\nIf `actual_zeroes == m`, then the answer is guaranteed to have 5 values.  I will output 5 and list the 5 consecutive numbers.\n\nHowever, if `actual_zeroes != m`, there are zero integers that have exactly `m` zeroes and I will output 0.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of factors of 5 and 2. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is simply the number of factors of 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nLegendre's formula gives us this count:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\n**Properties of Z(n)**\n\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n    *   For `n` from `5k` to `5k+4`, `Z(n)` will have the same value.\n    *   For example: `Z(5!)=1, Z(6!)=1, Z(7!)=1, Z(8!)=1, Z(9!)=1`.\n    *   Then `Z(10!)=2`.\n3.  When `n` is a multiple of 5, say `n = 5k`, `Z(n)` might increase by more than 1 if `n` is also a multiple of 25, 125, etc.\n    *   Example: `Z(20!)=4, Z(21!)=4, Z(22!)=4, Z(23!)=4, Z(24!)=4`.\n    *   Then `Z(25!) = floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   Notice that `Z(n)` jumps from 4 to 6, skipping 5. This means there is no `n` such that `Z(n)=5`.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nBased on the properties of `Z(n)`:\n*   If `m` is an achievable number of zeroes, then there will always be exactly 5 consecutive integers `n` for which `Z(n) = m`. These integers will be of the form `5k, 5k+1, 5k+2, 5k+3, 5k+4` for some integer `k`. This is because `Z(n)` is constant for `n` in `[5k, 5k+4]` and then `Z(5k+5)` will be strictly greater than `Z(5k+4)`.\n*   If `m` is not an achievable number of zeroes (like `m=5` in the example above), then there are 0 such `n` values.\n\nSo, the task boils down to:\n1.  Find the smallest positive integer `n_start` such that `Z(n_start) = m` and `n_start` is a multiple of 5.\n2.  If such an `n_start` exists, then the 5 integers are `n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`.\n3.  If no such `n_start` exists (i.e., `m` is a value that `Z(n)` skips), then there are 0 solutions.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Define `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function:**\n    ```python\n    def count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 5\n        while n // i >= 1:\n            count += n // i\n            i *= 5\n        return count\n    ```\n\n2.  **Binary Search for `n`:**\n    Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` for which `Z(n)` is at least `m`.\n    *   The maximum value of `m` is `100,000`.\n    *   Roughly, `Z(n) ≈ n/4`. So, `n ≈ 4m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` could be around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search could be `5 * 10^5`.\n    *   Let `low = 1`, `high = 5 * 10^5`, `ans_n = high`.\n    *   The binary search will find the smallest `n_min_zeroes` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n_min_zeroes) >= m`.\n\n3.  **Check the result:**\n    *   After binary search, calculate `actual_zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n)`.\n    *   If `actual_zeroes == m`:\n        This means `m` is an achievable number of zeroes.\n        The smallest `n` that produces `m` zeroes is `ans_n`.\n        We need to find the smallest multiple of 5, say `n_base`, such that `Z(n_base) = m`.\n        If `ans_n` is a multiple of 5, then `n_base = ans_n`.\n        If `ans_n` is not a multiple of 5, then `Z(ans_n-1)` must also be `m`, and so on, until we reach `n_base = ans_n - (ans_n % 5)`.\n        So, `n_base = ans_n - (ans_n % 5)`.\n        The 5 values of `n` are `n_base, n_base+1, n_base+2, n_base+3, n_base+4`.\n        Print `5` followed by these 5 integers.\n    *   If `actual_zeroes != m`:\n        This means `m` is not an achievable number of zeroes (it was skipped, like `m=5`).\n        Print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`m=1`)**\n\n1.  `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function is defined.\n2.  Binary Search for `n_min_zeroes` such that `Z(n_min_zeroes) >= 1`:\n    *   `low=1, high=500000`.\n    *   Eventually, `ans_n` will converge to `5`. (`Z(4)=0`, `Z(5)=1`).\n3.  `ans_n = 5`.\n4.  `actual_zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(5) = 1`.\n5.  Since `actual_zeroes == m` (1 == 1):\n    *   `n_base = ans_n - (ans_n % 5) = 5 - (5 % 5) = 5 - 0 = 5`.\n    *   The 5 integers are `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.\n    *   Output: `5\\n5 6 7 8 9`\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`m=5`)**\n\n1.  Binary Search for `n_min_zeroes` such that `Z(n_min_zeroes) >= 5`:\n    *   `Z(20)=4`, `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`.\n    *   The binary search will find `ans_n = 25`.\n2.  `ans_n = 25`.\n3.  `actual_zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(25) = 6`.\n4.  Since `actual_zeroes != m` (6 != 5):\n    *   Output: `0`\n\nThis logic covers all cases correctly.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n.
