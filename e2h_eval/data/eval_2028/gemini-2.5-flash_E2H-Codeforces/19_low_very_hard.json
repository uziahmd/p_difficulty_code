The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games.

The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.

    "thought": "**My Strategy for the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and my initial goal is to construct a Python script to solve it efficiently. The core of the challenge involves a nation with districts connected in a tree-like structure. Each district has a number of fans that's a power of 2, and the president wants to remove some contestants. My objective is to determine which contestants to remove to maximize the total number of fans remaining, with the constraint that the remaining districts must form a connected subgraph.\n\nThe first thing that pops into my head is, since the original structure is a tree, any connected subset of its vertices will also induce a tree. My brain quickly starts processing the implications. I realize I need to choose `n-k` districts that can connect to form a tree. I want to maximize the sum of the fans, which means I should try to keep the districts with the largest indices, as `2^i` grows very rapidly. The value of keeping district `n` is far greater than keeping any combination of districts with smaller indices. I need to prioritize these larger indices to maximize the total fan count.\n\nThis immediately suggests a greedy approach. I think: what if I work backward from the largest district number, `n`, and try to keep as many of them as possible, as long as connectivity is maintained? I need to figure out a way to decide for each district whether to keep it or remove it. To do that, I need to consider whether district `j` can be connected to the connected subgraph I already have.\n\nThis feels like a tree-based problem. I could potentially use dynamic programming, but a greedy approach might be more straightforward given the rapid growth of `2^i`. I'm starting to think that I should iterate from the largest district number (`n`) down to the smallest (`1`) and, for each district, decide whether to keep it or remove it based on its ability to form a connected subgraph with the districts I've already selected. I'll need to keep a running track of the selected districts and their connectivity to make the decision at each step.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts out of `n` such that they form a connected subgraph, and the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. We need to output the `k` removed districts.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows exponentially. Specifically, `2^i > sum(2^j for j < i)`. This means that to maximize the total sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. For example, keeping district `n` is always better than keeping any combination of districts `1, ..., n-1` if `n` can be part of a valid connected component of size `n-k`.\n\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1. We want to keep `n-k` districts.\n2. Iterate through districts from `n` down to `1`.\n3. For each district `i`, try to keep it. If we keep district `i`, it must be part of the final connected component.\n4. We need to ensure that the set of kept districts forms a connected component of size `n-k`.\n\nLet's maintain a set `kept_districts` and a count `num_kept`. We iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nIf `num_kept < n-k`:\n  If district `i` can be added to `kept_districts` such that the resulting set forms a connected component, we add `i`.\n  What does \"can be added\" mean? If `kept_districts` is empty, `i` can be added. If `kept_districts` is not empty, `i` can be added if it is adjacent to any district already in `kept_districts`.\n\nThis greedy strategy works:\nWe start with an empty set of kept districts. We iterate from `i = n` down to `1`.\nIf we have already selected `n-k` districts, we stop.\nOtherwise, we consider district `i`.\nIf `i` is connected to any district already in our `kept_districts` set, we add `i` to `kept_districts`.\nIf `kept_districts` is empty and we are considering `i=n`, we add `n` to `kept_districts`. (This handles the first district to be kept).\nAny district `i` that is not added to `kept_districts` will be marked for removal.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the chosen districts form a connected component. Why? Because we only add a district `i` if it's adjacent to an already kept district (or if it's the very first district `n`). This process builds a connected component. By prioritizing larger `i` values, we maximize the sum of `2^i`.\n\nTo efficiently check connectivity and manage the set of kept districts, we can use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. However, a simpler approach is to mark districts as \"kept\" and use a BFS/DFS-like expansion.\n\nA more concrete greedy algorithm:\n1. Initialize `removed_districts` as an empty list.\n2. Initialize `is_kept` array of size `n+1` to all `False`.\n3. Initialize `num_kept = 0`.\n4. Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n   If `num_kept == n-k`, break the loop (we have selected enough districts).\n   Mark district `i` as `is_kept[i] = True`.\n   `num_kept += 1`.\n   \n   Now, `is_kept` contains a set of districts. We need to check if these districts form a connected component. This is not quite right. The problem is that we might select `i` and `j` (both large) that are far apart, and then need to fill in the path between them with smaller-indexed districts.\n\nThe correct greedy approach leverages the fact that we want to keep `n-k` districts, and we prioritize high-indexed ones.\nWe can think of this as \"removing\" districts. We initially mark all districts as \"to be kept\". Then we iterate through districts in decreasing order of their index. If removing district `i` (which has a large index) does not disconnect the component of currently \"kept\" districts, and we still need to remove more districts, we remove `i`. This is complex because removing `i` might disconnect the graph.\n\nA simpler greedy approach for selecting `n-k` vertices in a tree to form a connected component with maximum sum is to root the tree arbitrarily (e.g., at district `n`). Then, we can use a DFS-like approach.\nHowever, a more direct approach is:\n1. Initialize a boolean array `removed[1...n]` to all `False`.\n2. Initialize `count_removed = 0`.\n3. Initialize a queue `q` for a BFS traversal.\n4. Add district `n` to `q` and mark `visited[n] = True`. This is our starting point for the connected component.\n5. Initialize `parent[1...n]` to store the parent in the BFS tree from `n`.\n6. Perform a BFS starting from `n` to find the shortest path to all other nodes and their parents. This is just a standard BFS traversal on the tree.\n7. After BFS, we have `parent` array. Now, we want to remove `k` districts. We want to remove districts that are \"least valuable\" AND whose removal doesn't disconnect `n` from other valuable districts.\n8. The districts with the smallest indices are the least valuable. So we want to remove `1, 2, 3, ...` as much as possible.\n9. To remove `k` districts while keeping the remaining `n-k` connected, we can think of it as selecting `n-k` districts. The `n-k` districts must form a connected component.\n10. The most valuable district is `n`. We *must* keep `n`.\n11. We can maintain a set of `n-k` districts that we intend to keep.\n    Start with `kept_set = {n}`.\n    Iterate `current_district` from `n-1` down to `1`.\n    If `len(kept_set) < n-k`:\n        We want to add `current_district` to `kept_set`. If `current_district` is adjacent to any district already in `kept_set`, we add it.\n        This approach is still problematic because `current_district` might be far from `n`, but connected to `n` via some `j < current_district`. If we skip `j`, `current_district` might not be reachable.\n\nThe key insight for this problem is:\nWe want to select `n-k` vertices that form a connected component and maximize `sum(2^i)`. This is equivalent to selecting `n-k` vertices, including `n`, and minimizing `sum(2^i)` for the `k` removed vertices. Since `2^i` is strictly increasing, minimizing `sum(2^i)` for removed vertices means removing the smallest possible `i` values.\n\nConsider district `n`. It must be part of our chosen component, otherwise, we could replace any chosen vertex `j` with `n` and get a larger sum.\nSo, we must keep district `n`.\nNow we need to select `n-k-1` more districts such that they, along with `n`, form a connected component.\nWe can conceptualize this as pruning `k` leaves from a \"potential\" component rooted at `n`.\n\nLet's root the tree at `n`. We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nWe can perform a DFS from `n`. During the DFS, we count the number of nodes in the subtree.\nFor each node `u`, if `u` is not `n`, we can decide to either keep `u` or remove `u`.\nIf we remove `u`, we must remove its entire subtree (unless `u` is `n`).\nThis is a standard \"prune a subtree\" problem.\n\nLet `size[u]` be the size of the subtree rooted at `u` (when `n` is the root).\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. This means we want to remove `k` nodes.\nThe most efficient way to remove `k` nodes while maintaining connectivity with `n` is to remove `k` nodes that are \"farthest\" from `n` and have the smallest indices.\n\nConsider a DFS from `n`. When we visit a node `u`, we can decide to keep it or remove it.\nIf we keep `u`, we try to keep its children.\nIf we remove `u`, we can remove its entire subtree.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum of fans, we want to remove the nodes with the smallest indices.\nSo, we iterate through nodes `i` from `1` to `n-1`. For each `i`, if we still need to remove nodes (`count_removed < k`), we try to remove `i`.\nWe can remove `i` if `i` is a \"leaf\" of the current connected component we are trying to build from `n`.\nThis means, if we consider the path from `i` to `n`, all nodes on this path (except `i` itself) must be kept.\n\nLet's use a simple approach:\n1. Mark all districts `1...n` as `kept`.\n2. `num_removed = 0`.\n3. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`.\n   If `num_removed == k`, we are done.\n   If district `i` can be removed without disconnecting the currently `kept` component (which always includes `n`), then remove `i`.\n   How to check this? District `i` can be removed if, after removing `i`, the number of connected components of the `kept` districts remains 1.\n   A simpler check: District `i` can be removed if it has exactly one neighbor that is currently `kept`. If `i` has multiple `kept` neighbors, removing `i` would split the component. If `i` has zero `kept` neighbors, it's already an isolated component or not part of the main component.\n   This is equivalent to saying: `i` is a leaf in the subgraph induced by `kept` districts.\n   \nThis is the correct greedy strategy:\n1. Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n2. Initialize `removed_districts` as an empty list.\n3. Initialize `kept_districts` as a boolean array `kept[1...n]` where all are `True` initially.\n4. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`:\n   If `removed_count == k`, break.\n   Check if district `i` can be removed. District `i` can be removed if, among its neighbors, exactly one is marked `kept`. This means `i` is a leaf in the induced subgraph of `kept` districts.\n   To implement this: count neighbors `j` of `i` such that `kept[j]` is `True`.\n   If this count is 1:\n     Mark `kept[i] = False`.\n     Add `i` to `removed_districts`.\n     `removed_count += 1`.\n     \n5. After the loop, `removed_districts` will contain the `k` districts to be removed. Sort and print them.\n\nWhy does this work?\nWe start with all `n` districts forming a single connected component. We want to remove `k` districts, prioritizing those with smaller indices.\nWhen we consider district `i` (from `1` to `n-1`), if it's a \"leaf\" in the current `kept` component (i.e., it has only one `kept` neighbor), removing it will not disconnect the component. It simply prunes a leaf. Since we iterate `i` from `1` upwards, we are always removing the \"least valuable\" available leaf. This greedy choice is optimal because removing `i` (a small index) is always better than removing `j` (a large index) if both are removable.\n\nExample walk-through:\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nInitial: `kept = [T,T,T,T,T,T]` (for 1 to 6)\n`removed_count = 0`, `removed_districts = []`\n\nIterate `i` from `1` to `5`:\n\n`i = 1`:\n  Neighbors of 1: [2].\n  `kept[2]` is `True`. Count of kept neighbors = 1.\n  So, 1 can be removed.\n  `kept[1] = False`.\n  `removed_districts = [1]`.\n  `removed_count = 1`.\n\n`i = 2`:\n  Neighbors of 2: [1,6,4,3].\n  `kept[1]` is `False`.\n  `kept[6]` is `True`.\n  `kept[4]` is `True`.\n  `kept[3]` is `True`.\n  Count of kept neighbors = 3. (6, 4, 3)\n  2 cannot be removed (it's not a leaf).\n\n`i = 3`:\n  Neighbors of 3: [2].\n  `kept[2]` is `True`. Count of kept neighbors = 1.\n  So, 3 can be removed.\n  `kept[3] = False`.\n  `removed_districts = [1, 3]`.\n  `removed_count = 2`.\n\n`i = 4`:\n  Neighbors of 4: [2].\n  `kept[2]` is `True`. Count of kept neighbors = 1.\n  So, 4 can be removed.\n  `kept[4] = False`.\n  `removed_districts = [1, 3, 4]`.\n  `removed_count = 3`.\n\n`removed_count` is now `k=3`. Break.\n\nFinal `removed_districts = [1, 3, 4]`. Sort: `[1, 3, 4]`.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis greedy approach works.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Adjacency list for the graph: `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`.\n- `kept` array: `kept = [True] * (n + 1)`.\n- Loop `i` from `1` to `n-1`.\n- Inside the loop, count `kept_neighbors` for `i`.\n- If `kept_neighbors == 1`, remove `i`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Building adjacency list: `O(N+M)` where `M = N-1` edges, so `O(N)`.\n- The main loop runs `N-1` times.\n- Inside the loop, for each `i`, we iterate through its neighbors. In the worst case, `i` could have `N-1` neighbors (star graph center).\n- Total complexity for checking neighbors for all `i`: `sum(degree[i])` which is `2*(N-1) = O(N)`.\n- So, the overall time complexity is `O(N)`.\n- Space complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list and `kept` array.\n\nThis is efficient enough for `N=10^6`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # kept[i] is True if district i is currently part of the connected component\n    # Initially, all districts are kept.\n    kept = [True] * (n + 1)\n    \n    removed_districts = []\n    removed_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate through districts from 1 to n-1.\n    # We want to remove districts with smaller indices first to maximize the sum of 2^i for kept districts.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if removed_count == k:\n            break\n        \n        # District n is the most valuable and must always be kept if possible.\n        # If we reach district n, and still need to remove districts, it means\n        # we couldn't remove enough smaller ones.
