            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Tokitsukaze and Mahjong Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the minimum extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make a mentsu (either a koutsu or shuntsu) with her initial three tiles. I'm starting with three tiles, and the goal is the fewest draws possible.\n\nSince a mentsu requires three tiles and I begin with three, the maximum draws I'd ever need is two. So, I can check for 0, 1, and 2 draws.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the tiles properly. Each tile is a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, or s). For example, \"1s\" becomes something like `(1, 's')`. The input is three strings, so parsing is the first step.\n\nNow, let's break down the logic:\n\n**Zero Draws:** If the initial three tiles already form a mentsu, the answer is 0. So, I need to check for both koutsu and shuntsu. For a koutsu, all three tiles must be identical. For a shuntsu, they must be the same suit and sequential in number. I can sort the numbers to check the sequence.\n\n**One Draw:** If zero draws don't work, I need to see if drawing one tile is enough. This is where I have to be careful. I *don't* need to find *all* possible `t_draw` tiles, just *one* that lets me form a mentsu from any three of the four tiles (the initial three plus the draw). It should not be computationally expensive to check possible draw outcomes.\n\nInstead of testing all the combinations, I need to think about which tiles, if drawn, would create a mentsu with the existing three. I can try to find this.\n\nThis requires careful thinking about the patterns within the initial three tiles and what draw would complete a triplet or a sequence.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `T1, T2, T3`. We need to determine the minimum draws (0, 1, or 2).\n\nFirst, let's represent the tiles in a structured way. Each tile has a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s). We can parse \"1s\" into `(1, 's')`. It's helpful to sort the initial tiles to simplify comparisons, especially for sequences.\n\nLet's define a helper function `check_mentsu(tiles)` that takes a list of tiles and returns `True` if any three tiles in the list form a mentsu, `False` otherwise.\n\n```python\ndef check_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Iterate through all combinations of 3 tiles\n    for i in range(len(tiles)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(tiles)):\n            for k in range(j + 1, len(tiles)):\n                t1, t2, t3 = sorted([tiles[i], tiles[j], tiles[k]]) # Sort to simplify shuntsu check\n\n                # Check for koutsu (triplet)\n                if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n                    return True\n\n                # Check for shuntsu (sequence)\n                # All must be same suit\n                if t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1]:\n                    # Numbers must be sequential\n                    if t1[0] + 1 == t2[0] and t2[0] + 1 == t3[0]:\n                        return True\n    return False\n```\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of draws:\n\n**0 Draws:**\nIf the initial three tiles `T1, T2, T3` already contain a mentsu, the answer is 0.\nWe can directly check this using `check_mentsu([T1, T2, T3])`.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not sufficient, we need to consider drawing one tile. We want to find if there exists *any* tile `T_draw` such that the set `{T1, T2, T3, T_draw}` contains a mentsu.\nInstead of iterating through all 27 possible `T_draw` tiles and checking `check_mentsu`, we can be more specific:\nA mentsu needs 3 tiles. If we draw one tile `T_draw`, the mentsu must involve `T_draw` and two of the original tiles, or it must involve `T_draw` and one of the original tiles plus a \"virtual\" tile that `T_draw` helps complete, or it must involve only two original tiles and `T_draw` completes it.\n\nLet's analyze what pairs/single tiles from `T1, T2, T3` can be completed into a mentsu with one draw:\n\n1.  **Two identical tiles:** If we have `X, X` (e.g., `1m, 1m`), drawing another `X` (e.g., `1m`) forms a koutsu `[X, X, X]`.\n2.  **Two sequential tiles of the same suit:** If we have `X, X+1` (e.g., `1m, 2m`), drawing `X-1` (e.g., `0m` - invalid, so `1m` for `2m,3m` or `2m` for `1m,3m`) or `X+2` (e.g., `3m`) forms a shuntsu. Specifically, drawing `X-1` (if `X > 1`) or `X+2` (if `X+1 < 9`).\n    Also, if we have `X, X+2` (e.g., `1m, 3m`), drawing `X+1` (e.g., `2m`) forms a shuntsu.\n\nSo, we can iterate through all pairs of tiles from `T1, T2, T3` and all single tiles from `T1, T2, T3` to see if they can form a mentsu with one draw.\n\nLet `tiles_parsed` be the list of `(num, suit)` tuples.\nWe need to check for:\n*   **Koutsu with 1 draw:**\n    *   If any two tiles are identical (e.g., `T1 == T2`), we can draw `T1` to form a koutsu.\n*   **Shuntsu with 1 draw:**\n    *   Consider all pairs `(Ti, Tj)` from `tiles_parsed`:\n        *   If `Ti[1] == Tj[1]` (same suit):\n            *   Let `n1, n2` be `Ti[0], Tj[0]` sorted.\n            *   If `n2 - n1 == 1` (e.g., `1m, 2m`): We can draw `n1-1` (if `n1 > 1`) or `n2+1` (if `n2 < 9`).\n            *   If `n2 - n1 == 2` (e.g., `1m, 3m`): We can draw `n1+1`.\n    *   Consider all single tiles `Ti` from `tiles_parsed`:\n        *   We can draw `Ti` twice to form a koutsu (e.g., `1m` and draw `1m, 1m`). This is possible with 2 draws, but not 1 draw if we only have one `Ti` initially.\n        *   We can draw `Ti+1, Ti+2` (e.g., `1m` and draw `2m, 3m`) or `Ti-1, Ti+1` or `Ti-2, Ti-1`. These are 2-draw scenarios.\n\nLet's simplify the 1-draw check. We have 3 tiles.\nWe need to find if there's a `T_draw` such that `(T_draw, T_a, T_b)` forms a mentsu, or `(T_a, T_b, T_c)` forms a mentsu (this is 0 draws), or `(T_draw, T_draw, T_a)` forms a mentsu (this is 2 draws from initial `T_a`).\n\nThe problem statement implies we add one tile, and *then* check the hand. So, if we draw `X`, our hand becomes `{T1, T2, T3, X}`. We need to check if *any* 3 tiles from this set form a mentsu.\n\nThis means we need to check:\n1.  **Koutsu:**\n    *   If `T1 == T2` (or `T1 == T3`, `T2 == T3`), we can draw `T1` to form `[T1, T1, T1]`.\n2.  **Shuntsu:**\n    *   If `T1, T2` form a potential shuntsu (e.g., `1m, 2m`), we can draw `3m` or `(0m)` to complete it.\n    *   If `T1, T3` form a potential shuntsu (e.g., `1m, 3m`), we can draw `2m` to complete it.\n    *   If `T2, T3` form a potential shuntsu (e.g., `2m, 3m`), we can draw `1m` or `4m` to complete it.\n    *   Also, consider a single tile `Ti`. If we draw `Ti+1` and `Ti+2` (2 draws), or `Ti-1` and `Ti+1` (2 draws), or `Ti-2` and `Ti-1` (2 draws).\n    *   What if we only have one `1m`? We can draw `2m` to get `[1m, 2m]`. Then we need `3m` to complete it. This is not 1 draw for a shuntsu.\n    *   The 1-draw case for shuntsu is when we have two tiles that are `X, X+1` (need `X-1` or `X+2`), or `X, X+2` (need `X+1`).\n\nLet's refine the 1-draw check. We need to find if there is *any* tile `draw_tile` such that `check_mentsu(initial_tiles + [draw_tile])` is true.\nWe can iterate through all 27 possible tiles `t` (1-9 for m, p, s). For each `t`, we add it to the hand `[T1, T2, T3, t]` and call `check_mentsu`. If any returns `True`, then the answer is 1.\n\n```python\nall_possible_tiles = []\nfor suit_char in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        all_possible_tiles.append((num, suit_char))\n\n# ... inside the main logic after parsing initial_tiles ...\nif check_mentsu(initial_tiles):\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    found_one_draw = False\n    for draw_tile in all_possible_tiles:\n        if check_mentsu(initial_tiles + [draw_tile]):\n            found_one_draw = True\n            break\n    if found_one_draw:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        # If 0 and 1 draws didn't work, then 2 draws must be the answer.\n        # Why 2 draws?\n        # We can always form a mentsu with 2 draws. For example, pick any tile T1.\n        # Draw T1 and T1. Now we have [T1, T1, T1, T2, T3], which contains a koutsu.\n        # Or pick any tile T1. Draw T1+1 and T1+2 (if valid). Now we have [T1, T1+1, T1+2, T2, T3], which contains a shuntsu.\n        # Since we can always form a mentsu with 2 draws, the maximum answer is 2.\n        print(2)\n```\n\nThis logic covers all cases and ensures minimality by checking 0, then 1, then defaulting to 2.\n\nLet's trace the third example: `3p 9m 2p`\nParsed: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n\n**0 Draws:**\n`check_mentsu([(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')])`\nPairs:\n- `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')` (sorted for shuntsu check: `(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')`)\n  - No koutsu (all different).\n  - No shuntsu (suits are mixed, or numbers not sequential).\nResult: `False`. Answer is not 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIterate `draw_tile` from `all_possible_tiles`.\nLet's try drawing `1p`:\nHand: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (1, 'p')]`\n`check_mentsu([(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (1, 'p')])`\nSorted for checking: `[(1, 'p'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`\nConsider combinations of 3 tiles:\n- `[(1, 'p'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')]`: Same suit 'p', numbers 1, 2, 3 are sequential. This forms a shuntsu!\nResult: `True`.\nSo, `found_one_draw` becomes `True`, and we print `1`.\n\nThis approach seems correct and robust.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    num = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    return (num, suit)\n\ndef check_mentsu(tiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if any three tiles in the given list form a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(tiles)\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n\n    # Iterate through all combinations of 3 tiles\n    # Use indices to avoid issues with duplicate tiles in input list\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                t1, t2, t3 = tiles[i], tiles[j], tiles[k]\n\n                # Check for koutsu (triplet)\n                if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n                    return True\n\n                # Check for shuntsu (sequence)\n                # All must be same suit\n                if t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1]:\n                    # Numbers must be sequential.
