On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**The Challenge of the Non-Decreasing Subsequence**\n\nAlright, so the task is to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a sequence of 1s and 2s, but with a twist: we can reverse a segment of the sequence first. The sequence can be up to 2000 elements long. The standard LNDS approach is simple: the LNDS can only look like a bunch of 1s followed by a bunch of 2s. The difficulty is the reversal.\n\nI need to figure out the best interval to reverse. The idea is to iterate over every possible sub-segment `[l, r]`, reverse it, and then find the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the resulting modified sequence. For each fixed subsegment, I would test all the split points within it.\n\nThe most intuitive approach involves looking at every pair of `l` and `r`, reversing the subsequence between them, and calculating the LNDS. This seems straightforward, but I need to make this efficient. Precomputing the number of 1s and 2s before and after any given index is key. I'm thinking of building lookup tables that let me quickly determine the number of 1s and 2s within any given range of the *original* sequence. Then the split-point strategy seemed best.\n\nInitially, iterating over all the possible reversal start and end points `l` and `r` (which is `O(N^2)`) and then iterating again over every \"split point\" (`O(N)`) where the LNDS could be split into a string of ones and twos (before and after the reversed sequence) made the total complexity `O(N^3)`. My gut tells me this will be too slow, given the constraints of the problem.\n\nI have optimized the LNDS calculation to `O(N)` for each pair of `l` and `r`, by carefully building prefix and suffix sums and efficiently calculating the one and two counts in the reversed section using those precomputed counts. I'm confident my `O(N)` is correct. Still, iterating over all possible start and end points and then the split index results in an overall cubic complexity. This needs a further boost.\n\nI've tested some small examples, and the code seems correct for the calculations. However, I am still at `O(N^3)`. This suggests I may be missing a clever optimization or a more efficient approach entirely, or perhaps there is a subtle trick to reduce the overall complexity by a constant factor. I need to rethink the core logic. Perhaps I can avoid reversing the sequence completely and work with the original indices in a smarter way. I have a feeling the solution will lie in a clever way of expressing the sequence that allows me to quickly determine the length of the LNDS for any reversal without physically performing the reversal operation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a sequence `a` after reversing an arbitrary subsegment `[l, r]`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. That is, it consists of some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. Its length is the total count of these 1s and 2s.\n\nLet the modified sequence be `a'`. To find the LNDS of `a'`, we can iterate through all possible \"split points\" `k` (from `0` to `n`). A split point `k` means we consider taking all 1s from `a'[0...k-1]` and all 2s from `a'[k...n-1]`. The length of such a subsequence would be `(count of 1s in a'[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in a'[k...n-1])`. We want to maximize this sum over all possible `k`.\n\nThe sequence length `n` is up to 2000. An `O(N^3)` solution would be `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`, which is too slow. An `O(N^2)` solution would be `2000^2 = 4 * 10^6`, which is feasible.\n\nLet's precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s, and suffix sums for 1s and 2s for the original array `a`:\n- `P1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`\n- `P2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`\n- `S1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`\n- `S2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` time. (Note: `P1[0]=P2[0]=0`, `S1[n]=S2[n]=0`).\n\nThe core idea is to iterate over all possible pairs `(l, r)` (1-indexed) representing the subsegment to be reversed. There are `O(N^2)` such pairs.\nFor each `(l, r)`:\nThe modified array `a'` consists of three parts:\n1. `a[0...l-2]` (prefix, unchanged)\n2. `a[r-1], a[r-2], ..., a[l-1]` (middle, reversed)\n3. `a[r...n-1]` (suffix, unchanged)\n\nLet `l_0 = l-1` and `r_0 = r-1` be the 0-indexed start and end of the segment to be reversed.\nWe need to find `max_{k=0...n} (count_of_1s_in_a_prime_prefix(k) + count_of_2s_in_a_prime_suffix(k))`.\nLet `count_1s_prefix_a_prime(k)` be the number of 1s in `a'[0...k-1]`.\nLet `count_2s_suffix_a_prime(k)` be the number of 2s in `a'[k...n-1]`.\n\nThese counts can be calculated in `O(1)` using the precomputed arrays:\n\n**`count_1s_prefix_a_prime(k)`:**\n- If `k <= l_0`: The segment `a'[0...k-1]` is identical to `a[0...k-1]`. So, `P1[k]`.\n- If `l_0 < k <= r_0+1`: The segment `a'[0...k-1]` consists of `a[0...l_0-1]` and the first `k-l_0` elements of the reversed middle segment. The first `k-l_0` elements of `reverse(a[l_0...r_0])` are `a[r_0], a[r_0-1], ..., a[r_0-(k-l_0-1)]`. These are original indices `[r_0-k+l_0+1, r_0]`. So, `P1[l_0] + (P1[r_0+1] - P1[r_0-k+l_0+1])`.\n- If `k > r_0+1`: The segment `a'[0...k-1]` consists of `a[0...l_0-1]`, all of `reverse(a[l_0...r_0])`, and `a[r_0+1...k-1]`. This is effectively `a[0...k-1]`. So, `P1[k]`.\n\n**`count_2s_suffix_a_prime(k)`:**\n- If `k > r_0+1`: The segment `a'[k...n-1]` is identical to `a[k...n-1]`. So, `S2[k]`.\n- If `l_0 < k <= r_0+1`: The segment `a'[k...n-1]` consists of the remaining elements of `reverse(a[l_0...r_0])` (from index `k` in `a'`) and `a[r_0+1...n-1]`. The elements from `reverse(a[l_0...r_0])` are `a[r_0-(k-l_0)-1], ..., a[l_0]`. These are original indices `[l_0, r_0-k+l_0]`. So, `(P2[r_0-k+l_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + S2[r_0+1]`.\n- If `k <= l_0`: The segment `a'[k...n-1]` consists of `a[k...l_0-1]`, all of `reverse(a[l_0...r_0])`, and `a[r_0+1...n-1]`. This is `(P2[l_0] - P2[k]) + (P2[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + S2[r_0+1]`, which simplifies to `P2[r_0+1] - P2[k] + S2[r_0+1]`.\n\nSince each `count_1s_prefix_a_prime(k)` and `count_2s_suffix_a_prime(k)` can be calculated in `O(1)` time, iterating `k` from `0` to `n` takes `O(N)` for each `(l, r)` pair. This results in an `O(N^3)` total time complexity. Given `N=2000`, this is too slow.\n\nThe key observation for an `O(N^2)` solution is to optimize the calculation of `max_{k} (count_1s_prefix_a_prime(k) + count_2s_suffix_a_prime(k))` for each `(l, r)`.\nLet `current_max_lnds` be the maximum LNDS length found so far. Initialize it with the LNDS of the original array (by setting `l=1, r=0` or just iterating `k` for the original array).\n\nIterate `l` from `1` to `n`.\nIterate `r` from `l` to `n`.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\nThe LNDS length for `a'` is `max_{k=0...n} (count_1s_prefix_a_prime(k) + count_2s_suffix_a_prime(k))`.\nLet's analyze the contribution of elements to the LNDS based on their original position.\nAn LNDS of `1...12...2` means we pick some 1s and some 2s.\nThe 1s can come from `a[0...l-2]`, then `a[r-1...l-1]` (reversed), then `a[r...n-1]`.\nThe 2s can come from `a[0...l-2]`, then `a[r-1...l-1]` (reversed), then `a[r...n-1]`.\nHowever, all picked 1s must appear before all picked 2s in `a'`.\n\nConsider the total number of 1s in `a[0...l-2]` is `P1[l-1]`.\nConsider the total number of 2s in `a[r...n-1]` is `S2[r]`.\nThese elements are always in their original positions and relative order.\nThe elements in `a[l-1...r-1]` are reversed.\nLet `ones_in_reversed_segment` be the count of 1s in `a[l-1...r-1]`. This is `P1[r] - P1[l-1]`.\nLet `twos_in_reversed_segment` be the count of 2s in `a[l-1...r-1]`. This is `P2[r] - P2[l-1]`.\n\nThe maximum LNDS length for `a'` can be found by choosing a split point within the original array `a`.\nLet `i` be an index from `0` to `n`. We want to pick `1`s from `a'[0...i']` and `2`s from `a'[i'+1...n-1]`, where `i'` is the modified index corresponding to original index `i`.\nThis is equivalent to choosing `i` as the index in the *original* array `a` such that we take 1s from `a_original[0...i-1]` and 2s from `a_original[i...n-1]`, but accounting for the reversal.\n\nLet's fix `l` and `r`.\nThe total number of 1s in the array is `P1[n]`.\nThe total number of 2s in the array is `P2[n]`.\nAn LNDS is formed by `P1[x]` 1s and `P2[y]` 2s.\nThe maximum length is `P1[l-1]` (1s before `l`) + `S2[r]` (2s after `r`) + `max_contribution_from_reversed_segment`.\nThe `max_contribution_from_reversed_segment` is found by considering the elements in `a[l-1...r-1]` (which are reversed).\nFor each `j` from `l-1` to `r-1`:\n  We can take 1s from `a[j...r-1]` (these are `a[r-1], a[r-2], ..., a[j]` in `a'`)\n  and 2s from `a[l-1...j-1]` (these are `a[j-1], a[j-2], ..., a[l-1]` in `a'`).\nThe count of 1s from `a[j...r-1]` is `P1[r] - P1[j]`.\nThe count of 2s from `a[l-1...j-1]` is `P2[j] - P2[l-1]`.\nSo, for a fixed `l, r`, we are looking for:\n`P1[l-1] + S2[r]` (fixed contributions)\n`+ max_{j=l-1...r} ( (count of 1s in a[j...r-1]) + (count of 2s in a[l-1...j-1]) )`\nLet `j` be the split point *within the original segment `[l-1, r-1]`*.\n`j` means that `a[r-1], ..., a[j]` are chosen as 1s, and `a[j-1], ..., a[l-1]` are chosen as 2s.\nSo the contribution from the middle segment is `(P1[r] - P1[j]) + (P2[j] - P2[l-1])`.\nWe need to maximize `P1[r] - P1[j] + P2[j] - P2[l-1]` over `j` from `l-1` to `r`.\nThe `j=l-1` case means all elements in `a[l-1...r-1]` are 1s.\nThe `j=r` case means all elements in `a[l-1...r-1]` are 2s.\n\nSo, the maximum LNDS for a given `(l, r)` is:\n`P1[l-1] + S2[r] + max_{j=l-1...r} ( (P1[r] - P1[j]) + (P2[j] - P2[l-1]) )`\n\nLet's analyze the term `(P1[r] - P1[j]) + (P2[j] - P2[l-1])`.\n`P1[r] - P1[j]` is the number of 1s in `a[j...r-1]`.\n`P2[j] - P2[l-1]` is the number of 2s in `a[l-1...j-1]`.\nThis is exactly the LNDS of `reverse(a[l-1...r-1])` if we consider the split point `j`.\nSo for each `(l, r)` pair, we calculate `P1[l-1] + S2[r] + max_LNDS_in_reversed_middle_segment(a[l-1...r-1])`.\nThe `max_LNDS_in_reversed_middle_segment(a[l-1...r-1])` part takes `O(r-l+1)` time.\nThe overall complexity is `O(N^2 * N) = O(N^3)`.\n\nThis is still `O(N^3)`. The only way to get `O(N^2)` is if the inner `max_{j}` loop can be computed in `O(1)`.\nThis is not possible because `j` depends on `r`.\n\nLet's re-examine the expression: `P1[l-1] + S2[r] + max_{j=l-1...r} (P1[r] - P1[j] + P2[j] - P2[l-1])`.\n`P1[l-1]` and `S2[r]` are fixed for a given `l, r`.\n`P1[r]` and `P2[l-1]` are also fixed.\nSo we need to maximize `P2[j] - P1[j]` over `j` from `l-1` to `r`.\nLet `val[j] = P2[j] - P1[j]`. We need `max_{j=l-1...r} val[j]`.\nThis is a range maximum query. This can be precomputed using a sparse table or segment tree, but that's overkill.\nFor a fixed `l`, as `r` increases, the range `[l-1, r]` for `j` expands.\nFor fixed `l`, we can compute `max_val_j[r] = max_{j=l-1...r} (P2[j] - P1[j])` in `O(N)` time.\n`max_val_j[r] = max(max_val_j[r-1], P2[r] - P1[r])`.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Precompute `P1`, `P2`, `S1`, `S2` arrays in `O(N)`.\n   `P1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n   `P2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n   `S1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n   `S2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n   (Using 0-indexed arrays for `a` and `P1, P2, S1, S2` with size `n+1`).\n\n2. Initialize `max_lnds = 0`.\n   We can calculate the LNDS of the original array as a baseline:\n   `max_lnds = max_{k=0...n} (P1[k] + S2[k])`.\n\n3. Iterate `l_0` from `0` to `n-1` (corresponding to 1-indexed `l` from `1` to `n`).\n   Inside this loop, we will calculate `max_val_j` for the current `l_0`.\n   `current_max_P2_minus_P1 = P2[l_0] - P1[l_0]` (for `j=l_0`).\n   Iterate `r_0` from `l_0` to `n-1` (corresponding to 1-indexed `r` from `l` to `n`).\n     Update `current_max_P2_minus_P1 = max(current_max_P2_minus_P1, P2[r_0+1] - P1[r_0+1])`.\n     (Note: `P2[j]` and `P1[j]` are counts up to `j-1`. So for `j` as an index, we use `P2[j+1]` and `P1[j+1]` for the value at `j`.)\n     The `j` in `max_{j=l-1...r} (P2[j] - P1[j])` refers to the original index `j`.\n     So we need `max_{j=l_0...r_0} (P2[j+1] - P1[j+1])`.\n     Let `max_val_j_in_range = max_{idx=l_0...r_0} (P2[idx+1] - P1[idx+1])`.\n     This can be maintained by `current_max_val = max(current_max_val, P2[r_0+1] - P1[r_0+1])` as `r_0` increases.\n     The LNDS for `(l_0, r_0)` is:\n     `P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + current_max_val`.\n     No, the term is `P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0] + max_{j=l_0...r_0} (P2[j+1] - P1[j+1])`.\n     Update `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0] + current_max_val)`.\n\nThis approach is `O(N^2)`.\n\nLet's verify the formula: `P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P1[j]) + (P2[j] - P2[l_0])`.\nThis is `P1[l_0]` (1s before `l_0`)\n`+ S2[r_0+1]` (2s after `r_0`)\n`+ (P1[r_0+1] - P1[j])` (1s in original `a[j...r_0]`, which are `a[r_0], ..., a[j]` in reversed segment)\n`+ (P2[j] - P2[l_0])` (2s in original `a[l_0...j-1]`, which are `a[j-1], ..., a[l_0]` in reversed segment)\n\nThis formula is correct.\nThe `max_val_j_in_range` needs to be computed for `P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx]` where `j_idx` is the index *before* which we take 2s and *after* which we take 1s.\nSo `j_idx` ranges from `l_0` to `r_0+1`.\nIf `j_idx = l_0`, it means all elements in `a[l_0...r_0]` are 1s.\nIf `j_idx = r_0+1`, it means all elements in `a[l_0...r_0]` are 2s.\n\nThe loop for `j` should be `l_0` to `r_0+1`.\n`max_val_j = max_{j_idx=l_0...r_0+1} (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])`\nFor `j_idx = l_0`: `P2[l_0] - P1[l_0]`\nFor `j_idx = r_0+1`: `P2[r_0+1] - P1[r_0+1]`\n\nThe maximum LNDS for `a'` (for `l_0, r_0`) is:\n`P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + max_{j_idx=l_0...r_0+1} (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])`\n\nLet's trace with the first example: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n=4`.\n`P1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`P2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n`S2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`\n\nInitial `max_lnds`:\n`k=0: P1[0]+S2[0] = 0+2 = 2`\n`k=1: P1[1]+S2[1] = 1+2 = 3`\n`k=2: P1[2]+S2[2] = 1+1 = 2`\n`k=3: P1[3]+S2[3] = 2+1 = 3`\n`k=4: P1[4]+S2[4] = 2+0 = 2`\nInitial `max_lnds = 3`.\n\nConsider `l=2, r=3` (1-indexed).

Reversed it is `[1, 2]`.\n`a'` is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.\nFormula: `P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + max_{j_idx=l_0...r_0+1} (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])`\n`P1[1] = 1`\n`S2[3] = 1`\n`P1[3] = 2`\n`P2[1] = 0`\n`P1[1] + S2[3] + (P1[3] - P2[1]) = 1 + 1 + (2 - 0) = 4`.\nNow, `max_{j_idx=1...3} (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])`:\n`j_idx=1: P2[1]-P1[1] = 0-1 = -1`\n`j_idx=2: P2[2]-P1[2] = 1-1 = 0`\n`j_idx=3: P2[3]-P1[3] = 1-2 = -1`\nMax value is `0`.\nTotal LNDS = `4 + 0 = 4`.\nThis matches the example.\n\nThis `O(N^2)` approach seems correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s\n    # P1[i]: count of 1s in a[0...i-1]\n    # P2[i]: count of 2s in a[0...i-1]\n    P1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    P2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        P1[i+1] = P1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        P2[i+1] = P2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    # Precompute suffix sums for 1s and 2s\n    # S1[i]: count of 1s in a[i...n-1]\n    # S2[i]: count of 2s in a[i...n-1]\n    S1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    S2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        S1[i] = S1[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        S2[i] = S2[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    # Calculate LNDS of the original array as a baseline\n    max_lnds = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1): # k is the split point (0 to n)\n        # 1s from a[0...k-1] and 2s from a[k...n-1]\n        max_lnds = max(max_lnds, P1[k] + S2[k])\n\n    # Iterate over all possible subsegments [l, r] to reverse (0-indexed l_0, r_0)\n    # l_0 from 0 to n-1\n    # r_0 from l_0 to n-1\n    for l_0 in range(n):\n        # current_max_val will store max(P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx]) for j_idx in [l_0, r_0+1]\n        # P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx] is for the split point before original index j_idx\n        # We need to include the case where all elements in the reversed segment are 1s (split at l_0)\n        # or all are 2s (split at r_0+1).\n        current_max_P2_minus_P1 = P2[l_0] - P1[l_0] # This is for j_idx = l_0\n\n        for r_0 in range(l_0, n):\n            # Update current_max_P2_minus_P1 for the new r_0.\n            # The new element to consider for max is at original index r_0.\n            # This corresponds to j_idx = r_0+1 for the split point.\n            current_max_P2_minus_P1 = max(current_max_P2_minus_P1, P2[r_0+1] - P1[r_0+1])\n\n            # Calculate LNDS for the array with a[l_0...r_0] reversed\n            # P1[l_0]: 1s in a[0...l_0-1] (prefix)\n            # S2[r_0+1]: 2s in a[r_0+1...n-1] (suffix)\n            # (P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]): This is the number of 1s in a[0...r_0] minus 2s in a[0...l_0-1]\n            #                        This term simplifies the overall expression.\n            #                        It's (P1[r_0+1] - P1[l_0]) + (P1[l_0] - P2[l_0]) - (P1[r_0+1] - P2[r_0+1])\n            # The formula is P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + max_{j_idx=l_0...r_0+1} (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])\n            \n            # Let's write it as:\n            # (1s from prefix) + (2s from suffix) + (1s from reversed part) + (2s from reversed part)\n            # The max value will be P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P1[j_idx]) + (P2[j_idx] - P2[l_0])\n            # We want to maximize this over j_idx in [l_0, r_0+1]\n            # = P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0] + (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])\n            # So, we maximize (P2[j_idx] - P1[j_idx])\n            \n            current_lnds = P1[l_0] + S2[r_0+1] + (P1[r_0+1] - P2[l_0]) + current_max_P2_minus_P1\n            max_lnds = max(max_lnds, current_lnds)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_lnds) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
