The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script for a competitive programming challenge.  The core of the problem involves maximizing how many chests can be opened, based on a pairing rule: a chest and key's *sum* must be odd.  This means we're dealing with the *parity* (odd or even) of the numbers involved.\n\nSince the sum of two numbers is odd if and only if one is odd and the other is even, I'm going to focus on counting how many odd and even chests and keys there are.\n\nLet's break it down:  There are two types of pairings: (odd chest, even key) and (even chest, odd key). Each type is independent of the other – using one doesn't affect the other. I can calculate each type's maximum and sum them.\n\nFor (odd chest, even key), the max pairings is limited by either the number of odd chests *or* the number of even keys, whichever is smaller (using the `min` function). Same logic applies for (even chest, odd key) pairings. This is a very efficient, greedy approach.\n\nThe total maximum opens the chest is simply the sum of max pairings for each pairing type. This approach is O(n + m), because it just iterates through the arrays a and b once, counting odd and even numbers.\n\nI've tested the logic with examples, including cases where one or both counts might be zero. I've also checked some edge cases. The code's going to be pretty straightforward: it reads the input, counts the odds and evens, calculates the `min` values, and prints the sum. I will use the standard input/output with `sys.stdin.readline` and `sys.stdout.write` because it is faster.\n\nThe prompt that this is a \"hard\" question may be just a distraction, as the core concept is quite simple after recognizing the implications of the odd sum constraint. This is a classic example of how understanding the underlying mathematical property makes this kind of competitive programming problem actually not so difficult at all.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nLet's analyze the condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` (meaning `a_i + b_j` is odd).\nThe sum of two integers is odd if and only if one integer is odd and the other is even.\nThere are two possible scenarios for a valid pairing:\n1.  `a_i` is an odd number and `b_j` is an even number. (Odd + Even = Odd)\n2.  `a_i` is an even number and `b_j` is an odd number. (Even + Odd = Odd)\n\nIf both `a_i` and `b_j` are odd, their sum `a_i + b_j` would be even (Odd + Odd = Even).\nIf both `a_i` and `b_j` are even, their sum `a_i + b_j` would be even (Even + Even = Even).\nIn these two cases, a key cannot open a chest.\n\nThis means we need to count the number of odd-numbered chests, even-numbered chests, odd-numbered keys, and even-numbered keys.\n\nLet's define:\n*   `n_odd_chests`: The count of chests with odd numbers.\n*   `n_even_chests`: The count of chests with even numbers.\n*   `m_odd_keys`: The count of keys with odd numbers.\n*   `m_even_keys`: The count of keys with even numbers.\n\nNow, we can form two independent types of pairings:\n\n1.  **Pairing an odd chest with an even key:**\n    We have `n_odd_chests` available and `m_even_keys` available. The maximum number of such pairings we can make is `min(n_odd_chests, m_even_keys)`. Each such pairing uses one odd chest and one even key.\n\n2.  **Pairing an even chest with an odd key:**\n    We have `n_even_chests` available and `m_odd_keys` available. The maximum number of such pairings we can make is `min(n_even_chests, m_odd_keys)`. Each such pairing uses one even chest and one odd key.\n\nSince these two types of pairings use disjoint sets of resources (odd chests and even keys for the first type; even chests and odd keys for the second type), they do not interfere with each other. Therefore, we can maximize the number of pairings for each type independently and sum the results to get the total maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests opened will be:\n`total_opened_chests = min(n_odd_chests, m_even_keys) + min(n_even_chests, m_odd_keys)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the integers `n` and `m`.\n2.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. Iterate through them and count `n_odd_chests` and `n_even_chests`.\n3.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. Iterate through them and count `m_odd_keys` and `m_even_keys`.\n4.  Calculate `min(n_odd_chests, m_even_keys)`.\n5.  Calculate `min(n_even_chests, m_odd_keys)`.\n6.  Sum these two minimums to get the final result.\n7.  Print the result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1.  **Chests:**\n    *   Odd chests: `9, 11` -> `n_odd_chests = 2`\n    *   Even chests: `14, 6, 2` -> `n_even_chests = 3`\n\n2.  **Keys:**\n    *   Odd keys: `7` -> `m_odd_keys = 1`\n    *   Even keys: `8, 4, 20` -> `m_even_keys = 3`\n\n3.  **Pairings:**\n    *   `min(n_odd_chests, m_even_keys) = min(2, 3) = 2` (e.g., chest 9 with key 8, chest 11 with key 4)\n    *   `min(n_even_chests, m_odd_keys) = min(3, 1) = 1` (e.g., chest 14 with key 7)\n\n4.  **Total:** `2 + 1 = 3`\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** We iterate through the `n` chest numbers once and the `m` key numbers once. This gives a total time complexity of `O(n + m)`. Given `n, m <= 10^5`, this is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:** We store the input arrays `a` and `b`, which takes `O(n + m)` space. If we process the inputs directly without storing the full arrays, we could achieve `O(1)` space (excluding input/output buffers).\n\nThis approach is optimal and correctly solves the problem.
