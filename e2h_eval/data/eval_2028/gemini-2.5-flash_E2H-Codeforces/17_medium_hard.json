He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thought Summary for \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got a competitive programming problem where we're given some clues (prefixes and suffixes) to figure out a secret string. My goal is to craft a Python script that efficiently solves this, leveraging my understanding of string manipulation and problem-solving techniques.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp the core of the problem. We're given a length `n` for our secret string `s`.  Then, we get `2n-2` strings, which are a mix of improper prefixes (from length 1 up to `n-1`) and improper suffixes (also from length 1 up to `n-1`).  We don't know which is which!  The aim is to figure out for each of those input strings if it's a prefix or a suffix (and output a 'P' or 'S' accordingly). The crucial piece is that the output has to be consistent - meaning, *at least one* valid original string `s` *must* exist for that particular 'P'/'S' assignment.\n\nNow, let's identify the critical observation: the prefix and suffix of length `n-1`.  These two determine the *entire* string `s`.  If we have `P_n-1` (the prefix of length `n-1`) and `S_n-1` (the suffix of length `n-1`), we can reconstruct `s`.  But there's a consistency condition here: The part of the prefix, *excluding the first character* must match the part of the suffix, *excluding the last character*. This is because `s` can be seen as either: the prefix with the last character of the suffix appended, OR the first character of the prefix appended to the suffix.\n\nNext, I need a clear strategy to solve this.\n\n1.  **Identify the Two `n-1` Length Strings:** We know we'll have exactly two strings of length `n-1` since there's one of each possible prefix and suffix length.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis 1:** Assume the first `n-1` length string is `P_n-1` and the second is `S_n-1`. Check if they're consistent by verifying `P_n-1[1:] == S_n-1[:-1]`. If consistent, build a candidate string `s` using  `P_n-1 + S_n-1[-1]`.  The key next step is *verification*: Check that this candidate `s` actually generates all the input strings correctly when we check its prefixes and suffixes and compare them to the input. We're looking for an exact match.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis 2:**  Repeat everything from step 2, but switch the assumed roles of `P_n-1` and `S_n-1`.\n\n4.  **Guaranteed Solution:** The problem statement is written so that at least one of these hypotheses *must* work, if consistent. If both work, we can output either. This guarantees the algorithm will find an answer.\n\nFor the crucial **verification step**, I'll generate all possible prefixes and suffixes from the candidate string. Then, I need to match that set with the strings we were given as input.  This is made more robust by sorting the strings so duplicates and different orderings won't be a problem. This means creating a multiset from the input and candidate's generated strings.\n\nTo **construct the output** (the 'P's and 'S's), I'll keep track of the original order of the input strings.  Once a valid `s` candidate is found (say, after Hypothesis 1), I'll create frequency counters for *all* the expected prefixes and suffixes. Then, I'll go through the input strings and assign 'P' (if the string is a prefix) and 'S' (if it's a suffix). The counter approach effectively handles situations where a string might be both a prefix and suffix of different lengths, correctly assigning it in a consistent manner. If there's overlap I'll assume 'P' first which is also fine.\n\nThe Python code should handle edge cases like n=2 and should take advantage of `collections.Counter` for efficient counting and comparing of strings.\n\nOverall, the core idea is a clever two-hypothesis approach and thorough validation, which ensures a fast and correct solution.\n",
    "response": "The solution relies on a key observation: the string of length `n-1` that is a prefix and the string of length `n-1` that is a suffix uniquely determine the original string `s` of length `n`.\n\nLet `P_k` denote the prefix of `s` of length `k`, and `S_k` denote the suffix of `s` of length `k`.\nThe prefix of length `n-1` is `P_{n-1} = s[0:n-1]`.\nThe suffix of length `n-1` is `S_{n-1} = s[1:n]`.\n\nIf we know `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`, we can reconstruct `s`:\n1. `s` must start with `P_{n-1}`.\n2. `s` must end with `S_{n-1}`.\n3. For these to be consistent, the substring `s[1:n-1]` must be identical in both `P_{n-1}` (which is `P_{n-1}[1:]`) and `S_{n-1}` (which is `S_{n-1}[:-1]`).\n4. If `P_{n-1}[1:] == S_{n-1}[:-1]`, then the original string `s` can be formed as `P_{n-1} + S_{n-1}[-1]` (or equivalently, `P_{n-1}[0] + S_{n-1}`).\n\nThe problem guarantees that there are exactly two strings of each length from `1` to `n-1`. This means there will be exactly two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call these `str_A` and `str_B`.\n\nWe can form two hypotheses:\n**Hypothesis 1:** `str_A` is `P_{n-1}` and `str_B` is `S_{n-1}`.\n**Hypothesis 2:** `str_B` is `P_{n-1}` and `str_A` is `S_{n-1}`.\n\nWe can test each hypothesis:\n1. **Check consistency:** For a given pair (`prefix_nm1`, `suffix_nm1`), verify if `prefix_nm1[1:] == suffix_nm1[:-1]`. If not, this hypothesis is invalid.\n2. **Reconstruct candidate string `s_cand`:** If consistent, `s_cand = prefix_nm1 + suffix_nm1[-1]`.\n3. **Verify `s_cand`:** Generate all `2n-2` prefixes and suffixes that `s_cand` would produce.\n    * Prefixes: `s_cand[0:k]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n    * Suffixes: `s_cand[n-k:n]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n    * Collect these into a frequency map (e.g., `collections.Counter`).\n    * Collect the input `2n-2` strings into another frequency map.\n    * If the two frequency maps are identical, `s_cand` is a valid original string.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a solution exists, at least one of these hypotheses will lead to a valid `s_cand`.\n\nOnce a valid `s_cand` is found, we need to assign 'P' or 'S' to each of the original input strings.\n1. Create two frequency maps: `P_counts` for prefixes generated by `s_cand`, and `S_counts` for suffixes generated by `s_cand`.\n2. Iterate through the input strings in their original order (keeping track of their original indices).\n3. For each input string `s_in`:\n    * If `P_counts[s_in] > 0`, assign 'P' to `s_in` and decrement `P_counts[s_in]`.\n    * Otherwise (it must be a suffix, as `s_cand` is verified), assign 'S' to `s_in` and decrement `S_counts[s_in]`.\n    * This strategy correctly handles duplicate strings and strings that are both prefixes and suffixes, as any valid assignment is acceptable.\n\nThe final output is the string of 'P's and 'S's.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=5, s=\"ababa\"):**\nInput strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba` (with original indices)\nStrings of length `n-1=4`: `abab`, `baba`. Let `str_A = \"abab\"`, `str_B = \"baba\"`.\n\n**Hypothesis 1:** `P_{n-1} = \"abab\"`, `S_{n-1} = \"baba\"`.\n1. Consistency check: `P_{n-1}[1:]` is `\"bab\"`, `S_{n-1}[:-1]` is `\"bab\"`. They match.\n2. `s_cand = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\"`.\n3. Verify `s_cand = \"ababa\"`:\n   * Prefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\n   * Suffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n   * Expected strings (multiset): `{a:2, ab:1, aba:2, abab:1, ba:1, baba:1}`\n   * Input strings (multiset): `{a:2, ab:1, aba:2, abab:1, ba:1, baba:1}`\n   * Multisets match. `s_cand = \"ababa\"` is valid.\n\n4. Assign 'P'/'S' based on `s_cand = \"ababa\"`:\n   * `P_counts = {a:1, ab:1, aba:1, abab:1}`\n   * `S_counts = {a:1, ba:1, aba:1, baba:1}`\n   * `result_chars = [''] * 8`\n   * `(ba, 0)`: `S_counts[\"ba\"] > 0`. Assign 'S'. `result_chars[0] = 'S'`.\n   * `(a, 1)`: `P_counts[\"a\"] > 0`. Assign 'P'. `result_chars[1] = 'P'`.\n   * `(abab, 2)`: `P_counts[\"abab\"] > 0`. Assign 'P'. `result_chars[2] = 'P'`.\n   * `(a, 3)`: `P_counts[\"a\"]` is now 0. `S_counts[\"a\"] > 0`. Assign 'S'. `result_chars[3] = 'S'`.\n   * `(aba, 4)`: `P_counts[\"aba\"] > 0`. Assign 'P'. `result_chars[4] = 'P'`.\n   * `(baba, 5)`: `S_counts[\"baba\"] > 0`. Assign 'S'. `result_chars[5] = 'S'`.\n   * `(ab, 6)`: `P_counts[\"ab\"] > 0`. Assign 'P'. `result_chars[6] = 'P'`.\n   * `(aba, 7)`: `P_counts[\"aba\"]` is now 0. `S_counts[\"aba\"] > 0`. Assign 'S'. `result_chars[7] = 'S'`.\n   * Final result: `SPPSPSPS`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    input_strings_data = [] # Stores (string, original_index)\n    len_n_minus_1_strings = [] # Stores the two strings of length n-1\n\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s_in = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_data.append((s_in, i))\n        if len(s_in) == n - 1:\n            len_n_minus_1_strings.append(s_in)\n\n    def check_and_build_result(prefix_nm1, suffix_nm1):\n        # 1.
