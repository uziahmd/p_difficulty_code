Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solution Thoughts: \"Crazy Town\" Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem. It looks like a classic computational geometry problem. The goal is to find the fewest \"steps\" (road crossings) to get from home to the university.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the input: Home and university coordinates, the number of roads (`n`), and the road definitions (lines of the form `a*x + b*y + c = 0`). The constraints are pretty straightforward: coordinate ranges, `n` range, and the coefficients' ranges. The critical part is that no two roads are identical, and home and the university aren't *on* any road.\n\nThe key idea is that the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks). To move between adjacent blocks, you *must* cross a road. Therefore, the minimum steps required equal the number of roads that *separate* the home region from the university region. This essentially means we need to count the lines that home and the university are on opposite sides of.\n\nHow do I check if two points are on opposite sides of a line? Simple!  For a line `a*x + b*y + c = 0`, if I plug in the coordinates of the two points into the equation (`a*x + b*y + c`), the results will have opposite signs if they are on opposite sides.  I can check this using the product of the results. If the product is negative, they're on opposite sides; if positive, they're on the same side. The problem guarantees neither point is on a line, so I don't need to worry about a value being zero.\n\nThe algorithm is pretty clear: Read the home and university coordinates, read `n`, initialize a step counter, loop through each road, calculate the expression `a*x + b*y + c` for each point, check if the signs are different, and increment the step counter if they are. Finally, print the step count.\n\nI need to make sure the large values for the coordinates and coefficients won't cause any problems. Since I'm using Python, I can relax; Python handles these large integers without overflowing. The calculations are simple arithmetic operations, and the number of roads (`n`, up to 300) won't make the algorithm complex.\n\nI double-checked with the examples. Both examples work as expected, including the scenario where a road does *not* separate the points. The final step is to create a Python script. It'll be a straightforward implementation of the algorithm. I'll read the input, loop through the roads, perform calculations, and check the signs.\n\nThe script has to read input, compute the value of the equation, check if the points are on opposite sides, and increment the counter. Python will handle the large numbers without issues. The solution seems sound, efficient, and ready to go!\n",
