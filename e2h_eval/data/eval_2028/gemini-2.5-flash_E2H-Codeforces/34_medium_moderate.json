And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Efficient Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nAlright, so the task at hand is to figure out the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" within a given dataset of sleep records.  A \"week\" here is defined as a contiguous block of `k` days.  We've got `n` days worth of data (`a1` through `an`), and the goal is to calculate the average sleep time across all these sliding `k`-day windows.\n\nMy initial thought was, \"Okay, brute force it, iterate through each possible week and calculate the sum.\"  But that quickly got me thinking about efficiency. If we have `n - k + 1` weeks and for each, have to sum k elements that will be an `O((n - k + 1) * k)` operation.  That quickly scales to something inefficient (O(n^2)) for big data sets.\n\nThen, the sliding window concept popped into my head. It's a classic for problems like this. The idea is to compute the sum for the first window, and then update it incrementally for the subsequent windows, avoiding redundant calculations. This is achieved by subtracting the departing element of the window and adding the newly included element in each iteration. Each iteration has a constant time cost, making the whole process `O(n)`. This means we only need one pass through the data.\n\nI realized that we don't even need to store all the week sums. We only need the *total* sum of all weeks. So, as we slide the window, we can just keep accumulating that total.  We calculate the sum of the first 'k' element, and then sliding the window, re-calculate the window sum by subtracting first element of previous window and adding k+1 element for each subsequent window.  Finally, after running the loop, average the `TotalSum` by `n - k + 1`, the number of weeks.\n\nI also considered prefix sums as an alternative but decided the sliding window approach is easier to implement.\n\nThis sliding window algorithm looks extremely promising.  It handles both large datasets and the specific constraints of the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a week consists of `k` consecutive days. We are given `n` days of sleep records, `a1, a2, ..., an`.\n\nThere are `n - k + 1` possible weeks:\nThe first week covers days `a1, ..., ak`.\nThe second week covers days `a2, ..., ak+1`.\n...\nThe last week covers days `an-k+1, ..., an`.\n\nTo find the overall average, we need to:\n1. Calculate the sum of sleep times for each of these `n - k + 1` weeks.\n2. Sum up all these individual week sums.\n3. Divide this grand total sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `n - k + 1` weeks, and for each week, sum its `k` elements. This would result in a time complexity of `O((n - k + 1) * k)`, which can be up to `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `k = n/2`). Given `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, `O(n^2)` is too slow (`4 * 10^10` operations).\n\nA more efficient approach uses a **sliding window**.\n1. **Initial Sum**: Calculate the sum of the first `k` days (`a[0]` to `a[k-1]`). This is the sum for the first week. Let's call this `current_week_sum`.\n2. **Total Sum Accumulation**: Initialize `total_sum_of_weeks` with `current_week_sum`.\n3. **Slide the Window**: For each subsequent week, we can update `current_week_sum` in `O(1)` time. When the window slides one position to the right:\n   - The element `a[i-1]` (the first element of the previous window) leaves the window.\n   - The element `a[i+k-1]` (the new last element of the current window) enters the window.\n   So, `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`.\n   After updating `current_week_sum` for the new week, add it to `total_sum_of_weeks`.\n   This process is repeated `n - k` times (for weeks starting from index 1 up to `n-k`).\n4. **Final Calculation**: After iterating through all `n - k + 1` weeks, `total_sum_of_weeks` will hold the sum of all individual week sums. Divide this by `n - k + 1` to get the final average.\n\nThis sliding window approach calculates the `total_sum_of_weeks` in `O(n)` time (initial sum takes `O(k)`, subsequent `n-k` updates take `O(1)` each, totaling `O(k + (n-k)) = O(n)`). This is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]):**\n1. `n=3, k=2`. `a = [3, 4, 7]`.\n2. **First week sum**: `current_week_sum = a[0] + a[1] = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n3. **Initialize total**: `total_sum_of_weeks = 7`.\n4. **Slide window**: Loop from `i=1` to `n-k = 1`.\n   - For `i=1`:\n     - `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n     - `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n     - `current_week_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`. (This is the sum for week `[4, 7]`)\n     - `total_sum_of_weeks = total_sum_of_weeks + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n5. Loop finishes.\n6. **Calculate average**: `num_weeks = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n   `average = total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `total_sum_of_weeks` can be `(n - k + 1) * k * max(ai)`. With `n=2*10^5`, `k=2*10^5`, `max(ai)=10^5`, this could be roughly `1 * 2*10^5 * 10^5 = 2*10^{10}`. If `k=1`, then `n * 1 * 10^5 = 2*10^{10}`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle these large sums without overflow. The final division will produce a float, and standard double-precision floats are sufficient for the required precision (`10^-6`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and k from the first line of input\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the list of sleep times 'a' from the second line of input\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first 'k' elements.\n    # This represents the sum of sleep times for the first week (days a[0] to a[k-1]).\n    current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\n    # Initialize total_sum_of_weeks with the sum of the first week.\n    # This variable will accumulate the sums of all n-k+1 weeks.\n    total_sum_of_weeks = current_week_sum\n\n    # Iterate through the remaining possible weeks using a sliding window approach.\n    # The loop runs from i=1 to n-k (inclusive).\n    # 'i' represents the starting index of the current week.\n    # The previous week started at index i-1.\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        # To get the sum of the current week from the previous week's sum:\n        # 1.
