The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem:**\n\nFirst, I had to understand the setup. We've got a circular road with houses numbered 1 to *n*, and *m* tasks that need to be done in order.  Xenia starts at house 1 and moves clockwise, and we need to minimize the total travel time.\n\nMy initial approach was to trace Xenia's movements step-by-step. I'd keep track of the `current_house` and the `total_time`.  The time to move between two houses would be the crux of the problem.  \n\nI realized the critical part was calculating the time to get from `current_house` to the target `a_i`.  I quickly worked out that if `a_i` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, the travel time is simply the difference.  But if `a_i` is *less* than `current_house`, it means we have to go all the way around the ring. I tried a few examples to confirm this. The formula `n - current_house + a_i` captures that clockwise wrap-around perfectly. I thought about an alternative `%` solution, which wasn't as intuitively clear for the problem as the logic provided.\n\nSo, I settled on a straightforward loop: for each task, calculate the time, add it to the total, and update `current_house`. I walked through the given examples, meticulously calculating each step to confirm the logic's correctness and I also tried to test it on edge cases. I needed to ensure that the code handled the wrap-around scenario. I verified against the test cases, and they matched!\n\nThinking about constraints, the biggest concern was the potential for large numbers, particularly for `total_time`. With *n* and *m* up to 10^5, the total time could reach 10^10. But Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so no overflow issue there. Also, time and space complexity are O(*m*).\n\nI implemented the algorithm in Python, using `sys.stdin.readline()` for faster input. I kept the code clean and easy to read. After the implementation I ran the examples, a few edge cases, the outputs matched. The logic looked solid.\n\nNow, I was confident in my solution! The key was in the logic of calculating time with respect to the circular path. I submitted the code. The problem was solved!",
