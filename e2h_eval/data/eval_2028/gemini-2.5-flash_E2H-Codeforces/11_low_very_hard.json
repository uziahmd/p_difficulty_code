A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Soft Drinking Problem in Python**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. Let's see... the core of it is figuring out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given limited resources. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: the number of friends (`n`), the drink details (`k`, `l`), lime details (`c`, `d`), salt details (`p`), and the per-friend requirements (`nl`, `np`).\n\nThe goal is to maximize toasts, but *all* friends have to have the same number of toasts. So, it's about the *minimum* resource limiting *all* the friends. \n\nLet's break it down by resource:\n\n1.  **Drinks:** I have `k * l` milliliters total drink. Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. So, the maximum toasts based *solely* on drink is `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division).\n2.  **Limes:** I have `c * d` lime slices. Each friend needs 1 slice per toast, so the limit here is simply `c * d` toasts.\n3.  **Salt:** I have `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `np` grams per toast, so the limit here is `p // np`.\n\nNow, each of these calculations gives me a maximum number of *individual* toasts. But, I can't have more toasts than the *minimum* limit across all resources. So, I need the `min` of these three values: `min((k * l) // nl, c * d, p // np)`. This gives me the maximum number of total *individual* toasts *before* considering the number of friends.\n\nSince each friend gets the same number of toasts, I need to distribute this maximum among the friends. So, I just divide the `min` value by the number of friends, `n`. However, I need to ensure this is an integer value, so I'll also do an integer division by `n`: `(min((k * l) // nl, c * d, p // np)) // n`.\n\nThat seems like the correct logic, so I'll implement this into a Python script and submit the solution.\n",
