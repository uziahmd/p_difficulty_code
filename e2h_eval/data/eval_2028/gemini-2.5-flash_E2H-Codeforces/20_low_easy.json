    "thought": "**Breaking Down a Challenging Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and the core challenge is clear: I need to figure out how many different ways I can select these `c_s` values so that the biggest possible \"beautiful multiset\" has a specific size, `f`. That's the target.\n\nFirst, I need to fully grasp what a \"beautiful multiset\" actually *is* and how its maximum size is even determined. It involves a multiset of binary strings, all of the same length, `n`. The \"beautiful\" part means that, for any possible binary string `s` (of length anywhere from 1 up to `n`), the count of strings in the multiset that start with `s` as a prefix can't exceed this pre-defined value `c_s`.\n\nInitially, I thought about using a dynamic programming approach with a trie (binary tree), with a state like `dp[L][count]`, where `L` is the length of the string represented by the current node, and `count` is the number of strings that have that node's string as a prefix. But this isn't quite the right direction. The `c_s` values are fixed for a certain selection. The goal is to discover the maximum size of a beautiful multiset given the conditions described by those `c_s` values.\n\nIt's all about constraints. I have a multiset, `M`, of binary strings, length `n`. For any string `s` (short or full length), the count of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix can't exceed `c_s`. If `s` is a prefix of some `s0` and `s1`, `count(s)` equals `count(s0) + count(s1)`. This applies to all prefixes. For a string `s` of length `L < n`, `count(s)` is the sum of counts of length `n` strings with `s` as a prefix. For the full length strings, `count(s)` is simply the number of times `s` appears. This is key. The central constraint is that the counts related to prefixes cannot exceed the associated `c_s` value. It is this constraint that determines if a multiset is \"beautiful\".\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. The chosen $c_s$ values must be between $0$ and $k$ inclusive.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of $c_s$ values.\nA multiset of binary strings of length $n$ is beautiful if for every binary string $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, the number of strings in the multiset for which $s$ is a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\nLet $N(s)$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe conditions are $N(s) \\le c_s$ for all $s$ of length $1$ to $n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$, where $s0$ and $s1$ are $s$ followed by '0' and '1' respectively.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)$ is the number of times $s$ itself appears in the multiset.\nThe total size of the multiset is $N(\\text{empty string})$. However, the problem statement says \"length from 1 to n\", so $N(\\text{empty string})$ is not directly constrained by $c_s$.\nThe total number of strings of length $n$ in the multiset is $N(\\text{empty string})$.\nThe conditions $N(s) \\le c_s$ imply $N(s) \\le \\min(c_s, c_{s0} + c_{s1})$ if $s0, s1$ are children of $s$. This is not how it works.\nThe conditions are $N(s) \\le c_s$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is limited by the $c_s$ values.\nConsider the strings of length $n$. For each string $t$ of length $n$, it must satisfy $N(t) \\le c_t$.\nAlso, for any prefix $s$ of $t$, $N(s) \\le c_s$.\nThe maximum number of times a string $t$ of length $n$ can appear in the multiset is $\\min_{s \\text{ is prefix of } t} c_s$.\nThis is because if $t$ appears $X$ times, then for any prefix $s$ of $t$, $N(s)$ must be at least $X$. (More accurately, $N(s)$ is the sum of counts of all strings in the subtree of $s$, so $N(s) \\ge X$).\nHowever, this interpretation is incorrect. The constraints $N(s) \\le c_s$ are on the *sum* of counts in the subtree.\nThe actual maximum size of a multiset is determined by a flow problem or by a greedy approach.\nIt is known that the maximum number of strings in a multiset that satisfy these prefix sum constraints is $\\sum_{s \\text{ of length } n} (\\text{number of times } s \\text{ appears})$.\nThis can be maximized by ensuring that for each string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))$.\nThe maximum size of the multiset is $N(\\text{root})$. The \"root\" here is the conceptual empty string.\nThe value $N(\\text{empty string})$ is $\\min(c_{\\text{empty string}}, N(0) + N(1))$ if $c_{\\text{empty string}}$ was defined.\nSince $c_s$ is defined for $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, the total count is $\\min(N(0)+N(1), \\text{some overall limit})$.\nThe total count of strings of length $n$ in the multiset is $N(0)+N(1)$.\nThis value $N(s)$ for any string $s$ can be calculated recursively:\nFor $s$ of length $n$: $N(s) = c_s$. (This is the maximum number of times $s$ can appear).\nFor $s$ of length $L < n$: $N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $N(0) + N(1)$ (the sum of counts for the two strings of length 1).\nLet $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ in a specific subtree, such that the maximum total count for that subtree is $\\text{val}$.\nThe total count for a subtree rooted at $s$ (string of length $L$) is $N(s)$.\nThe constraints $c_s$ are chosen for each string $s$ independently (within the $0 \\dots k$ range).\nLet $dp[L][v]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ values for all strings $t$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that $N(s) = v$.\nThe base case is $L=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s) = c_s$. We need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$. So, $N(s)$ can be any value from $0$ to $k$.\nFor $L=n$, $dp[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFor $L < n$:\nTo calculate $dp[L][v]$, we consider a string $s$ of length $L$. Its children are $s0$ and $s1$.\nWe need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nWe need to choose $c_t$ for descendants of $s0$ such that $N(s0) = v_0$.\nWe need to choose $c_t$ for descendants of $s1$ such that $N(s1) = v_1$.\nThen $N(s) = \\min(c_s, v_0 + v_1)$. We want this to be $v$.\nSo, $v = \\min(c_s, v_0 + v_1)$.\nThis implies $v \\le c_s$ and $v \\le v_0 + v_1$. Also, if $v = v_0 + v_1$, then $c_s \\ge v_0 + v_1$. If $v < v_0 + v_1$, then $c_s = v$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $N(s0)=v_0$ is $dp[L+1][v_0]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $N(s1)=v_1$ is $dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nThus, for a fixed $c_s$, $v_0$, $v_1$:\nIf $v_0+v_1 < c_s$: $N(s) = v_0+v_1$.\nIf $v_0+v_1 \\ge c_s$: $N(s) = c_s$.\n\nThis DP state is for a single string $s$. Since all strings of the same length are symmetric, we can compute $dp[L][v]$ for one such string, and it applies to all $2^L$ strings of length $L$.\nLet $dp[L][v]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ for descendants of a string $s$ of length $L-1$ (including $s$ itself) such that $N(s) = v$.\nThe maximum possible value for $N(s)$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet $S_L$ be the maximum possible value for $N(s)$ for a string $s$ of length $L$.\n$S_n = k$.\n$S_{L} = \\min(k, S_{L+1} + S_{L+1}) = \\min(k, 2 \\cdot S_{L+1})$.\n$S_L = \\min(k, 2^{n-L} \\cdot k)$. The maximum value for $N(s)$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $f$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ (for length 1 strings $0$ and $1$).\nSince $n \\le 15$, $k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2^{n-1} \\cdot k$ can be up to $2^{14} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 = 16384 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\approx 3.2 \\cdot 10^9$. This is too large for the DP state.\n\nNotice that the constraints $c_s$ are chosen for strings of length $1$ to $n$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $N(0) + N(1)$.\nLet $dp[L][v]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ for strings $t$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are *descendants of some specific string of length $L-1$*, such that the max count in that subtree is $v$.\nThe base case $L=n$: For a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)=c_s$. We choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$. So $dp[n][v]=1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nFor $L < n$:\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{v_0=0}^{S_{L+1}} \\sum_{v_1=0}^{S_{L+1}} [ \\min(c_s, v_0+v_1) = v ] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nThe sum $v_0+v_1$ can go up to $2 \\cdot S_{L+1}$.\nThe maximum value of $v$ is $S_L$.\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{v_0=0}^{S_{L+1}} \\sum_{v_1=0}^{S_{L+1}} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1] \\cdot (\\text{count of } c_s \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)=v)$.\nLet $S = v_0+v_1$.\nIf $v < S$: we need $c_s = v$. There is 1 choice for $c_s$.\nIf $v = S$: we need $c_s \\ge S$. There are $k-S+1$ choices for $c_s$ (from $S$ to $k$).\nIf $v > S$: this case is impossible, as $v = \\min(c_s, S)$ cannot be greater than $S$.\n\nSo, $dp[L][v] = \\sum_{v_0=0}^{S_{L+1}} \\sum_{v_1=0}^{S_{L+1}} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1] \\cdot \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } v = v_0+v_1 \\text{ and } v < S_{L+1} \\\\ k-(v_0+v_1)+1 & \\text{if } v = v_0+v_1 \\text{ and } v_0+v_1 \\le k \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } v < v_0+v_1 \\text{ and } c_s=v \\end{cases}$\nLet's rewrite the coefficient for $dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$:\nIf $v = v_0+v_1$: The number of choices for $c_s$ is $k-(v_0+v_1)+1$. (This is valid if $v_0+v_1 \\le k$).\nIf $v < v_0+v_1$: The number of choices for $c_s$ is $1$ (namely $c_s=v$). This is valid if $v \\le k$.\n\nLet $P[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$. This is a convolution.\nLet $DP_{next}$ be $dp[L+1]$ and $DP_{curr}$ be $dp[L]$.\n$P = DP_{next} * DP_{next}$.\n$DP_{curr}[v] = \\left( \\sum_{x=v+1}^{2 \\cdot S_{L+1}} P[x] \\right) \\cdot 1 + P[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)$.\nThe sum is for $x \\le k$.\n$DP_{curr}[v] = \\sum_{x=v+1}^{\\min(k, 2 \\cdot S_{L+1})} P[x] + P[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)$.\nThis is valid for $v \\le k$. If $v > k$, $DP_{curr}[v]=0$.\n\nThe maximum value for $v$ in $dp[L][v]$ is $\\min(k, 2^{n-L} \\cdot k)$.\nFor $L=1$, $v$ can go up to $\\min(k, 2^{n-1} \\cdot k)$.\nIf $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, then $S_1 = \\min(k, 2^{14}k) = k = 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThis means $2^{n-L} \\cdot k$ is very large, so the $\\min$ is always $k$.\nSo for $n=15$, $S_L = k$ for all $L$.\nThe maximum value for $f$ is $k$.\nThe final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nLet's recheck $S_L$.\n$S_n = k$.\n$S_{n-1} = \\min(k, S_n+S_n) = \\min(k, 2k)$.\nIf $k < 2k$ (which is true for $k \\ge 1$), then $S_{n-1}=k$.\n$S_{n-2} = \\min(k, S_{n-1}+S_{n-1}) = \\min(k, 2k) = k$.\n...\nThis continues until $2^{n-L} \\cdot k$ becomes greater than $k$. This is true for $n-L \\ge 1$.\nSo $S_L = k$ for all $L \\le n$. The maximum value for $f$ is $k$.\nThis simplifies the DP state. The maximum value for $v$ in $dp[L][v]$ is always $k$.\n\nThe convolution $P = DP_{next} * DP_{next}$ can be computed using FFT/NTT.\nThe size of the arrays is $k+1$. $k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nFFT/NTT for $k$ elements takes $O(k \\log k)$.\nThere are $n$ levels of DP. Total time $O(n \\cdot k \\log k)$.\n$n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This is feasible.\n\nModulo is $998244353$, which is a prime suitable for NTT.\n\nLet $dp[v]$ be the current DP array (for length $L+1$). We want to compute $dp_{new}[v]$ (for length $L$).\n$dp[v]$ represents counts for $N(s0)$ or $N(s1)$.\nThe values $v_0, v_1$ range from $0$ to $k$.\n$P[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} dp[v_0] \\cdot dp[v_1]$ for $x \\in [0, 2k]$.\n$dp_{new}[v] = \\sum_{x=v+1}^{2k} P[x] + P[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)$.\nNote that $P[x]$ is only non-zero for $x \\le 2k$.\nAlso, $dp_{new}[v]$ is only non-zero for $v \\le k$.\nSo, $dp_{new}[v] = \\sum_{x=v+1}^{k} P[x] + P[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)$. (Since $v \\le k$, $v+1 \\le k+1$, so $x$ can't go up to $2k$ in the sum part).\nThis simplification is correct because $N(s)$ cannot exceed $k$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{x=v+1}^{k} P[x]$ can be computed efficiently using suffix sums.\nLet $SufP[y] = \\sum_{x=y}^{k} P[x]$.\nThen $\\sum_{x=v+1}^{k} P[x] = SufP[v+1]$.\nSo, $dp_{new}[v] = (SufP[v+1] + P[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nInitial step: $L=n$. $dp[v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nLoop from $L=n-1$ down to $1$:\n1. Compute $P = dp * dp$ using NTT. $P$ will have size $2k+1$.\n2. Compute suffix sums $SufP$. $SufP[k+1]=0$. For $y=k$ down to $0$, $SufP[y] = (SufP[y+1] + P[y]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n3. Compute $dp_{new}$. For $v=0$ to $k$:\n   $dp_{new}[v] = (SufP[v+1] + P[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n   If $v > k$, $dp_{new}[v]=0$.\n4. Update $dp = dp_{new}$.\n\nAfter the loop, $dp[f]$ is the answer.\n\nExample 1: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$L=1$. Base case is $L=n=1$.\n$dp[v]=1$ for $0 \\le v \\le 42$.\nThe problem asks for $N(0)+N(1)$.\nHere $n=1$. $s$ is length 1. $N(s)=c_s$.\nThe multiset strings are of length 1.\n$N(0)=c_0$, $N(1)=c_1$.\nThe total size is $N(0)+N(1) = c_0+c_1$.\nWe need $c_0+c_1 = f$.\n$c_0 \\in [0,k]$, $c_1 \\in [0,k]$.\nNumber of ways to choose $c_0, c_1$ such that $c_0+c_1=f$.\nThis is $f+1$ if $f \\le k$.\nIf $f > k$, it's $2k-f+1$.\nIf $f \\le k$: $c_0=0, c_1=f$; $c_0=1, c_1=f-1$; ...; $c_0=f, c_1=0$. There are $f+1$ ways.\nIf $k < f \\le 2k$: $c_0=f-k, c_1=k$; ...; $c_0=k, c_1=f-k$. Number of ways is $k-(f-k)+1 = 2k-f+1$.\nFor $n=1, k=42, f=2$: $f \\le k$, so $2+1=3$ ways. Correct.\n\nMy DP definition for $N(s)$ is for a specific string $s$. The final answer requires $N(0)+N(1)$.\nThis means my DP should go one level deeper.\nLet $dp[L][v]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ for all strings $t$ of length $L$ to $n$ in a specific subtree, such that $N(s)=v$ where $s$ is the root of that subtree.\nWe need $N(0)+N(1)=f$.\nThe calculation $dp[L][v]$ is for one node.\nAfter $n-1$ levels of DP, we have $dp[1][v]$ for strings \"0\" and \"1\".\nThe total number of ways to choose $c_s$ for $s$ of length 1 to $n$ is:\n$\\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=0}^k [v_0+v_1=f] \\cdot dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\nThis is exactly $P[f]$ from the last convolution $dp[1]*dp[1]$.\nSo the final answer is $P[f]$ where $P$ is the result of $dp[1]*dp[1]$.\nThe loop should run $n-1$ times.\nInitial $dp$ for $L=n$: $dp[v]=1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nAfter $n-1$ iterations, $dp$ will contain the values for length 1 strings.\nThe final convolution $P = dp * dp$ (where $dp$ is for length 1 strings).\nThen the answer is $P[f]$.\n\nCorrected DP loop:\n`current_dp` array of size $k+1$. Initialize `current_dp[v] = 1` for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nFor `_` from $1$ to $n-1$: (This means $n-1$ iterations for $L = n-1, n-2, \\dots, 1$)\n  1. Compute `P = current_dp * current_dp` using NTT. `P` has size $2k+1$.\n  2. Compute suffix sums `SufP`. `SufP[2k+1]=0`. For $y=2k$ down to $0$, `SufP[y] = (SufP[y+1] + P[y]) % MOD`. (Actually, we only need $SufP[y]$ up to $y=k+1$, so $y$ from $k$ down to $0$).\n     `SufP` array of size $k+2$. `SufP[k+1]=0`. For $y=k$ down to $0$: `SufP[y] = (SufP[y+1] + P[y]) % MOD`.\n  3. Create `next_dp` array of size $k+1$. For $v=0$ to $k$:\n     `next_dp[v] = (SufP[v+1] + P[v] * (k-v+1)) % MOD`.\n  4. Set `current_dp = next_dp`.\nAfter the loop, `current_dp` holds $dp[1]$ values.\nFinal step: Compute $P_{final} = current_dp * current_dp$ using NTT.\nThe answer is $P_{final}[f]$.\n\nMaximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe length of $P$ is $2k+1$, so $P[f]$ is well-defined.\n\nConsider the case $n=1$. The loop `for _ from 1 to n-1` does not run.\n`current_dp` is initialized with $dp[v]=1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nThen $P_{final} = current_dp * current_dp$.\n$P_{final}[f] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=f} current_dp[v_0] \\cdot current_dp[v_1]$.\nSince $current_dp[v]=1$ for $v \\in [0,k]$ and $0$ otherwise:\n$P_{final}[f] = \\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=0}^k [v_0+v_1=f] \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$.\nThis is the number of pairs $(v_0, v_1)$ such that $0 \\le v_0 \\le k$, $0 \\le v_1 \\le k$, and $v_0+v_1=f$.\nThis is exactly the formula derived for $n=1$:\nIf $f \\le k$, $f+1$ ways.\nIf $k < f \\le 2k$, $2k-f+1$ ways.\nThis matches the example for $n=1, k=42, f=2$. $P_{final}[2] = 2+1=3$.\n\nThe NTT implementation needs to be careful with array sizes and roots.\nThe size for NTT should be a power of 2, greater than or equal to $2k+1$.\nFor $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k+1 = 400001$. The next power of 2 is $2^{19} = 524288$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT = 3  # Primitive root modulo MOD\n\n# Function for modular exponentiation (a^b % mod)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function for modular inverse (a^(mod-2) % mod)\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# NTT implementation\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        wlen = power(ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half))\n        if invert:\n            wlen = inv(wlen)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for k_idx in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + k_idx]\n                v = (a[i + k_idx + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k_idx] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k_idx + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n    return a\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef poly_mul(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to result_len\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials with zeros\n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    fft_a = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    fft_b = ntt(b_padded, False)\n\n    # Point-wise multiplication\n    fft_res = [(fft_a[i] * fft_b[i]) % MOD for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Inverse NTT\n    res_padded = ntt(fft_res, True)\n\n    return res_padded[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[v] stores the number of ways to choose c_s values for a subtree\n    # such that the max count for that subtree is v.\n    # Initial state: L=n.
