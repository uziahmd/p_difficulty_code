Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I've been given this \"Array Stabilization\" problem, which seems pretty straightforward on the surface, but requires a clever approach to optimize for performance. The goal is to minimize the instability of an array after removing a single element. Instability is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\nMy initial understanding is that the input will be an array of integers, let's call it `a`, and its size `n`. The key constraint here is that `n` can be up to 10^5, and the elements themselves can be up to 10^5. This tells me that I need an efficient solution, likely linear or near-linear time complexity, to avoid Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) issues.\n\nI've worked through some example cases, which helps solidify the problem and gives some intuition. Removing the largest element will make the new maximum the second-largest, and removing the smallest will make the new minimum the second-smallest. The question becomes how to find the minimum of those instabilities. It's becoming clearer that sorting the array is a crucial step.\n\nMy key observation is that to minimize instability, I need to focus on influencing the maximum and minimum values. After sorting the array, let's call the sorted array `a_sorted`, the difference between `a_sorted[n-1]` and `a_sorted[0]` will be the original instability. To minimize this, I need to either decrease the maximum (by removing the original maximum) or increase the minimum (by removing the original minimum). Or, perhaps, removing an element in between will be the best option.\n\nLet `a_sorted = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]` where `s_1` is the smallest and `s_n` is the largest. After removing a value, the instability will become: either `s_n - s_2`, if I remove `s_1`, or `s_{n-1} - s_1` if I remove `s_n`. It can be shown that those two cases are the best cases. Thus, by comparing `s_n - s_2` and `s_{n-1} - s_1`, I can determine the minimum possible instability, which will be the answer to the problem. The idea is to sort the array and then calculate both potential instabilities, and take the smallest one. This looks like a solid, efficient approach that should handle the given constraints without any issues. I should be able to whip up a Python script to do this now.\n",
