The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this problem of figuring out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, and I'm breaking it down methodically.  The core of it is understanding how the dimensions of the plate and the rings interact.\n\nEssentially, I've got a plate defined by its width (`w`) and height (`h`).  There are `k` rings, and each ring is just a border of cells on an inner rectangle. The first ring's outer border is at the edge of the plate.\n\nEach subsequent ring is formed by an inner rectangle with progressively smaller dimensions because each ring is 2 cells away from the next, so the inner rectangle is two cells smaller on each side for each ring. The inner rectangle of the `i`-th ring is of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.\n\nI'm thinking, for the `i`-th ring, the width (`w_i`) will be `w - 4(i - 1)` and the height (`h_i`) will be `h - 4(i - 1)`. I *could* calculate the number of border cells for each ring with the formula `2 * (w_i + h_i) - 4`, that's the standard formula. But here's the catch: the inner rectangle *must* have positive dimensions for this formula to be correct and to avoid any edge cases. What if the inner rectangle shrinks to almost nothing?\n\nSo, I'm considering edge cases. If `w_i` or `h_i` becomes less than or equal to 1, I need to account for it differently, and the border cell calculation is not straightforward.  A rectangle's border cells are only correctly calculated with that formula if both width and height are at least 2.\n\nI need to re-evaluate how to count border cells. If either dimension is zero or negative, the number of cells is zero. If one of the dimensions is 1, the number of border cells will just be the length of the other dimension.  Otherwise, I can use the classic border cell formula.\n\nEssentially, I'm planning to craft a Python script that iterates through each ring. For each ring, I'll first check if its dimensions are valid (greater than 0) and then calculate the number of border cells appropriately. I'll accumulate these counts to get the total number of gilded cells. I'll need some conditional logic to handle those edge cases. I think I've got a solid plan.\n",
