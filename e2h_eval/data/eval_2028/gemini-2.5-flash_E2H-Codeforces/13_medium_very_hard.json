For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, as an expert in my field:**\n\nFirst, I need to create a mapping from musical notes (C, C#, etc.) to numerical values (0-11) for easier calculation. Then, I'll read the input and convert the notes to their numerical equivalents.  The key is to understand the *cyclic* nature of musical intervals and how to calculate them consistently, always going \"up\" the scale. I'll represent the distance from one note to another using modular arithmetic.\n\nNext, I recognize the importance of handling unordered sets of notes. To classify triads, I must consider all possible arrangements of the three notes. Sorting them numerically first will simplify the distance calculations. Then, I'll calculate the intervals between *adjacent* notes, including the \"wraparound\" distance from the highest note back to the lowest. This results in three intervals that will define the triad's characteristics.\n\nMy plan is to meticulously check for specific interval patterns to classify a triad. I know that major triads follow a 4-3 pattern (or a cyclic permutation thereof), while minor triads follow a 3-4 pattern.  Since there's an unambiguous classification guarantee, I'm confident my approach of exhaustively checking all cyclic permutations of the intervals will work perfectly. I can use modular arithmetic to ensure the distance calculations are correct and handle the cyclic nature of the notes.\n\nI will implement my solution with a Python script, aiming for clarity and efficiency. I'll use a dictionary for the note-to-integer mapping and then carefully calculate the intervals between the sorted notes. Then, I'll use clear `if/elif/else` statements to check the intervals against the major and minor patterns. By considering these steps and checking my logic with examples, I'm certain this solution will be robust and accurate.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a three-note triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given a list of 12 notes that repeat cyclically, and the distance between notes is measured in semitones.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Integers:**\n    First, we need a consistent way to represent the 12 notes numerically. We can assign integers from 0 to 11 to the notes:\n    C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11.\n    This mapping allows us to perform arithmetic operations to calculate distances.\n\n2.  **Calculate Cyclic Distance:**\n    The distance from a note `n1` to a note `n2` (ascending) in semitones is given by `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. This handles the cyclic nature of the notes correctly. For example, the distance from E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8`.\n\n3.  **Process Input Triad:**\n    *   Read the three input note names.\n    *   Convert each note name to its corresponding integer value using our mapping.\n    *   Since a chord is an *unordered* set of notes, we sort these three integer values. Let them be `s1, s2, s3` such that `s1 <= s2 <= s3`.\n\n4.  **Determine Intervals:**\n    With the notes sorted, we can calculate the three intervals that make up the triad in a cyclic order:\n    *   `interval1`: distance from `s1` to `s2` (i.e., `(s2 - s1 + 12) % 12`)\n    *   `interval2`: distance from `s2` to `s3` (i.e., `(s3 - s2 + 12) % 12`)\n    *   `interval3`: distance from `s3` back to `s1` (i.e., `(s1 - s3 + 12) % 12`)\n    These three intervals `[interval1, interval2, interval3]` represent the distances between adjacent notes in the sorted cyclic order. Their sum will always be 12.\n\n5.  **Classify the Triad:**\n    According to the problem definition:\n    *   A **major triad** can be ordered such that the distance between the first two notes is 4 semitones, and the distance between the second and third notes is 3 semitones. This means we are looking for a cyclic sequence of intervals `(4, 3, 5)` (since 4+3+5=12).\n    *   A **minor triad** can be ordered such that the distance between the first two notes is 3 semitones, and the distance between the second and third notes is 4 semitones. This means we are looking for a cyclic sequence of intervals `(3, 4, 5)`.\n\n    We check if any cyclic permutation of our calculated intervals `[interval1, interval2, interval3]` matches `(4, 3)` for major or `(3, 4)` for minor. The cyclic pairs to check are `(interval1, interval2)`, `(interval2, interval3)`, and `(interval3, interval1)`.\n\n    The problem guarantees that the answer will be unambiguous (a chord cannot be both major and minor simultaneously).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (C E G):**\n1.  Notes: C, E, G\n2.  Integer values: C=0, E=4, G=7\n3.  Sorted values: `s1=0, s2=4, s3=7`\n4.  Intervals:\n    *   `interval1 = (4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   `interval2 = (7 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   `interval3 = (0 - 7 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n    The cyclic intervals are `[4, 3, 5]`.\n5.  Classification:\n    *   Check for major: Is `(interval1, interval2)` equal to `(4, 3)`? Yes, `(4, 3)`. So, it's a major triad.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (C# B F):**\n1.  Notes: C#, B, F\n2.  Integer values: C#=1, B=10, F=5\n3.  Sorted values: `s1=1, s2=5, s3=10`\n4.  Intervals:\n    *   `interval1 = (5 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   `interval2 = (10 - 5 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n    *   `interval3 = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    The cyclic intervals are `[4, 5, 3]`.\n5.  Classification:\n    *   Check for major: Is `(4,5)` or `(5,3)` or `(3,4)` equal to `(4,3)`? No.\n    *   Check for minor: Is `(4,5)` or `(5,3)` or `(3,4)` equal to `(3,4)`? Yes, `(interval3, interval1)` is `(3,4)`. So, it's a minor triad.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Mapping of note names to integer values (0-11)\n    note_to_int = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    # Read the three space-separated notes from standard input\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert note names to their integer values and sort them\n    # Sorting ensures we have a consistent order (s1 <= s2 <= s3)\n    notes_val = [note_to_int[n] for n in notes_str]\n    notes_val.sort()\n\n    # Extract the sorted note values\n    s1, s2, s3 = notes_val[0], notes_val[1], notes_val[2]\n\n    # Calculate the three cyclic intervals between the sorted notes.\n    # The distance is always taken from the lower tone to the upper tone.\n    # (n2 - n1 + 12) % 12 correctly calculates this cyclic distance.\n    intervals = []\n    intervals.append((s2 - s1 + 12) % 12) # Interval from s1 to s2\n    intervals.append((s3 - s2 + 12) % 12) # Interval from s2 to s3\n    intervals.append((s1 - s3 + 12) % 12) # Interval from s3 back to s1 (wraps around)\n\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n\n    # Check for major triad pattern: (4 semitones, then 3 semitones)\n    # This pattern can start from any of the three notes in the cycle.\n    # We check all three possible starting points: (i1,i2), (i2,i3), and (i3,i1).\n    if (intervals[0] == 4 and intervals[1] == 3) or \\\n       (intervals[1] == 4 and intervals[2] == 3) or \\\n       (intervals[2] == 4 and intervals[0] == 3):\n        is_major = True\n\n    # Check for minor triad pattern: (3 semitones, then 4 semitones)\n    # Similar to major, check all three possible cyclic starting points.\n    if (intervals[0] == 3 and intervals[1] == 4) or \\\n       (intervals[1] == 3 and intervals[2] == 4) or \\\n       (intervals[2] == 3 and intervals[0] == 4):\n        is_minor = True\n\n    # Print the classification based on the checks.\n    # The problem guarantees unambiguous classification.\n    if is_major:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"major\\n\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"minor\\n\")\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"strange\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
