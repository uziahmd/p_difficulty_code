He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem: find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. My initial thought process is to break this down. The key is to understand how those zeroes come about. I immediately recall that trailing zeroes are a result of factors of 10. Since 10 is 2 * 5, the number of trailing zeroes will be dictated by the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`. However, the number of 2s will always exceed the number of 5s. So, it boils down to counting the factors of 5.\n\nThis leads me to Legendre's formula. I'll use it to calculate the number of factors of 5 in `n!`, which is essentially the number of trailing zeroes, represented as `Z(n)`.  The formula is: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` and so on, until the denominator becomes greater than `n`.\n\nNow, the core of the problem becomes finding `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. I need to analyze `Z(n)`'s behavior. I can see that `Z(n)` is non-decreasing; as `n` increases, the number of trailing zeroes either stays the same or increases. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n\nI'm starting to visualize this. `Z(n)` essentially \"jumps\" at multiples of 5. The size of the jump depends on the power of 5 present in that number.  If `n+1` is a multiple of 5, the increase in `Z(n)` will be the valuation of 5 in `n+1` (the power of 5). For example, going from 4! to 5!, it increases by 1. But going from 24! to 25!, it increases by 2.\n\nThis jump behavior is the crucial aspect of the problem. It means that there might be gaps in possible values of `Z(n)`. For example, there could be an `m` for which no solution for `n` exists. It means that there may be multiple values of `n` that produce the same number of trailing zeroes. I'll need to account for this non-linearity in my approach to find all valid `n` values.  I see a path now; I need to find where the jumps are happening. I am now thinking to generate all possible n values for a given m, and return them, or if there are none, return none.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is given by Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum counts the total number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`.\n\nThe function `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nSpecifically, `Z(n)` remains constant for `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` if `n` is a multiple of 5 (e.g., `Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1`).\nWhen `n` is a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases. For example, `Z(4)=0`, `Z(5)=1`. `Z(9)=1`, `Z(10)=2`. `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`.\n\nThis means that if `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4)` will also be equal to `m` (provided they don't reach the next multiple of 5 that causes `Z` to jump beyond `m`).\nSpecifically, for any `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, the values `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are candidates, as long as their `Z` value is still `m`. The next multiple of 5, `n'`, will cause `Z(n')` to be `m + v_5(n')` where `v_5(n')` is the number of factors of 5 in `n'`. This means `Z(n')` will be at least `m+1`.\nTherefore, if `Z(n) = m`, then all integers `x` such that `n <= x < n + 5` and `Z(x) = m` are solutions. There can be at most 5 such integers.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1. Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n2. The maximum value for `m` is 100,000. Let's estimate the range for `n`.\n   `Z(n) approx n/4` (roughly, because `n/5 + n/25 + ... = n * (1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = n * ( (1/5) / (1 - 1/5) ) = n * (1/4)`).\n   So, if `m = 100,000`, `n` would be approximately `4 * 100,000 = 400,000`.\n   A safe upper bound for binary search could be `5 * m + 5` or `500,000`. Let's use `5 * m`.\n3. After finding the smallest `n_0` such that `Z(n_0) >= m`:\n   - If `Z(n_0) > m`, then there is no `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. This happens if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` \"jumps over\" (e.g., `m=5`, when `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`). In this case, the count `k` is 0.\n   - If `Z(n_0) = m`, then `n_0` is the smallest solution. All subsequent values `n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4` will also have `Z` values equal to `m`, because the next multiple of 5 will increase the number of zeroes. So, `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4` are all solutions. The count `k` is 5.\n\nLet's implement the `count_trailing_zeroes` function and then use binary search.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n is 5*m, since Z(n) is approximately n/4.\n    # For m=100000, n approx 400000. 5*m = 500000 is a good upper bound.\n    high = 5 * m + 5 # Add a small buffer just in case\n    ans_n = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if zeroes >= m:\n            ans_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    \n    # After binary search, ans_n is the smallest integer such that Z(ans_n) >= m.\n    # If no such n exists (e.g., m=0, but problem says m >= 1), ans_n might remain -1.\n    # For m >= 1, ans_n will always be found.\n\n    if ans_n == -1 or count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) != m:\n        # If Z(ans_n) is strictly greater than m, it means m is skipped.\n        # Example: m=5.
