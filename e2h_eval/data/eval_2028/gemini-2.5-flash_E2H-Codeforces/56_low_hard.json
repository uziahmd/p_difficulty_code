Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Guard Duty (easy)\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and my initial thought is: Python is definitely the way to go here. Let's break this down. We have `R` rebel spaceships and `B` bases, and we need to pair them up without any of the lines between them crossing. The key thing that jumps out is `R` and `B` have to be equal. That's a quick check to eliminate a lot of impossible cases. If they aren't equal, we can just say \"No\" and move on.\n\nThe small constraint on the input, with `R` and `B` up to 10, immediately makes me think that an exponential solution, probably based on permutations, could be feasible. With 10 spaceships and 10 bases, that's only 10! or 3.6 million permutations. That's well within the ballpark of a feasible runtime.\n\nSo, here's the plan: First, I read in the coordinates. Then, the simple `R != B` check. After that, I'll generate all the permutations of base assignments using `itertools.permutations`.  For each permutation, I'll form the segments, ship to base. The core of this is the intersection check for each pair of segments. That's the part that needs to be efficient.\n\nI'll need a function `do_segments_intersect` to determine if two segments intersect. The problem statement makes life easier by guaranteeing that no three points are collinear and no two points are coincident. This allows me to use a standard orientation test to check for intersections, which simplifies things. No need to worry about the edge cases.\n\nIf any permutation works (no intersecting segments), I print \"Yes\" and terminate. If I run through all of them and they all produce intersecting lines, then I'll print \"No\". That should do it. It's a straightforward strategy of brute-force and geometric intersection testing, and should be relatively quick to implement.\n",
