And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Average Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the average sleep time from Polycarp's records.  I've got the total number of days, *n*, and the length of each \"week,\" *k*.  The sleep data is in an array, `a`, with *n* elements.  \n\nThe problem boils down to this:  I need to calculate the average sleep across *all* possible weeks. A \"week\" is a consecutive block of *k* days.  Since there are *n* days, and each week is *k* days long, there will be *n - k + 1* weeks.  I need to find the sum of sleep for each of these weeks, then average it.\n\nA naive approach would be slow—loop through each of the *n - k + 1* weeks, summing the sleep for each of the *k* days within that week. That's *O(n*k)* time, which is too slow. I'll need a better strategy.\n\nA sliding window is the way to go here. First, I compute the sum of the sleep times in the first week. Then, for each subsequent week, I can efficiently update the sum by subtracting the sleep time of the day that \"leaves\" the window and adding the sleep time of the new day entering the window. This is an *O(1)* operation per week, making the overall process *O(n)*.\n\nI'll start with calculating the initial window `current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])`. Then I will accumulate the sum from each week into a variable, `total_overall_sum`. The key optimization is realizing that I can update this current sum using `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]` where `i` represents the starting day of each week (after the first week).  `total_overall_sum` will be updated each iteration.  Finally, to get the average, I just divide `total_overall_sum` by `n - k + 1`.\n\nI've carefully checked the edge cases—what if *k* equals *n*?  What if *k* is 1? It looks correct. I double-checked the logic and the sliding window updates are accurate. I'll make sure to output the result to the requested precision (at least 6 digits after the decimal point), which standard Python floating-point precision will handle easily.  The input will be read using `sys.stdin.readline()` and split.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks.\" A week is defined as `k` consecutive days. Given `n` days of sleep records `a1, a2, ..., an`, there are `n - k + 1` possible weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times, and then we need to find the average of these `n - k + 1` weekly sums.\n\nLet's denote the `j`-th week as the sequence of sleep times `a_j, a_{j+1}, ..., a_{j+k-1}` (using 1-based indexing for days). The sum for this week is `S_j = a_j + a_{j+1} + ... + a_{j+k-1}`.\nWe need to calculate `TotalSum = S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}`.\nThe final answer will be `TotalSum / (n - k + 1)`.\n\n**Constraints Analysis:**\n- `1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`\n- `1 <= ai <= 10^5`\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `n - k + 1` weeks and for each week, sum `k` elements. This would result in `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time complexity. In the worst case (e.g., `k` approximately `n/2`), this is `O(n^2)`, which for `n = 2 * 10^5` would be `4 * 10^{10}` operations, far too slow.\n\n**Efficient Approach: Sliding Window**\nWe can use a sliding window technique to calculate the sum of each week in `O(1)` time after the first week's sum is known.\n\n1.  **Calculate the sum of the first week:** Sum the first `k` elements `a[0], ..., a[k-1]` (using 0-based indexing). Let this be `current_week_sum`. This takes `O(k)` time.\n2.  **Initialize `total_overall_sum`:** Set `total_overall_sum = current_week_sum`.\n3.  **Slide the window:** For subsequent weeks, we can update `current_week_sum` efficiently.\n    For the week starting at index `i` (i.e., `a[i], ..., a[i+k-1]`), its sum can be derived from the previous week's sum (starting at `i-1`, i.e., `a[i-1], ..., a[i+k-2]`) by:\n    `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n    This operation takes `O(1)` time.\n    We perform this update for `i` from `1` up to `n - k`. In each step, we add the new `current_week_sum` to `total_overall_sum`.\n\nThe total time complexity will be `O(k)` for the first sum plus `O(n - k)` for the remaining `n - k` weeks, which simplifies to `O(n)`. This is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet `n = 3, k = 2, a = [3, 4, 7]`\n\n1.  **First week:** `a[0:2] = [3, 4]`.\n    `current_week_sum = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n    `total_overall_sum = 7`.\n\n2.  **Loop for `i` from `1` to `n - k = 3 - 2 = 1`:**\n    *   **`i = 1`:**\n        The previous week started at `i-1 = 0`. The current week starts at `i = 1`.\n        `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n        `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n        `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n        `current_week_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`. (This is the sum of `[4, 7]`)\n        `total_overall_sum = total_overall_sum + current_week_sum = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n\n3.  **Loop ends.**\n    The total number of weeks is `n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n    The average is `total_overall_sum / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\nThis matches the example output. The maximum value for `total_overall_sum` can be up to `(n - k + 1) * k * max(a_i)`, which is approximately `2*10^5 * 2*10^5 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^{15}`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this without overflow. The final division results in a float, which Python handles with sufficient precision for the `10^-6` error tolerance.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read n and k from the first line of input\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n# Read the list of sleep times 'a' from the second line of input\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the first window (week) of 'k' days.\n# This corresponds to days a[0] through a[k-1] in 0-based indexing.\ncurrent_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\n# Initialize total_overall_sum with the sum of the first week.\n# This variable will accumulate the sums of all (n - k + 1) weeks.\ntotal_overall_sum = current_week_sum\n\n# Use a sliding window approach to calculate the sums for the remaining weeks.\n# The loop iterates from the second week (starting at index 1) up to the last week (starting at index n-k).\n# The range function generates numbers from 1 up to (n - k + 1) - 1, which is n-k.\nfor i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n    # To get the sum of the current week (starting at index 'i') from the sum of the previous week (starting at 'i-1'):\n    # 1.
