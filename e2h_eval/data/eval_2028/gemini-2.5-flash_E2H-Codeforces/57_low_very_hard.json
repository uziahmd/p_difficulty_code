His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Finding Vasya's Best and Worst Olympiad Rank: A Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in this Olympiad. I've got the total number of participants, `n`, the minimum score Vasya achieved, `x`, and lists of scores from the two tours, `a` and `b`. The tricky part is, I don't know which scores from list `a` correspond to which scores from list `b`. Each participant has a score from each tour, and I need to find the optimal assignment of those scores to participants to determine Vasya's best and worst-case scenarios.\n\nSince ranks are based on the total score, I'm focusing on finding the assignment of scores that leads to the highest and lowest possible total score for Vasya, relative to everyone else. To get his *best* rank, I need to maximize Vasya's score and minimize the scores of all other participants.  I know Vasya's total score has to be at least `x`.\n\nMy strategy is this: to find the best possible rank, I want to give Vasya the highest total score, or at least a score equal to the highest one. I'm sorting the `a` and `b` lists to help me identify the largest potential sums. I need to make sure I don't double-count a score or leave any out, so an assignment is crucial. Ultimately, I'm looking for the assignment that gives Vasya the highest possible score compared to the rest of the group.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, their scores in two tours (lists `a` and `b`), and the knowledge that Vasya's total score is at least `x`. The key challenge is that we don't know which first-tour score corresponds to which second-tour score; we must form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` using each score exactly once. Ranks are determined by total score, with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\nLet's analyze the best and worst-case scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n**1. Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\nTo achieve the best possible rank (ideally 1st place), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and/or minimize the scores of other participants.\nSince the jury can assign places arbitrarily for ties, if Vasya's score is among the highest, he can be assigned the best rank among those with that score.\nTo get rank 1, Vasya's total score must be greater than or equal to all other participants' total scores.\nConsider the strategy to maximize Vasya's score: Vasya should take the largest available score from list `a` and the largest available score from list `b`. Let these be `max(a)` and `max(b)`. If `max(a) + max(b) >= x`, Vasya can achieve this score.\nCan we always make Vasya get rank 1?\nYes. We can always pair the largest `a_i` with the largest `b_j` to maximize one participant's score. Let this be Vasya.\nSuppose `a_k` is the largest score in `a` and `b_l` is the largest score in `b`. If `a_k + b_l >= x`, we can assign these to Vasya. For the remaining `n-1` participants, we pair the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `b`. The specific pairing for others doesn't matter for Vasya's rank if he has the absolute highest score.\nIf Vasya takes `a_k + b_l`, his score is `S_vasya = a_k + b_l`.\nFor any other participant, their score `S_other = a_p + b_q` where `a_p \\neq a_k` and `b_q \\neq b_l`.\nSince `a_k` and `b_l` are the maximums, `S_vasya` will be greater than or equal to any other `a_p + b_q` if we pair `a_k` with `b_l` and then pair the remaining `a` values with `b` values.\nThus, Vasya can always achieve rank 1 by taking the highest available `a_i` and `b_j` (as long as their sum is at least `x`, which is guaranteed by the problem statement for *some* pair). The problem guarantees that *some* `a_i + b_j >= x`. We can always pick the largest `a_i` and largest `b_j` and assign them to Vasya. This will give him the highest possible score `max(a) + max(b)`. No other participant can achieve a higher score. Due to arbitrary tie-breaking, Vasya can be assigned rank 1.\nSo, the best possible rank for Vasya is always **1**.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\nTo find the worst possible rank, we want to minimize Vasya's score (while still being at least `x`) and/or maximize the scores of other participants.\nThis requires a specific pairing strategy. We need to find an assignment of `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that:\n1. Each `a_i` and `b_j` is used exactly once.\n2. One pair `(A_vasya, B_vasya)` belongs to Vasya, and `A_vasya + B_vasya >= x`.\n3. The number of participants with a total score strictly greater than Vasya's score is maximized.\n4. If there are other participants with the same score as Vasya, they are ranked higher than Vasya.\n\nLet's sort both arrays `a` and `b` in ascending order.\nTo maximize the scores of *other* participants, we can try to form `n-1` high-scoring pairs for them.\nConsider pairing `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}`. This is a common strategy to make sums relatively balanced or to create a specific distribution.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_0 <= a_1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}`.\nLet's sort `b` in descending order: `b_0 >= b_1 >= ... >= b_{n-1}`.\nNow, consider pairing `a_i` with `b_i`. This pairing `(a_i, b_i)` for all `i` tends to create sums that are somewhat balanced (e.g., `a_0 + b_0` is `min(a) + max(b)`, `a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}` is `max(a) + min(b)`).\nLet's calculate the total scores for all `n` participants using this pairing: `S_i = a_i + b_i`.\nNow, we need to identify which of these `n` pairs could be Vasya's. Vasya's pair `(a_k, b_k)` must satisfy `a_k + b_k >= x`.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank (i.e., make it as large as possible), we should pick `k` such that `S_k = a_k + b_k` is as small as possible, subject to `S_k >= x`.\nAfter finding this `S_k`, we count how many other participants `S_j` (for `j != k`) have `S_j > S_k`. Let this count be `C_greater`.\nThen, we count how many other participants `S_j` (for `j != k`) have `S_j == S_k`. Let this count be `C_equal`.\nVasya's worst rank would then be `C_greater + C_equal + 1` (because all `C_greater` people are strictly better, and all `C_equal` people can be ranked better than Vasya due to arbitrary tie-breaking, plus Vasya himself).\n\nWhy is this pairing optimal for finding the worst rank?\nConsider the sorted `a` (ascending) and `b` (descending) arrays.\n`a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`\n`b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}`\nThe sums `S_i = a_i + b_i`.\nIt is a known property that if `a` is sorted ascending and `b` is sorted descending, then the sums `a_i + b_i` are \"mixed\" in a way that minimizes the variation among sums, or rather, it's a specific permutation.\nTo maximize the number of people *above* Vasya, we want to make Vasya's score as low as possible (but still `>= x`) and make as many other scores as high as possible.\nThe \"greedy\" approach of pairing `a_i` with `b_i` (after sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending) creates `n` sums.\nLet's iterate through these sums `S_i = a_i + b_i`. We want to find the smallest `S_i` that is `>= x`. Let this be `S_vasya`.\nOnce we find `S_vasya`, we count how many `S_j` are strictly greater than `S_vasya`, and how many are equal.\nThe worst rank will be `(count of S_j > S_vasya) + (count of S_j == S_vasya) + 1`.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n1. Sort `a` ascending: `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n2. Sort `b` descending: `b = [8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0]`\n\n3. Form pairs `(a_i, b_i)` and calculate sums `S_i`:\n   - `S_0 = a_0 + b_0 = 3 + 8 = 11`\n   - `S_1 = a_1 + b_1 = 4 + 6 = 10`\n   - `S_2 = a_2 + b_2 = 4 + 4 = 8`\n   - `S_3 = a_3 + b_3 = 4 + 4 = 8`\n   - `S_4 = a_4 + b_4 = 5 + 3 = 8`\n   - `S_5 = a_5 + b_5 = 6 + 0 = 6`\n\n4. Filter sums `S_i` that are `>= x` (which is 7):\n   `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8]` (S_5 = 6 is excluded)\n\n5. To find Vasya's worst rank, we pick the smallest sum from the filtered list as Vasya's score: `S_vasya = 8`. (This corresponds to any of `S_2, S_3, S_4`).\n\n6. Count participants with scores strictly greater than `S_vasya = 8`:\n   - `11 > 8` (1 participant)\n   - `10 > 8` (1 participant)\n   Total `C_greater = 2`.\n\n7. Count participants with scores equal to `S_vasya = 8`:\n   - There are three `8`s in the list `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]`. If Vasya takes one of them (say `S_2=8`), then `S_3=8` and `S_4=8` are equal to his score.\n   Total `C_equal = 2`.\n\n8. Worst rank = `C_greater + C_equal + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy works because by pairing `a_i` (ascending) with `b_i` (descending), we create a specific set of `n` sums. It can be shown that this pairing is one of the permutations that allows for maximizing the number of participants whose scores are higher than a given threshold, or minimizing the lowest possible score above a threshold, depending on how you frame it. Essentially, it provides a \"fair\" distribution of scores such that we can find the minimum possible score Vasya could have while still satisfying `x`, and then count how many people could beat him.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Read `n` and `x`.\n- Read list `a` and list `b`.\n- Sort `a` in ascending order.\n- Sort `b` in descending order.\n- Create a list `sums` where `sums[i] = a[i] + b[i]`.\n- Initialize `worst_rank = n`. (This is an upper bound, if Vasya gets the lowest possible score `>= x` and everyone else gets a higher score).\n- Iterate through `sums`:\n    - If `s_i >= x`:\n        - This `s_i` is a candidate for Vasya's score.\n        - Count how many `s_j` in the `sums` list are strictly greater than `s_i`.\n        - Count how many `s_j` in the `sums` list are equal to `s_i` (excluding `s_i` itself).\n        - Calculate `current_rank = C_greater + C_equal + 1`.\n        - Update `worst_rank = max(worst_rank, current_rank)`.\n    This iteration is not quite right. We need to find the `s_i` that results in the *maximum* rank.\n    The `sums` list `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]` is what we get.\n    We need to find the smallest `s_i` that is `>= x`.\n    Let's sort the `sums` list after generating it: `sorted_sums = [6, 8, 8, 8, 10, 11]`.\n    Now, find the first element in `sorted_sums` that is `>= x`.\n    In the example, `x=7`. The first element `>= 7` is `8`.\n    So, Vasya's score `S_vasya = 8`.\n    Now, to calculate worst rank for `S_vasya = 8`:\n    Count elements in `sorted_sums` that are `> 8`: `[10, 11]` (2 elements).\n    Count elements in `sorted_sums` that are `== 8`: `[8, 8]` (2 elements, excluding Vasya's own 8).\n    Worst rank = `2 (greater) + 2 (equal) + 1 (Vasya) = 5`.\n\nThis simplified approach works:\n1. Sort `a` ascending.\n2. Sort `b` descending.\n3. Compute `sums = [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(n)]`.\n4. Sort `sums` ascending.\n5. Find the minimum index `k` such that `sums[k] >= x`. (This `sums[k]` is the lowest possible score Vasya could have, given this pairing strategy, while satisfying the condition).\n6. The rank for this `sums[k]` would be `n - k`. This is because there are `k` participants with scores `sums[0] ... sums[k-1]` all less than `sums[k]`. And `n - k` participants with scores `sums[k] ... sums[n-1]` all greater than or equal to `sums[k]`. If Vasya takes `sums[k]`, and all participants with score `>= sums[k]` are ranked higher or equal to him, his rank would be `n - k`.\nThis is exactly `(count of S_j > S_vasya) + (count of S_j == S_vasya) + 1`.\nFor example `sorted_sums = [6, 8, 8, 8, 10, 11]`, `x=7`.\n`k=1` because `sums[1]=8` is the first one `>=7`.\nWorst rank = `n - k = 6 - 1 = 5`.\n\nThis is a standard approach for finding the worst rank in such scenarios. The `n - k` logic correctly counts how many participants (including Vasya) are in the upper portion of the sorted scores. If Vasya has the `k`-th score (0-indexed) in the sorted list of sums, there are `n-1-k` people with strictly higher scores, and `k` people with strictly lower scores. If all `n-1-k` people are ranked higher, and Vasya is ranked last among those with his score, his rank would be `(n-1-k) + (count of people with same score as Vasya, excluding Vasya) + 1`.\nThe `n - k` formula is simpler: it means there are `n - k` people whose scores are `>= sums[k]`. Vasya is one of them. In the worst case, all `n-k-1` people get ranked before him. So his rank is `(n-k-1) + 1 = n-k`.\n\nFinal Algorithm:\n1. Best rank: Always 1.\n2. Worst rank:\n   a. Read `n, x`.\n   b. Read `a` and `b`.\n   c. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n   d. Sort `b` in descending order.\n   e. Create `sums = [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(n)]`.\n   f. Sort `sums` in ascending order.\n   g. Use `bisect_left` (or a manual loop) to find the index `k` of the first element in `sums` that is `>= x`.\n   h. The worst rank is `n - k`.\n\nExample 1:\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n1. `a` sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n2. `b` sorted (desc): `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n3. `sums = [1+1, 1+1, 1+1, 1+1, 1+1] = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n4. `sums` sorted: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n5. `x=2`. `bisect_left(sums, 2)` gives `k=0`. (The first element `>= 2` is at index 0).\n6. Worst rank = `n - k = 5 - 0 = 5`.\nOutput: `1 5`.
