The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Solving the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to maximize the number of chests I can open. Each chest has a number, and each key has a number. A key opens a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, meaning one must be even and the other odd. I need to use each key and chest at most once.\n\nMy initial thought is to count how many even and odd chests and keys I have. Let's call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`.  I realize that to maximize the openings, I need to match even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. This leads to two independent sets of pairings: even-odd and odd-even.\n\nThe maximum number of even chests I can open is limited by the number of available odd keys. Conversely, the number of odd chests I can open is limited by the available even keys.  Therefore, I calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` for the even-odd pairs and `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` for the odd-even pairs. Since these sets are independent, I can simply sum them to get the total number of chests I can open.\n\nThe final answer is  `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. This looks efficient because I'm just iterating through the input arrays once to count parities and perform a simple calculation. I tested it with several examples, including edge cases like zero counts, and it works perfectly.  I'm confident this solution is the most efficient approach given the problem constraints and the parity condition. I've also double-checked that it adheres to standard input/output practices for competitive programming environments. The code is clean and concise, and I'm ready to submit it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe core condition is `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}`. This means that one of `a_i` and `b_j` must be an even number, and the other must be an odd number. In other words, `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\n\nWe can categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n1.  **Even chests**: Chests with an even number `a_i`.\n2.  **Odd chests**: Chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n3.  **Even keys**: Keys with an even number `b_j`.\n4.  **Odd keys**: Keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nLet's count these categories:\n*   `chests_even`: Number of even chests.\n*   `chests_odd`: Number of odd chests.\n*   `keys_even`: Number of even keys.\n*   `keys_odd`: Number of odd keys.\n\nFor a successful pairing `(a_i, b_j)`:\n*   If `a_i` is an even chest, it must be paired with an odd key `b_j`.\n*   If `a_i` is an odd chest, it must be paired with an even key `b_j`.\n\nThese two types of pairings are independent:\n1.  **Pairing even chests with odd keys**: We have `chests_even` even chests and `keys_odd` odd keys. The maximum number of such pairings is limited by the smaller of these two counts. So, we can form `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` pairs. Each such pair uses one even chest and one odd key.\n2.  **Pairing odd chests with even keys**: Similarly, we have `chests_odd` odd chests and `keys_even` even keys. The maximum number of such pairings is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. Each such pair uses one odd chest and one even key.\n\nSince the chests used in the first type of pairing (even chests) are distinct from those used in the second type (odd chests), and similarly for the keys (odd keys vs. even keys), these two sets of pairings do not conflict with each other. Therefore, we can simply add the maximum number of pairings from each category to get the total maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n**Total maximum opened chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`**\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chests_even = 0` and `chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, check its parity:\n    *   If `a_i` is even (`a_i % 2 == 0`), increment `chests_even`.\n    *   If `a_i` is odd (`a_i % 2 != 0`), increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_even = 0` and `keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, check its parity:\n    *   If `b_j` is even (`b_j % 2 == 0`), increment `keys_even`.\n    *   If `b_j` is odd (`b_j % 2 != 0`), increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7.  Print the result.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n*   **Chests:**\n    *   Odd: `9, 11` -> `chests_odd = 2`\n    *   Even: `14, 6, 2` -> `chests_even = 3`\n*   **Keys:**\n    *   Odd: `7` -> `keys_odd = 1`\n    *   Even: `8, 4, 20` -> `keys_even = 3`\n\n*   Pair even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n*   Pair odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\nTotal opened chests = `1 + 2 = 3`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity**: We iterate through the `n` chest numbers once and the `m` key numbers once. This takes `O(n + m)` time.\n*   **Space Complexity**: We store the input arrays `a` and `b`, which takes `O(n + m)` space. If we process numbers as they are read without storing the full arrays, it would be `O(1)` auxiliary space. Given the constraints `n, m <= 10^5`, `O(n+m)` time and space are well within typical limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m from the first line.\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the chest numbers from the second line.\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Read the key numbers from the third line.\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Count even and odd numbered chests.\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # Check if x is even\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:  # x is odd\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Count even and odd numbered keys.\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # Check if x is even\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:  # x is odd\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # To open a chest, the sum of key number and chest number must be odd.\n    # This means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n    # 1.
