Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Morse Code Sequence Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Morse code problem. It's essentially about counting possible letter sequences that can be derived from a binary string, representing dots ('0') and dashes ('1').  The core of the issue is figuring out the unique sequences we can construct from substrings of this binary string.\n\nI see that the valid Morse code representations for English letters can be between 1 and 4 bits long.  That makes the total possible combinations 30 (2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4), but we have to subtract those invalid representations. From that, we see that there are 26 letters represented by the valid strings.\n\nThe crux is, given a string `S`, we want to append either '0' or '1' `m` times. After each append, the goal is to calculate the *number* of unique English letter sequences derived from any substring of `S`, and all this is modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSo, for example, if I've got \"111\", the possible substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". Each of these could represent a single letter, or we could break them up into a series of concatenated letters like \"T\" \"M\", \"TM\", and \"TTT\". We have to account for these *sequences*.\n\nI can see that I'll need a dynamic programming (DP) approach. Let `dp[k]` store the number of valid sequences for the prefix of the string up to the `k`-th position. We will increment `dp[k]` by looking at the substring ending at position `k`.\n\nIt seems like the trick is to iterate through substrings of the given string `S` to find the different valid English letter sequences possible. Then, accumulate the total count across all substrings while ensuring we don't double-count any sequences and that the result stays within the modulo range. I think a DP strategy, where we build up the solutions from smaller prefixes, is the way to go here.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a growing binary string `S`. Each English letter is represented by a binary string of length 1 to 4, where '0' is a dot and '1' is a dash. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") do not represent any letter.\n\nLet's define the set of valid Morse code strings for single letters:\n`VALID_MORSE = {s for s in generate_all_strings() if s not in INVALID_MORSE}`\nwhere `generate_all_strings()` produces all binary strings of length 1 to 4, and `INVALID_MORSE = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\nThe core idea is dynamic programming. When a new character is appended to `S`, let its length be `N`. We need to consider all substrings ending at the new character `S[k:N]` for `0 <= k < N`. For each such substring, we want to find how many distinct letter sequences it can represent.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed by parsing the prefix `S[0:i]`. This is not quite right, as we need to consider *any* substring.\n\nA better approach is to consider `dp[i]` as the number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed by parsing the suffix `S[i:]`. No, this is also not right.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed by parsing the *prefix* `S[0:i]` of the current string `S`.\nWhen we append a character `c` to `S`, making its new length `N`:\nThe total count of sequences is the sum of sequences from all substrings.\nThis problem can be rephrased: For each starting position `i` in `S`, and each ending position `j` in `S` (`i <= j`), we consider the substring `S[i:j+1]`. For this substring, we want to count the number of ways it can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse code letters.\n\nLet `count_ways[k]` be the number of ways the suffix `S[N-k:N]` (the last `k` characters of `S`) can be parsed into a sequence of English letters.\n`count_ways[0] = 1` (empty string has one way to be parsed, as an empty sequence).\nFor `k` from 1 to `min(N, 4)`:\n  `sub = S[N-k:N]` (the suffix of length `k`)\n  If `sub` is in `VALID_MORSE`:\n    `count_ways[k] = (count_ways[k] + count_ways[0]) % MOD` (This means `sub` itself forms a single letter sequence).\n  For `l` from 1 to `min(N-k, 4)`:\n    `prefix_of_suffix = S[N-k:N-k+l]`\n    If `prefix_of_suffix` is in `VALID_MORSE`:\n      `count_ways[k] = (count_ways[k] + count_ways[k-l]) % MOD`\n\nThis approach counts *sequences* for a given substring. The problem asks for *distinct* sequences across *all* substrings. This implies using a set to store sequences or a hash-based approach. Given $M=3000$, a direct string set approach would be too slow due to string operations and large number of sequences.\n\nThe key insight for \"distinct sequences\" in competitive programming problems with dynamic programming is often to use a state that captures the *number* of distinct items, rather than the items themselves. This usually means the problem has a specific structure or that \"distinct\" actually means \"number of ways\". Let's re-read carefully: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" This phrasing usually means \"number of distinct sequences\".\n\nThe example \"111\" gives 7.\n\"1\" -> T\n\"11\" -> M\n\"111\" -> O\n\"11\" (as \"1\"+\"1\") -> TT\n\"111\" (as \"1\"+\"11\") -> TM\n\"111\" (as \"11\"+\"1\") -> MT\n\"111\" (as \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\") -> TTT\n\nThis confirms that the sequences are indeed distinct if their letter components are distinct. For example, 'T' is distinct from 'M', and 'TT' is distinct from 'TM'.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of `S` that *ends* at index `i-1`. (So `S[0:i]`).\nNo, this is still not right. The problem is asking for the total number of distinct sequences from *all* substrings.\n\nLet's maintain a set of all distinct letter sequences found so far.\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, forming `S_new`:\n1.  For each substring `sub` of `S_new` that ends at the newly appended character:\n    a.  Calculate all possible letter sequences for `sub`.\n    b.  Add these sequences to the global set.\n2.  The answer is the size of the global set.\n\nThis will be too slow. `M=3000`. `S` can be length 3000. Number of substrings ending at `N-1` is `N`. For each substring, we need to parse it. Parsing a string of length `L` can take `O(L)` time (if `dp` is used), so `O(N^2)` per step. Total `O(M^3)`. String hashing might help, but the number of distinct sequences could be huge.\n\nThe constraint `M <= 3000` is the key. An `O(M^2)` solution would be `3000^2 = 9 \\times 10^6`, which is acceptable. An `O(M^3)` solution would be `2.7 \\times 10^{10}`, too slow.\n\nLet's try to adapt the standard DP for counting ways to parse a string.\nLet `dp_ways[k]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[N-k:N]` (of length `k`) into a sequence of letters.\n`dp_ways[0] = 1` (empty string can be parsed in one way: empty sequence).\nFor `k` from 1 to `N`:\n  `dp_ways[k] = 0`\n  For `l` from 1 to `min(k, 4)`:\n    `sub = S[N-k : N-k+l]`\n    If `sub` is a valid Morse code for a letter:\n      `dp_ways[k] = (dp_ways[k] + dp_ways[k-l]) % MOD`\n\nThis `dp_ways` counts the number of ways to parse a *specific* suffix `S[N-k:N]`. This is useful if we need to count total ways, but not distinct sequences.\n\nThe problem is simplified if we consider that we are essentially counting paths in a graph.\nLet `S` be the current string. When a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S + c`.\nWe are interested in distinct sequences from *all* substrings `S[i:j]`.\nThe total count of distinct sequences can be computed by taking the sum of distinct sequences from `S[0:N-1]` and adding the new distinct sequences that involve the character `c` at `S[N-1]`.\n\nLet `total_distinct_sequences` be the answer for `S[0:N-1]`.\nWhen `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S[0:N]`.\nThe new sequences are those formed by substrings `S[i:N]` for `0 <= i < N`.\nFor each `i`, we need to find all sequences for `S[i:N]`.\n\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences that can be formed using the substring `S[j:N]`.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct sequences. This suggests that the sequences themselves are not too numerous, or that there's a trick.\nThe maximum length of `S` is 3000. A sequence of letters can have at most 3000 letters (if all are length 1).\nIf we use string hashing for sequences, we can store hash values in a set.\nA sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk` can be hashed as `hash(L1) * P^(k-1) + hash(L2) * P^(k-2) + ... + hash(Lk)`.\nSince there are 26 letters, we can assign an integer ID to each letter (e.g., 'A'=1, 'B'=2, ..., 'Z'=26).\nThen `hash(L1 L2 ... Lk) = (ID(L1) * BASE^(k-1) + ID(L2) * BASE^(k-2) + ... + ID(Lk)) % MOD_HASH`.\n\nLet `current_S` be the string `S`.\nWhen a character `ch` is appended to `current_S`:\n  `current_S += ch`\n  `N = len(current_S)`\n  `new_sequences = set()`\n  For `i` from `0` to `N-1`: (This `i` is the start of the substring)\n    `current_hash = 0`\n    `current_len = 0`\n    For `j` from `i` to `N-1`: (This `j` is the end of the substring)\n      `current_len += 1`\n      `sub = current_S[j]`\n      `current_hash = (current_hash * 2 + (1 if sub == '1' else 0))`\n      If `current_len > 4`: break (Morse code length max 4)\n      If `current_S[i:j+1]` is in `VALID_MORSE`:\n        // We found a valid letter. Now we need to combine it with sequences from S[j+1:N]\n        // This is where it gets tricky. We need sequences for S[i:j+1] + sequences for S[j+1:N]\n        // Not just S[i:j+1] itself.\n\nThis looks like a standard DP on string problem.\nLet `dp[i]` be the set of all distinct letter sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[i:]`.\nThis is too much state.\n\nLet's re-examine the example: `S = \"111\"`.\n`N=1`, `S=\"1\"`. Substring \"1\". Valid. Letter 'T'. Sequences: {\"T\"}. Count = 1.\n`N=2`, `S=\"11\"`.\n  Substrings: \"1\", \"11\".\n  \"1\" -> 'T'. Sequences: {\"T\"}.\n  \"11\" -> 'M'. Sequences: {\"M\"}.\n  Also, \"11\" can be \"1\" + \"1\" -> 'T' + 'T' -> \"TT\".\n  Total sequences: {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. Count = 3.\n`N=3`, `S=\"111\"`.\n  Substrings: \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\n  From \"1\": {\"T\"}\n  From \"11\": {\"M\", \"TT\"}\n  From \"111\":\n    \"111\" itself -> 'O'.\n    \"1\" + \"11\" -> 'T' + 'M' -> \"TM\"\n    \"11\" + \"1\" -> 'M' + 'T' -> \"MT\"\n    \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" -> 'T' + 'T' + 'T' -> \"TTT\"\n  Total sequences: {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}. Count = 7.\n\nThe calculation for `S=\"111\"` shows that we need to consider all possible segmentations of a substring `S[i:j]` into `L_1 L_2 ... L_k`.\nFor each substring `S[i:j]`, let `dp_sub[p]` be the set of distinct sequences for `S[i:p]`.\n`dp_sub[i-1] = {empty_sequence_hash}`\nFor `p` from `i` to `j`:\n  `dp_sub[p] = set()`\n  For `l` from 1 to `min(p-i+1, 4)`:\n    `morse_code = S[p-l+1 : p+1]`\n    If `morse_code` is `VALID_MORSE`:\n      `letter_id = get_letter_id(morse_code)`\n      For `prev_seq_hash` in `dp_sub[p-l]`:\n        `new_seq_hash = combine_hashes(prev_seq_hash, letter_id)`\n        `dp_sub[p].add(new_seq_hash)`\n  Add all hashes from `dp_sub[p]` to the global set.\n\nThis is `O(M^2)` substrings. For each substring of length `L`, we do `O(L)` DP steps. Each DP step involves iterating up to 4 previous states and doing set operations.\nThe number of sequences can still be large. For `M=3000`, if each substring adds just a few sequences, the global set can grow very large.\n\nLet's assume the \"distinct\" part is handled by the modulo arithmetic itself. This usually means the problem asks for the *sum of ways* to form sequences, or the *number of paths* in a graph, and not \"distinct sequences\" in the strict set-theoretic sense. But the example output clearly shows distinctness. \"T\" and \"TT\" are distinct. \"TM\" and \"MT\" are distinct.\n\nThe problem statement: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThis phrasing is ambiguous and often means \"count the number of distinct sequences\". If it meant \"sum of ways\", it would usually be \"number of ways to form non-empty sequences\".\n\nThe maximum number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed from a binary string of length `L` is bounded.\nIf `L=4`, say \"0000\".\n\"0\" -> A\n\"00\" -> B\n\"000\" -> C\n\"0000\" -> D\nSequences: A, B, C, D, AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, CA, AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, AAAA.\nThe number of sequences can grow exponentially with length.\nFor `L=3000`, the number of distinct sequences could be astronomical. This makes me think that the problem is not about actual string sequences and their hashes.\n\nThere must be a simpler interpretation of \"distinct sequences\".\nWhat if it's \"number of (start_index, end_index, sequence_hash)\" pairs? No, that's not distinct sequences.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"very easy question\" hint. This usually points to a standard DP approach.\nPerhaps the \"distinct\" part is handled by the small length of Morse codes (1-4).\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[i:]`.\nThis is still not quite right. We need all substrings.\n\nLet `ans[i]` be the total number of distinct sequences formed by all substrings of `S[0:i+1]`.\nWhen `S[i+1]` is appended, `ans[i+1]` = `ans[i]` + (new distinct sequences involving `S[i+1]`).\nThe new distinct sequences are those formed by `S[k:i+1]` for `0 <= k <= i+1`.\n\nLet `dp_new[k]` be the set of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing the suffix `S[k:i+1]` (where `i+1` is the current length of `S`).\n`dp_new[i+1]` is the set for the empty string, so `empty_sequence_hash`.\nFor `k` from `i` down to `0`:\n  `dp_new[k] = set()`\n  For `l` from 1 to `min(4, i+1-k)`:\n    `morse_code = S[k : k+l]`\n    If `morse_code` is `VALID_MORSE`:\n      `letter_id = get_letter_id(morse_code)`\n      For `prev_seq_hash` in `dp_new[k+l]`:\n        `new_seq_hash = combine_hashes(letter_id, prev_seq_hash)`\n        `dp_new[k].add(new_seq_hash)`\n  Add all sequences in `dp_new[k]` (excluding empty) to the global set.\n\nThis is `O(M)` iterations for appending characters. In each iteration, we run a DP of length `N` (current string length). Each step of DP involves `O(4)` transitions. Each transition involves combining hashes and set operations.\nThe number of hashes in each `dp_new[k]` set can be large.\nIf `dp_new[k]` has `X` elements, then `dp_new[k-1]` can have `4*X` elements. This can grow exponentially.\nMax `N=3000`. `26^3000` sequences is too much.\n\nThe \"very easy\" hint and `M=3000` suggests that the number of distinct sequences is not actually that large, or the `MOD` operation makes them effectively distinct by modulo.\nIf `MOD` is applied to hashes, then hash collisions are possible.\nIf `MOD` is applied to the final count, then we must be counting something different.\n\nLet's consider the problem from a different angle.\nWhat if the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences of *indices* `(i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), ..., (i_k, j_k)` such that `S[i_p:j_p]` is a valid Morse code, and `j_p = i_{p+1}-1`? No, that's not what the example shows.\n\nThe example \"111\" yields 7.\nT (1)\nM (11)\nO (111)\nTT (1+1)\nTM (1+11)\nMT (11+1)\nTTT (1+1+1)\n\nThe key must be that the *number* of distinct sequences for any substring `S[i:j]` is small.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\nLet's analyze the number of distinct sequences for a string of length `L`.\n`f(L)` = number of distinct sequences for `S[x:x+L]`.\n`f(1)`: 1 (if `S[x]` is valid)\n`f(2)`: 1 (if `S[x:x+2]` is valid) + `f(1)` * `f(1)` (if `S[x]` and `S[x+1]` are valid).\nThis is not counting distinct sequences. This is counting total ways.\n\nLet's use the standard method for counting distinct strings using polynomial hashing.\nAssign an ID to each of the 26 valid Morse codes (1 to 26).\nUse a base `P` (e.g., 31) and a modulus `MOD_HASH` (e.g., $10^9+9$).\nA sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk` has hash `(ID(L1) * P^(k-1) + ID(L2) * P^(k-2) + ... + ID(Lk)) % MOD_HASH`.\nTo avoid collisions, we can use two different pairs of (P, MOD_HASH).\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Precompute `VALID_MORSE` set and a mapping from Morse string to `letter_id` (1-26).\n    `VALID_MORSE_MAP = {s: id for s, id in zip(valid_strings, range(1, 27))}`\n2.  Initialize `global_distinct_hashes = set()`\n3.  Initialize `current_S = \"\"`\n4.  Initialize `P1 = 31`, `MOD1 = 1_000_000_007` (or another large prime like `1_000_000_009`)\n5.  Initialize `P2 = 37`, `MOD2 = 1_000_000_007` (or another large prime like `1_000_000_007` can be used as the second modulus if we want to output directly)\n\nLet's use `MOD = 1_000_000_007` for the final answer.\nFor hashing, we need a different modulus, say `MOD_HASH = 1_000_000_009`.\n`P = 31`.\n\n`global_distinct_hashes = set()` stores `(hash1, hash2)` pairs.\n`current_S = []` (list of chars for efficient appending).\n\nFor each input character `ch`:\n  `current_S.append(ch)`\n  `N = len(current_S)`\n\n  `dp_hashes = [set() for _ in range(N + 1)]`\n  `dp_hashes[N].add((0, 0))` # Represents the empty sequence hash (base case)\n\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    For `l` from 1 to `min(4, N-k)`:\n      `morse_code_str = \"\".join(current_S[k : k+l])`\n      If `morse_code_str` in `VALID_MORSE_MAP`:\n        `letter_id = VALID_MORSE_MAP[morse_code_str]`\n        For `(prev_h1, prev_h2)` in `dp_hashes[k+l]`:\n          `new_h1 = (letter_id * P + prev_h1) % MOD_HASH`\n          `new_h2 = (letter_id * P_ALT + prev_h2) % MOD_HASH_ALT`\n          `dp_hashes[k].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n          If `(new_h1, new_h2)` is not `(0,0)` (i.e., not empty sequence):\n            `global_distinct_hashes.add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n\n  Print `len(global_distinct_hashes) % MOD`.\n\nThis approach has `M` iterations.\nIn each iteration, `N` (current length of `S`) can go up to `M`.\nThe inner loop `k` goes from `N-1` down to `0`.\nThe `l` loop goes up to 4.\nInside `l` loop, `dp_hashes[k+l]` can contain up to `X` elements.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `L` can be roughly `(26^1 + 26^2 + 26^3 + 26^4)` if we assume all combinations are possible. This is still too large.\n\nThe number of *distinct* sequences for a string of length `L` is bounded by `26^L`.\nHowever, the actual number of sequences that can be generated from a length `L` binary string is much smaller.\nA string of length `L` can be parsed into `k` letters, where `k` is between `ceil(L/4)` and `L`.\nThe number of ways to parse a string of length `L` is `fibonacci(L)`.\nFor example, a string of length 4, \"0000\".\n\"0\" -> A\n\"00\" -> B\n\"000\" -> C\n\"0000\" -> D\nPossible sequences:\nA\nB\nC\nD\nAA (from 0+0)\nAB (from 0+00)\nAC (from 0+000)\nBA (from 00+0)\nBB (from 00+00)\nCA (from 000+0)\nAAA (from 0+0+0)\nAAB (from 0+0+00)\nABA (from 0+00+0)\nBAA (from 00+0+0)\nAAAA (from 0+0+0+0)\nTotal 15 distinct sequences for \"0000\".\nThis is small enough.\nThe number of distinct sequences for `S[k:N]` is `O(fib(N-k))`.\nThe total number of hash entries in `dp_hashes` for one iteration is `sum_{k=0 to N-1} |dp_hashes[k]|`.\nThis sum can be `O(N * fib(N))`. For `N=3000`, `fib(3000)` is huge.\n\nThe \"very easy\" implies that we don't need to use string hashing explicitly. The modulo might be applied to counts of *something else*.\nMaybe it's the number of distinct (length, hash) pairs? No, that's still string hashing.\n\nWhat if the number of distinct sequences is small enough that `set()` operations are fast?\nFor `N=3000`, the total number of distinct sequences across all substrings can be up to `M * (max_sequences_per_substring)`.\n`max_sequences_per_substring` is `O(fib(L_{max}))` where `L_{max}=3000`. This is too large.\n\nThis suggests that the \"distinct sequences\" are not treated as full strings for comparison.\nCould it be that the problem is asking for the sum of `dp_ways[k]` for all `k` and all substrings?\nIf it's \"sum of ways\", then the `dp_ways` approach is correct.\n`total_ways = 0`\nFor each new character:\n  `N = len(current_S)`\n  `dp_ways = [0] * (N + 1)`\n  `dp_ways[N] = 1` // Empty string has 1 way to parse (empty sequence)\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    For `l` from 1 to `min(4, N-k)`:\n      `morse_code_str = \"\".join(current_S[k : k+l])`\n      If `morse_code_str` in `VALID_MORSE_MAP`:\n        `dp_ways[k] = (dp_ways[k] + dp_ways[k+l]) % MOD`\n    `total_ways = (total_ways + dp_ways[k]) % MOD` // Add ways for S[k:N]\n  Print `total_ways`.\n\nLet's test this interpretation with the example `S=\"111\"`. `MOD = 10^9+7`.\n`S=\"\"`, `total_ways = 0`.\nAppend '1'. `current_S=\"1\"`. `N=1`.\n  `dp_ways = [0, 0]`. `dp_ways[1] = 1`.\n  `k=0`: `l=1`. `morse_code_str=\"1\"`. Valid.\n    `dp_ways[0] = (dp_ways[0] + dp_ways[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n  `total_ways = (0 + dp_ways[0]) % MOD = 1`.\n  Output: 1. (Matches example)\n\nAppend '1'. `current_S=\"11\"`. `N=2`.\n  `dp_ways = [0, 0, 0]`. `dp_ways[2] = 1`.\n  `k=1`:\n    `l=1`: `morse_code_str=\"1\"`. Valid.\n      `dp_ways[1] = (dp_ways[1] + dp_ways[2]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n  `total_ways = (1 + dp_ways[1]) % MOD = 2`.\n  `k=0`:\n    `l=1`: `morse_code_str=\"1\"`. Valid.\n      `dp_ways[0] = (dp_ways[0] + dp_ways[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    `l=2`: `morse_code_str=\"11\"`. Valid.\n      `dp_ways[0] = (dp_ways[0] + dp_ways[2]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n  `total_ways = (2 + dp_ways[0]) % MOD = (2 + 2) % MOD = 4`.\n  Output: 4. (Example output for \"11\" is 3. This interpretation is wrong.)\n\nThe example output means \"distinct sequences\".\nMy `dp_ways` approach is counting the total number of ways to parse substrings, not distinct sequences.\nThe example output for \"11\" is 3. My `dp_ways` for \"11\" gives 4.\nThe sequences are \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\nMy `dp_ways` counts:\nFor \"1\": 1 way (\"T\")\nFor \"11\": 2 ways (\"M\", \"TT\")\nTotal = 1+2 = 3. Wait, this matches the example if I only sum `dp_ways[k]` for `k` from `0` to `N-1` for the *current* string `S`.\n\nLet `total_count` be the final answer.\nWhen `current_S` becomes `S_new` (length `N`):\n  `dp_new_sequences_at_k[k]` = set of distinct sequences for `S_new[k:N]`.\n  `dp_new_sequences_at_k[N] = {empty_hash}`.\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    For `l` from 1 to `min(4, N-k)`:\n      `morse_code_str = \"\".join(S_new[k : k+l])`\n      If `morse_code_str` in `VALID_MORSE_MAP`:\n        `letter_id = VALID_MORSE_MAP[morse_code_str]`\n        For `prev_hash` in `dp_new_sequences_at_k[k+l]`:\n          `new_hash = combine_hashes(letter_id, prev_hash)`\n          `dp_new_sequences_at_k[k].add(new_hash)`\n  \n  The `total_count` is the size of `global_distinct_hashes`.\n  `global_distinct_hashes` should contain all sequences generated from `S_new[k:N]` for all `k`.\n  So, for `k` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    For `seq_hash` in `dp_new_sequences_at_k[k]`:\n      If `seq_hash` is not `empty_hash`:\n        `global_distinct_hashes.add(seq_hash)`\n\nThis is the `O(M^2 * 4 * MaxSetSize)` approach. MaxSetSize is the issue.\nLet's analyze `MaxSetSize`. `fib(L)` for `L=3000` is too large.\nBut the actual number of *distinct* sequences of letters that can be generated from a string of length `L` (max 4 for each letter) is not `fib(L)`.\nFor example, \"00\" can be \"A\" (from \"00\") or \"AA\" (from \"0\"+\"0\").\nIf \"0\" -> 'A', \"00\" -> 'B'.\nThen \"00\" can be \"B\" or \"AA\". These are 2 distinct sequences.\nIf \"0000\":\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\"\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\"\nLength 4: \"0000\", ...\nThere are 26 valid Morse codes.\nThe number of distinct sequences from a string of length `L` is bounded by `26^L`.\nBut `L` is the number of *letters* in the sequence, not the length of the Morse code string.\nA Morse code string of length `L` can form sequences of `k` letters, where `k` is between `ceil(L/4)` and `L`.\nExample: `L=4`. \"0000\".\n`k=1`: \"0000\" -> 'D'.\n`k=2`: \"0\" + \"000\" -> 'A' + 'C' -> \"AC\". \"00\" + \"00\" -> 'B' + 'B' -> \"BB\". \"000\" + \"0\" -> 'C' + 'A' -> \"CA\".\n`k=3`: \"0\" + \"0\" + \"00\" -> 'A' + 'A' + 'B' -> \"AAB\".\n`k=4`: \"0\" + \"0\" + \"0\" + \"0\" -> 'A' + 'A' + 'A' + 'A' -> \"AAAA\".\n\nThe total number of distinct sequences for `S` of length `N` is the sum of `|dp_new_sequences_at_k[k]|` for `k=0..N-1`, after taking the union.\nThe maximum total number of distinct sequences is bounded by `M * 26^4`.\n`3000 * 26^4 = 3000 * 456976 = 1,370,928,000`. This is too large for a set of `(hash1, hash2)` pairs to be efficient. `1.3 * 10^9` set elements is too many.\n\nThis means the number of *actual* distinct sequences is much smaller.\nOr the \"very easy\" implies that we don't need to consider distinctness using hashing, but rather a property of the modulo.\nIf the problem was \"the sum of ways to form sequences\", `M=3000` and `O(M^2)` would be fine.\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3. `dp_ways` gives 3.\n  `current_S=\"11\"`, `N=2`.\n  `dp_ways = [0,0,0]`, `dp_ways[2]=1`.\n  `k=1`: `l=1`. `morse=\"1\"`. `dp_ways[1] = (0+dp_ways[2]) = 1`.\n  `k=0`: `l=1`. `morse=\"1\"`. `dp_ways[0] = (0+dp_ways[1]) = 1`.\n           `l=2`. `morse=\"11\"`. `dp_ways[0] = (1+dp_ways[2]) = 2`.\n  Total ways for \"11\" is `dp_ways[0] + dp_ways[1] = 2+1 = 3`. This matches example.\n\nExample for `S=\"111\"`. Output 7.\n  `current_S=\"111\"`, `N=3`.\n  `dp_ways = [0,0,0,0]`, `dp_ways[3]=1`.\n  `k=2`: `l=1`. `morse=\"1\"`. `dp_ways[2] = (0+dp_ways[3]) = 1`.\n  `k=1`: `l=1`. `morse=\"1\"`. `dp_ways[1] = (0+dp_ways[2]) = 1`.\n           `l=2`. `morse=\"11\"`. `dp_ways[1] = (1+dp_ways[3]) = 2`.\n  `k=0`: `l=1`. `morse=\"1\"`. `dp_ways[0] = (0+dp_ways[1]) = 2`.\n           `l=2`. `morse=\"11\"`. `dp_ways[0] = (2+dp_ways[2]) = 3`.\n           `l=3`. `morse=\"111\"`. `dp_ways[0] = (3+dp_ways[3]) = 4`.\n  Total ways for \"111\" is `dp_ways[0] + dp_ways[1] + dp_ways[2] = 4+2+1 = 7`. This matches example.\n\nIt seems the problem *is* asking for the sum of ways to parse each substring `S[k:N]`, not the number of distinct sequences. This is a common interpretation ambiguity in competitive programming problems, and the \"very easy\" hint combined with the example output matching this interpretation strongly suggests this is the intended solution.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n1.  Precompute `VALID_MORSE` set (binary strings of length 1-4, excluding the 4 invalid ones).\n2.  Initialize `current_S = []` (list of characters).\n3.  Initialize `total_count = 0`.\n4.  For each input character `ch`:\n    a.  `current_S.append(ch)`.\n    b.  `N = len(current_S)`.\n    c.  `dp = [0] * (N + 1)`. `dp[N] = 1` (base case for empty suffix).\n    d.  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        i.  For `l` from 1 to `min(4, N-k)`:\n            `sub = \"\".join(current_S[k : k+l])`.\n            If `sub` is in `VALID_MORSE`:\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`.\n        ii. `total_count = (total_count + dp[k]) % MOD`.\n    e.  Print `total_count`.\n\nThis is an `O(M^2)` solution.\nOuter loop `M` iterations.\nInner loop `N` (up to `M`) iterations.\nInnermost loop `4` iterations.\nTotal time complexity: `O(M * N * 4) = O(M^2)`.\nFor `M=3000`, `3000^2 = 9 * 10^6` operations, which is perfectly fine within typical time limits (usually `10^8` ops/sec).\n\nLet's generate the `VALID_MORSE` set.\nAll binary strings of length 1 to 4:\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\"\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\"\nLength 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0100\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"\n\nTotal 30 strings.\nInvalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nSo `VALID_MORSE` contains 26 strings.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    INVALID_MORSE = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    VALID_MORSE = set()\n\n    # Generate all binary strings of length 1 to 4\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            s = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if s not in INVALID_MORSE:\n                VALID_MORSE.add(s)\n\n    current_s = []\n    total_count = 0\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        current_s.append(char)\n        n = len(current_s)\n\n        # dp[k] will store the number of ways to parse the suffix current_s[k:]\n        # into a sequence of English letters.\n        # dp[n] is 1, representing one way to parse an empty string (empty sequence).\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        dp[n] = 1\n\n        # Iterate k from n-1 down to 0\n        # k represents the starting index of the suffix current_s[k:]\n        for k in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            # Try to form a Morse code string of length l starting at k\n            for l in range(1, 5):\n                if k + l <= n:\n                    sub = \"\".join(current_s[k : k + l])\n                    if sub in VALID_MORSE:\n                        # If current_s[k : k+l] is a valid Morse code,\n                        # then any sequence that can be formed from current_s[k+l:]\n                        # can be prefixed by this new letter.\n                        # So, add dp[k+l] ways to dp[k].\n                        dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD\n            \n            # dp[k] now contains the number of ways to parse the substring current_s[k:n]\n            # Add these ways to the total_count.\n            total_count = (total_count + dp[k]) % MOD\n        \n        sys.stdout.write(str(total_count) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
