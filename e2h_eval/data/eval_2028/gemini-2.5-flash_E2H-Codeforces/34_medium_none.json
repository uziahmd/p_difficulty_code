And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that calculates the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a week is defined as `k` consecutive days. I have `n` days of sleep records (`a1, a2, ..., an`).\n\nFirst, I figured out the number of possible weeks is `n - k + 1`.  Let's call the sleep time sum for each week `S_j`,  where `j` starts at 1 and goes to `n-k+1`.  The average sleep time for that week is just `S_j / k`.\n\nThe core of the problem asks for the *average of these average sleep times*.  So I need to sum all the individual week averages and then divide by the number of weeks (`n-k+1`). This boils down to: `(Sum of all S_j) / (k * (n - k + 1))`\n\nI initially was thrown off by the example output, which led me to think the problem might have an error in it. After re-reading and trying different interpretations, I'm confident the problem wants the sum of the weekly sums (`S_j`) divided by the number of weeks. This is the same as the sum of all individual sleep times across all weeks divided by the number of weeks (number of days across all weeks) or total number of days across all weeks.\n\nTo do this efficiently, I realized a naive approach would be slow (`O(n*k)`) because `n` can be up to 2 * 10^5.  I needed a sliding window approach. I realized that each `a_i` contributes to many weekly sums depending on its index, but the sliding window technique simplifies the calculation.\n\nI'll start by calculating the sum of the first `k` elements to represent the first week, and then I'll use a sliding window to efficiently compute the sum for subsequent weeks. I add it to a running total for the sum.  This will be an O(n) algorithm. Finally, I will divide the total sum of weekly sums by the number of weeks.  I need to handle large numbers (although Python integers are arbitrary precision). I also need to format the final average result to the requested precision.  I checked my logic against the examples given. This should work efficiently and correctly.\n",
