    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and it's asking me to count the number of ways to choose some values. Specifically, these $c_s$ values, which represent counts for prefixes of binary strings, need to be chosen in a way that gives a \"beautiful\" multiset a specific maximum size. And these $c_s$ values have upper and lower bounds. Let's start by figuring out what makes a multiset beautiful.\n\nA beautiful multiset is one where, for any binary string, the number of strings in the multiset that start with that string as a prefix doesn't exceed the corresponding $c_s$. I can picture this as a prefix tree, or trie. Each node represents a binary string, and the value at that node ($c_s$) tells me how many strings can have that string as a prefix. The leaves are strings of length $n$.\n\nNow, how do I actually *maximize* the size of a beautiful multiset given the $c_s$ values?  That's the key.  If a string $S$ is in the multiset, all its prefixes are contributing. The count of strings with prefix 's' needs to be limited by $c_s$.  It looks like a max-flow or min-cut problem, but it might be simpler than that.\n\nLet's think about this recursively.  If $s$ is a string of length $n$, the maximum number of times it can appear is simply $c_s$. But if $s$ is shorter than $n$, the number of strings with that prefix is the sum of the strings with $s0$ and $s1$ as prefixes. So, $N(s) \\le c_s$, and $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$. The maximum value of the total size seems to be determined by some sort of greedy approach on this tree.\n\nTo maximize the multiset size, I need to make the count for each prefix as large as possible without violating the constraints. At each node, the maximum value is limited by $c_s$ and also by the maximum counts of its children, since $N(s0) + N(s1)$ is always at most $c_s$.  This means the maximum number of strings with prefix $s$ is the minimum between $c_s$ and the sum of the counts from $s0$ and $s1$. Seems like I need to work my way up the tree from the leaves. Let's try and develop an algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ such that $0 \\le c_s \\le k$, and the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings of length exactly $n$ is exactly $f$.\n\nLet's define $M(s)$ as the maximum possible number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nIf $s$ is a binary string of length $n$, then $M(s)$ is simply the count of $s$ itself in the multiset. The condition for $s$ is $M(s) \\le c_s$. To maximize $M(s)$, we choose $M(s) = c_s$.\nIf $s$ is a binary string of length less than $n$, then strings having $s$ as a prefix are exactly those having $s0$ as a prefix plus those having $s1$ as a prefix. Thus, $M(s) = M(s0) + M(s1)$.\nHowever, $M(s)$ is also constrained by $c_s$, so $M(s) \\le c_s$.\nCombining these, the maximum possible value for $M(s)$ is $\\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nThis recursive definition implies that to maximize $M(s)$, we should maximize $M(s0)$ and $M(s1)$ first.\nSo, the maximum possible count of strings in a beautiful multiset is $M(\\text{empty string})$, which is $\\min(c_{\\text{empty string}}, M(0) + M(1))$. The problem statement considers strings of length 1 to $n$, so the root of our tree is implicitly string '0' and '1'. The total number of strings in the multiset is $M(0) + M(1)$.\n\nLet $dp[len][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $len$ to $n$ that are prefixes of some string starting with '0' or '1' (i.e., strings in the subtree rooted at $s$), such that for any such $s$, $0 \\le c_s \\le k$, and the maximum possible count for string $s$ (denoted $M(s)$) is exactly $val$.\nThe base case is for strings of length $n$. For any string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. So, $c_s$ can be any value from $0$ to $k$.\n$dp[n][val]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for a single string $s$ of length $n$ such that $M(s)=val$. This means $c_s=val$. Since $0 \\le c_s \\le k$, this is 1 if $0 \\le val \\le k$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nFor $len < n$, let $s$ be a string of length $len$. $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nWe want to compute $dp[len][val]$. This is the sum over all possible choices of $c_s$, $M(s0)$, and $M(s1)$ such that $M(s) = val$.\n$dp[len][val] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{val_0=0}^f \\sum_{val_1=0}^f \\left(dp[len+1][val_0] \\times dp[len+1][val_1]\\right)$\nwhere the sum is restricted such that $\\min(c_s, val_0 + val_1) = val$.\n\nLet $S_j = \\sum_{i=0}^j dp[len+1][i]$. This is the prefix sum of $dp[len+1]$.\nThe total number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings $s'$ of length $len+1$ to $n$ (in the subtree of $s0$) such that $M(s0) \\le V$ is $S_V$.\nThe total number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings $s'$ of length $len+1$ to $n$ (in the subtree of $s0$) such that $M(s0) = V$ is $dp[len+1][V]$.\n\nLet $P[x] = \\sum_{val_0+val_1=x} dp[len+1][val_0] \\times dp[len+1][val_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$P[x]$ represents the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ values in the subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $M(s0) + M(s1) = x$.\nThe maximum possible value for $x$ is $2f$.\nWe can compute $P[x]$ using FFT/NTT. Since $f$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2f$ can be $4 \\cdot 10^5$. NTT is suitable here.\n\nNow, for a fixed $val$:\n$dp[len][val] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{x \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, x)=val} P[x]$.\nThis sum can be broken down:\n1. If $c_s = val$: Then $x$ must be $\\ge val$. The number of ways is $\\sum_{x=val}^{2f} P[x]$. This term is added for $c_s=val$.\n2. If $c_s > val$: Then $x$ must be exactly $val$. The number of ways is $P[val]$. This term is added for each $c_s \\in \\{val+1, \\dots, k\\}$. There are $k-val$ such choices.\nSo, $dp[len][val] = \\left(\\sum_{x=val}^{2f} P[x]\\right) + (k-val) \\times P[val]$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{x=val}^{2f} P[x]$ can be computed efficiently using suffix sums of $P$. Let $SuffP[val] = \\sum_{x=val}^{2f} P[x]$.\nThen $dp[len][val] = SuffP[val] + (k-val) \\times P[val]$.\nThis is for $0 \\le val \\le k$. If $val > k$, then $c_s$ cannot be $val$, so $dp[len][val]=0$.\nThe maximum value for $val$ is $f$. So we only need to compute up to $f$.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize $dp[n][val]$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$ to 1, otherwise 0.\n2. Iterate $len$ from $n-1$ down to $1$.\n   a. Compute $P[x]$ by convolving $dp[len+1]$ with itself using NTT. The size of arrays for NTT should be at least $2f+1$.\n   b. Compute suffix sums $SuffP[val]$ from $P$.\n   c. For each $val$ from $0$ to $f$:\n      If $val \\le k$, set $dp[len][val] = (SuffP[val] + (k-val) \\times P[val]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n      Else ($val > k$), set $dp[len][val] = 0$.\n3. The final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nThe maximum value for $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. The maximum length for $dp$ arrays is $f+1$.\nThe convolution step takes $O(F \\log F)$ time, where $F$ is the size of the NTT. $F \\approx 2f$.\nThere are $n-1$ levels of DP. So total time complexity is $O(n \\cdot f \\log f)$.\nGiven $n=15, f=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n \\cdot f \\log f \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(4 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 5.7 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n\nWe need to implement NTT. The modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number suitable for NTT ($998244353 = 119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1$). A primitive root is $3$.\n\nFinal check: The maximum total count is $f$.\nFor $len=1$, we need $M(0) + M(1) = f$.\nThe definition of $dp[len][val]$ is for a single string $s$ of length $len$.\nThe final answer we need is for $M(\\text{root}) = f$. In our setup, this means $M(0) + M(1) = f$.\nSo, after computing $dp[1][val]$ for all $val$, we need to compute $\\sum_{val_0+val_1=f} dp[1][val_0] \\times dp[1][val_1]$.\nThis is exactly $P[f]$ from the last convolution step (when $len$ goes from $1$ to $0$, or just $dp[1]$ convolved with itself).\nSo the final answer is $P[f]$ where $P$ is the result of convolving $dp[1]$ with $dp[1]$.\n\nLet's refine the DP state: $dp[len]$ is an array where $dp[len][val]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for a single branch (subtree) starting at length $len$ such that its maximum value is $val$.\nWe start with $dp[n]$ where $dp[n][val]=1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$, else $0$.\nThen we iterate $len$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n  $P = \\text{convolve}(dp[len+1], dp[len+1])$\n  $SuffP = \\text{suffix_sum}(P)$\n  For $val$ from $0$ to $f$:\n    If $val \\le k$, $dp[len][val] = (SuffP[val] + (k-val) \\times P[val]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n    Else $dp[len][val] = 0$.\nFinally, the answer is $P[f]$ from the last iteration (when $len=1$).\n\nExample 1: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$dp[1]$ is an array. $dp[1][val]=1$ for $0 \\le val \\le 42$, else $0$.\nThe problem asks for $M(0)+M(1)=f$.\nThe calculation is $P = \\text{convolve}(dp[1], dp[1])$. We need $P[f] = P[2]$.\n$P[2] = \\sum_{val_0+val_1=2} dp[1][val_0] \\times dp[1][val_1]$.\nPossible pairs $(val_0, val_1)$: $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$.\n$dp[1][0]=1, dp[1][1]=1, dp[1][2]=1$ (since $0,1,2 \\le k=42$).\n$P[2] = dp[1][0] \\times dp[1][2] + dp[1][1] \\times dp[1][1] + dp[1][2] \\times dp[1][0]$\n$P[2] = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 = 3$.\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# NTT implementation\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        len_half <<= 1\n        wlen = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half << 1), MOD)\n        if inverse:\n            wlen = pow(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half << 1):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n    \n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n    return a\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to len_a + len_b - 1\n    n = 1\n    while n < len_a + len_b - 1:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n    \n    a_fft = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    b_fft = ntt(b_padded, False)\n    \n    c_fft = [(x * y) % MOD for x, y in zip(a_fft, b_fft)]\n    \n    c = ntt(c_fft, True)\n    \n    return c[:len_a + len_b - 1]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[val] stores the number of ways to choose c_s values for a subtree\n    # such that the max count for the root of this subtree is 'val'.\n    # Max possible value for val is f.\n    # We need to consider values up to f for the current level,\n    # and up to 2f for the sum of children.\n    \n    # Base case: len = n (leaf nodes)\n    # For a string s of length n, M(s) = c_s.\n    # dp_curr[val] = 1 if 0 <= val <= k, else 0.\n    # The maximum value for val is f.\n    dp_curr = [0] * (f + 1)\n    for val in range(min(k, f) + 1):\n        dp_curr[val] = 1\n\n    # Iterate from len = n-1 down to 1\n    # For each level, we calculate dp_next based on dp_curr\n    # The number of strings in the trie is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n.\n    # For n=15, it's 2^16 - 2.\n    # But we only need to iterate n-1 times for the DP levels.\n    \n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        # Convolve dp_curr with itself to get P\n        # P[x] = sum_{val0 + val1 = x} dp_curr[val0] * dp_curr[val1]\n        # Max value for x is 2*f.\n        P = multiply(dp_curr, dp_curr)\n        \n        # P might be shorter than 2*f+1 if f is small, pad with zeros\n        P_padded = [0] * (2 * f + 1)\n        for i in range(min(len(P), 2 * f + 1)):\n            P_padded[i] = P[i]\n        P = P_padded\n\n        # Compute suffix sums of P\n        suff_P = [0] * (2 * f + 1)\n        suff_P[2 * f] = P[2 * f]\n        for val in range(2 * f - 1, -1, -1):\n            suff_P[val] = (suff_P[val + 1] + P[val]) % MOD\n\n        # Calculate dp_next based on P and suff_P\n        dp_next = [0] * (f + 1)\n        for val in range(f + 1):\n            if val <= k:\n                # Case 1: c_s = val.
