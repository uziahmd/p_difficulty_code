There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Finding the Maximum Games in a Knockout Tennis Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this tennis tournament. The goal is to figure out the absolute *maximum* number of games the eventual winner can play, given this funky rule. It's a knockout format, which means the winner has to keep beating people until they're the last player standing.\n\nLet's call the number of games the winner has won, `k`. My gut tells me I should focus on maximizing `k`. The key rule is that players can only face off if the difference in games won between them is at most one. So if I have player A with `k_A` games and player B with `k_B` games, they can play if the absolute difference between `k_A` and `k_B` is less than or equal to one. Makes sense.\n\nThe total number of games in the tournament has to be `n-1` where `n` is the number of players. The winner plays until everyone else is gone, that's just the way it goes.\n\nNow, to maximize the winner's games, I'm thinking I need to be strategic about the opponents. If the winner, `W`, wants to rack up the most wins, they should always try to play against someone with as *few* games won as possible, as long as the rule holds. By playing someone \"fresh\", I'm effectively opening up more \"branches\" of the tournament for possible matches.\n\nI'm starting to visualize this. Players with a specific number of games won can be thought of as existing at certain \"stages\" or \"rounds\" in the tournament. When two players meet, the loser is out, and the winner moves up a stage.\n\nI'm going to define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players needed to get a winner who has won `k` games. My objective is to find the largest value of `k` such that `f(k)` is less than or equal to the total number of players, `n`.\n\nNow, that rule. If the winner, has won `k` games, they can play against someone who has won either `k-1`, `k` or `k+1` games. But my intuition kicks in: If I'm maximizing my number of wins, I shouldn't bother playing someone with `k+1` games! That can't even happen because I'm the winner and am currently at `k` games, and I am the one progressing. So it's someone with `k-1` or `k`. Every win moves me up a level.\n\nI'm picturing this as a kind of branching process, a bit like the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum players required to create a winner at `k` games seems to be building recursively on these previous states, like a tournament tree.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games a player has already won.\nThe rule states that if player A has won `k_A` games and player B has won `k_B` games, they can play if `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1`.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nConsider the winner (W) of the tournament. To maximize the number of games W plays, W should always play. Each time W plays and wins, W increments their game count by 1.\nLet's analyze the number of players required to reach a certain stage for W.\nSuppose W has just won `k` games. To win the `(k+1)`-th game, W needs an opponent.\nThe opponent must have played `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` games. However, since W is playing their `(k+1)`-th game, W has won `k` games so far. So W can play against an opponent who has won `k-1` or `k` games.\n\nTo minimize the total number of players `f(k+1)` required to produce a winner who has played `k+1` games, W should play against an opponent who also required the minimum number of players to reach their current state.\n\nLet's denote `f(k)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a player who has won `k` games.\n- For `k=0`: A player who has won 0 games is just one of the initial `n` players. So, `f(0) = 1`.\n- For `k=1`: A player wins their first game. They must play against an opponent who has won 0 games.\n  - W (0 games) plays O (0 games). W wins, now W has 1 game.\n  - This requires `f(0)` players for W and `f(0)` players for O. So, `f(1) = f(0) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n- For `k=2`: A player wins their second game. They have won 1 game so far. They can play against an opponent who has won 0 or 1 game.\n  - Option 1: W (1 game) plays O (0 games). W wins, now W has 2 games.\n    - Players needed: `f(1)` for W + `f(0)` for O = `2 + 1 = 3`.\n  - Option 2: W (1 game) plays O (1 game). W wins, now W has 2 games.\n    - Players needed: `f(1)` for W + `f(1)` for O = `2 + 2 = 4`.\n  - To minimize `f(2)`, we choose Option 1: `f(2) = 3`.\n- For `k=3`: A player wins their third game. They have won 2 games so far. They can play against an opponent who has won 1 or 2 games.\n  - Option 1: W (2 games) plays O (1 game). W wins, now W has 3 games.\n    - Players needed: `f(2)` for W + `f(1)` for O = `3 + 2 = 5`.\n  - Option 2: W (2 games) plays O (2 games). W wins, now W has 3 games.\n    - Players needed: `f(2)` for W + `f(2)` for O = `3 + 3 = 6`.\n  - To minimize `f(3)`, we choose Option 1: `f(3) = 5`.\n\nLet's list the sequence `f(k)`:\n`f(0) = 1`\n`f(1) = 2` (W(0) vs O(0))\n`f(2) = 3` (W(1) vs O(0))\n`f(3) = 5` (W(2) vs O(1))\n`f(4) = 8` (W(3) vs O(2))\n`f(5) = 13` (W(4) vs O(3))\n\nIt appears that `f(k)` follows the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, `f(k) = F_{k+2}`, where `F_n` is the `n`-th Fibonacci number with `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`.\n- `f(0) = F_2 = 1`\n- `f(1) = F_3 = 2`\n- `f(2) = F_4 = 3`\n- `f(3) = F_5 = 5`\n- `f(k) = F_{k+2}`\n\nLet's prove this by induction.\nBase cases are shown above.\nAssume `f(i) = F_{i+2}` for all `i <= k`.\nTo find `f(k+1)`: W has won `k` games. W can play against an opponent O who has won `k-1` or `k` games.\n- If W (k games) plays O (k-1 games): Players needed = `f(k) + f(k-1) = F_{k+2} + F_{k+1} = F_{k+3}`.\n- If W (k games) plays O (k games): Players needed = `f(k) + f(k) = F_{k+2} + F_{k+2} = 2 * F_{k+2}`.\n\nWe need to choose the minimum of these two options.\nWe know that for `k >= 1`, `F_{k+3} = F_{k+2} + F_{k+1}`.\nWe need to compare `F_{k+3}` with `2 * F_{k+2}`.\n`F_{k+3} = F_{k+2} + F_{k+1}`.\nSo we compare `F_{k+2} + F_{k+1}` with `2 * F_{k+2}`.\nThis simplifies to comparing `F_{k+1}` with `F_{k+2}`.\nFor `k >= 0`, `F_{k+2} >= F_{k+1}`.\nEquality `F_{k+2} = F_{k+1}` only holds for `k=0` (`F_2=1, F_1=1`).\n- If `k=0`: W (0 games) plays O (-1 games) [invalid] or O (0 games).\n  `f(1)` is formed by W(0) vs O(0), so `f(1) = f(0) + f(0) = 1+1=2 = F_3`.\n- If `k=1`: W (1 game) plays O (0 games) or O (1 game).\n  `f(2)` is min(`f(1)+f(0)`, `f(1)+f(1)`) = min(`2+1`, `2+2`) = `3`. `F_4=3`.\n  Here `F_2=1`, `F_3=2`. `F_3 > F_2`. So `F_{k+1} < F_{k+2}` for `k=1`.\n  Thus `F_{k+2} + F_{k+1} < 2 * F_{k+2}` for `k=1`.\n  So `f(k+1) = F_{k+3}` is chosen.\n\nIn general, for `k >= 1`, `F_{k+1} < F_{k+2}`.\nTherefore, `F_{k+2} + F_{k+1} < 2 * F_{k+2}`.\nThis means that to minimize players, the winner (who has `k` games) should always play against an opponent who has `k-1` games.\nSo, `f(k+1) = f(k) + f(k-1)` for `k >= 1`.\nThis confirms that `f(k)` follows the Fibonacci recurrence, with `f(0)=1` and `f(1)=2`.\nThe sequence is `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`, which is `F_{k+2}`.\n\nWe are given `n` players (up to `10^18`). We need to find the maximum `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\nWe can generate Fibonacci numbers until `F_{k+2}` exceeds `n`. The corresponding `k` will be our answer.\n\nExample Walkthrough:\n- `n=2`:\n  - `k=0`: `f(0)=1 <= 2`.\n  - `k=1`: `f(1)=2 <= 2`.\n  - `k=2`: `f(2)=3 > 2`.\n  Max `k=1`.\n- `n=3`:\n  - `k=0`: `f(0)=1 <= 3`.\n  - `k=1`: `f(1)=2 <= 3`.\n  - `k=2`: `f(2)=3 <= 3`.\n  - `k=3`: `f(3)=5 > 3`.\n  Max `k=2`.\n- `n=4`:\n  - `k=0`: `f(0)=1 <= 4`.\n  - `k=1`: `f(1)=2 <= 4`.\n  - `k=2`: `f(2)=3 <= 4`.\n  - `k=3`: `f(3)=5 > 4`.\n  Max `k=2`.\n- `n=10`:\n  - `k=0`: `f(0)=1 <= 10`.\n  - `k=1`: `f(1)=2 <= 10`.\n  - `k=2`: `f(2)=3 <= 10`.\n  - `k=3`: `f(3)=5 <= 10`.\n  - `k=4`: `f(4)=8 <= 10`.\n  - `k=5`: `f(5)=13 > 10`.\n  Max `k=4`.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially.\n`F_1 = 1`\n`F_2 = 1`\n`F_3 = 2`\n`F_4 = 3`\n...\n`F_{90}` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`.\n`F_{91}` is approximately `4.66 * 10^18`.\n`F_{92}` is approximately `7.54 * 10^18`.\n`F_{93}` is approximately `1.22 * 10^19`.\nSo, `k+2` will be around 90. `k` will be around 88. This means we only need to iterate a small number of times to find the answer.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F_2`, which is `f(0)`).\n2. Initialize `b = 2` (representing `F_3`, which is `f(1)`).\n3. Initialize `k = 1` (since `f(1)` is the first value we check after `f(0)` for `k>=1`).\n4. Read `n`.\n5. If `n=2`, the loop below will correctly find `k=1`.\n6. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   - `temp = b`\n   - `b = a + b` (this computes the next Fibonacci number in the `f(k)` sequence)\n   - `a = temp`\n   - `k = k + 1`\n7. The loop terminates when `b > n`. At this point, the previous `k` was the maximum `k` for which `f(k) <= n`. So, we return `k-1`.\n\nLet's re-check the initial values for the loop:\n`k=0`: `f(0)=1`.\n`k=1`: `f(1)=2`.\nIf `n=2`:\n  `a=1, b=2, k=1`.\n  Loop condition `b <= n` (i.e., `2 <= 2`) is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `k = 1 + 1 = 2`\n  Loop condition `b <= n` (i.e., `3 <= 2`) is false.\n  Return `k-1 = 2-1 = 1`. Correct for `n=2`.\n\nIf `n=3`:\n  `a=1, b=2, k=1`.\n  Loop 1: `2 <= 3` true. `b=3, a=2, k=2`.\n  Loop 2: `3 <= 3` true. `b=5, a=3, k=3`.\n  Loop 3: `5 <= 3` false.\n  Return `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct for `n=3`.\n\nThis algorithm works.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # f(k) = F_{k+2}\n    # F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...\n    # f(0) = F_2 = 1\n    # f(1) = F_3 = 2\n    # f(2) = F_4 = 3\n    # We are looking for max k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n    # current_f_k_minus_1 corresponds to f(k-1)\n    # current_f_k corresponds to f(k)\n    # We start with f(0) and f(1)\n    current_f_k_minus_1 = 1  # f(0)\n    current_f_k = 2          # f(1)\n    \n    # k represents the number of games played by the winner.\n    # We've initialized f(1) = 2, so k starts at 1.\n    k = 1\n\n    # Loop while the number of players required for k games is less than or equal to n.\n    # The loop condition checks current_f_k which is f(k).\n    while current_f_k <= n:\n        # Calculate the next f(k+1) using f(k) + f(k-1)\n        next_f_k = current_f_k_minus_1 + current_f_k\n        \n        # Update for the next iteration\n        current_f_k_minus_1 = current_f_k\n        current_f_k = next_f_k\n        \n        # Increment k, as we've successfully produced a winner with one more game\n        k += 1\n        \n    # The loop terminates when current_f_k (which is f(k)) becomes greater than n.\n    # This means the previous value of k (k-1) was the maximum for which f(k-1) <= n.\n    # So, the maximum number of games the winner can play is k-1.\n    print(k - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
