The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is calculating losses, and I need to optimize this because the number of rounds, *n*, can be enormous.  The inputs are the sequences of moves for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, and the number of rounds.\n\nMy first thought is, simulating *every* round is a non-starter.  I need to find a way to avoid that and make it efficient.  The fact that both players use *cyclic* strategies is key. That means both their moves repeat.  Nikephoros cycles through his sequence *A* of length *m*, and Polycarpus cycles through *B* of length *k*.\n\nSince they both play in cycles, the key is understanding how these cycles interact.  They'll have a *combined* cycle length. This combined length will be the least common multiple of *m* and *k*, which I'll call *L*. I can calculate *L* using the formula `LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)`.  And even if *m* and *k* are up to 1000, *L* won't be too big to handle, at most a million rounds.\n\nMy strategy is now forming:\n\n1.  **Find the Cyclic Pattern**: I'll simulate just *L* rounds. I'll need to work out the moves each player makes for each round.  I can keep track of how many times each player loses during these *L* rounds.  Let's call these the cyclic losses for each player (`losses_N_cycle` and `losses_P_cycle`).\n2.  **Scale Up to *n* Rounds**: I can use the cyclic losses I've computed.  I need to divide *n* by *L* to find the number of complete cycles, then multiply those losses by the number of complete cycles to find the total losses from those complete rounds.  I'll also have a remainder. I can just simulate the remaining rounds and add them to the count.\n\nThis should be fast enough, and the number of iterations should be manageable. I think I have a solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus after `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Nikephoros plays cyclically from sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus plays cyclically from sequence `B` of length `k`. `n` can be very large (up to 2 * 10^9), while `m` and `k` are relatively small (up to 1000).\n\nThe key observation is that both players' moves repeat in cycles. Nikephoros's moves repeat every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's moves repeat every `k` rounds. Therefore, the combined pattern of moves `(Nikephoros's move, Polycarpus's move)` repeats every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `LCM` is the Least Common Multiple.\n\nLet `L = LCM(m, k)`. Since `m, k <= 1000`, `L` will be at most `m * k = 1000 * 1000 = 10^6`. This length `L` is small enough to simulate.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Define a helper function `get_winner(move1, move2)`:** This function takes two moves (e.g., 'R', 'P', 'S') and returns:\n    *   `1` if `move1` wins against `move2`.\n    *   `-1` if `move1` loses against `move2`.\n    *   `0` if it's a draw.\n    The rules are: 'R' beats 'S', 'S' beats 'P', 'P' beats 'R'.\n\n2.  **Calculate `L = LCM(m, k)`:**\n    *   First, calculate `GCD(m, k)` using the Euclidean algorithm.\n    *   Then, `L = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)`.\n\n3.  **Simulate one full cycle of `L` rounds:**\n    *   Initialize `nikephoros_losses_cycle = 0` and `polycarpus_losses_cycle = 0`.\n    *   Loop `i` from `0` to `L - 1`:\n        *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n        *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n        *   Call `get_winner(A[i % m], B[i % k])`.\n            *   If the result is `1` (Nikephoros wins), increment `polycarpus_losses_cycle`.\n            *   If the result is `-1` (Nikephoros loses), increment `nikephoros_losses_cycle`.\n            *   If the result is `0` (draw), do nothing.\n\n4.  **Calculate total losses for `n` rounds:**\n    *   `num_full_cycles = n // L`\n    *   `remaining_rounds = n % L`\n\n    *   Initialize `total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_cycle`\n    *   Initialize `total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_cycle`\n\n    *   **Simulate the `remaining_rounds`:**\n        *   Loop `i` from `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`:\n            *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n            *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n            *   Call `get_winner(A[i % m], B[i % k])`.\n                *   If the result is `1`, increment `total_polycarpus_losses`.\n                *   If the result is `-1`, increment `total_nikephoros_losses`.\n\n5.  **Print the results:** `total_nikephoros_losses` and `total_polycarpus_losses`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n = 7`, `A = \"RPS\"`, `B = \"RSPP\"`\n`m = 3`, `k = 4`\n\n1.  **`get_winner` function:**\n    *   `get_winner('R', 'S')` -> 1 (R beats S)\n    *   `get_winner('S', 'P')` -> 1 (S beats P)\n    *   `get_winner('P', 'R')` -> 1 (P beats R)\n    *   `get_winner('R', 'R')` -> 0 (Draw)\n    *   `get_winner('R', 'P')` -> -1 (R loses to P)\n    *   ...etc.\n\n2.  **`LCM(3, 4)`:**\n    *   `GCD(3, 4) = 1`\n    *   `L = (3 * 4) // 1 = 12`\n\n3.  **Simulate one full cycle (12 rounds):**\n    `nikephoros_losses_cycle = 0`, `polycarpus_losses_cycle = 0`\n\n    | Round `i` | N plays `A[i%3]` | P plays `B[i%4]` | Winner | N losses | P losses |\n    | :-------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :----- | :------- | :------- |\n    | 0         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[0]`='R'       | Draw   | 0        | 0        |\n    | 1         | `A[1]`='P'       | `B[1]`='S'       | P wins | 1        | 0        |\n    | 2         | `A[2]`='S'       | `B[2]`='P'       | N wins | 1        | 1        |\n    | 3         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[3]`='P'       | P wins | 2        | 1        |\n    | 4         | `A[1]`='P'       | `B[0]`='R'       | N wins | 2        | 2        |\n    | 5         | `A[2]`='S'       | `B[1]`='S'       | Draw   | 2        | 2        |\n    | 6         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[2]`='P'       | P wins | 3        | 2        |\n    | 7         | `A[1]`='P'       | `B[3]`='P'       | Draw   | 3        | 2        |\n    | 8         | `A[2]`='S'       | `B[0]`='R'       | P wins | 4        | 2        |\n    | 9         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[1]`='S'       | N wins | 4        | 3        |\n    | 10        | `A[1]`='P'       | `B[2]`='P'       | Draw   | 4        | 3        |\n    | 11        | `A[2]`='S'       | `B[3]`='P'       | N wins | 4        | 4        |\n\n    After 12 rounds: `nikephoros_losses_cycle = 4`, `polycarpus_losses_cycle = 4`.\n\n4.  **Calculate total losses for `n=7` rounds:**\n    *   `num_full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0`\n    *   `remaining_rounds = 7 % 12 = 7`\n\n    *   `total_nikephoros_losses = 0 * 4 = 0`\n    *   `total_polycarpus_losses = 0 * 4 = 0`\n\n    *   **Simulate `remaining_rounds = 7`:**\n        (This is the same as the first 7 rows of the cycle simulation above)\n        | Round `i` | N plays `A[i%3]` | P plays `B[i%4]` | Winner | N losses | P losses |\n        | :-------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :----- | :------- | :------- |\n        | 0         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[0]`='R'       | Draw   | 0        | 0        |\n        | 1         | `A[1]`='P'       | `B[1]`='S'       | P wins | 1        | 0        |\n        | 2         | `A[2]`='S'       | `B[2]`='P'       | N wins | 1        | 1        |\n        | 3         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[3]`='P'       | P wins | 2        | 1        |\n        | 4         | `A[1]`='P'       | `B[0]`='R'       | N wins | 2        | 2        |\n        | 5         | `A[2]`='S'       | `B[1]`='S'       | Draw   | 2        | 2        |\n        | 6         | `A[0]`='R'       | `B[2]`='P'       | P wins | 3        | 2        |\n\n    After 7 rounds: `total_nikephoros_losses = 3`, `total_polycarpus_losses = 2`.\n\n5.  **Print:** `3 2`.
