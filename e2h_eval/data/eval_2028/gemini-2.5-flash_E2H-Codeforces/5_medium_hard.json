Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for \"Colored Boots\"**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The objective is to find the maximum compatible pairs of boots, given their colors. My initial thought process revolves around a greedy strategy, aiming to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the boots and their corresponding colors efficiently. Since we'll be dealing with indices for output, it's logical to store indices alongside their colors. A dictionary or a list of lists seems ideal for storing the indices of boots for each color (and a separate list for the indefinite color, '?').\n\nThe core strategy will be greedy: prioritize the most restrictive pairings first. Specific color matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a') are the most rigid and must be paired exactly. Then, handle specific colors with the flexible '?' boots. Lastly, pair the remaining '?' boots with each other.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1.  **Exact Matches:** Pair boots of identical specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a').\n2.  **Specific to '?' Pairing:** Match the remaining boots of specific colors with available '?' boots.\n3.  **'?' with '?':** Finally, pair any remaining '?' boots.\n\nI need to initialize data structures to store boot indices, specifically lists for each character ('a' to 'z' and '?'). I'll keep track of indices in `left_indices` and `right_indices` lists. The logic will involve iterating through the input strings and populating these lists.\n\nThe pairing is achieved via:\n- exact color matches first\n- then specific left with '?' right\n- then '?' left with specific right\n- then '?' with '?'.\n\nThis is the most efficient greedy strategy as exact matches are preserved for maximum results.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to output these pairs. A boot can be part of at most one pair. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color (e.g., '?' and 'z', 'a' and '?', '?' and '?').\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should employ a greedy strategy. The core idea is to prioritize pairings that are more restrictive, thus saving the more flexible '?' boots for situations where specific color boots might not have an exact match.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color:**\n    We'll use lists to store the 0-indexed positions of boots for each color. Since we have 26 specific lowercase Latin letters and one '?' character, we can use an array of 27 lists for left boots and another for right boots.\n    -   `left_indices[char_code]` will store indices of left boots with `char_code`.\n    -   `right_indices[char_code]` will store indices of right boots with `char_code`.\n    -   We can map 'a' to 0, 'b' to 1, ..., 'z' to 25, and '?' to 26.\n    -   Using `list.pop()` will be efficient as we process boots and remove them from consideration.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Pairings:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Pair exact specific colors.**\n        These are the most restrictive pairs. A left boot of color 'c' and a right boot of color 'c' can only form a compatible pair with each other (or with a '?' boot). By pairing them, we use up two specific boots that are \"tied\" together, leaving '?' boots available for other specific boots that might not have an exact match.\n        For each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n        While there are left boots of color `c` and right boots of color `c`:\n            Pop one index from `left_indices[c]` and one from `right_indices[c]`, and add the pair to our results.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Pair specific color boots with '?' boots.**\n        After Step 1, any remaining specific color boot (e.g., a left 'a' boot) does not have an exact specific match available on the other side. Its only remaining option for a compatible pair is a '?' boot. We should use '?' boots for these specific boots.\n        This step is split into two parts:\n        *   **Step 2a: Pair specific left boots with '?' right boots.**\n            For each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n            While there are left boots of color `c` and right '?' boots:\n                Pop one index from `left_indices[c]` and one from `right_indices['?']`, and add the pair to our results.\n        *   **Step 2b: Pair '?' left boots with specific right boots.**\n            For each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n            While there are left '?' boots and right boots of color `c`:\n                Pop one index from `left_indices['?']` and one from `right_indices[c]`, and add the pair to our results.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Pair '?' boots with '?' boots.**\n        These are the most flexible boots. They are used last, after all specific boots have been considered for pairing.\n        While there are left '?' boots and right '?' boots:\n            Pop one index from `left_indices['?']` and one from `right_indices['?']`, and add the pair to our results.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that we maximize pairs because it prioritizes using boots that have fewer pairing options first, thus preserving the highly flexible '?' boots for later, when they might be the only option for a specific boot. The order of iterating through specific colors (e.g., 'a' then 'b' or 'z' then 'y') does not affect the total number of pairs, only which specific boots are paired with which '?' boots.\n\n**Example Trace (from problem description's second example):**\n`n = 7`\n`l = abaca?b`\n`r = zabbbcc`\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    `left_indices`:\n    'a': [0, 2, 4]\n    'b': [1, 6]\n    'c': [3]\n    '?': [5]\n    `right_indices`:\n    'a': [1]\n    'b': [2, 3]\n    'c': [4, 5, 6]\n    'z': [0]\n    `result_pairs = []`\n\n2.  **Step 1: Exact specific matches**\n    *   'a': `left_indices['a'] = [0, 2, 4]`, `right_indices['a'] = [1]`\n        Pair (4, 1) -> `result_pairs.append((5, 2))` (1-indexed)\n        `left_indices['a'] = [0, 2]`, `right_indices['a'] = []`\n    *   'b': `left_indices['b'] = [1, 6]`, `right_indices['b'] = [2, 3]`\n        Pair (6, 3) -> `result_pairs.append((7, 4))`\n        `left_indices['b'] = [1]`, `right_indices['b'] = [2]`\n        Pair (1, 2) -> `result_pairs.append((2, 3))`\n        `left_indices['b'] = []`, `right_indices['b'] = []`\n    *   'c': `left_indices['c'] = [3]`, `right_indices['c'] = [4, 5, 6]`\n        Pair (3, 6) -> `result_pairs.append((4, 7))`\n        `left_indices['c'] = []`, `right_indices['c'] = [4, 5]`\n    *   'z': No left 'z' boots.\n\n    After Step 1: `result_pairs = [(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3), (4, 7)]`\n    Remaining:\n    `left_indices`: 'a': [0, 2], '?': [5]\n    `right_indices`: 'c': [4, 5], 'z': [0]\n\n3.  **Step 2a: Specific left with '?' right**\n    `right_indices['?']` is empty. No pairs.\n\n4.  **Step 2b: '?' left with specific right**\n    `left_indices['?'] = [5]`\n    *   'c': `right_indices['c'] = [4, 5]`\n        Pair (5, 5) -> `result_pairs.append((6, 6))`\n        `left_indices['?'] = []`, `right_indices['c'] = [4]`\n    *   'z': `left_indices['?']` is empty. No pairs.\n\n    After Step 2: `result_pairs = [(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3), (4, 7), (6, 6)]`\n    Remaining:\n    `left_indices`: 'a': [0, 2]\n    `right_indices`: 'c': [4], 'z': [0]\n\n5.  **Step 3: '?' left with '?' right**\n    `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']` are empty. No pairs.\n\nFinal `result_pairs` contains 5 pairs. This matches the maximum count in the example. The exact pairs may differ from the example output, but the total count is the same, and all pairs are compatible.\n\n**Complexity:**\n-   Populating `left_indices` and `right_indices`: O(N)\n-   Steps 1, 2, 3: Each boot index is pushed onto a list once and popped once. The loops iterate up to 26 times (for specific colors) or until lists are empty. In total, each boot is processed a constant number of times. So, these steps are O(N).\nOverall time complexity: O(N).\nSpace complexity: O(N) for storing indices.\n\nGiven N up to 150,000, O(N) solution is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 0-indexed boot indices for each color.\n    # We'll use 0-25 for 'a'-'z', and 26 for '?'.\n    left_indices = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n    right_indices = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n\n    # Populate the lists\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_indices[26].append(i)\n        else:\n            left_indices[ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i)\n\n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_indices[26].append(i)\n        else:\n            right_indices[ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i)\n\n    result_pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair exact specific colors ('c' with 'c')\n    for c_idx in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_indices[c_idx] and right_indices[c_idx]:\n            l_boot_idx = left_indices[c_idx].pop()\n            r_boot_idx = right_indices[c_idx].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_boot_idx + 1, r_boot_idx + 1))\n\n    # Step 2: Pair specific color boots with '?' boots\n    # Step 2a: Specific left boots with '?' right boots\n    for c_idx in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_indices[c_idx] and right_indices[26]:\n            l_boot_idx = left_indices[c_idx].pop()\n            r_boot_idx = right_indices[26].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_boot_idx + 1, r_boot_idx + 1))\n            \n    # Step 2b: '?' left boots with specific right boots\n    for c_idx in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_indices[26] and right_indices[c_idx]:\n            l_boot_idx = left_indices[26].pop()\n            r_boot_idx = right_indices[c_idx].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_boot_idx + 1, r_boot_idx + 1))\n\n    # Step 3: Pair '?' left boots with '?' right boots\n    while left_indices[26] and right_indices[26]:\n        l_boot_idx = left_indices[26].pop()\n        r_boot_idx = right_indices[26].pop()\n        result_pairs.append((l_boot_idx + 1, r_boot_idx + 1))\n\n    # Print results\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{len(result_pairs)}\\n\")\n    for l_idx, r_idx in result_pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
