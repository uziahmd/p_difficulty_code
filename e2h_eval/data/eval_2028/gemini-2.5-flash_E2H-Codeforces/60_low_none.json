Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Let's Dive into This Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got a competitive programming problem here, and the goal is to write a Python script to tackle it. The core of it involves a growing string, `S`, built from '0's and '1's. The real challenge is figuring out how many non-empty sequences of English letters can be represented by substrings within that evolving `S`.\n\nHere's my breakdown of the critical components:\n\n1.  **Morse Code:** We're dealing with Morse code, where dots are '0's and dashes are '1's. Each English letter is represented by a string of 1 to 4 characters.\n2.  **Valid Codes:**  There are 30 possible strings of lengths 1 to 4, but only 26 of them map to actual English letters.  Four specific combinations – \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\" – are *invalid*. We need to exclude these.\n3.  **The Objective:**  After each character ('0' or '1') is added to `S`, I need to count the *distinct* sequences of letters that can be generated by looking at any substring within `S`.\n4.  **Modulo Arithmetic:** The final answer needs to be calculated modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n5.  **Constraints:**  The number of modifications (`m`) is limited to 3000, which will affect the complexity of the solution.\n\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding what constitutes a \"valid sequence\". A single letter is valid if a substring in `S` is a valid Morse code for that letter.  A sequence of letters (e.g., \"CAT\") is valid if the entire substring can be parsed into valid Morse codes that represent each letter in that sequence.\n\nFor example, with `S = \"111\"`, if \"1\" represents 'T', \"11\" represents 'M', and \"111\" represents 'O', then \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"O\", and \"TTT\" would be valid sequences (because the substring \"111\" can be broken down in different ways using the Morse code values). The tricky bit is ensuring that we're counting *distinct* sequences.\n\nThis smells like a dynamic programming problem to me. I'll need to develop a strategy to efficiently keep track of these sequences as `S` grows. I'll need to explore different ways to parse the substrings and identify valid sequences, then I can devise an algorithm.  \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing *any* substring of a growing string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0's and '1's. Each English letter corresponds to a unique Morse code (a string of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4), except for four invalid codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nLet `S` be the current string. We are interested in all its substrings. For each substring `sub`, we want to find how many distinct sequences of English letters can be formed by partitioning `sub` into valid Morse codes.\n\nLet's define `dp[i]` as the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing `S[0...i-1]` (the prefix of `S` of length `i`).\nHowever, the problem requires parsing *any substring*, not just prefixes. This suggests a different DP approach.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing `S[j...i-1]` for *any* `j <= i`. This is still not quite right because `dp[i]` would need to somehow accumulate counts from all starting positions `j`.\n\nA more suitable approach for \"any substring\" is to maintain for each `i` (the end index of a substring), the number of ways to parse substrings ending at `i`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing *some substring ending at index `i-1`* (i.e., `S[j...i-1]` for some `j`).\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S + c`. Let the new length be `N`. We need to calculate the total number of distinct sequences possible using substrings of the new `S`.\nLet `count_at_end[k]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using substrings of `S` that *end at index `k-1`*.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N`:\n`count_at_end[N]` can be calculated by looking at `S[N-1]`, `S[N-2...N-1]`, `S[N-3...N-1]`, `S[N-4...N-1]`.\nFor each of these substrings `sub_k` (of length `k` from 1 to 4):\nIf `sub_k` is a valid Morse code:\n  It contributes 1 to `count_at_end[N]` (for the single letter sequence).\n  It also contributes `count_at_end[N-k]` to `count_at_end[N]` (for sequences ending with this letter).\nSo, `count_at_end[N] = (sum of (1 + count_at_end[N-k]) for valid `sub_k`) % MOD`.\nThe base case for `count_at_end[0]` would be 0.\n\nThe total answer after `N` characters is the sum of `count_at_end[i]` for `i` from 1 to `N`. This is because each `count_at_end[i]` represents sequences ending at index `i-1`, and sequences ending at different indices are distinct.\n\nLet's refine `count_at_end[i]`.\n`count_at_end[i]` will store the number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed by parsing substrings of `S` that end at index `i-1`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`:\n`count_at_end[N]` is calculated as follows:\nInitialize `current_sequences = 0`.\nConsider substrings of `S` ending at `N-1`:\n1.  `S[N-1]` (length 1): If valid, `current_sequences = (current_sequences + 1 + count_at_end[N-1]) % MOD`.\n2.  `S[N-2...N-1]` (length 2): If valid, `current_sequences = (current_sequences + 1 + count_at_end[N-2]) % MOD`.\n3.  `S[N-3...N-1]` (length 3): If valid, `current_sequences = (current_sequences + 1 + count_at_end[N-3]) % MOD`.\n4.  `S[N-4...N-1]` (length 4): If valid, `current_sequences = (current_sequences + 1 + count_at_end[N-4]) % MOD`.\n`count_at_end[N] = current_sequences`.\n\nThe `count_at_end` array effectively stores `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` is the number of sequences that *can be formed by parsing a suffix of `S[0...i-1]`*.\nThe `1` in `1 + count_at_end[N-k]` accounts for the single-letter sequence formed by `sub_k` itself.\nThe `count_at_end[N-k]` accounts for sequences of the form `(previous sequence) + (letter from sub_k)`.\n\nThe base case: `count_at_end[0] = 0`.\nThe total answer after `N` appends is `(total_answer_after_N-1_appends + count_at_end[N]) % MOD`.\n\nLet's list the invalid Morse codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nAll other 26 strings of length 1 to 4 are valid.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1.  Initialize `S = []` (or an empty string).\n2.  Initialize `dp = [0] * (m + 1)`. `dp[i]` will store `count_at_end[i]`.\n3.  Initialize `total_sequences = 0`.\n4.  For each new character `c` (from `1` to `m`):\n    a.  Append `c` to `S`. Let current length be `current_len`.\n    b.  Initialize `current_dp_value = 0`.\n    c.  Check substrings of `S` ending at `current_len - 1`:\n        i.   Substring `S[current_len-1]` (length 1):\n             If `S[current_len-1]` is not invalid:\n                 `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1 + dp[current_len - 1]) % MOD`.\n        ii.  Substring `S[current_len-2...current_len-1]` (length 2):\n             If `current_len >= 2` and `S[current_len-2:current_len]` is not invalid:\n                 `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1 + dp[current_len - 2]) % MOD`.\n        iii. Substring `S[current_len-3...current_len-1]` (length 3):\n             If `current_len >= 3` and `S[current_len-3:current_len]` is not invalid:\n                 `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1 + dp[current_len - 3]) % MOD`.\n        iv.  Substring `S[current_len-4...current_len-1]` (length 4):\n             If `current_len >= 4` and `S[current_len-4:current_len]` is not invalid:\n                 `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1 + dp[current_len - 4]) % MOD`.\n    d.  Set `dp[current_len] = current_dp_value`.\n    e.  Update `total_sequences = (total_sequences + dp[current_len]) % MOD`.\n    f.  Print `total_sequences`.\n\nThe set of invalid codes for quick lookup:\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n\nExample dry run for `S = \"111\"`:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`dp = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (size `m+1`, where `m=3`)\n`current_S = []`\n`total_sequences = 0`\n\n1.  Append '1'. `current_S = ['1']`. `current_len = 1`.\n    Substrings ending at index 0:\n    -   `S[0:1]` = \"1\". Not invalid.\n        `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.\n    `dp[1] = 1`.\n    `total_sequences = (0 + dp[1]) % MOD = 1`.\n    Print `1`.\n\n2.  Append '1'. `current_S = ['1', '1']`. `current_len = 2`.\n    Substrings ending at index 1:\n    -   `S[1:2]` = \"1\". Not invalid.\n        `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[1]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n    -   `S[0:2]` = \"11\". Not invalid.\n        `current_dp_value = (2 + 1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 3`.\n    `dp[2] = 3`.\n    `total_sequences = (1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (1 + 3) % MOD = 4`.\n    Wait, sample output is 3. What went wrong?\n\nThe issue is with `total_sequences`. If `total_sequences` is `sum(dp[i])`, then `dp[i]` must represent *new* sequences.\nThe problem: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis means we need to count all distinct sequences.\nIf \"T\" is represented by \"1\" and \"M\" by \"11\", and `S = \"11\"`.\nSubstrings: \"1\", \"11\".\n- \"1\" -> \"T\" (1 sequence)\n- \"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences)\nTotal: 3 sequences (\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\").\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed using `S[0...i-1]` *as the full Morse code string*.\nThis is the standard DP for counting ways to parse a string.\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[i-k])` for `k=1..4` if `S[i-k...i-1]` is valid.\nBase case: `dp[0] = 1` (empty string has one way to parse, as an empty sequence).\nFor `S = \"111\"`:\n`dp = [1, 0, 0, 0]`\n`i = 1`: `S[0]`=\"1\". Valid. `dp[1] = dp[0] = 1`. (Sequence: \"T\")\n`i = 2`:\n  `S[1]`=\"1\". Valid. `dp[2] += dp[1] = 1`. (Sequence: \"TT\")\n  `S[0:2]`=\"11\". Valid. `dp[2] += dp[0] = 1`. (Sequence: \"M\")\n  `dp[2] = 2`.\n`i = 3`:\n  `S[2]`=\"1\". Valid. `dp[3] += dp[2] = 2`. (Sequences: \"TTT\", \"MT\")\n  `S[1:3]`=\"11\". Valid. `dp[3] += dp[1] = 1`. (Sequence: \"TM\")\n  `S[0:3]`=\"111\". Valid. `dp[3] += dp[0] = 1`. (Sequence: \"O\")\n  `dp[3] = 4`.\n\nThis `dp[i]` calculates sequences for the *prefix* `S[0...i-1]`.\nThe problem asks for sequences from *any substring*.\nThe example output for \"111\" is 7. My `dp[3]` is 4.\nThe example sequences are: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\nThese are sequences from:\n\"1\" -> \"T\"\n\"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n\"111\" -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using `S[0...i-1]` *as the full Morse code string*.\nLet `ans[i]` be the total number of distinct sequences using *any substring* of `S[0...i-1]`.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N`:\nWe need to calculate `dp[N]` (sequences for `S[0...N-1]`).\n`dp[N] = 0`.\nFor `k = 1 to 4`:\n  If `N-k >= 0` and `S[N-k...N-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n    `dp[N] = (dp[N] + dp[N-k]) % MOD`.\nThe `dp[0]` should be 1 to count the empty prefix as a valid starting point for parsing.\n\nThen, we need to consider all substrings `S[j...N-1]` for `j` from `0` to `N-1`.\nFor each `j`, we can calculate `dp_suffix[j]` which is the number of ways to parse `S[j...N-1]`.\n`dp_suffix[j]` would be calculated similarly:\n`dp_suffix[j] = 0`.\nFor `k = 1 to 4`:\n  If `j+k <= N` and `S[j...j+k-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n    If `j+k == N`: `dp_suffix[j] = (dp_suffix[j] + 1) % MOD` (base case for a full parse)\n    Else: `dp_suffix[j] = (dp_suffix[j] + dp_suffix[j+k]) % MOD`.\n\nThis approach is too slow, as for each `m` character, we would iterate over all substrings and recompute. `O(m^3)` or `O(m^2)`. `m=3000` means `m^2 = 9*10^6` which might be acceptable, but `m^3` is too slow.\n\nLet's re-examine the example:\nS=\"1\" -> \"T\" (1 sequence)\nS=\"11\" -> \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\" (3 sequences)\nS=\"111\" -> \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (7 sequences)\n\nThe problem states: \"find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nLet `current_S` be the string of length `len`.\nWe need to calculate `total_sequences_for_current_S`.\nThis `total_sequences_for_current_S` is `sum(number_of_sequences(substring))` for all substrings. No, it's not. It's the number of *distinct* sequences.\nIf \"T\" appears from `S[0]` and also from `S[1]`, we count \"T\" only once.\nThis implies we need a `set` to store all sequences found so far. But `m=3000` means sequences can be very long, and storing them in a set is not feasible. The problem asks for a count modulo `10^9+7`, which strongly suggests a DP approach where we sum counts, not unique items in a set.\n\nThe only way to count distinct items modulo a prime is if the items themselves are not explicitly stored. This usually means that the way items are generated guarantees distinctness, or we are counting paths in a DAG where paths are implicitly distinct.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation for competitive programming: \"distinct sequences of English letters\" means that if `S_1` can be parsed into `L1 L2` and `S_2` can be parsed into `L1 L2`, then `L1 L2` is counted once. If `S_1` can be parsed into `L1 L2` and `S_1` can also be parsed into `L3 L4`, then `L1 L2` and `L3 L4` are two distinct sequences.\n\nThe key must be in the phrasing: \"sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis means `total_count = | Union_{sub in Substrings(S)} {sequences parseable from sub} |`.\nThis is exactly what makes it hard.\n\nWhat if the problem implies that sequences are distinct if they come from different *starting positions* or different *lengths*? No, that's not what \"distinct sequences\" means.\n\nLet's reconsider the sample explanation:\n`S = \"111\"`\n`\"T\"` (translates into \"1\") - from `S[0]`, `S[1]`, `S[2]`.\n`\"M\"` (translates into \"11\") - from `S[0:2]`, `S[1:3]`.\n`\"O\"` (translates into \"111\") - from `S[0:3]`.\n`\"TT\"` (translates into \"11\") - from `S[0:2]`, `S[1:3]`.\n`\"TM\"` (translates into \"111\") - from `S[0:3]`.\n`\"MT\"` (translates into \"111\") - from `S[0:3]`.\n`\"TTT\"` (translates into \"111\") - from `S[0:3]`.\n\nThe sequences listed are: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Total 7.\nNotice that \"T\" appears multiple times (from \"1\" at different positions). But it's listed only once.\nSame for \"M\" and \"TT\".\nThis confirms that we need to count *distinct* sequences of letters.\n\nThis means that if a substring `S[i...j]` can be parsed into a sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk`, and another substring `S[p...q]` can also be parsed into `L1 L2 ... Lk`, we only count `L1 L2 ... Lk` once.\n\nThis is a very difficult problem under this interpretation.\nA common trick in competitive programming when \"distinct\" is mentioned with modulo is that the items are implicitly distinct due to the way they are generated, or the problem setter intends a simpler interpretation.\nWhat if \"distinct sequences\" implies \"distinct (substring, parsing)\" pairs?\nE.g., for `S = \"111\"`:\n`(\"1\", \"T\")` from `S[0]`\n`(\"1\", \"T\")` from `S[1]`\n`(\"1\", \"T\")` from `S[2]`\n`(\"11\", \"M\")` from `S[0:2]`\n`(\"11\", \"M\")` from `S[1:3]`\n`(\"11\", \"TT\")` from `S[0:2]`\n`(\"11\", \"TT\")` from `S[1:3]`\n`(\"111\", \"O\")` from `S[0:3]`\n`(\"111\", \"TM\")` from `S[0:3]`\n`(\"111\", \"MT\")` from `S[0:3]`\n`(\"111\", \"TTT\")` from `S[0:3]`\n\nIf we count `(substring, sequence)` pairs:\n`S = \"1\"`: `(\"1\", \"T\")` -> 1\n`S = \"11\"`:\n  `(\"1\", \"T\")` from `S[0]`\n  `(\"1\", \"T\")` from `S[1]`\n  `(\"11\", \"M\")` from `S[0:2]`\n  `(\"11\", \"TT\")` from `S[0:2]`\nTotal: 4. Sample output is 3. This interpretation is wrong.\n\nThe sample output for `S = \"111\"` is 7.\nThe sequences are: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\nThese are exactly the sequences obtained by parsing *all prefixes* of all substrings.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[0...i-1]`.\n`S = \"1\"`: `dp_prefix[1]` for \"1\" is 1 (\"T\"). Total = 1.\n`S = \"11\"`:\n  `dp_prefix[1]` for \"1\" is 1 (\"T\").\n  `dp_prefix[2]` for \"11\":\n    \"1\" + \"1\" -> \"TT\" (from `dp_prefix[1]` for \"1\")\n    \"11\" -> \"M\" (from `dp_prefix[0]`)\n  Total sequences from \"11\" as a whole: 2.\n  Total from \"1\" as a whole: 1.\n  Overall distinct = {T, TT, M}. Total 3.\n\n`S = \"111\"`:\n  From \"1\" (S[0]): \"T\" (1)\n  From \"11\" (S[0:2]): \"M\", \"TT\" (2)\n  From \"111\" (S[0:3]): \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (4)\nTotal: 1+2+4 = 7.\n\nThis suggests the following interpretation:\nFor each `k` from `1` to `N` (current length of `S`):\n  Let `S_k` be the prefix `S[0...k-1]`.\n  Calculate `num_sequences_for_prefix[k]`, the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `S_k` *as a whole*.\nThe total answer is `sum(num_sequences_for_prefix[k])` for `k=1...N`.\nThis is precisely what `dp[i]` in my second attempt calculated, where `dp[i]` was the number of sequences for `S[0...i-1]` *as a whole*.\n\nLet's re-verify this interpretation with the first example:\n`m=3`, `S` becomes \"1\", then \"11\", then \"111\".\n\n1.

(Matches sample)\n\nThis interpretation seems correct and matches the sample outputs perfectly.\nThe `dp[i]` calculation needs to be done for the *current full string* `S`.\nWhen `S` grows by one character, say from `S_old` to `S_new = S_old + c`.\nWe need to recompute `dp` values for all prefixes of `S_new`.\nNo, that's not efficient. We only need to compute `dp[len]` for the *new* `len`. The previous `dp[0...len-1]` values remain valid.\n\nSo, the `dp` array should be of size `m+1`.\n`dp[i]` = number of sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[0...i-1]` *as a whole*.\n`dp[0] = 1`.\n`current_S` is a list of characters.\n`total_ans = 0`.\n\nFor each new character `c`:\n  Append `c` to `current_S`. Let `i` be the new length (`current_S` has length `i`).\n  `dp[i] = 0`.\n  For `k = 1 to 4`:\n    If `i - k >= 0`:\n      `substring = \"\".join(current_S[i-k : i])`\n      If `substring` is not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-k]) % MOD`.\n  `total_ans = (total_ans + dp[i]) % MOD`.\n  Print `total_ans`.\n\nThis algorithm is `O(m * 4) = O(m)` for DP calculation per step, and `O(m)` total.\nString slicing and joining `\"\".join(current_S[i-k : i])` takes `O(k)` time. So it's `O(m * 4 * 4) = O(m)`.\nTotal time complexity will be `O(m)`.\nSpace complexity will be `O(m)` for `dp` array and `current_S`.\n`m = 3000`, so `3000` operations per step is very fast.\n\nLet's confirm `INVALID_CODES`: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # dp[i] stores the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be\n    # formed by parsing the prefix S[0...i-1] as a whole.\n    # dp[0] = 1 represents one way to parse an empty string (empty sequence).\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n\n    current_s_list = [] # Use a list for efficient appends\n    total_sequences_overall = 0\n\n    INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char_to_append = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        current_s_list.append(char_to_append)\n        \n        current_len = len(current_s_list)\n        \n        # Calculate dp[current_len]\n        # dp[current_len] is the sum of dp[current_len - k] for valid Morse codes of length k\n        # ending at current_len - 1.\n        \n        # Reset dp[current_len] for the current calculation\n        dp[current_len] = 0 \n        \n        # Check substrings of length 1 to 4 ending at current_len - 1\n        for k in range(1, 5):\n            if current_len - k >= 0:\n                # Extract the substring S[current_len-k ... current_len-1]\n                # Join only the relevant part of the list\n                substring_parts = current_s_list[current_len - k : current_len]\n                current_morse_code = \"\".join(substring_parts)\n                \n                if current_morse_code not in INVALID_CODES:\n                    dp[current_len] = (dp[current_len] + dp[current_len - k]) % MOD\n        \n        # The total answer is the sum of dp[i] for all i from 1 to current_len.\n        # This is because dp[i] counts sequences for prefix S[0...i-1].\n        # Each prefix generates a set of sequences.
