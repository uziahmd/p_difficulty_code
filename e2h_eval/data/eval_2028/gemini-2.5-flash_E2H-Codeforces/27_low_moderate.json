On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Tackling the Twisty Movement**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem, and the input is an array of 1s and 2s. The game is to reverse any subsegment and try to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).  Since we only have 1s and 2s, the LNDS is essentially just a block of 1s followed by a block of 2s.  This screams dynamic programming or at least clever prefix/suffix calculations.\n\nMy initial thought is that the solution boils down to figuring out how to position those 1s and 2s to get the longest possible non-decreasing sequence.  The key insight here is that the LNDS's length is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s chosen from the modified array, so I just need to arrange to get as many 1s as possible, followed by as many 2s as possible. I'm assuming the algorithm will involve some sort of iteration or brute force.\n\nSo, let's break it down. If I reverse a subsegment `[l, r]`, I create a new array, `b`. I'll split that array somewhere, say at index `i`.  All the 1s for the LNDS will come from the left part, `b[1...i]`, and all the 2s will come from the right part, `b[i+1...n]`.  I need to find the optimal split point, i, and the best `[l, r]` to reverse.\n\nFor a fixed `[l, r]` reversed and an `i`, the LNDS length is just the number of 1s in `b[1...i]` plus the number of 2s in `b[i+1...n]`. I was thinking of iterating over all `l` and `r` pairs, doing the reverse, and then iterating over all `i` values. This gives me a time complexity of O(N^4), which I quickly realized is not going to fly.\n\nThe trick to optimization is in calculating the count of 1s and 2s quickly. I can use prefix sums for 1s and suffix sums for 2s. This means I can calculate `(count of 1s in b[1...i])` and `(count of 2s in b[i+1...n])` in O(1) time each, given the prefix and suffix sums. I think this will get me a much faster algorithm.\n\nSo the plan now is to somehow reduce the time to an N^3 complexity or lower. Perhaps I can do this in O(N^3)? Let me think... I can compute prefix sums of the original array, and, after reversing a subsegment, I will need to iterate on i for calculating 1s and 2s, but the idea is there.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence after reversing a single subsegment `a[l...r]` of the given sequence `a`. The sequence elements are restricted to 1s and 2s.\n\n**Key Observation for Non-decreasing Subsequences with 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s will always be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. This means all chosen 1s must appear before all chosen 2s in the original sequence.\n\nLet the modified sequence be `b`. To find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in `b`, we can iterate through all possible \"split points\" `k` (from 0 to `n`). A split point `k` means we consider taking all 1s from `b[1...k]` and all 2s from `b[k+1...n]`.\nThe maximum length for a given `b` would be `max_k ( (count of 1s in b[1...k]) + (count of 2s in b[k+1...n]) )`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Iterate over all possible reversal intervals `[l, r]`:**\n    `l` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.\n    `r` ranges from `l` to `n-1`.\n    (Using 0-based indexing for convenience in Python).\n\n2.  **Construct the modified sequence `b` for each `[l, r]`:**\n    `b` will be `a[0...l-1] + reversed(a[l...r]) + a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the LNDS for `b`:**\n    To do this efficiently, we can precompute prefix sums of 1s and suffix sums of 2s for `b`.\n    *   `prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `b[0...i-1]`. `prefix_ones[0] = 0`.\n    *   `suffix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `b[i...n-1]`. `suffix_twos[n] = 0`.\n\n    Then, for each split point `k` (from 0 to `n`):\n    The number of 1s up to index `k-1` is `prefix_ones[k]`.\n    The number of 2s from index `k` onwards is `suffix_twos[k]`.\n    The total length for this split point is `prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k]`.\n    We take the maximum over all `k`.\n\n4.  **Maintain a global maximum:**\n    Keep track of the overall maximum LNDS length found across all `[l, r]` combinations.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n = 4`)**\n\nLet's consider `l=1, r=2` (0-based: `l=1, r=2`, interval `a[1...2]` which is `[2, 1]`).\nOriginal `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\nReversed subsegment `a[1...2]` becomes `[1, 2]`.\nModified `b = [1, 1, 2, 2]`.\n\nNow, calculate LNDS for `b = [1, 1, 2, 2]`:\n*   `prefix_ones`: `[0, 1, 2, 2, 2]` (counts of 1s in `[], [1], [1,1], [1,1,2], [1,1,2,2]`)\n*   `suffix_twos`: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` (counts of 2s in `[1,1,2,2], [1,2,2], [2,2], [2], []`)\n\n| k (split point) | `prefix_ones[k]` | `suffix_twos[k]` | Sum |\n| :-------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :-- |\n| 0               | 0                | 2                | 2   |\n| 1               | 1                | 2                | 3   |\n| 2               | 2                | 2                | 4   |\n| 3               | 2                | 1                | 3   |\n| 4               | 2                | 0                | 2   |\n\nMaximum LNDS for `b = [1, 1, 2, 2]` is 4. This becomes our current overall maximum.\n\nThe overall maximum will be the answer.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Outer loops for `l` and `r`: O(N^2) pairs.\n*   Constructing `b`: O(N) (slicing and reversing).\n*   Calculating `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos`: O(N).\n*   Finding max LNDS for `b`: O(N).\n*   Total complexity: O(N^2 * (N + N + N)) = O(N^3).\n\nGiven `N <= 2000`, `N^3` would be `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`, which is too slow. We need a faster approach.\n\n**Optimization: Reusing Prefix/Suffix Sums**\n\nNotice that for a fixed `l`, as `r` changes, only the segment `a[l...r]` is affected. The parts `a[0...l-1]` and `a[r+1...n-1]` remain unchanged.\n\nLet `P1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `S2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\nThese can be precomputed in O(N).\n\nWhen we reverse `a[l...r]`:\n*   The number of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` is `P1[k]` if `k <= l`.\n*   The number of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` is `S2[k]` if `k > r`.\n\nThe tricky part is `k` falling within or across `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's fix `l` and `r`. The sequence `b` is `a_prefix + a_reversed_middle + a_suffix`.\n`a_prefix = a[0...l-1]`\n`a_reversed_middle = reversed(a[l...r])`\n`a_suffix = a[r+1...n-1]`\n\nThe LNDS for `b` is `max_k ( (count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1]) )`.\n\nConsider a split point `k`:\n1.  **`k <= l`**: The split is entirely before or at the start of the reversed segment.\n    *   1s: `P1[k]`\n    *   2s: `(count of 2s in reversed(a[l...r])) + (count of 2s in a[r+1...n-1])`\n        This is `(total_twos_in_original_a[l...r]) + S2[r+1]`.\n        `total_twos_in_original_a[l...r]` can be calculated as `S2[l] - S2[r+1]`.\n        So, `P1[k] + (S2[l] - S2[r+1]) + S2[r+1] = P1[k] + S2[l]`.\n    This part is constant for a fixed `l` and `r` when `k <= l`. This is incorrect. The 2s are from `b[k...n-1]`.\n    `b[k...n-1]` consists of `a[k...l-1]` (if `k<l`), `reversed(a[l...r])`, and `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n    The count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` is `(S2[k] - S2[l])` (from `a[k...l-1]`) + `(count of 2s in reversed(a[l...r]))` + `S2[r+1]`.\n    Count of 2s in `reversed(a[l...r])` is the same as count of 2s in `a[l...r]`. This is `S2[l] - S2[r+1]`.\n    So, for `k <= l`, LNDS contribution is `P1[k] + (S2[k] - S2[l]) + (S2[l] - S2[r+1]) + S2[r+1] = P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n    This means if `k <= l`, reversing `a[l...r]` has no effect on the LNDS calculation for this `k`.\n    The length is simply `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n\n2.  **`k > r`**: The split is entirely after the reversed segment.\n    *   1s: `(count of 1s in a[0...l-1]) + (count of 1s in reversed(a[l...r])) + (count of 1s in a[r+1...k-1])`\n        This is `P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[l]) + (P1[k] - P1[r+1]) = P1[k]`.\n        This is incorrect. The 1s are from `b[0...k-1]`.\n        `b[0...k-1]` consists of `a[0...l-1]`, `reversed(a[l...r])`, and `a[r+1...k-1]`.\n        Count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` is `P1[l]` + `(count of 1s in reversed(a[l...r]))` + `(P1[k] - P1[r+1])`.\n        Count of 1s in `reversed(a[l...r])` is the same as count of 1s in `a[l...r]`. This is `P1[r+1] - P1[l]`.\n        So, for `k > r`, LNDS contribution is `P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[l]) + (P1[k] - P1[r+1]) + S2[k] = P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n    This also means if `k > r`, reversing `a[l...r]` has no effect on the LNDS calculation for this `k`.\n    The length is simply `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n\n    **Conclusion for `k <= l` or `k > r`:** The LNDS contribution for such split points `k` is simply `P1[k] + S2[k]`, which is the LNDS length if no reversal happened. The maximum of these is `max(P1[k] + S2[k])` over all `k`. This is the LNDS of the original sequence. So, our answer must be at least this value.\n\n3.  **`l < k <= r`**: The split point `k` is inside the reversed segment.\n    *   1s: `P1[l]` (from `a[0...l-1]`) + `(count of 1s in reversed(a[l...k-1]))`.\n        `reversed(a[l...k-1])` corresponds to `a[r-(k-1-l)...r]` in the original sequence.\n        The count of 1s in `reversed(a[l...k-1])` is the same as the count of 1s in `a[l...k-1]`. This is `P1[k] - P1[l]`.\n        So, the 1s part is `P1[l] + (P1[k] - P1[l]) = P1[k]`.\n        Wait, this is incorrect. `reversed(a[l...k-1])` is not `a[l...k-1]`.\n        Let's be precise. `b[0...k-1]` consists of `a[0...l-1]` and `reversed(a[l...k-1])`.\n        The count of 1s in `a[0...l-1]` is `P1[l]`.\n        The count of 1s in `reversed(a[l...k-1])` is the count of 1s in `a[l...k-1]` *if* `a[l...k-1]` was *not* reversed.\n        But it *is* reversed. The elements `a[l], ..., a[k-1]` are now `a[k-1], ..., a[l]`.\n        The count of 1s in `reversed(a[l...k-1])` is the count of 1s in `a[l...k-1]`. This is `P1[k] - P1[l]`.\n        So, the 1s part is `P1[l] + (P1[k] - P1[l]) = P1[k]`. This logic seems to hold.\n\n    *   2s: `(count of 2s in reversed(a[k...r]))` + `S2[r+1]` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n        The count of 2s in `reversed(a[k...r])` is the same as the count of 2s in `a[k...r]`. This is `S2[k] - S2[r+1]`.\n        So, the 2s part is `(S2[k] - S2[r+1]) + S2[r+1] = S2[k]`.\n\n    This means for any `k`, the sum `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])` is *always* `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n    This implies that reversing a segment `a[l...r]` does not change the LNDS length at all! This cannot be true, as shown by the example.\n\nMy interpretation of `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1])` etc. is flawed.\nThe elements of `b` are `b[i]`.\n`b[j]` is `a[j]` for `j < l`.\n`b[j]` is `a[l+r-j]` for `l <= j <= r`.\n`b[j]` is `a[j]` for `j > r`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\n`count_ones(idx_end)`: number of 1s in `b[0...idx_end]`\n`count_twos(idx_start)`: number of 2s in `b[idx_start...n-1]`\n\n`current_max_lnds = 0`\n\nIterate `l` from 0 to `n-1`.\n  Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n    `temp_b = a[0:l] + a[l:r+1][::-1] + a[r+1:n]`\n\n    `local_max_lnds = 0`\n    `prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)`\n    `suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)`\n\n    For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:\n      `prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if temp_b[i] == 1 else 0)`\n    For `i` from `n-1` down to 0:\n      `suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if temp_b[i] == 2 else 0)`\n\n    For `k` from 0 to `n`:\n      `local_max_lnds = max(local_max_lnds, prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k])`\n\n    `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, local_max_lnds)`\n\nThis is the O(N^3) approach. The issue is `temp_b` construction and `prefix_ones/suffix_twos` calculation inside the loops.\n\nLet's try to optimize `prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k]` calculation for a fixed `l, r`.\nThe values `P1[i]` (prefix 1s in original `a`) and `S2[i]` (suffix 2s in original `a`) are precomputed.\n`P1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n`S2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor a split point `k`:\nThe number of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` is:\n*   If `k <= l`: `P1[k]`\n*   If `k > r`: `P1[l]` (from `a[0...l-1]`) + `(P1[r+1] - P1[l])` (from `a[l...r]`, which is reversed) + `(P1[k] - P1[r+1])` (from `a[r+1...k-1]`). This simplifies to `P1[k]`.\n*   If `l < k <= r`: `P1[l]` (from `a[0...l-1]`) + `(count of 1s in reversed(a[l...k-1]))`.\n    `reversed(a[l...k-1])` corresponds to `a[r-(k-1-l)...r]` in the original sequence.\n    The segment `a[l...k-1]` has `P1[k] - P1[l]` ones.\n    The segment `a[k...r]` has `P1[r+1] - P1[k]` ones.\n    When `a[l...r]` is reversed, `a[l...k-1]` becomes the suffix of the reversed part, and `a[k...r]` becomes the prefix.\n    The 1s we pick are from `a[0...l-1]` and then from `reversed(a[l...k-1])`.\n    This means we need to count 1s in `a[0...l-1]` AND 1s in `a[k...r]` (since `a[k...r]` is now at the beginning of the reversed segment).\n    So, `P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[k])`.\n\nThe number of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` is:\n*   If `k <= l`: `S2[k]` (from `a[k...l-1]`) + `(S2[l] - S2[r+1])` (from `a[l...r]`, which is reversed) + `S2[r+1]` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`). This simplifies to `S2[k]`.\n*   If `k > r`: `S2[k]`\n*   If `l < k <= r`: `(count of 2s in reversed(a[k...r]))` + `S2[r+1]` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n    This means we need to count 2s in `a[l...k-1]` (since `a[l...k-1]` is now at the end of the reversed segment) AND 2s in `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n    So, `(S2[l] - S2[k]) + S2[r+1]`.\n\nLet's summarize the LNDS length for a split point `k` given reversal `[l, r]`:\n\n1.  **`k <= l`**: `P1[k] + S2[k]` (LNDS of original array at split `k`)\n2.  **`k > r`**: `P1[k] + S2[k]` (LNDS of original array at split `k`)\n3.  **`l < k <= r`**: `(P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[k]))` (1s) + `((S2[l] - S2[k]) + S2[r+1])` (2s)\n    This simplifies to `P1[l] + P1[r+1] - P1[k] + S2[l] - S2[k] + S2[r+1]`.\n\nSo, for each `l, r`:\nWe need to calculate `max_k (P1[k] + S2[k])` for `k <= l` and `k > r`. This is simply the LNDS of the original array. Let this be `max_orig_lnds`.\nAnd we need to calculate `max_k (P1[l] + P1[r+1] - P1[k] + S2[l] - S2[k] + S2[r+1])` for `l < k <= r`.\nThis can be rewritten as `(P1[l] + S2[l] + P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) - (P1[k] + S2[k])`.\nLet `C = P1[l] + S2[l] + P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]`. This is constant for fixed `l, r`.\nWe need to find `C - min_k (P1[k] + S2[k])` for `l < k <= r`.\n\nSo, for each `l, r`:\n`current_max = max_orig_lnds`\n`min_val_in_middle = infinity`\nFor `k` from `l+1` to `r`:\n  `min_val_in_middle = min(min_val_in_middle, P1[k] + S2[k])`\nIf `l+1 <= r` (i.e., the middle segment is not empty):\n  `current_max = max(current_max, (P1[l] + S2[l] + P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) - min_val_in_middle)`\n\nThis is still O(N^3) because `min_val_in_middle` is computed in O(N) for each `l, r`.\n\nWe need to optimize finding `min_k (P1[k] + S2[k])` for `l < k <= r`.\nThis is a Range Minimum Query (RMQ) problem. We can use a segment tree or sparse table, but that adds complexity.\nA simpler approach:\nFix `l`. Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nAs `r` increases, the range `l < k <= r` expands.\n`min_val_in_middle` can be updated in O(1).\n`min_val_in_middle` for `r` is `min(min_val_in_middle` for `r-1`, `P1[r] + S2[r])`.\n\n**Optimized Algorithm (O(N^2)):**\n\n1.  **Precompute `P1` and `S2` arrays:**\n    `P1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `P1` has size `n+1`.\n    `S2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S2` has size `n+1`.\n    This takes O(N) time.\n\n2.  **Calculate `max_orig_lnds`:**\n    `max_orig_lnds = 0`\n    For `k` from 0 to `n`:\n        `max_orig_lnds = max(max_orig_lnds, P1[k] + S2[k])`\n    This takes O(N) time.

Correct.\nAh, my `S2` array values were wrong in the trace.\n`a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\n`S2[4] = 0`\n`S2[3] = S2[4] + (1 if a[3]==2 else 0) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n`S2[2] = S2[3] + (1 if a[2]==2 else 0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n`S2[1] = S2[2] + (1 if a[1]==2 else 0) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n`S2[0] = S2[1] + (1 if a[0]==2 else 0) = 2 + 0 = 2`\nSo `S2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`. This is correct.\n\nLet's re-trace `k=1, l=1`.\n`P1_b[1] = P1[1] = 1`. Correct.\n`S2_b[1] = S2[1] = 2`. Correct.\nSo `P1_b[1]+S2_b[1] = 1+2=3`.\nThe formula `P1[k]+S2[k]` for `k <= l` is `P1[1]+S2[1] = 1+2=3`. This matches.\nMy `S2` array was correct, but I wrote `S2[1]=1` in the trace explanation earlier.\nSo `k<=l` and `k>r` cases are correctly handled by `P1[k]+S2[k]`.\n\nNow for `l < k <= r`.\n`l=1, r=2`. `k=2`.\n`P1_b[2] = P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[r-(k-1-l)])`\n`P1_b[2] = P1[1] + (P1[3] - P1[2-(2-1-1)])`\n`P1_b[2] = P1[1] + (P1[3] - P1[2])`\n`P1_b[2] = 1 + (2 - 1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\nThis matches `P1_b[2]=2` from direct computation.\n\n`S2_b[2] = (S2[l] - S2[k]) + S2[r+1]`\n`S2_b[2] = (S2[1] - S2[2]) + S2[3]`\n`S2_b[2] = (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\nThis matches `S2_b[2]=2` from direct computation.\n\nSo, for `l=1, r=2, k=2`:\nLNDS length is `P1_b[2]+S2_b[2] = 2+2=4`.\nMy formula `(P1[l] + S2[l] + P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) - (P1[r-(k-1-l)] + S2[k])` should yield this.\n`P1[1]+S2[1] + P1[3]+S2[3] - (P1[2] + S2[2])`\n`= (1+2) + (2+1) - (1+1)`\n`= 3 + 3 - 2 = 4`. This is correct!\n\nThe issue was my previous calculation `P1[r-(k-1-l)] + S2[k]` was `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\nIt should be `P1[r-(k-1-l)] + S2[k]`.\n\nLet `val_to_minimize = P1[r-x] + S2[l+1+x]`.\n`x` goes from `0` to `r-l-1`.\nWhen `r=l`, `r-l-1 = -1`.

This is for `l < k <= r`.\n\n        Similarly, `S2_b[k] = (count of 2s in reversed(a[k...r])) + S2[r+1]`.\n        `reversed(a[k...r])` means `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[k]` appear in `b` in that order.\n        The count of 2s in `reversed(a[k...r])` is simply the count of 2s in `a[k...r]`.\n        This is `S2[k] - S2[r+1]`.\n        So, `S2_b[k] = (S2[k] - S2[r+1]) + S2[r+1] = S2[k]`. This is for `l < k <= r`.\n\n        This means that for `l < k <= r`, `P1_b[k] + S2_b[k]` is simply `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n        This implies that reversing a segment `a[l...r]` does *not* change the LNDS length for split points `k` *inside* the reversed segment.\n        This is utterly wrong. The example proves it. `[1,2,1,2]` -> `[1,1,2,2]`. Original `k=2` LNDS: `P1[2]+S2[2]=1+1=2`. New `k=2` LNDS: `P1_b[2]+S2_b[2]=2+2=4`.\n\n        The core misunderstanding is in `count of 1s in reversed(a[l...k-1])`.\n        A non-decreasing subsequence is formed by picking elements `b[p1], b[p2], ...`.\n        If `k` is the split point, 1s come from `b[0...k-1]` and 2s from `b[k...n-1]`.\n        The elements `b[0...l-1]` are `a[0...l-1]`.\n        The elements `b[l...r]` are `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\n        The elements `b[r+1...n-1]` are `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\n        For `l < k <= r`:\n        1s are picked from `b[0...k-1]`.

Let `idx = r-j+l`.\n        So, we need to minimize `P1[idx] + S2[idx]` where `idx` is `r-j+l`.\n        As `j` goes from `l` to `r-1`:\n        `j=l`: `idx = r-l+l = r`.\n        `j=l+1`: `idx = r-(l+1)+l = r-1`.\n        ...\n        `j=r-1`: `idx = r-(r-1)+l = l+1`.\n        So, `idx` ranges from `l+1` to `r` in decreasing order.\n\n        Therefore, we need to minimize `P1[idx] + S2[idx]` for `idx` in `[l+1, r]`.\n        This is the same as `min_{idx in [l+1, r]} (P1[idx] + S2[idx])`.\n        This is exactly `min_val_in_middle_segment` that I had in my O(N^2) code.\n\n        The formula `(P1[l] + S2[l] + P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) - min_{idx in [l+1, r]} (P1[idx] + S2[idx])` is correct!\n\n        Let's re-run the second example `l=2, r=6` with this final formula and correct `P1, S2`.\n        `a = [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]`\n        `P1 = [0,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4]`\n        `S2 = [5,5,5,4,3,2,2,2,1,0,0]`\n\n        `max_orig_lnds = 0`\n        `k=0: P1[0]+S2[0] = 0+5=5`\n        `k=1: P1[1]+S2[1] = 1+5=6`\n        `k=2: P1[2]+S2[2] = 2+5=7`\n        `k=3: P1[3]+S2[3] = 2+4=6`\n        `k=4: P1[4]+S2[4] = 2+3=5`\n        `k=5: P1[5]+S2[5] = 2+2=4`\n        `k=6: P1[6]+S2[6] = 2+2=4`\n        `k=7: P1[7]+S2[7] = 3+2=5`\n        `k=8: P1[8]+S2[8] = 4+1=5`\n        `k=9: P1[9]+S2[9] = 4+0=4`\n        `k=10: P1[10]+S2[10] = 4+0=4`\n        `max_overall_lnds` initialized to `7`.\n\n        `l=2, r=6`:\n        `min_val_in_middle_segment` needs to be `min(P1[idx]+S2[idx])` for `idx` in `[3, 6]`.\n        `idx=3: P1[3]+S2[3] = 2+4=6`\n        `idx=4: P1[4]+S2[4] = 2+3=5`\n        `idx=5: P1[5]+S2[5] = 2+2=4`\n        `idx=6: P1[6]+S2[6] = 2+2=4`\n        So, `min_val_in_middle_segment = 4`.\n\n        `current_lnds_middle_part = (P1[l]+S2[l] + P1[r+1]+S2[r+1]) - min_val_in_middle_segment`\n        `= (P1[2]+S2[2] + P1[7]+S2[7]) - 4`\n        `= (2+5 + 3+2) - 4`\n        `= (7 + 5) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8`.\n        `max_overall_lnds = max(7, 8) = 8`.

The LNDS definition is clear.\n        The issue must be in my formula, or my understanding of how LNDS is formed.\n        The LNDS of `b` is `max_k (count of 1s in b[0...k-1] + count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`. This is universally true for elements 1 and 2.\n\n        Let `C1_b[k] = count of 1s in b[0...k-1]`.\n        Let `C2_b[k] = count of 2s in b[k...n-1]`.\n\n        `C1_b[k]`\n        if `k <= l`: `P1[k]`\n        if `k > r`: `P1[l] + (P1[r+1]-P1[l]) + (P1[k]-P1[r+1]) = P1[k]` (1s in original `a[0...k-1]`)\n        if `l < k <= r`: `P1[l] + (P1[r+1]-P1[r-(k-1-l)])` (1s in `a[0...l-1]` + 1s in `a[r-(k-1-l)...r]`)\n\n        `C2_b[k]`\n        if `k <= l`: `(S2[k]-S2[l]) + (S2[l]-S2[r+1]) + S2[r+1] = S2[k]` (2s in original `a[k...n-1]`)\n        if `k > r`: `S2[k]`\n        if `l < k <= r`: `(S2[l]-S2[r-(k-l)+1]) + S2[r+1]` (2s in `a[l...r-(k-l)]` + 2s in `a[r+1...n-1]`)\n\n        The `max_overall_lnds` must be initialized with the LNDS of the original array.\n        `max_overall_lnds = max_{0 <= k <= n} (P1[k] + S2[k])`. This covers `k <= l` and `k > r` cases.\n\n        For `l < k <= r`:\n        We need to maximize `(P1[l] + P1[r+1] - P1[r-(k-1-l)]) + (S2[l] - S2[r-(k-l)+1] + S2[r+1])`.\n        Let `j = k-1`.

With the correct `P1` array, the formula `P1_b[k] = P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[r-(k-1-l)])` is correct.\n\n        Now, for `S2_b[k]`:\n        `S2_b[k] = (S2[l] - S2[r-(k-l)+1]) + S2[r+1]`\n        For `l=2, r=6, k=4`:\n        `S2[l]=S2[2]=5`.\n        `S2[r+1]=S2[7]=2`.\n        `r-(k-l)+1 = 6-(4-2)+1 = 6-2+1 = 5`.\n        `S2[r-(k-l)+1] = S2[5]=2`.\n        `S2_b[4] = (S2[2] - S2[5]) + S2[7] = (5-2) + 2 = 3+2=5`.\n        This matches `S2_b[4]=5`.\n\n        So, the formulas for `P1_b[k]` and `S2_b[k]` for `l < k <= r` are correct.\n        This means the resulting expression `(P1[l] + S2[l] + P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) - (P1[r-(k-1-l)] + S2[r-(k-l)+1])` is correct.\n        And the optimization `min_{idx in [l+1, r]} (P1[idx] + S2[idx+1])` is also correct.\n\n        So, the code should work now.
