You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition & Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. It's about maximizing a number, `a`, by strategically replacing its digits with digits from another sequence, `s`.  The key constraints are: each digit in `s` can be used only once, and each position in `a` can be replaced at most once.  My goal is to figure out the *largest* possible number I can create.\n\nMy thought process immediately gravitates towards a greedy approach. To maximize a number, I need to make the leftmost (most significant) digits as large as possible.  Since the length of `a` remains constant after replacements, that's my main focus.\n\nHere's how I'm breaking it down:\n\n1.  **Iterate Left-to-Right:** I'll process the digits of `a` from left to right.\n2.  **Maximize at Each Position:** For each digit in `a`, I'll check if I can replace it with a larger digit from `s`. I need to ensure that the replacement makes the *entire* number larger, not just that specific digit.  A replacement with a *smaller* digit would negate the greedy strategy.\n3.  **Use Largest Available:** To efficiently find the largest possible replacement digit, I'll first sort the digits from `s` in descending order. This way, I can quickly pick the largest available digit and see if it's suitable.\n4.  **No Replacement if Ineffective:** If the largest available digit from `s` is not *greater* than the current digit in `a`, then there's no point in replacing it. Since I'm processing left-to-right, no other digit from `s` will do a better job and since any replacement can only improve the number if it is greater than the current value, it would only get smaller.\n5.  **Data Structures:** I'll represent `a` as a list of characters (or digits) to allow modifications, and sort the digits of `s` in reverse for easy access to the largest remaining digit.\n\nBasically, I'm aiming for a \"biggest first\" strategy, checking if a replacement is beneficial at each position and making the change only if it increases the overall value of the number. It's a localized optimization aiming for a globally optimal solution.\n",
