Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Candle Conundrum: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this classic \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I'm itching to solve it with a Python script. It's a fun little simulation. Vasily starts with a bunch of candles, each burning for an hour. But here's the twist: he can recycle the stubs, making new candles! The goal is to maximize the total burn time.\n\nThe core of my approach is going to be a loop. I need to keep track of a few key things: the total hours lit, the current number of new candles, and the number of burned-out candles Vasily has. The loop will simulate the burning and recycling process.\n\nInside the loop, I'll first check if I have any new candles. If so, I'll add those hours to the total, update the burned-out candle count, and zero out the new candle count (since they're all now used).\n\nNext, I need to see how many new candles I can make from the burned-out ones. I'll use integer division (`//`) to find out how many full sets of `b` stubs I can combine. The remainder, using the modulo operator (`%`), are the stubs that can't be recycled immediately. I'll add the new candles to the `current_new_candles` counter, and update the `burned_out_candles` counter to reflect the leftovers.\n\nThe loop keeps running as long as Vasily has any new candles to light at the beginning of the iteration.\n\nI've even done a quick walkthrough with the example `a=4` and `b=2` to be sure I understand the logic and how the variables change. This should be a straightforward translation into Python. The tricky part will be ensuring I handle the integer divisions and remainders correctly. This shouldn't be too challenging, but I'll make sure to double-check my work!\n",
