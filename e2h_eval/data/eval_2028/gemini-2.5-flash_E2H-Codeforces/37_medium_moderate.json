    "thought": "**Solving the Gluttony Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core challenge is this \"Gluttony\" problem. We're given an array of distinct integers, and the goal is to rearrange them (a permutation) such that the sums of all non-empty, proper subsets are unique between the original and the permuted array. The constraint on the size, up to 22, suggests a potential for exponential complexity, but we need to be careful.\n\nInitially, I thought about all the edge cases. For a single element, any permutation works. For two elements, swapping them does the trick. Then, for larger arrays, the constraint on subsets is the real hurdle.\n\nI started digging into the math, specifically the sums of subsets. If the sums are equal, we've got a problem.  I considered constructing the permutation, but checking all the sums would be too slow. This is where I thought about the cyclic shift. It's a simple, elegant permutation, and it seemed like a good starting point. So the permutation `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]` came to mind after sorting `a`.\n\nI tried it with some examples, thinking maybe it always works. For the values to be powers of two, it worked easily. Then, I realized that if the cyclic shift does *not* work, we need to return -1. But it would be odd if we had to return -1 since we can permute `a` in other ways.\n\nNext, I focused on analyzing the sums. I sorted the original array `a` and then built a cyclic shift permutation.  I then converted the problem into a subset sum problem on the differences between adjacent sorted elements. This got me thinking -  a key to whether it works is that  the cyclic shift approach works if the target `a[n-1]-a[0]` (from the sorted array) can NOT be expressed as the sum of a proper non-empty subset of the differences.\n\nI spent time crafting a function to perform this subset sum check, and then tested it. If the check came back `True`, I knew the cyclic shift worked. If `False`, something more complex would have to occur. But as I thought about it, a permutation might always exist given the problem statement. The question is if one does not exist or if it is always guaranteed. After working it out, it seemed like the cyclic shift does always work and there is never a -1 case.\n\nLet's test the logic and implement a Python script. If the cyclic shift works after sorting the array, then that is our solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)` for all `S` where `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and properties:\n1. `n` (array size) is between 1 and 22. This suggests that solutions with complexity up to `O(n * 2^n)` or `O(n^2 * 2^n)` might be acceptable.\n2. `a` contains `n` distinct integers.\n3. `0 <= a_i <= 10^9`.\n\n**Case n=1:**\nIf `n=1`, the condition `0 < |S| < n` becomes `0 < |S| < 1`, which means there are no such subsets `S`. Thus, any permutation `b` works. Since `b` must be a permutation of `a`, `b` must be `a` itself. So, `a[0]` is a valid output.\n\n**Case n=2:**\nIf `n=2`, `a = [a_0, a_1]`. The condition `0 < |S| < 2` means `|S|=1`.\nThe subsets are `S={0}` and `S={1}`.\nFor `S={0}`: `a[0] != b[0]`.\nFor `S={1}`: `a[1] != b[1]`.\nSince `b` must be a permutation of `a`, the only way to satisfy these conditions is `b[0] = a[1]` and `b[1] = a[0]`. This is a swap. Since `a` contains distinct integers, `a_0 != a_1`, so this permutation is well-defined and always works. For example, if `a=[1, 2]`, `b=[2, 1]`.\n\n**General Case (n > 2):**\nA common strategy in competitive programming for such problems is to try a simple, structured permutation. A cyclic shift is a good candidate.\nLet's first sort the array `a` in ascending order: `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nConsider constructing `b` by cyclically shifting `a`: `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nSo, `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\n\nLet's check the condition `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)`.\nSubstituting `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}`, we need `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(a[(i+1)%n] for i in S)`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum(a[i] - a[(i+1)%n] for i in S) != 0`.\n\nLet `x_i = a[i] - a[(i+1)%n]`.\nFor our sorted `a`, the values `x_i` are:\n`x_0 = a_0 - a_1` (negative)\n`x_1 = a_1 - a_2` (negative)\n...\n`x_{n-2} = a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}` (negative)\n`x_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0` (positive, since `a_{n-1}` is the largest and `a_0` is the smallest)\n\nThe sum of all `x_i` is `(a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_0) = 0` (it's a telescoping sum).\nWe need to check if there exists a subset of indices `S` such that `0 < |S| < n` and `sum(x_i for i in S) = 0`.\nIf such an `S` exists, this cyclic shift fails. Otherwise, it works.\n\nLet `P = x_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0`. This is the only positive `x_i`.\nAll other `x_i` (for `i=0, ..., n-2`) are negative. Let `N_i = x_i`.\nIf `sum(x_i for i in S) = 0` for some `S`, then `S` must contain `P` (otherwise, all elements in the sum are negative, and a non-empty sum cannot be zero).\nSo, we are looking for a subset `S'` of `{0, ..., n-2}` such that `P + sum(N_i for i in S') = 0`.\nThis means `sum(N_i for i in S') = -P`.\nLet `D_j = -N_j = a_{j+1} - a_j` for `j=0, ..., n-2`. These are all positive.\nWe are looking for `sum(D_j for j in S') = P = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nThe set of values `D_j` is `{a_1-a_0, a_2-a_1, ..., a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}}`.\nThe sum of all `D_j` is `(a_1-a_0) + (a_2-a_1) + ... + (a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}) = a_{n-1}-a_0`.\nSo, `P` can always be formed by summing *all* elements in `{D_0, ..., D_{n-2}}`. This corresponds to `S = {0, ..., n-1}` (the full set of indices for `x_i`), which is explicitly excluded by the problem condition `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nTherefore, the cyclic shift fails if and only if `a_{n-1} - a_0` can be formed by a *proper non-empty subset* of `{a_1-a_0, a_2-a_1, ..., a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}}`.\nLet `diffs = [a[i+1] - a[i] for i in range(n-1)]`.\nWe need to check if `target_sum = a[n-1] - a[0]` can be formed by a proper non-empty subset of `diffs`.\nThe number of elements in `diffs` is `n-1`. Since `n <= 22`, `n-1 <= 21`.\nWe can check all `2^(n-1)` subset sums.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and array `a`.\n2. If `n=1`, print `a[0]` and exit.\n3. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n4. Construct `b_candidate` as the cyclic shift: `b_candidate = a[1:] + a[:1]`.\n5. Check if `b_candidate` is a valid solution:\n   a. Create `diffs = [a[i+1] - a[i] for i in range(n-1)]`.\n   b. Calculate `target_sum = a[n-1] - a[0]`.\n   c. Iterate through all masks `m` from `1` to `2^(n-1) - 2` (to represent proper non-empty subsets of `diffs`).\n   d. For each mask `m`, calculate `current_sum = sum(diffs[j] for j in range(n-1) if (m >> j) & 1)`.\n   e. If `current_sum == target_sum`, then `b_candidate` is not valid. In competitive programming contexts, when a constructive solution is found to fail, and no other simple construction is apparent, it often means no solution exists. Given the problem constraints and type, it's highly likely that if this specific cyclic shift fails, there is no solution, and we should print `-1`.\n6. If the loop completes without finding such a `current_sum`, then `b_candidate` is valid. Print `b_candidate`.\n\n**Why this specific cyclic shift is sufficient:**\nIt turns out that for `n >= 3`, if the cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}` (on sorted `a`) fails, it implies `a_k = a_{k+1}` for some `k`, which contradicts distinctness, or `a_0=a_{n-1}` which is also impossible.\nSpecifically, `sum_{j in S'} (a_{j+1} - a_j) = a_{n-1} - a_0` where `S'` is a proper non-empty subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nLet `S'` be `{s_1, ..., s_m}` where `m < n-1`.\n` (a_{s_1+1} - a_{s_1}) + ... + (a_{s_m+1} - a_{s_m}) = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nIf the `s_j` indices are consecutive, say `S' = {k, k+1, ..., l}`, then the sum is `a_{l+1} - a_k`.\nSo `a_{l+1} - a_k = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nSince `a` is sorted, `a_0 < a_k` and `a_{l+1} < a_{n-1}` (because `S'` is proper and non-empty, so `k>0` or `l+1<n-1`).\nIf `k=0`, then `a_{l+1} - a_0 = a_{n-1} - a_0`, implying `a_{l+1} = a_{n-1}`. Since `l+1 < n-1`, this is impossible as `a` is strictly increasing.\nIf `l+1=n-1`, then `a_{n-1} - a_k = a_{n-1} - a_0`, implying `a_k = a_0`. Since `k > 0`, this is impossible.\nIf `k>0` and `l+1<n-1`, then `a_{l+1}-a_k < a_{n-1}-a_0`. So equality is impossible.\nThe non-consecutive case is more complex, but the underlying principle remains: `sum(a_{j+1}-a_j)` over a proper subset of indices will always be strictly less than `a_{n-1}-a_0`. This is because each `a_{j+1}-a_j` is positive, and removing any term from the full sum `a_{n-1}-a_0` makes the sum smaller.\nThus, the cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}` (after sorting `a`) *always* works for `n >= 3`.\n\nThis means the subset sum check will always return `True` (i.e., no proper non-empty subset sums to `target_sum`).\nThe `if current_sum == target_sum:` condition will never be met for `i != (1 << num_diffs) - 1`.\n\nSo the simplified algorithm is:\n1. Read `n` and array `a`.\n2. If `n=1`, print `a[0]` and exit.\n3. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n4. Construct `b` as the cyclic shift: `b = a[1:] + a[:1]`.\n5. Print `b`.\n\nThis simpler logic covers `n=1` and `n=2` correctly as well.\nFor `n=1`, `a[0]` is printed.\nFor `n=2`, `a=[a0, a1]` becomes `[a1, a0]` after cyclic shift.\n\nLet's re-check the example: `n=4`, `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\nSorted `a` is `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\nCyclic shift `b` is `[10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\nThis is different from the example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`, but the problem says \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\" So `[10, 100, 1000, 1]` should be a valid answer.\n\nThe analysis that `sum(D_j for j in S') = P` cannot hold for a proper non-empty `S'` relies on the fact that `D_j = a_{j+1} - a_j > 0`. If `a` contains distinct integers, then `a_{j+1} > a_j` for all `j` after sorting, so `D_j >= 1`.\nSince all `D_j` are positive, any proper non-empty subset sum `sum_{j in S'} D_j` will be strictly less than `sum_{j=0}^{n-2} D_j = P`.\nThis means `sum_{j in S'} D_j = P` can only happen if `S'` is the full set `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nTherefore, the cyclic shift *always* works for `n >= 3`.\n\nThe problem statement implies there might be cases where no such array `b` exists (print -1). My analysis suggests that the cyclic shift always works. This is a common pattern in competitive programming: a simple construction is often the intended solution if it's not immediately obvious why it fails. The \"print -1\" condition might be a red herring, or exist for `n=0` or other boundary/degenerate cases not covered by `1 <= n <= 22`.\n\nFinal simplified algorithm:\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read array `a`.\n3. Sort `a`.\n4. Construct `b` by cyclically shifting `a`: `b = a[1:] + a[:1]`.\n5. Print elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array a.
