    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Minimizing Nodes for Reachability**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. My goal is to figure out the bare minimum number of nodes, `n`, needed to build a directed graph where exactly `p` pairs of nodes are mutually reachable. Then, I want the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in any such graph.\n\nFirst, let's unpack this \"p-reachable\" thing. It means we have exactly `p` pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v`, and there are paths both from `u` to `v` and from `v` to `u`. That screams \"strongly connected component\" to me. Two nodes being reachable from each other just means they're stuck in the same SCC.\n\nNow, with an SCC of size `k`, any two nodes within it can reach each other. So, within that SCC, we have `k * (k - 1) / 2` such ordered pairs. We need to sum these up across all SCCs.\n\nTo keep `n` as small as possible, I want the SCCs to be as big as I can possibly make them. It makes sense to concentrate the \"reachability\" into as few nodes as I can. So, I need to find the smallest number of nodes, `k`, where I can get at least `p` reachable pairs, `k * (k - 1) / 2 >= p`.\n\nThat `k * (k - 1) / 2` function is key. It's monotonically increasing, so I can just iterate through `k` values starting from 1 until I find the smallest one, `k_min`, that gives me enough pairs. Then, if `k_min * (k_min - 1) / 2` equals `p` exactly, I'm done – a single SCC of size `k_min` is the most efficient. Otherwise, I will have more than needed, but that's not a problem for the minimum number of nodes.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all `p`-reachable graphs with `n` nodes.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n\n**1. `p`-reachable graph:**\nA graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n\"Reachable from each other\" means `u` and `v` belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are mutually reachable. The number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` from these `k` nodes is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nTo minimize the total number of nodes `n` for a given `p`, we should try to pack as many `p` pairs as possible into a single SCC.\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` be the number of `(u, v)` pairs with `u < v` in an SCC of size `k`.\nWe need to find the smallest `k` such that `f(k) >= p`. Let this be `k_0`.\nWe can find `k_0` by iterating `k = 0, 1, 2, ...` and checking `k * (k - 1) / 2 >= p`.\nSince `p` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, `k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2` is approximately `k_0^2 / 2`. So `k_0^2` is about `4 * 10^5`, meaning `k_0` is about `sqrt(4 * 10^5) = sqrt(40 * 10^4) = 200 * sqrt(10) \\approx 632`. A loop up to `k=700` or `800` is efficient enough.\n\nOnce we find `k_0` such that `f(k_0 - 1) < p <= f(k_0)`:\n- If `f(k_0) = p`, we can form a single SCC of size `k_0`. The minimum number of nodes `n` is `k_0`.\n- If `f(k_0) > p`, we cannot achieve exactly `p` pairs with a single SCC of size `k_0`. We must use `k_0 - 1` nodes in an SCC, which gives `f(k_0 - 1)` pairs. The remaining `p - f(k_0 - 1)` pairs must come from nodes outside this SCC. To minimize `n`, each additional pair `(u, v)` (with `u < v`) must come from a separate SCC of size 2. Each such SCC adds 2 nodes and 1 pair. So we need `p - f(k_0 - 1)` such SCCs.\n  The total number of nodes `n` would be `(k_0 - 1) + 2 * (p - f(k_0 - 1))`.\n\nLet's summarize the minimum number of nodes `n`:\nFirst, find the smallest `k_0` such that `k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2 >= p`.\nThen, `n = (k_0 - 1) + 2 * (p - (k_0 - 1) * (k_0 - 2) / 2)`.\nThis formula covers both cases:\n- If `p = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2`, then `p - (k_0 - 1) * (k_0 - 2) / 2 = k_0 - 1`.\n  So `n = (k_0 - 1) + 2 * (k_0 - 1) = 3 * (k_0 - 1)`. This is incorrect.\n  Let's re-evaluate.\n  The number of pairs is `p`.\n  We find largest `k` such that `k * (k-1) / 2 <= p`. Let this be `k_scc`.\n  The number of pairs remaining is `p_rem = p - k_scc * (k_scc - 1) / 2`.\n  These `p_rem` pairs must come from `p_rem` additional SCCs of size 2. Each such SCC uses 2 nodes.\n  So, the minimum number of nodes `n = k_scc + 2 * p_rem`.\n\n**Example:**\n- If `p=0`: `k_scc=0`. `p_rem = 0`. `n = 0 + 2*0 = 0`.\n- If `p=1`: `k_scc=2` (`2*(1)/2 = 1`). `p_rem = 0`. `n = 2 + 2*0 = 2`.\n- If `p=3`: `k_scc=3` (`3*(2)/2 = 3`). `p_rem = 0`. `n = 3 + 2*0 = 3`.\n- If `p=4`: `k_scc=3` (`3*(2)/2 = 3`). `p_rem = 4-3=1`. `n = 3 + 2*1 = 5`.\nThis logic for `n` seems correct.\n\n**2. Maximum number of unidirectional pairs:**\nA pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there is NO path from `v` to `u`.\nThis means `u` and `v` are NOT in the same SCC, and `u` can reach `v`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to create paths between nodes in different SCCs, but only in one direction.\nThe structure that maximizes such paths is a \"chain\" of SCCs.\nIf we have SCCs `S_1, S_2, ..., S_m` and add edges such that there is a path from any node in `S_i` to any node in `S_j` if `i < j`, but no path from `S_j` to `S_i` if `i < j`.\nFor any two nodes `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` with `i < j`:\n- There is a path `u -> v`.\n- There is no path `v -> u`.\nSo, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair.\nThe number of such pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} |S_i| * |S_j|`.\n\nIn our construction for `n` nodes:\nWe have one main SCC of size `k_scc`. Let's call it `S_0`.\nWe have `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. Let's call them `S_1, S_2, ..., S_{p_rem}`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we arrange them in a chain: `S_0 -> S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_{p_rem}`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is:\n`|S_0| * (|S_1| + |S_2| + ... + |S_{p_rem}|)` (pairs from `S_0` to later SCCs)\n`+ |S_1| * (|S_2| + ... + |S_{p_rem}|)` (pairs from `S_1` to later SCCs)\n`...`\n`+ |S_{p_rem-1}| * |S_{p_rem}|` (pairs from `S_{p_rem-1}` to `S_{p_rem}`)\n\nLet `k_scc` be `k`. The remaining `p_rem` SCCs each have size 2.\nTotal nodes in these `p_rem` SCCs is `2 * p_rem`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `k * (2 * p_rem) + 2 * 2 * (p_rem * (p_rem - 1) / 2)`.\nThe second term `2 * 2 * (p_rem * (p_rem - 1) / 2)` counts pairs between the `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. Each pair of such SCCs `S_i, S_j` contributes `2 * 2 = 4` unidirectional pairs.\nSo, total unidirectional pairs = `k * (2 * p_rem) + 4 * (p_rem * (p_rem - 1) / 2)`.\nThis simplifies to `2 * k * p_rem + 2 * p_rem * (p_rem - 1)`.\n\nLet's test this formula:\n- `p=0`: `k_scc=0`, `p_rem=0`. `n=0`. Unidirectional pairs = `2*0*0 + 2*0*(-1) = 0`. Correct.\n- `p=1`: `k_scc=2`, `p_rem=0`. `n=2`. Unidirectional pairs = `2*2*0 + 2*0*(-1) = 0`. Correct. (A graph with one SCC has 0 unidirectional pairs).\n- `p=3`: `k_scc=3`, `p_rem=0`. `n=3`. Unidirectional pairs = `2*3*0 + 2*0*(-1) = 0`. Correct.\n- `p=4`: `k_scc=3`, `p_rem=1`. `n=5`. Unidirectional pairs = `2*3*1 + 2*1*(1-1) = 6 + 0 = 6`. Correct.\n  Graph: `S_0` (3 nodes) -> `S_1` (2 nodes).\n  Pairs from `S_0` to `S_1`: `3 * 2 = 6`.\n  Pairs from `S_1` to `S_0`: `0`.\n  Total unidirectional pairs: `6`.\n\nThe logic seems solid.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Calculate `k_scc`: Loop `k` from 0 upwards.\n  `k_scc = 0`\n  `while k_scc * (k_scc - 1) / 2 <= p:`\n  `  k_scc += 1`\n  `k_scc -= 1` (because the loop exits when `f(k_scc)` is *greater* than `p`, we want the largest `k` *less than or equal to* `p`)\n- Calculate `p_rem = p - k_scc * (k_scc - 1) / 2`.\n- Calculate `n = k_scc + 2 * p_rem`.\n- Calculate `unidirectional_pairs = 2 * k_scc * p_rem + 2 * p_rem * (p_rem - 1)`.\n\nEdge case `p=0`:\n`k_scc = 0` (loop `k=0`: `0 <= 0` is true, `k_scc` becomes 1. Loop `k=1`: `0 <= 0` is true, `k_scc` becomes 2. This is wrong).\nThe `k_scc` should be the largest `k` such that `k*(k-1)/2 <= p`.\nLet's find `k_scc` this way:\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while (k_scc + 1) * k_scc / 2 <= p:`\n`  k_scc += 1`\nThis will give the correct `k_scc`.\nFor `p=0`:\n`k_scc=0`. `(0+1)*0/2 = 0 <= 0`. `k_scc` becomes 1.\n`k_scc=1`. `(1+1)*1/2 = 1 <= 0` is false. Loop terminates. `k_scc` is 1.\nThis is still wrong. If `p=0`, `k_scc` should be 0.\nA simple way to find `k_scc` for `p`:\nStart `k = 0`.\n`current_p_count = 0`\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while current_p_count <= p:`\n`  k_scc += 1`\n`  current_p_count = k_scc * (k_scc - 1) // 2`\n`k_scc -= 1`\n`current_p_count = k_scc * (k_scc - 1) // 2` (This is `f(k_scc)`)\n`p_rem = p - current_p_count`\n\nLet's trace for `p=0`:\n`k_scc = 0`, `current_p_count = 0`\n`while 0 <= 0:` (true)\n  `k_scc = 1`\n  `current_p_count = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0`\n`while 0 <= 0:` (true)\n  `k_scc = 2`\n  `current_p_count = 2 * 1 // 2 = 1`\n`while 1 <= 0:` (false)\nLoop terminates.\n`k_scc` is 2.\n`k_scc -= 1` means `k_scc` becomes 1.\n`current_p_count = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0`.\n`p_rem = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n`n = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1`.\n`unidirectional_pairs = 2 * 1 * 0 + 2 * 0 * (-1) = 0`.\nOutput for `p=0`: `1 0`. Example output: `0 0`. My `n` is wrong for `p=0`.\n\nThe issue is that `k_scc=0` implies 0 nodes and 0 pairs. `k_scc=1` implies 1 node and 0 pairs.\nThe formula `k * (k-1) / 2` works for `k >= 0`.\nIf `p=0`, we need 0 pairs. This can be achieved with 0 nodes.\nIf `k_scc` is 0, then `p_rem` is 0, and `n` should be 0.\nMy loop `while current_p_count <= p` finds the smallest `k_scc` such that `f(k_scc) > p`. Then `k_scc-1` is the largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= p`.\nLet's try this:\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while True:`\n`  if (k_scc + 1) * k_scc // 2 > p:`\n`    break`\n`  k_scc += 1`\nNow `k_scc` is the largest integer such that `k_scc * (k_scc - 1) // 2 <= p`.\n\nTrace for `p=0`:\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while True:`\n  `if (0+1)*0//2 = 0 > 0:` (false)\n  `k_scc = 1`\n  `if (1+1)*1//2 = 1 > 0:` (true)\n  `break`\nLoop terminates. `k_scc` is 1.\n`current_p_count = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0`.\n`p_rem = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n`n = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1`.\n`unidirectional_pairs = 2 * 1 * 0 + 2 * 0 * (-1) = 0`.\nStill `1 0` for `p=0`. The example output is `0 0`.\n\nThe problem states \"minimum number of nodes required\". If `p=0`, 0 nodes is a valid graph with 0 `(u,v)` pairs. So `n=0` is correct.\nMy formula for `n` `k_scc + 2 * p_rem` implicitly assumes `k_scc >= 1` if `k_scc` is the size of an SCC.\nIf `k_scc` is 0, it means we don't need a main SCC.\nIf `p=0`, `k_scc` becomes 0. `p_rem` becomes 0. `n=0`. `unidirectional_pairs=0`. This is the base case.\n\nLet's adjust the `k_scc` calculation:\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while (k_scc + 1) * k_scc // 2 <= p:`\n`  k_scc += 1`\n`# k_scc is now the smallest k such that k*(k-1)/2 > p.`\n`# So, k_scc-1 is the largest k such that k*(k-1)/2 <= p.`\n`k_scc -= 1`\n\nTrace for `p=0`:\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while (0+1)*0//2 = 0 <= 0:` (true)\n  `k_scc = 1`\n`while (1+1)*1//2 = 1 <= 0:` (false)\nLoop terminates. `k_scc` is 1.\n`k_scc -= 1` becomes `k_scc = 0`.\n`current_p_count = 0 * (-1) // 2 = 0`.\n`p_rem = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n`n = k_scc + 2 * p_rem = 0 + 2 * 0 = 0`.\n`unidirectional_pairs = 2 * 0 * 0 + 2 * 0 * (-1) = 0`.\nThis gives `0 0` for `p=0`.

We need 1 pair `(u,v)` with `u<v` mutually reachable.\nThis requires at least 2 nodes in an SCC. So `k_scc=2`. `2*(1)/2 = 1`.\nThis implies `n=2`. Unidirectional pairs = 0.\nMy calculation gives `n=3`. Why?\nMy `k_scc` is the size of the *main* SCC.\nIf `p=1`, the smallest `k` for `k*(k-1)/2 >= 1` is `k=2`. `f(2)=1`.\nSo we can use a single SCC of size 2. `n=2`. Unidirectional pairs = 0.\nMy logic for `n` was `k_scc + 2 * p_rem`.\nHere `k_scc` (calculated as `k_scc=1` in the trace) is the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`.\nIf `f(k_scc) = p`, then `p_rem = 0`. `n = k_scc`.\nIf `f(k_scc) < p`, then `p_rem > 0`. `n = k_scc + 2 * p_rem`.\nThis is exactly what I derived initially.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the `k_scc` calculation for `p=1`:\n`k_scc = 0`\n`while (0+1)*0//2 = 0 <= 1:` (true)\n  `k_scc = 1`\n`while (1+1)*1//2 = 1 <= 1:` (true)\n  `k_scc = 2`\n`while (2+1)*2//2 = 3 <= 1:` (false)\nLoop terminates. `k_scc` is 2.\nThen `k_scc -= 1` makes `k_scc = 1`.\n`current_p_count = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0`.

This is still not `2 0`.\n\nThe problem is how `k_scc` is defined.\nLet `k_max_scc` be the size of the largest SCC we use.\nThe number of pairs this SCC produces is `k_max_scc * (k_max_scc - 1) / 2`.\nWe want this to be as close to `p` as possible without exceeding `p`.\nSo, `k_max_scc` should be the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\nThis is what my `k_scc -= 1` after the loop aims to find.\n\nLet's re-trace `p=1` with `k_max_scc` instead of `k_scc`:\n`k_val = 0`\n`while (k_val + 1) * k_val // 2 <= p:`\n`  k_val += 1`\n`k_max_scc = k_val - 1`\n\nFor `p=1`:\n`k_val = 0`. `(0+1)*0//2 = 0 <= 1`. `k_val = 1`.\n`k_val = 1`. `(1+1)*1//2 = 1 <= 1`. `k_val = 2`.\n`k_val = 2`. `(2+1)*2//2 = 3 <= 1` is false.

Correct for `p=4`.\n\nIt seems my general logic for `n` and `unid` is correct, and the `k_max_scc` calculation is also correct.\nThe only case where it differs from my expectation is `p=1`.\nFor `p=1`, `k_max_scc = 1`. This means the largest SCC has size 1. This SCC contributes 0 pairs.\nThen `p_rem = 1`.

A single SCC of size 2 yields `p=1` pairs. `n=2`. Unidirectional pairs = 0.\nThis is a valid graph with `n=2` nodes and `p=1` pairs.\nMy calculation for `n` gives `3`. This means my `n` is not always minimal.\n\nThe logic `n = k_max_scc + 2 * p_rem` is correct if `p_rem > 0`.\nIf `p_rem = 0`, then `n = k_max_scc`.\nThe condition `p_rem = 0` means `p = k_max_scc * (k_max_scc - 1) / 2`.\nThis means `p` is a triangular number.\nSo, if `p` is a triangular number, `n = k_max_scc` and `unid = 0`.\nIf `p` is not a triangular number, then `p_rem > 0`.\nIn this case, `n = k_max_scc + 2 * p_rem` and `unid = 2 * k_max_scc * p_rem + 2 * p_rem * (p_rem - 1)`.\n\nLet's re-trace `p=1` with this refined logic:\n`k_val` loop gives `k_max_scc = 1`.\n`current_p_count = f(1) = 0`.\n`p_rem = 1 - 0 = 1`.\nSince `p_rem > 0`, `p` is not a triangular number.\n`n = k_max_scc + 2 * p_rem = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3`.\n`unid = 2 * 1 * 1 + 2 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 2`.\nStill `3 2`.\n\nThe issue is that `k_max_scc` is defined as the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`.\nBut to minimize `n`, we want to find the *smallest* `k` such that `f(k) >= p`.\nLet this be `k_min_scc`.\nIf `f(k_min_scc) = p`, then `n = k_min_scc` and `unid = 0`.\nIf `f(k_min_scc) > p`, then we must use `k_min_scc - 1` nodes in a main SCC, which gives `f(k_min_scc - 1)` pairs.\nThe remaining `p - f(k_min_scc - 1)` pairs come from `p_rem = p - f(k_min_scc - 1)` SCCs of size 2.\nSo `n = (k_min_scc - 1) + 2 * p_rem`.\nAnd `unid = 2 * (k_min_scc - 1) * p_rem + 2 * p_rem * (p_rem - 1)`.\n\nLet's use this logic:\nFind `k_min_scc`:\n`k_min_scc = 0`\n`while k_min_scc * (k_min_scc - 1) // 2 < p:`\n`  k_min_scc += 1`\nThis `k_min_scc` will be the smallest `k` such that `k*(k-1)/2 >= p`.\n\nTrace for `p=0`:\n`k_min_scc = 0`. `0 * (-1) // 2 = 0 < 0` is false.

Correct.\n\nTrace for `p=4`:\n`k_min_scc = 0`. `f(0)=0 < 4`. `k_min_scc = 1`.\n`k_min_scc = 1`. `f(1)=0 < 4`. `k_min_scc = 2`.\n`k_min_scc = 2`. `f(2)=1 < 4`. `k_min_scc = 3`.\n`k_min_scc = 3`. `f(3)=3 < 4`. `k_min_scc = 4`.\n`k_min_scc = 4`. `f(4)=6 < 4` is false. Loop terminates.\n`k_min_scc` is 4.\n`f(4) = 6`. `f(4) > p`.\nSo, `k_main_scc_size = k_min_scc - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.\n`pairs_from_main_scc = f(3) = 3`.\n`p_rem = p - pairs_from_main_scc = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n`n = k_main_scc_size + 2 * p_rem = 3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.\n`unid = 2 * k_main_scc_size * p_rem + 2 * p_rem * (p_rem - 1) = 2 * 3 * 1 + 2 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 6 + 0 = 6`.\nResult `5 6`. Correct.\n\nThis refined logic seems to work for all examples and edge cases.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Initialize `k_min_scc = 0`.\n2. Loop: `while k_min_scc * (k_min_scc - 1) // 2 < p:`\n   `k_min_scc += 1`\n   This finds the smallest `k_min_scc` such that `k_min_scc * (k_min_scc - 1) // 2 >= p`.\n3.
