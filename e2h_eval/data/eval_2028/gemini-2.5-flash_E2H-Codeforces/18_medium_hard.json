The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this Frog Jumping problem. My goal is to write a Python script to efficiently solve it.**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem constraints. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b` but must stay within `[0, x]`. The function `f(x)` tells us how many distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0`, given the bound `x`.  My ultimate goal is to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.  The input parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` have specific upper bounds.\n\nAnalyzing `f(x)`, I realize that this is a reachability problem, but with the added complexity of the `[0, x]` constraint.  Without the bound, the reachable numbers would be multiples of `gcd(a, b)`. However, the `[0, x]` constraint dramatically changes the reachable set.  I can't just apply a standard BFS or DFS because `x` can be large.\n\nI need a more efficient method. All reachable numbers must be of the form `k*a - l*b` and also lie between `0` and `x`. My initial thinking was to use Dijkstra to find the shortest path but the values themselves, and the constraints, don't play well in a straightforward shortest-path algorithm.\n\nI started thinking about remainders modulo a, because the frog jumps are consistent with the `+a` or `-b`. All reachable numbers must be of the form `k*g` where `g = gcd(a,b)`.  This helps simplify things.\n\nThe real key is this idea: for a given `x`, if a number `k` is reachable, then we need to ensure that when we use `+a` and `-b` to construct that `k`, that all intermediate values are also non-negative (the constraint).\n\nThe crucial insight is to calculate, for each remainder `r` modulo `a`, the smallest non-negative integer `dist[r]` that is reachable from 0. I can use Dijkstra algorithm with these remainders and the weights are `b`.  Then, any reachable number must be greater or equal than the smallest, `k >= dist[r]` where `r = k mod a` and the number must satisfy the upper bound `x`.\n\nSo, the values `dist[r]` give the starting points for my construction of reachable values `k`. These values are reachable and I just need to find all the numbers `k` between `0` and `x` such that `k >= dist[k mod a]`.\n\nBy using this Dijkstra algorithm, I can compute all the numbers `dist[r]` very quickly. Then, for each `x`, I can compute `f(x)`. Finally, I can sum those `f(x)` values, using these insights.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, given that it can jump `+a` or `-b`, and must always stay within the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points must be multiples of `g`. If a point `p` is reachable, then `p \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`.\nLet's simplify the problem by dividing `a, b, x` by `g`. Let `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`. Then `gcd(a', b') = 1`. The problem becomes finding reachable points `p'` in `[0, x/g]` using jumps `+a'` and `-b'`. The number of such points is `f(x)`. If we find `f'(x')` for the scaled problem, then `f(x) = f'(x/g)`.\nSo, we can assume `gcd(a, b) = 1` for now, and multiply the final `f(x)` counts by `g` when summing if `x` is a multiple of `g`, or count `f'(x/g)` for `x/g`. This is not entirely correct. `f(x)` counts distinct integers in `[0, x]`. If `g > 1`, then `f(x)` is the count of reachable multiples of `g` in `[0, x]`. This is equivalent to counting reachable integers in `[0, floor(x/g)]` for the scaled problem. So `f(x) = f'(floor(x/g))`.\n\nLet's proceed with the assumption `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nWe want to find `f(x)`, the number of reachable points in `[0, x]`.\nA point `k` is reachable from `0` if there is a path `0 = p_0, p_1, ..., p_t = k` such that `0 \\le p_j \\le x` for all `j`.\nThe set of all non-negative integers reachable from `0` by jumps `+a` and `-b` without an upper bound `x` (i.e., only `p_j \\ge 0` constraint) can be characterized using a Dijkstra-like algorithm.\nLet `min_reach[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` (always staying non-negative).\nWe can compute `min_reach[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` using Dijkstra:\n1. Initialize `min_reach[0] = 0` and `min_reach[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, a-1]`.\n2. Use a min-priority queue, initially containing `(0, 0)`.\n3. When extracting `(d, u)` from the PQ:\n   If `d > min_reach[u]`, continue.\n   Consider jumping `-b`: The new remainder is `v = (u - b) % a`. The value reached is effectively `d + b` in terms of \"cost\" to reach this remainder. If `d + b < min_reach[v]`, update `min_reach[v] = d + b` and push `(d + b, v)` to the PQ.\nAfter Dijkstra, `min_reach[r]` will hold the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` (always staying non-negative).\nThe maximum value of `min_reach[r]` can be around `a*b`. Since `a, b \\le 10^5`, this can be up to `10^{10}`, which fits in a 64-bit integer. The Dijkstra runs in `O(a log a)` time, which is feasible for `a = 10^5`.\n\nOnce we have `min_reach[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\nFor a given `x`, any reachable point `k` must satisfy `0 \\le k \\le x`, `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, and `k \\ge min_reach[k \\pmod a]`.\nSince we assumed `gcd(a,b)=1`, `g=1`. So `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g` is always true.\nFor each `r \\in [0, a-1]`, the reachable points `k` with `k \\pmod a = r` are `min_reach[r], min_reach[r]+a, min_reach[r]+2a, ...`.\nWe need to count how many of these are less than or equal to `x`.\nFor a fixed `r`, the number of such points is `N_r(x) = floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1`, if `x \\ge min_reach[r]`. Otherwise, it's `0`.\nSo, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n\nNow, we need to calculate `S = sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n`S = sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((i - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nWe can swap the sums:\n`S = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=0}^{m} max(0, floor((i - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `C_r(i) = max(0, floor((i - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nThe inner sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} C_r(i)` can be computed efficiently.\n`C_r(i)` is `0` if `i < min_reach[r]`.\nIf `i \\ge min_reach[r]`, `C_r(i)` is `floor((i - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1`.\nLet `L_r = min_reach[r]`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} C_r(i)` is `sum_{i=L_r}^{m} (floor((i - L_r) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - L_r`. The sum becomes `sum_{j=0}^{m-L_r} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nLet `M_r = m - L_r`. If `M_r < 0`, this sum is `0`. Otherwise, it's `sum_{j=0}^{M_r} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nThis sum can be computed in `O(1)` time.\nLet `Q = M_r // a` and `R = M_r % a`.\nThe terms `(floor(j / a) + 1)` are:\n`1` for `j = 0, ..., a-1` (total `a` terms)\n`2` for `j = a, ..., 2a-1` (total `a` terms)\n...\n`Q` for `j = (Q-1)a, ..., Qa-1` (total `a` terms)\n`Q+1` for `j = Qa, ..., Qa+R` (total `R+1` terms)\n\nThe sum is `a * (1 + 2 + ... + Q) + (R+1) * (Q+1)`.\n`a * Q * (Q+1) / 2 + (R+1) * (Q+1)`.\nThis simplifies to `(a * Q + R + 1) * (Q + 1) - a * Q * (Q + 1) / 2`.\nNo, it's `a * Q * (Q+1) / 2 + (R+1) * (Q+1)`.\nLet's check:\n`sum_{j=0}^{M_r} (floor(j / a) + 1) = sum_{k=0}^{Q-1} (k+1) * a + (Q+1) * (R+1)`\n`= a * (Q * (Q+1) / 2) + (Q+1) * (R+1)`.\nThis formula is correct.\n\nSo, the overall algorithm:\n1. Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. If `g > 1`:\n   The problem is equivalent to counting reachable points `p'` in `[0, floor(m/g)]` using jumps `+a/g` and `-b/g`, and then multiplying the sum by `g`.\n   No, it's `f(i) = f'(floor(i/g))`. So we need to sum `f'(floor(i/g))` for `i=0..m`.\n   This means `f'(0)` is counted `g` times (for `i=0..g-1`), `f'(1)` is counted `g` times (for `i=g..2g-1`), etc.\n   The value `f'(k)` is counted for `i` from `k*g` to `min(m, (k+1)*g - 1)`.\n   Let `m' = floor(m/g)`.\n   The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` becomes `sum_{k=0}^{m'} f'(k) * (min(m, (k+1)*g - 1) - k*g + 1)`.\n   The term `(min(m, (k+1)*g - 1) - k*g + 1)` is `g` for `k < m'`. For `k = m'`, it is `m - m'*g + 1`.\n   So, `sum_{k=0}^{m'-1} f'(k) * g + f'(m') * (m - m'*g + 1)`.\n   This is the correct transformation.\n   We apply the algorithm for `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`, `m' = floor(m/g)`. Let the result be `S'`.\n   The final sum is `S' * g + f'(m') * (m - m'*g + 1 - g)`.\n   No, it's `g * sum_{k=0}^{m'-1} f'(k) + f'(m') * (m % g + 1)`.\n   Let `m_prime = m // g`.\n   `total_sum = 0`\n   `current_f_prime_sum = 0`\n   `for k from 0 to m_prime - 1`:\n     `current_f_prime_sum += f_prime(k)`\n   `total_sum = g * current_f_prime_sum`\n   `total_sum += f_prime(m_prime) * (m % g + 1)`\n   This is the correct way to handle `g > 1`.\n   Then we can set `a = a/g`, `b = b/g`, `m = m/g` effectively for the rest of the calculation.\n\n3. Calculate `min_reach[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` using Dijkstra.\n   `a` can be up to `10^5`. `min_reach` values can be `10^{10}`.\n\n4. Calculate the total sum `S_prime = sum_{k=0}^{m_prime} f_prime(k)` using the `min_reach` values.\n   `S_prime = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (a * Q_r * (Q_r+1) / 2 + (R_r+1) * (Q_r+1))`\n   where `M_r = m_prime - min_reach[r]`. If `M_r < 0`, the term is `0`.\n   Otherwise, `Q_r = M_r // a`, `R_r = M_r % a`.\n   This sum is `O(a)`.\n\n5. Combine results:\n   `final_sum = g * S_prime - (g-1) * f_prime(m_prime) + f_prime(m_prime) * (m % g + 1)`.\n   This simplified to `g * S_prime - g * f_prime(m_prime) + f_prime(m_prime) * (m % g + 1) + f_prime(m_prime)`.\n   No, it's simpler. `g * (sum_{k=0}^{m_prime-1} f'(k)) + f'(m_prime) * (m % g + 1)`.\n   `g * (S_prime - f'(m_prime)) + f'(m_prime) * (m % g + 1)`.\n   `g * S_prime - g * f'(m_prime) + f'(m_prime) * (m % g + 1)`.\n   `g * S_prime + f'(m_prime) * (m % g + 1 - g)`.\n\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`. `gcd(5,3)=1`.

What's wrong?\nLet's check `f(7)` for `a=5, b=3`. `x=7`.\n`min_reach = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`\n`r=0`: `k=0, 5`. Both `0,5 <= 7`. Count=2. (`N_0(7) = floor((7-0)/5)+1 = 1+1=2`)\n`r=1`: `min_reach[1]=9 > 7`. Count=0.\n`r=2`: `k=3`. `3 <= 7`. Count=1. (`N_2(7) = floor((7-3)/5)+1 = 0+1=1`)\n`r=3`: `min_reach[3]=12 > 7`. Count=0.\n`r=4`: `k=6`. `6 <= 7`. Count=1. (`N_4(7) = floor((7-6)/5)+1 = 0+1=1`)\n`f(7) = 2+0+1+0+1 = 4`.\nExample says `f(7)=8`. This is a huge discrepancy.\n\nThe issue is with `min_reach` definition.\n`min_reach[r]` is the minimum non-negative integer `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` *by jumps `+a` and `-b`*.\nThe Dijkstra described (cost `b` for `(u-b)%a`) correctly finds the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k = N*b` for some `N`. This is not the full set of reachable numbers.\nA number `X` is reachable if `X = i*a - j*b` for some `i, j \\ge 0`, and all intermediate sums are `\\ge 0`.\nThe set of reachable numbers `k \\ge 0` is `dist[k \\pmod a]` and `dist[k \\pmod a] + a, dist[k \\pmod a] + 2a, ...`.\nThe values `dist[r]` are smallest non-negative values `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` (always staying non-negative).\nThe Dijkstra should be:\n`dist[r]` = min `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable.\n`dist[0] = 0`.\nFrom `u`, we can reach `u+a`. So from `dist[u]`, we can reach `dist[u]+a`. This has same remainder `u`.\nFrom `u`, we can reach `u-b`. So from `dist[u]`, we can reach `dist[u]-b`. This has remainder `(u-b)%a`.\nThis is exactly the Dijkstra formulation for finding shortest paths on a graph where nodes are `0, ..., a-1` and edges are `u \\to (u-b)%a` with weight `b`.\nThe resulting `dist[r]` are the minimum *values* `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nThis is a standard technique for \"smallest number `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod N` and `k` is a sum of `A_i`\".\n\nLet's re-verify `f(7)` for `a=5, b=3`.\n`0` is reachable.\nFrom `0`: `+5 -> 5`.\nFrom `5`: `+5 -> 10` (not allowed, `10>7`). `-3 -> 2`.\nFrom `2`: `+5 -> 7`. `-3 -> -1` (not allowed).\nFrom `7`: `+5 -> 12` (not allowed). `-3 -> 4`.\nFrom `4`: `+5 -> 9` (not allowed). `-3 -> 1`.\nFrom `1`: `+5 -> 6`. `-3 -> -2` (not allowed).\nFrom `6`: `+5 -> 11` (not allowed). `-3 -> 3`.\nFrom `3`: `+5 -> 8` (not allowed). `-3 -> 0`.\nReachable points in `[0,7]`: `{0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3}`.\nSize is `8`. This matches example `f(7)=8`.\n\nMy `min_reach` calculation is correct for the specific definition.\n`min_reach = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` for remainders `0,1,2,3,4`.\nThese are `0, 9, 3, 12, 6`. All are multiples of `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nFor `x=7`:\n`r=0`: `k=0, 5`. Both `0,5 \\le 7`. Count=2.\n`r=1`: `k=9, 14, ...`. None `\\le 7`. Count=0.\n`r=2`: `k=3, 8, ...`. Only `3 \\le 7`. Count=1.\n`r=3`: `k=12, ...`. None `\\le 7`. Count=0.\n`r=4`: `k=6, 11, ...`. Only `6 \\le 7`. Count=1.\nTotal `f(7) = 2+0+1+0+1 = 4`. Still `4`.\n\nThe issue is that the set of reachable points `k` such that `k \\ge 0` is not just `min_reach[k \\pmod a] + N*a`.\nThe values `min_reach[r]` are indeed the smallest non-negative `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` *using only `-b` jumps to change remainder and `+a` jumps to increase value by `a` without changing remainder*. This is the standard definition of `dist` in the modulo Dijkstra.\nHowever, from `dist[u]`, we can also jump `+a` to `dist[u]+a`, `dist[u]+2a`, etc.\nAnd from `dist[u]`, we can also jump `-b` to `dist[u]-b`.\nThe Dijkstra finds the minimum `k` for each `k \\pmod a`.\nThe set of reachable numbers is `U_{r=0}^{a-1} {min_reach[r] + N*a | N \\ge 0, min_reach[r] + N*a \\ge 0}`.\nThis set is correct for \"reachable from `0` staying non-negative\".\nThe problem is `f(x)`: never jumps outside `[0, x]`.\nMy current `f(x)` calculation is for \"reachable from `0` staying non-negative, and final point `\\le x`\". This is not the same as \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\".\n\nExample: `a=5, b=3, x=7`.\n`f(7)` should be `8`. My current formula gives `4`.\nPoints `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7` are reachable.\n`0`.\n`0+5=5`.\n`5-3=2`.\n`2+5=7`.\n`7-3=4`.\n`4-3=1`.\n`1+5=6`.\n`6-3=3`.\nAll these points are in `[0,7]`. All intermediate jumps are also in `[0,7]`.\nThe set of reachable points is `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}`.\n\nMy `min_reach` values are `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`.\n`0` is `min_reach[0]`.\n`1` is not `min_reach[1]` (which is `9`). How is `1` reachable?\n`0 \\to 5 \\to 2 \\to 7 \\to 4 \\to 1`. Path `0,5,2,7,4,1`. All points `\\in [0,7]`.\nSo `1` is reachable for `x=7`.\nBut `min_reach[1]` is `9`. This means `1` is not reachable if `x` is large enough to allow `9`.\nThe `min_reach` values are computed for an infinite `x` (only `\\ge 0` constraint).\nIf `x` is small, some `min_reach[r]` might not be reachable.\nFor `x=7`, `min_reach[1]=9` is not reachable.\nThe set of reachable points for a given `x` is `S_x`.\n`S_x` is the closure of `{0}` under `k \\to k+a` (if `k+a \\le x`) and `k \\to k-b` (if `k-b \\ge 0`).\nThis is a standard BFS. But `x` is too large for BFS.\n\nThe `min_reach` values are correctly computed for the \"stay non-negative\" condition.\nLet `g = gcd(a,b)`.\nThe number of reachable points in `[0, x]` is `f(x)`.\nLet `dp[i]` be `true` if `i` is reachable, `false` otherwise.\nThe problem is that the `min_reach` values are independent of `x`.\nFor `x` up to `max(a,b)` (roughly `10^5`), we can use BFS.\nLet `limit = max(a,b)`. For `x < limit`, we can do a BFS.\nFor `x \\ge limit`:\nOnce we reach a point `k` such that `k \\ge b`, we can always make the `k-b` jump.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=1`, and we can reach `k` and `k \\ge b`, then we can reach `k-b, k-2b, ...` as long as `\\ge 0`.\nThis means we can reach all numbers `k \\ge b` that are `\\equiv k \\pmod a` and `k \\ge min_reach[k \\pmod a]`.\nThe values `min_reach[r]` are the minimum non-negative integers `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` *without upper bound*.\nIf `x` is large enough, specifically `x \\ge min_reach[r] + a`, then all `min_reach[r] + N*a` for `N \\ge 0` are reachable.\nThe question is, how large `x` needs to be for the `min_reach` values to be relevant?\nThe `min_reach` values are the smallest values `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable *without upper bound*.\nIf `x` is very large, say `x \\ge a*b`, then all `k \\in [0, x]` that are multiples of `g` are reachable.\nThis is not true. Example `a=5, b=3`. `x=10`. `min_reach = [0,9,3,12,6]`.\nReachable points `[0,10]`:\n`0 \\to 5 \\to 2 \\to 7 \\to 4 \\to 1 \\to 6 \\to 3 \\to 8 \\to 10`.\nReachable: `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}`. `f(10)=10`.\n`min_reach[1]=9`. `1` is reachable. `min_reach[1]` is not `1`.\nThis means the `min_reach` values are *not* the `min_reach` values under the \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" rule.\nThe `min_reach` values are for the \"stay non-negative\" rule only.\n\nThe problem \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" is a different beast.\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum `x` such that `i` is reachable from `0` and `0` is reachable from `i` (i.e. we can jump `+a` and `-b` and stay within `[0, x]` for all intermediate steps).\nThis is not it either.\nThe problem asks for `f(x)` = number of distinct integers reachable from `0` *if it never jumps outside `[0, x]`*.\nThis means, if we are at `k`, `k+a` is a valid jump only if `k+a \\le x`. `k-b` is valid only if `k-b \\ge 0`.\nThis is a standard BFS for each `x`.\nThe `a, b` values are up to `10^5`. `m` is `10^9`.\nLet `N = a+b`. The maximum value of `min_reach` (Frobenius number) is `a*b - a - b`.\nThe values `f(x)` will stabilize for `x` large enough.\nThe set of reachable points for a small `x` (say `x < a+b`) can be computed by BFS.\nLet `max_val = a + b`. We can compute `f(x)` for `x` up to `max_val` using BFS.\nFor `x > max_val`:\nThe reachable points `p` must satisfy `p \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`.\nIf `x` is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of `g` in `[0, x]`.\nThe maximum value of `a, b` is `10^5`. `a+b` can be `2 * 10^5`.\nLet `limit = a+b`.\nFor `i \\in [0, limit]`, compute `f(i)` using BFS.\n`visited = set()`, `q = deque([0])`, `visited.add(0)`.\n`while q:`\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `if curr + a <= x and curr + a not in visited:`\n    `visited.add(curr + a)`\n    `q.append(curr + a)`\n  `if curr - b >= 0 and curr - b not in visited:`\n    `visited.add(curr - b)`\n    `q.append(curr - b)`\n`f(x) = len(visited)`.\nThis BFS is too slow for `x` up to `limit`. The number of reachable points can be `x+1`.\nA BFS for `f(x)` takes `O(x)` time. Summing `f(x)` for `x` up to `limit` is `O(limit^2)`. `(2*10^5)^2 = 4*10^{10}` operations. Too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation is that `f(x)` increases in steps.\n`f(x)` is a non-decreasing function.\n`f(x)` is `1` for `x < a`.\n`f(x)` for `x \\ge a`:\nThe `min_reach` values are definitely the key.\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum value `k` such that `k \\equiv i \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` (staying non-negative). This is what my current Dijkstra computes.\n`dp = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` for `a=5, b=3`.\nThe values `f(x)` for `x \\ge a+b` (or some other bound) will be `x/g + 1` if `gcd(a,b)=g`.\nThis is if `x` is large enough so that all multiples of `g` in `[0, x]` are reachable.\nThe largest non-reachable value is the Frobenius number `a*b - a - b` (if `gcd(a,b)=1`).\nSo for `x >= a*b - a - b`, `f(x) = x+1`.\nThis means `f(x)` becomes `x+1` for `x \\ge F_N = a*b - a - b`.\n`F_N` can be `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^{10}`. This is too large.\nThe actual bound is `a+b` or `a+b-g`.\nLet `limit = a+b`.\nFor `x \\ge limit`, `f(x)` will be `x/g + 1` if `gcd(a,b)=g`.\nThis is because if `k` is reachable and `k \\ge b`, then `k-b` is reachable.\nIf `k` is reachable and `k \\le x-a`, then `k+a` is reachable.\nIf we can reach all `p \\in [0, a+b]` that are multiples of `g`, then we can reach all multiples of `g` in `[0, x]`.\nThis is because from any `k \\in [a+b, x-a]`, we can reach `k+a` or `k-b`.\nIf `k \\in [a+b, x-a]`, then `k+a \\in [2a+b, x]`.\nAnd `k-b \\in [a, x-a-b]`.\nThis is not sufficient.\n\nLet's use the definition of `f(x)`: `f(x)` is the size of the set `S_x = {p \\mid 0 \\le p \\le x \\text{ and p is reachable from 0 within } [0,x]}`.\n`S_x` can be found by BFS.\n`q = deque([0])`, `visited = {0}`.\n`while q:`\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `next_a = curr + a`\n  `if next_a <= x and next_a not in visited:`\n    `visited.add(next_a)`\n    `q.append(next_a)`\n  `next_b = curr - b`\n  `if next_b >= 0 and next_b not in visited:`\n    `visited.add(next_b)`\n    `q.append(next_b)`\nThe maximum value `curr` can reach is `x`.\nThe maximum value `curr` can reach in `min_reach` definition is `a*b`.\nLet `g = gcd(a,b)`.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values (computed via Dijkstra) are the minimum non-negative `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` *without any upper bound on `x`*.\nLet `dp[r]` be these `min_reach` values.\nAll reachable points `p` (without upper bound) are of the form `dp[p \\pmod a] + N*a` for some `N \\ge 0`.\nThe points `p` must also be multiples of `g`.\nSo `dp[r]` must be multiples of `g`. And `a` is a multiple of `g`.\nSo `dp[r] + N*a` are always multiples of `g`.\nLet `L = max(dp)`. The maximum value in `dp` array.\nFor any `x \\ge L`, all `k \\in [0, x]` that are multiples of `g` are reachable.\nThis is because for any `k \\ge L`, `k \\ge dp[k \\pmod a]`.\nSo for `x \\ge L`, `f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1`.\n`L` can be `a*b` (up to `10^{10}`). This is too large.\n\nThe key must be related to `a+b`.\nLet `max_val = a+b`.\nFor `x \\ge max_val`, the set of reachable points for `f(x)` is the same as for `f(max_val)` plus all multiples of `g` in `(max_val, x]`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the smallest value `k` such that `k \\equiv i \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable from `0` (staying non-negative) using jumps `+a` and `-b`.\nThis is the same Dijkstra, but modulo `g`.\n`dist[i]` = min non-negative `k` such that `k \\equiv i \\pmod g`.\nNodes `0, ..., g-1`.\n`dist[0] = 0`, `dist[i] = inf` for `i \\ne 0`.\nPQ `[(0,0)]`.\nPop `(d,u)`.\n`v = (u+a)%g`. `dist[v] = min(dist[v], d+a)`.\n`v = (u-b)%g`. `dist[v] = min(dist[v], d+b)`.\nThis is not right. This is for shortest path, not minimum value.\nThe values `k` are multiples of `g`. So `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`.\nSo `dist[0]` is the only relevant one. `dist[0]=0`.\n\nThe problem is a variant of \"reachability in a range\".\nLet `reachable[i]` be true if `i` is reachable.\n`reachable[0] = true`.\nIteratively: `new_reachable = false`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `x`:\n  If `reachable[i]`:\n    If `i+a \\le x`: `reachable[i+a] = true`.\n    If `i-b \\ge 0`: `reachable[i-b] = true`.\nThis is BFS.\n\nThe state for `f(x)` is `(current_pos, max_pos_reached)`.\nThe problem states \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means `f(x)` is the count of points `p` such that there is a path `0=p_0, p_1, ..., p_k=p` where `0 \\le p_j \\le x` for all `j`.\nThis is a standard BFS on `[0, x]`.\n\nThe values `f(i)` for `i` up to `a+b` can be computed by BFS.\nLet `MAX_A_B = 2 * 10^5`.\n`dp_f[i]` for `i` up to `MAX_A_B`.\n`dp_f[i]` stores `f(i)`.\n`q = deque()`, `visited = [False] * (MAX_A_B + 1)`, `num_reachable = 0`.\n`q.append(0)`, `visited[0] = True`, `num_reachable = 1`.\n`f_values = [0] * (MAX_A_B + 1)`.\n`f_values[0] = 1`.\n`head = 0`.\nFor `x` from `1` to `MAX_A_B`:\n  While `head < x`:\n    `curr = q[head]`\n    `head += 1`\n    `next_a = curr + a`\n    `if next_a <= x and not visited[next_a]:`\n      `visited[next_a] = True`\n      `q.append(next_a)`\n      `num_reachable += 1`\n    `next_b = curr - b`\n    `if next_b >= 0 and not visited[next_b]:`\n      `visited[next_b] = True`\n      `q.append(next_b)`\n      `num_reachable += 1`\n  `f_values[x] = num_reachable`.\nThis computes `f(x)` for `x` up to `MAX_A_B` in `O(MAX_A_B^2)` time.
