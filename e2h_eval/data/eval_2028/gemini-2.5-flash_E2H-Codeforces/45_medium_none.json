There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Games in a Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this tennis tournament problem. The goal is to figure out the most games the winner can possibly play, given this quirky rule: players can only face off if their game counts are within one of each other.  I'm thinking, let's call the number of games played 'k'. We start with everyone at k=0, of course.\n\nThe core of the problem, as I see it, is how efficiently can we consume players to create a single winner who has played a maximum number of games. It seems to point towards using Fibonacci or powers of 2.\n\nI'm thinking about Fibonacci and considering how to build this up, with this tournament. We start with the winner and have an opponent with no games played (the first game). To have the winner play the second game, their opponent can have either 0 or 1 games.  I'm trying to figure out the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. I'm exploring different scenarios: the winner's opponent having either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nI'm trying to define a function to find the minimum number of players needed such that the winner can play k games, as well as considering the opponents. The definition seems a bit off, I need to focus on what happens to players after being eliminated. I'm currently modeling the possible states of players and how they are used.\n\nI keep coming back to a sequence, I'm thinking of Fibonacci numbers. It's becoming clear that maximizing the winner's games involves an optimal \"experience\" distribution.  When the winner has k-1 games, an ideal opponent would have k-2 games because this uses the fewest number of players. So if the opponent has k-1, then the tournament would take more players.\n\nMy thinking is that to get a winner to have 'k' games, we build a kind of bracket structure.\n\nI'm starting to formalize the recurrence: the minimum number of players, f(k), for the winner to play k games, seems to depend on the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games is f(k-1) + f(k-2). I just need to find the largest value of k such that f(k) is still less than or equal to the total number of players. This seems to be the most efficient strategy.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games. We want to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's determine the values of `f(k)`:\n\n*   **`f(0)`**: If the winner plays 0 games, it means they haven't played yet. This requires only 1 player (the potential winner themselves). So, `f(0) = 1`.\n\n*   **`f(1)`**: To play 1 game, the winner (who has 0 games) needs an opponent (who also has 0 games). After the game, the winner has played 1 game, and the opponent is eliminated. This requires 2 players in total. So, `f(1) = 2`.\n\n*   **`f(k)` for `k >= 2`**: Suppose the winner has already played `k-1` games and won all of them. To play their `k`-th game, they need an opponent. According to the rule, this opponent must have played either `(k-1)-1 = k-2` games or `k-1` games.\n    *   **Option 1: Opponent has `k-1` games.**\n        To produce a winner who has played `k-1` games, we need `f(k-1)` players.\n        To produce an opponent who has played `k-1` games, we also need `f(k-1)` players.\n        These two groups of players must be distinct. So, the total number of players required for this option is `f(k-1) + f(k-1) = 2 * f(k-1)`.\n    *   **Option 2: Opponent has `k-2` games.**\n        To produce a winner who has played `k-1` games, we need `f(k-1)` players.\n        To produce an opponent who has played `k-2` games, we need `f(k-2)` players.\n        These two groups of players must be distinct. So, the total number of players required for this option is `f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.\n\n    Since we are looking for the *minimum* number of players required for the winner to play `k` games, we should choose the option that uses fewer players:\n    `f(k) = min(2 * f(k-1), f(k-1) + f(k-2))`.\n    Given that `f(k-2) <= f(k-1)` for `k >= 2` (as the number of players needed is non-decreasing with games played), it follows that `f(k-1) + f(k-2) <= 2 * f(k-1)`.\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation simplifies to `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence! Let's list the first few terms:\n`f(0) = 1`\n`f(1) = 2`\n`f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n`f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n`f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\nAnd so on.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the Fibonacci numbers `F_m` if we define `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`. Specifically, `f(k) = F_{k+2}`.\n\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`. We can generate Fibonacci numbers `f(k)` until they exceed `n`. The `k` value for the last `f(k)` that was less than or equal to `n` is our answer.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers efficiently. We can do this iteratively using two variables to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet's trace the examples:\n*   `n=2`:\n    `k=0, f(0)=1 <= 2`\n    `k=1, f(1)=2 <= 2`\n    `k=2, f(2)=3 > 2`\n    The maximum `k` is 1. Output: 1. (Correct)\n*   `n=3`:\n    `k=0, f(0)=1 <= 3`\n    `k=1, f(1)=2 <= 3`\n    `k=2, f(2)=3 <= 3`\n    `k=3, f(3)=5 > 3`\n    The maximum `k` is 2. Output: 2. (Correct)\n*   `n=4`:\n    `k=0, f(0)=1 <= 4`\n    `k=1, f(1)=2 <= 4`\n    `k=2, f(2)=3 <= 4`\n    `k=3, f(3)=5 > 4`\n    The maximum `k` is 2. Output: 2. (Correct)\n*   `n=10`:\n    `k=0, f(0)=1 <= 10`\n    `k=1, f(1)=2 <= 10`\n    `k=2, f(2)=3 <= 10`\n    `k=3, f(3)=5 <= 10`\n    `k=4, f(4)=8 <= 10`\n    `k=5, f(5)=13 > 10`\n    The maximum `k` is 4. Output: 4. (Correct)\n\nThe logic holds for all example cases.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `F_90` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`. So, `k` will be at most around 88. An iterative approach will be very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # f(k) represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n    # f(0) = 1 (the winner themselves, no games played)\n    # f(1) = 2 (winner plays 1 game, needs 1 opponent)\n    # For k >= 2, f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n    # This is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically F_{k+2} where F_0=0, F_1=1.\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Initialize f(0) and f(1)\n    # current_f_k_minus_2 stores f(k-2)\n    # current_f_k_minus_1 stores f(k-1)\n    \n    # Let's use a, b for the Fibonacci sequence: a, b, a+b, ...\n    # Initial values:\n    # k=0: f_prev_prev = 1 (f(0))\n    # k=1: f_prev = 2 (f(1))\n    # k_val = 1 (current max games)\n    \n    f_prev_prev = 1  # Represents f(k-2)\n    f_prev = 2       # Represents f(k-1)\n    k_val = 1        # Represents the current max games the winner can play\n\n    # Iterate to find the largest k such that f(k) <= n\n    while True:\n        f_current = f_prev + f_prev_prev\n        if f_current > n:\n            break\n        \n        k_val += 1\n        f_prev_prev = f_prev\n        f_prev = f_current\n        \n    print(k_val)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
