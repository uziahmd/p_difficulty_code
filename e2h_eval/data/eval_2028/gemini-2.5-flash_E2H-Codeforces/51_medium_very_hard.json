Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Amusing Joke Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm taking a look at this \"Amusing Joke\" problem.  The goal is to figure out if a pile of letters can be formed by rearranging the letters in a guest's and host's names.  The input's straightforward: three strings â€“ guest, host, and the pile.  The output's either \"YES\" or \"NO.\"\n\nThe core idea is this: the *multiset* of letters (considering character counts) in the pile has to be exactly the same as the combined letters from the guest and the host.  Reordering is allowed, so anagrams are valid.  That means if I take the guest's and host's names, stick 'em together, and then compare the character counts with the pile, I should get a match if the answer is \"YES.\" And of course, the lengths of both strings must match.\n\nThere are two examples provided to confirm this:\n\n- **Example 1:** `SANTACLAUS`, `DEDMOROZ`, and `SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS`. If these were sorted, both the combined guest+host letters, and the pile of letters, would match character by character.\n\n- **Example 2:** `PAPAINOEL`, `JOULUPUKKI`, and `JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI`. These would **not** match if sorted.\n\nSo, I need an algorithm. Reading and concatenating the input strings are a must. After that, I can sort the combined string (guest + host) and the pile, and compare the sorted results. If the sorted strings are identical, it's a \"YES,\" otherwise a \"NO.\"  Sorting gives a simple, effective anagram check.\n\nThe sorting approach simplifies the character count comparison, making the logic easy to implement.  The other approach uses frequency maps. The sorting method is very appropriate here, and sorting a string with length up to 200 should be lightning fast.\n\nNow the code. I read the three input strings, combine the guest and host names, sort both the combined string and the pile string, and compare.  A simple `if` statement decides \"YES\" or \"NO.\" I add some tests with example inputs from the problem description.\n\nThe program seems to work, including those examples that should return NO. The examples' constraints are all length <= 100 for each input line. But if the combination of guest name and host name is longer than 100, and the solution *requires* the pile to be the same, then the problem description is a contradiction.  Let's check the constraint, even though the example suggests it doesn't matter.\n\nIn conclusion: the sorting method provides the most efficient way to solve this problem. After testing, I can confidently submit the solution!\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    guest_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile_letters = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    combined_names = guest_name + host_name\n    sorted_combined = sorted(combined_names)\n    sorted_pile = sorted(pile_letters)\n\n    if sorted_combined == sorted_pile:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"YES\\n\")\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n",
