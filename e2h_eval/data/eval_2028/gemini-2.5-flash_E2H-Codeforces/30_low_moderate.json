Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**TV Game Solution - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. I understand the rules: two players, Homer and Marge, a number *A* with 2*n* digits, and each player gets *n* moves.  The goal is to maximize the sum of their resulting numbers, *S1* and *S2*. The twist is *A* is a *string* that we need to interpret.  The key is that *A* can have leading zeros, and *S1* and *S2* will also have leading zeros. *n* can be up to 18, so *A* can have up to 36 digits.\n\nMy first thought is, Python's arbitrary-precision integers will handle those huge numbers just fine, so that simplifies things.  I'm thinking dynamic programming or recursion with memoization is the way to go because it feels like there's an optimal substructure and definitely overlapping subproblems here.\n\nThe crucial part is figuring out the state for the dynamic programming or recursive function. What do I need to know at any given step to make the *best* decision? I think I need:\n\n1.  *k*: The index of the current digit in *A* that we're considering.\n2.  *h\\_moves*: The number of moves Homer has already made.\n3.  *m\\_moves*: The number of moves Marge has already made.\n\nSo, I'm thinking of a function, `dp(k, h_moves, m_moves)`, which returns the maximum total prize (S1 + S2) achievable from the *k*-th digit onwards, given the current moves count.\n\nThe base case will be when we've processed all digits, which means `k == 2n`. That *must* mean that `h_moves == n` and `m_moves == n`, and the total prize at that point is zero. If, in any recursive branch, `h_moves == n and m_moves == n`, then we also stop and return 0.\n\nNow, the recursive step. At state `(k, h_moves, m_moves)`, the digit is `A[k]`. The key is deciding who gets that digit.\n\nWe have two choices.\n1. **Homer takes it:** This is valid *only* if `h_moves < n`. In this case, `A[k]` is added to Homer's number (*S1*).\n2. **Marge takes it:** This is valid *only* if `m_moves < n`. In this case, `A[k]` is added to Marge's number (*S2*).\n\nNow, the crux of the problem - determining the contribution of a digit to each number. This needs more attention. It's not about appending it as a single digit; *S1* and *S2* are *constructed* from those digits in the original number *A*.\n\nIf Homer takes *A[k]*, then that digit becomes the `(h_moves + 1)`-th digit from the left of his number *S1*. Likewise, if Marge takes *A[k]*, that digit is added to *S2*. The problem is just to maximize the sum of *S1* and *S2*.\n\nThis is where I'll probably spend the bulk of my time - getting that state transition equation right.  I need to make sure I don't double-count anything and that I correctly handle the positions of the digits within *S1* and *S2*. I'll need to figure out how to represent the sum. I think I have the core idea, I'm just refining the implementation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of `2n` moves (each by Homer or Marge) such that Homer makes exactly `n` moves, Marge makes exactly `n` moves, and the sum of their resulting numbers, `S1 + S2`, is maximized. `S1` is Homer's number, formed by digits he takes in order; `S2` is Marge's number, formed by digits she takes in order.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization. Let's define a state `dp(k, h_count, m_count)` as the maximum possible sum `(S1_suffix + S2_suffix)` that can be achieved from the remaining `2n - k` digits, given that `h_count` digits have already been assigned to Homer and `m_count` digits to Marge.\n\nThe parameters for our DP state will be:\n* `k`: The index of the current digit being considered from the input string `A`. `k` ranges from `0` to `2n-1`.\n* `h_count`: The number of moves Homer has made so far. `h_count` ranges from `0` to `n`.\n* `m_count`: The number of moves Marge has made so far. `m_count` ranges from `0` to `n`.\n\nThe return value of `dp(k, h_count, m_count)` will be a tuple: `(max_total_value, best_move_char)`.\n`max_total_value` is the maximum `S1 + S2` achievable from this state.\n`best_move_char` is 'H' or 'M', indicating which player should take the `k`-th digit to achieve `max_total_value`. This is needed to reconstruct the path.\n\n**Base Case:**\nIf `k == 2n` (all digits have been processed):\n  If `h_count == n` and `m_count == n`, then we have successfully assigned all digits. The remaining value is 0. Return `(0, '')`.\n  Otherwise, this is an invalid state (e.g., one player didn't make `n` moves). Return `(-infinity, '')` to indicate this path is not viable.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\nAt state `(k, h_count, m_count)`:\nThe current digit is `digit = int(A[k])`.\nWe need to consider two possibilities:\n\n1.  **Homer takes the `k`-th digit:**\n    This is allowed only if `h_count < n`.\n    If Homer takes `digit`, it will be the `(h_count + 1)`-th digit of his number `S1`. The position of this digit in `S1` determines its place value. Since `S1` will eventually have `n` digits, this `digit` will contribute `digit * 10^(n - 1 - h_count)` to `S1`.\n    Let `(val_if_H_takes, _) = dp(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)`.\n    The total value if Homer takes this digit is `digit * (10**(n - 1 - h_count)) + val_if_H_takes`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes the `k`-th digit:**\n    This is allowed only if `m_count < n`.\n    If Marge takes `digit`, it will be the `(m_count + 1)`-th digit of her number `S2`. Similarly, it contributes `digit * 10^(n - 1 - m_count)` to `S2`.\n    Let `(val_if_M_takes, _) = dp(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)`.\n    The total value if Marge takes this digit is `digit * (10**(n - 1 - m_count)) + val_if_M_takes`.\n\nWe choose the move ('H' or 'M') that yields the maximum total value. Store this result in `memo[k][h_count][m_count]` to avoid recomputing.\n\n**Reconstructing the Path:**\nAfter computing `dp(0, 0, 0)`, we can reconstruct the sequence of moves by starting from `(0, 0, 0)` and at each step `(k, h_count, m_count)`, appending `memo[k][h_count][m_count][1]` (the `best_move_char`) to our result string and moving to the next state `(k+1, h_count + (1 if best_move_char == 'H' else 0), m_count + (1 if best_move_char == 'M' else 0))`.\n\n**Memoization Table:**\n`memo[k][h_count][m_count]` will store the calculated `(max_total_value, best_move_char)`. Initialize all entries to `None`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(2n * n * n) = O(n^3)` states. Each state computation involves constant time operations.\n    For `n=18`, `18^3 = 5832`. `2n*n*n = 36 * 18 * 18 = 11664` states. This is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(2n * n * n) = O(n^3)` for the memoization table.\n    For `n=18`, `11664` entries. Each entry stores a large integer and a character. This is well within memory limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # memo[k][h_count][m_count] stores (max_total_value, best_move_char)\n    # k: current digit index (0 to 2n-1)\n    # h_count: Homer's moves made so far (0 to n)\n    # m_count: Marge's moves made so far (0 to n)\n    memo = {}\n\n    def dp(k, h_count, m_count):\n        if (k, h_count, m_count) in memo:\n            return memo[(k, h_count, m_count)]\n\n        # Base case: All digits processed\n        if k == 2 * n:\n            if h_count == n and m_count == n:\n                return 0 # All moves made, no more value to add\n            else:\n                # This path is invalid because players didn't make exactly n moves\n                return -1 # Use -1 to denote an invalid path, as actual values are non-negative\n\n        current_digit = int(A[k])\n        \n        max_val = -1 # Initialize with -1 to indicate no valid path found yet\n        best_choice = ''\n\n        # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n        if h_count < n:\n            val_if_h_takes = dp(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)\n            if val_if_h_takes != -1: # Check if the subproblem solution is valid\n                # Contribution of current_digit to S1\n                # It's the (h_count)-th digit (0-indexed) of S1, so its place value is 10^(n - 1 - h_count)\n                current_total_val = current_digit * (10**(n - 1 - h_count)) + val_if_h_takes\n                \n                if current_total_val > max_val:\n                    max_val = current_total_val\n                    best_choice = 'H'\n\n        # Option 2: Marge takes the current digit\n        if m_count < n:\n            val_if_m_takes = dp(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)\n            if val_if_m_takes != -1: # Check if the subproblem solution is valid\n                # Contribution of current_digit to S2\n                # It's the (m_count)-th digit (0-indexed) of S2, so its place value is 10^(n - 1 - m_count)\n                current_total_val = current_digit * (10**(n - 1 - m_count)) + val_if_m_takes\n                \n                if current_total_val > max_val:\n                    max_val = current_total_val\n                    best_choice = 'M'\n        \n        memo[(k, h_count, m_count)] = max_val\n        return max_val\n\n    # Populate DP table (this call computes the max value)\n    dp(0, 0, 0)\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result_path = []\n    k, h_count, m_count = 0, 0, 0\n    while k < 2 * n:\n        current_digit = int(A[k])\n        \n        # Calculate value if Homer takes current digit\n        val_if_h_takes = -1\n        if h_count < n:\n            sub_val = memo.get((k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count), -1)\n            if sub_val != -1:\n                val_if_h_takes = current_digit * (10**(n - 1 - h_count)) + sub_val\n\n        # Calculate value if Marge takes current digit\n        val_if_m_takes = -1\n        if m_count < n:\n            sub_val = memo.get((k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1), -1)\n            if sub_val != -1:\n                val_if_m_takes = current_digit * (10**(n - 1 - m_count)) + sub_val\n        \n        # Choose the move that led to the maximum value\n        # If val_if_h_takes is greater, Homer takes it.\n        # If val_if_m_takes is greater, Marge takes it.\n        # If they are equal, either is fine.
