For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach to a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem that's got my attention. It's asking me to count the number of ways to pick integer values, `c_s`, for all binary strings `s` of lengths 1 through `n`. The key here is that the *maximum* size of a \"beautiful multiset\" must be exactly `f`. And, of course, the final count needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst things first, I need to deeply understand this \"beautiful multiset\" and how its size gets determined. From what I'm reading, a multiset of binary strings (length `n`) is beautiful if, for any shorter string `s` (length 1 up to `n`), the count of strings in the multiset that start with `s` doesn't go over the corresponding `c_s` value. \n\nI'm starting to visualize this. If a string `S` of length `n` is in the multiset, its presence contributes to all its prefixes. This reminds me of network flow, specifically min-cut max-flow, but the constraint on `n` (<= 15) immediately points to an exponential number of strings, like 2<sup>15</sup>. I need to get the total number of prefixes correct, and it is 2 * (2<sup>n</sup> - 1). This should be manageable.\n\nSo, for a given set of `c_s` values, the maximum size is defined by how we can fit binary strings within the prefix constraints. I'm thinking about a binary tree structure. The binary strings perfectly map to a trie: the root is the empty string, and each node has a 0 and 1 child. Leaf nodes represent strings of length `n`. Every `c_s` is like a capacity constraint at a node.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the sum of counts for each string of length `n`, let's call it `x_S`, subject to these capacity restrictions. This strongly suggests a network flow formulation. I envision a source node `S` and a sink node `T`. I would need to have nodes for short strings `U_s` and the strings of length n `V_S`. Edges represent connections between these nodes with capacities set by the `c_s` values. The edges should model that any complete string (length `n`) contributes to the prefix restrictions. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined. A multiset of binary strings of length $n$ is beautiful if for every string $s$ (length $1$ to $n$), the number of strings in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\nLet $x_S$ be the number of times a specific string $S$ of length $n$ appears in the multiset. We want to maximize $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} x_S$.\nThe constraints are:\n1. $x_S \\ge 0$ for all $S$ of length $n$.\n2. For every string $s$ of length $L$ ($1 \\le L \\le n$), $\\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } s \\text{ is prefix of } S} x_S \\le c_s$.\n\nThis problem structure is related to network flow. Specifically, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is given by the minimum of $c_s$ values on paths from the root to leaves in a conceptual binary prefix tree.\nMore precisely, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s$.\nTo see why, consider any string $S$ of length $n$. It has $n$ prefixes (including itself): $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n = S$. If $S$ is in the multiset $x_S$ times, then $x_S$ contributes to the prefix count for each $s_i$. Thus, $x_S$ cannot exceed any $c_{s_i}$. So $x_S \\le \\min_{i=1 \\dots n} c_{s_i}$. To maximize the total sum, we can choose $x_S = \\min_{i=1 \\dots n} c_{s_i}$ for each $S$. This choice satisfies all constraints. For any prefix $s_j$, the sum $\\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } s_j \\text{ is prefix of } S} x_S = \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } s_j \\text{ is prefix of } S} \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s$. This sum is $\\le \\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } s_j \\text{ is prefix of } S} c_{s_j} = (\\text{number of } S \\text{ with prefix } s_j) \\times c_{s_j} = 2^{n - \\text{length}(s_j)} \\times c_{s_j}$. This is not necessarily $\\le c_{s_j}$.\n\nThe correct interpretation for the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is as follows:\nLet $P(s)$ be the set of all strings of length $n$ that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $\\min_{\\text{all strings } s} \\left(c_s \\cdot 2^{n - \\text{length}(s)}\\right)$.\nThis is a known result (e.g., from problems involving prefix codes or optimal prefix tree construction). Each $c_s$ acts as an upper bound on the total \"weight\" of strings rooted at $s$. The maximum total weight is limited by the tightest such bound.\nFor example, if $n=1$, we have strings $0$ and $1$. The prefixes are $0$ and $1$.\nThe maximum size is $\\min(c_0 \\cdot 2^{1-1}, c_1 \\cdot 2^{1-1}) = \\min(c_0, c_1)$.\nIf $n=2$, strings $00, 01, 10, 11$. Prefixes $0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11$.\nThe maximum size is $\\min(c_0 \\cdot 2^{2-1}, c_1 \\cdot 2^{2-1}, c_{00} \\cdot 2^{2-2}, c_{01} \\cdot 2^{2-2}, c_{10} \\cdot 2^{2-2}, c_{11} \\cdot 2^{2-2})$\n$= \\min(2c_0, 2c_1, c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11})$.\nSo, we need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$ for all $2(2^n-1)$ prefixes $s$ such that $\\min_{s} (c_s \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}) = f$.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values for all prefixes $s$ of length $i$ such that:\n1. For any prefix $s'$ of length $L < i$, $c_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\ge f$.\n2. For any prefix $s'$ of length $L = i$, $c_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\ge j$.\n3. For any prefix $s'$ of length $L > i$, $c_{s'}$ can be anything in $[0, k]$.\nThis DP state is not quite right. We need to find the global minimum.\n\nLet's simplify. For each string $s$ of length $L$, we choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$. This means $c_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ can range from $0$ to $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet $V_L = 2^{n-L}$. The values $c_s \\cdot V_L$ must be at least $f$ for some strings, and exactly $f$ for at least one string.\nThis means for all $s$, $c_s \\cdot V_L \\ge f$. And there exists at least one $s^*$ such that $c_{s^*} \\cdot V_{\\text{length}(s^*)} = f$.\n\nFor each length $L \\in [1, n]$:\nThe value $V_L = 2^{n-L}$.\nThe minimum possible value for $c_s$ such that $c_s \\cdot V_L \\ge f$ is $\\lceil f / V_L \\rceil$. Let this be $C_{L, \\text{min}}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $c_s$ is $k$.\nSo for any $s$ of length $L$, $c_s$ must be in range $[\\max(0, C_{L, \\text{min}}), k]$.\nLet $N_L = 2^L$ be the number of strings of length $L$.\nFor a fixed $L$, there are $N_L$ strings. For each of these strings, $c_s$ can be chosen in $k - \\max(0, C_{L, \\text{min}}) + 1$ ways.\nThe total number of ways to choose all $c_s$ such that $\\min (c_s \\cdot V_L) \\ge f$ is $\\prod_{L=1}^n \\left(k - \\max(0, \\lceil f / V_L \\rceil) + 1\\right)^{N_L}$.\nLet $W(X)$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ such that $\\min (c_s \\cdot V_L) \\ge X$.\n$W(X) = \\prod_{L=1}^n \\left(k - \\max(0, \\lceil X / V_L \\rceil) + 1\\right)^{N_L}$.\nNote that if $\\lceil X / V_L \\rceil > k$, then there are no valid choices for $c_s$, so that term becomes 0. If $X=0$, $\\lceil X/V_L \\rceil = 0$.\n\nWe need the number of ways such that the maximum possible size is *exactly* $f$.\nThis is $W(f) - W(f+1)$.\n$W(f)$ counts all ways where the min is $\\ge f$.\n$W(f+1)$ counts all ways where the min is $\\ge f+1$ (which means the min is $\\ge f$ AND not equal to $f$).\nSo $W(f) - W(f+1)$ gives ways where the min is exactly $f$.\n\nLet's calculate $W(X)$:\n$V_L = 2^{n-L}$. $N_L = 2^L$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ for a string $s$ of length $L$ is $k - \\max(0, \\text{ceil_div}(X, V_L)) + 1$.\nIf $\\text{ceil_div}(X, V_L) > k$, this term is 0.\n$\\text{ceil_div}(A, B) = (A + B - 1) // B$ for positive $A, B$. If $A=0$, it's $0$.\nSo, $C_{L, \\text{min}}(X) = (X + V_L - 1) // V_L$ if $X > 0$, else $0$.\nNumber of choices for $c_s$ of length $L$: $\\text{choices}_L(X) = k - \\max(0, C_{L, \\text{min}}(X)) + 1$.\nIf $\\text{choices}_L(X) < 0$, it should be 0.\n$W(X) = \\prod_{L=1}^n (\\text{choices}_L(X))^{N_L} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's calculate $W(f)$ and $W(f+1)$.\nModulo is $998244353$.\n$n \\le 15$, $k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$V_L = 2^{n-L}$ can be up to $2^{14} = 16384$.\n$N_L = 2^L$ can be up to $2^{15} = 32768$.\nThe calculations involve powers modulo a prime. `pow(base, exp, mod)` can be used.\n\nExample $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$L=1$: $V_1 = 2^{1-1} = 1$. $N_1 = 2^1 = 2$.\n$W(2)$:\n$C_{1, \\text{min}}(2) = (2+1-1)//1 = 2$.\nChoices for $c_s$ of length 1: $42 - \\max(0, 2) + 1 = 42 - 2 + 1 = 41$.\n$W(2) = (41)^{N_1} = 41^2 = 1681$.\n\n$W(3)$:\n$C_{1, \\text{min}}(3) = (3+1-1)//1 = 3$.\nChoices for $c_s$ of length 1: $42 - \\max(0, 3) + 1 = 42 - 3 + 1 = 40$.\n$W(3) = (40)^{N_1} = 40^2 = 1600$.\n\nResult: $W(2) - W(3) = 1681 - 1600 = 81$.\nWait, the example output is 3. My formula is wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the maximum size of a beautiful multiset.\nConsider the example $n=1, c_0=0, c_1=2$. Max multiset $\\{1,1\\}$. Size 2.\nMy formula: $\\min(c_0 \\cdot 2^{1-1}, c_1 \\cdot 2^{1-1}) = \\min(c_0, c_1) = \\min(0, 2) = 0$. This is not 2.\nThis implies my interpretation of the max size is incorrect.\n\nThe problem statement example: $n=2$, multiset $\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$. Size 4.\n$c_0=3, c_{00}=1, c_{01}=2, c_1=1, c_{10}=2, c_{11}=3$.\nCounts for prefixes:\n$0$: $00, 01, 01$. Total 3. $3 \\le c_0=3$. OK.\n$00$: $00$. Total 1. $1 \\le c_{00}=1$. OK.\n$01$: $01, 01$. Total 2. $2 \\le c_{01}=2$. OK.\n$1$: $11$. Total 1. $1 \\le c_1=1$. OK.\n$10$: None. Total 0. $0 \\le c_{10}=2$. OK.\n$11$: $11$. Total 1. $1 \\le c_{11}=3$. OK.\nAll constraints satisfied.\n\nThis is a standard maximum flow problem from a source $S$ to a sink $T$.\nNodes: $S$, $T$. For each prefix $s$ of length $L \\in [1, n-1]$, a node $U_s$. For each string $S$ of length $n$, a node $V_S$.\nEdges:\n1. From $S$ to $U_s$ for each $s$ of length 1, capacity $\\infty$. (Or, if we want to model $c_s$ as a node capacity, it's more complex).\n2. For each $s$ of length $L \\in [1, n-1]$:\n   - If $L < n-1$: $U_s \\to U_{s0}$ and $U_s \\to U_{s1}$, capacity $\\infty$.\n   - If $L = n-1$: $U_s \\to V_{s0}$ and $U_s \\to V_{s1}$, capacity $\\infty$.\n3. For each $V_S$ (string $S$ of length $n$): $V_S \\to T$, capacity $\\infty$.\n4. For each $s$ of length $L \\in [1, n]$, add a node $C_s$. Edges $C_s \\to U_s$ (if $L<n$) or $C_s \\to V_S$ (if $L=n$), with capacity $c_s$.\nThis is not quite right. The $c_s$ constraints apply to the *sum* of strings that have $s$ as a prefix. This means $c_s$ should be a capacity on an edge *leaving* the node $U_s$.\n\nThe maximum size of the multiset is given by the following:\nLet $x_S$ be the count of string $S$ of length $n$ in the multiset.\nThe total count for prefix $s$ is $\\sum_{S \\in P(s)} x_S \\le c_s$.\nThis is a standard formulation for a problem on a tree/trie.\nThe maximum total count $\\sum x_S$ is achieved by taking $x_S$ to be the maximum possible value for each $S$, where $x_S$ is constrained by all its prefixes.\nSpecifically, $x_S \\le c_s$ for any prefix $s$ of $S$. So $x_S \\le \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s$.\nTo maximize $\\sum x_S$, we set $x_S = \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s$.\nThen the total maximum size is $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} \\left( \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s \\right)$.\n\nLet $M(c_s)$ be this sum. We need to find the number of ways to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$ such that $M(c_s) = f$.\nThis is a dynamic programming problem on the binary tree/trie.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ for all prefixes of length $L$ and their descendants, such that the sum of minimums for the $2^{n-L}$ leaves under each such prefix $s$ is $\\text{val}$.\nThis is too complex because the sum depends on values from different branches.\n\nA simpler DP state:\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_sum}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ for all strings of length $L$ and their descendants, such that the sum of $\\min_{s' \\text{ prefix of } S, s' \\text{ starts at length } L} c_{s'}$ for all leaves $S$ under a particular string $s$ of length $L$ is equal to `current_sum`.\nNo, this is still not right. The $\\min$ depends on $c_s$ values of *ancestors* too.\n\nLet's use a DP state that tracks the minimum possible $c_s$ for any string $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{min_val}][\\text{current_sum}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ for all strings of length $L$ and their descendants, such that the minimum $c_s$ for any descendant string is $\\text{min_val}$, and the sum of $\\min_{s' \\text{ prefix of } S} c_{s'}$ for all $2^{n-L}$ leaves $S$ under a particular string $s$ of length $L$ is `current_sum`.\nThis is also not right. The prefix $s$ itself has a $c_s$ value.\n\nThe structure of the problem is that for each string $S$ of length $n$, its contribution to the total sum is $x_S = \\min(c_{s_1}, c_{s_2}, \\dots, c_{s_n})$, where $s_i$ are prefixes of $S$.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} x_S$.\nThis can be rewritten using inclusion-exclusion or by considering the structure of the trie.\nThe sum $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s$ can be calculated by summing over $s$:\nFor each $s$ of length $L$, the value $c_s$ is the minimum for some $2^{n-L}$ leaves.\nThe contribution of $c_s$ to the total sum is $c_s \\cdot (\\text{number of leaves } S \\text{ for which } s \\text{ is the *first* prefix whose } c \\text{ value is } c_s)$.\nThis is equivalent to: $c_s$ contributes $c_s - \\max(c_{s_0}, c_{s_1})$ (if $L<n$) to the sum for each leaf under $s$.\nMore precisely, $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} \\left( \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s \\right) = \\sum_{s \\text{ of length } L=1 \\dots n} (c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})) \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ where $c_{s0}=c_{s1}=0$ if $L=n$.\nThis is a standard result for calculating costs in a tree where path costs are $\\min$.\nLet $val(s) = c_s$. The total sum is $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} \\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} val(s)$.\nThis is equal to $\\sum_{s \\text{ of length } 1 \\dots n} (val(s) - \\max(val(s0), val(s1))) \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$ where $val(\\text{non-existent child}) = 0$.\nSo $f = \\sum_{s \\text{ of length } 1 \\dots n} (c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})) \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$.\nLet $d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ (with $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})=0$ if $s$ is a leaf).\nThen $f = \\sum_{s} d_s \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$.\nEach $d_s$ must be non-negative, because $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ must hold for the minimum to be taken at a deeper level. If $c_s < \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$, then $c_s$ would be the minimum for some paths, but this is already handled by $c_s$ itself.\nThe condition $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ is crucial for this formula.\nAlso, $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nThis means $d_s \\ge 0$.\nAnd $c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nBy induction from leaves up to root:\nFor leaves $S$ (length $n$): $c_S \\in [0, k]$. $d_S = c_S - 0 = c_S$. So $d_S \\in [0, k]$.\nFor $s$ of length $n-1$: $c_s \\in [0, k]$. $d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nWe need $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nAlso, $c_s \\le k$. So $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\nThis implies $d_s \\le k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n\nThis is a DP problem. We need to sum over all possible choices of $d_s$ values.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_sum}]$ be the number of ways to assign $d_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ and their descendants, such that the total sum contributed by these subtrees (i.e. $\\sum_{s' \\text{ in subtree}} d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$) is `current_sum`, and for each $s$ of length $L$, we know the value $c_s$.\nThe issue is $c_s$ depends on $d_s$ and $c_{s0}, c_{s1}$.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThis means $c_s$ can be very large if $c_{s0}, c_{s1}$ are large. But $c_s$ must be $\\le k$.\nSo $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $(d_s, c_s)$ for *one* string $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that $c_s \\le k$, $d_s \\ge 0$, and the sum of contributions for this subtree is $\\text{val}$.\nThe sum of contributions for this subtree is $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} + \\sum_{s' \\text{ descendant of } s} d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$.\nThe number of such strings $s$ of length $L$ is $2^L$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_c}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to assign $d_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of a string $s$ of length $L$, such that $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) = \\text{current_c}$ and the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ for descendants is $\\text{current_f}$.\nThis is a standard DP for tree problems where values depend on children.\n$dp[L][\\text{max_child_c}][\\text{subtree_f}]$\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{sum_d_val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ and their descendants, such that for each string $s'$ of length $L$, $c_{s'} = \\text{max_c_val}$ and $\\sum_{s'' \\text{ descendant of } s'} d_{s''} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s'')} = \\text{sum_d_val}$.\nThis is still too complicated. $c_s$ can be different for different $s$ of the same length.\n\nThe problem states $N \\le 15$. This suggests $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot \\text{something small})$ or $O(N \\cdot F \\cdot \\text{something small})$.\nThe maximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum possible sum $f$ is $k \\cdot \\sum_{L=1}^n 2^L \\cdot 2^{n-L} = k \\cdot \\sum_{L=1}^n 2^n = k \\cdot n \\cdot 2^n$.\nFor $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, this is $2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 2^{15} \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 32768 \\approx 10^{11}$. This is much larger than $f$. So $f$ is a relatively small value.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_c}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of a single string $s$ of length $L$, such that the maximum $c_{s'}$ among all strings $s'$ of length $L+1$ is `current_c`, and the sum $\\sum_{s' \\text{ descendant of } s} d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ is `current_f`.\nBase case: $L=n$. For a leaf $S$.\n$c_S \\in [0, k]$. $d_S = c_S$.\nThe sum is $d_S \\cdot 2^{n-n} = d_S \\cdot 1 = c_S$.\nSo $dp[n][\\text{c}][\\text{c}]$ = 1 for $c \\in [0, k]$. All other $dp[n][\\cdot][\\cdot]$ are 0.\nThe `max_child_c` for $L=n$ is 0, as there are no children.\nSo $dp[n][0][c] = 1$ for $c \\in [0, k]$.\n\nNow, for $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\nTo compute $dp[L][\\text{max_c}][\\text{total_f}]$ for a string $s$ of length $L$:\nWe need to combine results from $s0$ and $s1$ subtrees.\nLet $dp[L+1][\\text{max_c_child}][\\text{f_child}]$ be the DP state for one child.\nFor $s0$: $dp[L+1][\\text{max_c_0}][\\text{f_0}]$\nFor $s1$: $dp[L+1][\\text{max_c_1}][\\text{f_1}]$\nThe max $c$ value for children of $s$ is $\\max(\\text{max_c_0}, \\text{max_c_1})$.\nThe sum of $d$ values from children is $\\text{f_0} + \\text{f_1}$.\nSo we can compute $dp\\_combined[L+1][\\text{max_c_combined}][\\text{f_combined}]$ by iterating over all possible $\\text{max_c_0}, \\text{f_0}, \\text{max_c_1}, \\text{f_1}$.\n$\\text{max_c_combined} = \\max(\\text{max_c_0}, \\text{max_c_1})$.\n$\\text{f_combined} = \\text{f_0} + \\text{f_1}$.\n$dp\\_combined[L+1][\\text{max_c_combined}][\\text{f_combined}] += dp[L+1][\\text{max_c_0}][\\text{f_0}] \\cdot dp[L+1][\\text{max_c_1}][\\text{f_1}]$.\nThis can be done using polynomial multiplication (convolution).\nThe states are limited. $\\text{max_c}$ can go up to $k$. $\\text{sum_f}$ can go up to $f$.\nMax $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. Max $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe convolution would be $O(K \\cdot F^2)$ or $O(K \\cdot F \\log F)$. This is too slow.\n\nThe definition of $d_s$ is $c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThe $c_s$ values are constrained by $0 \\le c_s \\le k$.\nThis implies $0 \\le d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\n$d_s \\ge 0$.\nAlso, $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ must hold for the formula to be correct (otherwise the minimum is $c_s$ itself).\nThe formula $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} (\\min_{s \\text{ prefix of } S} c_s) = \\sum_{s \\text{ of length } 1 \\dots n} (c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})) \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$ is valid only if $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ for all $s$ of length $<n$, and $c_S \\ge 0$ for leaves $S$.\nIf this holds, then $d_s \\ge 0$.\nThe constraint $c_s \\le k$ means $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\nSo $d_s \\le k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThus, for each $s$ of length $L < n$, $d_s$ can range from $0$ to $k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nFor leaves $S$ (length $n$), $d_S$ can range from $0$ to $k$.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_val}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of a string $s$ of length $L$, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for all $s'$ of length $L+1$ is `max_val`, and the sum $\\sum_{s' \\text{ descendant of } s} d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ is `current_f`.\nThis is still not right. The `max_val` is for *children* of $s$, not $s$ itself.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{c_val}][\\text{f_val}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of a string $s$ of length $L$, such that $c_s = \\text{c_val}$ and the sum from $s$'s subtree is $\\text{f_val}$.\nBase case $L=n$: $c_S \\in [0, k]$. $d_S = c_S$. Sum is $c_S$.\nSo $dp[n][c_S][c_S] = 1$ for $c_S \\in [0, k]$.\nFor $L < n$:\nTo compute $dp[L][c_s][f_s]$:\nWe need to combine $dp[L+1][c_{s0}][f_{s0}]$ and $dp[L+1][c_{s1}][f_{s1}]$.\n$c_s$ must be $\\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$f_s = (c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})) \\cdot 2^{n-L} + f_{s0} + f_{s1}$.\nLet $M = \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$f_s = (c_s - M) \\cdot 2^{n-L} + f_{s0} + f_{s1}$.\n$dp[L][c_s][f_s] = \\sum_{c_{s0}, f_{s0}} \\sum_{c_{s1}, f_{s1}} dp[L+1][c_{s0}][f_{s0}] \\cdot dp[L+1][c_{s1}][f_{s1}]$\nwhere $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ and $f_s = (c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})) \\cdot 2^{n-L} + f_{s0} + f_{s1}$.\nThe $c_s$ can go up to $k$. The $f_s$ can go up to $f$.\nThis means $dp[L]$ is a $K \\times F$ table.\nTo compute $dp[L]$ from $dp[L+1]$:\nFor each $c_s \\in [0, k]$:\n  We need to compute the sum of $dp[L+1][c_{s0}][f_{s0}] \\cdot dp[L+1][c_{s1}][f_{s1}]$ for valid $c_{s0}, c_{s1}, f_{s0}, f_{s1}$.\n  Let $P[M][F'] = \\sum_{c_{s0}, f_{s0}, c_{s1}, f_{s1} \\text{ s.t. } \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})=M, f_{s0}+f_{s1}=F'} dp[L+1][c_{s0}][f_{s0}] \\cdot dp[L+1][c_{s1}][f_{s1}]$.\n  This is a 2D convolution.\n  $P[M][F'] = \\sum_{c_0, c_1 \\text{ s.t. } \\max(c_0, c_1)=M} \\left( \\sum_{f_0, f_1 \\text{ s.t. } f_0+f_1=F'} dp[L+1][c_0][f_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][c_1][f_1] \\right)$.\n  The inner sum is a 1D convolution for fixed $c_0, c_1$.\n  Let $Poly_c(x) = \\sum_f dp[L+1][c][f] x^f$.\n  Then $\\sum_{f_0, f_1 \\text{ s.t. } f_0+f_1=F'} dp[L+1][c_0][f_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][c_1][f_1]$ is the coefficient of $x^{F'}$ in $Poly_{c_0}(x) \\cdot Poly_{c_1}(x)$.\n  The degree of these polynomials is $f$. Convolution takes $O(F \\log F)$.\n  There are $K$ such polynomials.\n  To compute $P[M][F']$:\n  Iterate $M$ from $0$ to $k$.\n  For a fixed $M$:\n    Iterate $c_0$ from $0$ to $M$.\n      If $c_0 = M$: iterate $c_1$ from $0$ to $M$.\n        If $c_1 < M$: contribute $Poly_M(x) \\cdot Poly_{c_1}(x)$ to $P[M][\\cdot]$.\n        If $c_1 = M$: contribute $Poly_M(x) \\cdot Poly_M(x)$ to $P[M][\\cdot]$.\n      If $c_0 < M$: iterate $c_1$ from $0$ to $M$.\n        If $c_1 = M$: contribute $Poly_{c_0}(x) \\cdot Poly_M(x)$ to $P[M][\\cdot]$.\n  This is $O(K^2 \\cdot F \\log F)$.

The problem says length 1 to $n$.\nSo we need to compute for $2^1$ strings of length 1.\nLet $A_L(x) = \\sum_{C=0}^k \\sum_{F=0}^f H[L][C][F] x^F$ be a polynomial for a single node of length $L$.\nThen the answer is the coefficient of $x^f$ in $(A_1(x))^{2^1}$. (No, this is wrong. $c_s$ values are related).\n\nThe $c_s$ for $s$ of length $L$ are not independent. $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThis dependency is what makes it hard.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\nStrings are $0, 1$. Prefixes are $0, 1$.\n$f = (c_0 - 0) \\cdot 2^{1-1} + (c_1 - 0) \\cdot 2^{1-1} = c_0 + c_1$.\nWe need to find number of pairs $(c_0, c_1)$ such that $0 \\le c_0, c_1 \\le k=42$ and $c_0+c_1=f=2$.\nPossible pairs $(c_0, c_1)$: $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$.\nThere are 3 ways. This matches the example!\nSo the formula $f = \\sum_s (c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})) \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$ is correct.\nAnd the conditions are $0 \\le c_s \\le k$ and $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ (or $c_S \\ge 0$ for leaves).\nThis means $d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ must be $\\ge 0$.\nAnd $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\n\nLet $P_L(C, F)$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of a single string $s$ of length $L$, such that $c_s=C$ and the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ for $s'$ in $s$'s subtree is $F$.\nBase case $L=n$: $s$ is a leaf. $c_S \\in [0, k]$. $d_S = c_S$. Sum is $c_S$.\n$P_n(C, C) = 1$ for $C \\in [0, k]$. All other $P_n(C, F)$ are 0.\n\nFor $L = n-1, \\dots, 1$:\nTo compute $P_L(C, F)$:\nWe need to consider $c_{s0}$ and $c_{s1}$ and their subtrees.\nLet $M = \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nWe need $C \\ge M$.\n$F = (C-M) \\cdot 2^{n-L} + F_0 + F_1$.\n$P_L(C, F) = \\sum_{M=0}^C \\sum_{F_0, F_1 \\text{ s.t. } F_0+F_1 = F - (C-M)2^{n-L}} \\sum_{c_{s0}, c_{s1} \\text{ s.t. } \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})=M} P_{L+1}(c_{s0}, F_0) \\cdot P_{L+1}(c_{s1}, F_1)$.\nLet $Q_M(y) = \\sum_{F'} \\left( \\sum_{c_0, c_1 \\text{ s.t. } \\max(c_0, c_1)=M} \\sum_{F_0+F_1=F'} P_{L+1}(c_0, F_0) P_{L+1}(c_1, F_1) \\right) y^{F'}$.\nThis is the same $Q_M(y)$ as before.\n$P_L(C, F) = \\sum_{M=0}^C \\text{coeff}(y^{F - (C-M)2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\n\nLet's analyze complexity for $P_L(C, F)$ calculation again.\n1. For each $C_x \\in [0, k]$, compute $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(C_x, y) = \\sum_{F_x=0}^f P_{L+1}(C_x, F_x) y^{F_x}$. (This is just creating polynomials). $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n2. For each $M \\in [0, k]$, compute $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y) = \\sum_{C_x=0}^M P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(C_x, y)$. This is $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M-1, y) + P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(M, y)$. $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n3. For each $M \\in [0, k]$, compute $(P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y))^2$. This is $K$ convolutions. $O(K \\cdot F \\log F)$.\n4. For each $M \\in [0, k]$, compute $Q_M(y) = (P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y))^2 - (P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M-1, y))^2$. $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n5. For each $C \\in [0, k]$ and $F \\in [0, f]$, compute $P_L(C, F)$.\n   $P_L(C, F) = \\sum_{M=0}^C \\text{coeff}(y^{F - (C-M)2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\n   The sum is over $M$. The number of terms $M$ is $C+1$.\n   The offset $F_{offset} = (C-M)2^{n-L}$. $F_{offset} \\le F \\le f$.\n   $C-M \\le f / 2^{n-L}$.\n   So the sum is over $D = C-M$ from $0$ to $\\min(C, f/2^{n-L})$.\n   The number of terms is $O(f/2^{n-L})$.\n   So step 5 takes $O(K \\cdot F \\cdot (f/2^{n-L}))$.\nTotal time for one $L$: $O(K \\cdot F \\log F + K \\cdot F \\cdot (f/2^{n-L}))$.\nThe $K \\cdot F \\log F$ term dominates when $f/2^{n-L}$ is small.\nThe $K \\cdot F \\cdot (f/2^{n-L})$ term dominates when $f/2^{n-L}$ is large. $f/2^{n-L}$ is largest for $L=n$, where it's $f$.\nSo for $L=n-1$, $V_{n-1} = 2^1 = 2$. Complexity $O(K \\cdot F \\log F + K \\cdot F \\cdot f/2)$.\nFor $L=1$, $V_1 = 2^{n-1}$. $O(K \\cdot F \\log F + K \\cdot F \\cdot f/2^{n-1})$.\nTotal complexity: $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\log F + N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f \\sum_{L=1}^n 1/2^{n-L})$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{L=1}^n 1/2^{n-L} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 1/2^j = (1 - (1/2)^n)/(1-1/2) = 2(1 - 1/2^n) < 2$.\nSo total complexity is $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\log F + N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f)$.\n$N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f = 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\approx 1.2 \\cdot 10^{16}$. This is too much.\n\nThe problem must have a trick.\nThe maximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum number of strings of length $n$ is $2^n$. For $n=15$, $2^{15} = 32768$.\nThe maximum $f$ can be $k \\cdot 2^n$. For $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, this is $2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 32768 \\approx 6.5 \\cdot 10^9$.\n$f$ is much smaller than the maximum possible sum.\n\nWhat if $C$ is also small?\nThe $c_s$ values can be up to $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe $F$ values can be up to $f=2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe total number of states for $P_L(C,F)$ is $K \\cdot F$.\n$P_L(C,F)$ is the number of ways.\nThe total number of strings $s$ is $2(2^n-1)$.\nThe maximum $C$ that matters for $P_L(C,F)$ is $f$. If $C > f$, then $c_s$ can be reduced to $f$ without changing the total sum $F$, as $F \\le f$.\nIf $C > f$, then $c_s$ can be chosen as $f$.\nNo, this is wrong. $c_s$ can be large, but $d_s$ must be small.\n$d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F \\le f$.\nSo $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nSo $c_s$ can be large if $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ is large.\nHowever, if $c_s > f$, then $d_s$ must be 0 for $s$ to contribute to $f$.\nNo, that's not right. $c_s$ can be $k$, and $d_s$ can be $k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThe sum $F$ is $\\sum d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $d_s$ could still be small.\n\nConsider the values $c_s$ can take. They are integers from $0$ to $k$.\nThe final sum $f$ is also an integer.\nThe DP state $P_L(C,F)$ is for a single node.\nThe final answer is $P_1(C, f)$ summed over all $C \\in [0, k]$.\nNo, this is for $2^1$ strings of length 1.\nLet $P_L(C, F)$ be the number of ways for a single node $s$ of length $L$ to have $c_s=C$ and its subtree contributes $F$ to the total sum.\nThe final answer is for the whole tree.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{s \\text{ length } 1 \\dots n} d_s \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all $2^L$ nodes of length $L$ and their descendants, such that the total sum from these $2^L$ subtrees is `current_f`.\n$dp[L][\\text{current_f}] = \\sum_{F_1, \\dots, F_{2^L} \\text{ s.t. } \\sum F_i = \\text{current_f}} \\prod_{i=1}^{2^L} (\\sum_{C_i=0}^k P_L(C_i, F_i))$.\nLet $Poly_L(x) = \\sum_{F=0}^f (\\sum_{C=0}^k P_L(C, F)) x^F$.\nThen $dp[L][\\text{current_f}]$ is the coefficient of $x^{\\text{current_f}}$ in $(Poly_L(x))^{2^L}$.\nThis is polynomial exponentiation. $(Poly_L(x))^{2^L}$ can be computed by repeated squaring in $O(L \\cdot F \\log F)$ time.\nSo the overall algorithm:\n1. Compute $P_n(C, F)$. $P_n(C,C)=1$ for $C \\in [0, k]$.\n2. For $L = n-1, \\dots, 1$:\n   a. Compute $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(C_x, y) = \\sum_{F_x=0}^f P_{L+1}(C_x, F_x) y^{F_x}$. $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n   b. Compute $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y) = \\sum_{C_x=0}^M P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(C_x, y)$. $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n   c. Compute $(P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y))^2$ for all $M$. $O(K \\cdot F \\log F)$.\n   d. Compute $Q_M(y) = (P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y))^2 - (P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M-1, y))^2$. $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n   e. Compute $P_L(C, F)$ using $Q_M(y)$. This is the $O(K \\cdot F \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$ part.\n3. After computing $P_1(C, F)$, compute $Poly_1(x) = \\sum_{F=0}^f (\\sum_{C=0}^k P_1(C, F)) x^F$. $O(K \\cdot F)$.\n4. Compute $(Poly_1(x))^{2^1}$. This is $Poly_1(x) \\cdot Poly_1(x)$. $O(F \\log F)$.\nThe coefficient of $x^f$ in $(Poly_1(x))^2$ is the answer.\n\nThe total complexity is $O(N \\cdot (K \\cdot F \\log F + K \\cdot F \\cdot f / 2^{n-L}))$.\nThe $f/2^{n-L}$ term is the problem.\n$N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f \\approx 10^{16}$. This is not the intended solution.\n\nThe problem states $N \\le 15$. This is small.\n$K, F \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$. These are large.\nThe total number of $c_s$ values is $2(2^n-1)$. For $n=15$, this is $2(32768-1) \\approx 6.5 \\cdot 10^4$.\nThis is small enough to iterate over some choices of $c_s$.\n\nThe $f$ value is the target sum.\nThe values $d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ are constrained by $d_s \\ge 0$ and $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_s d_s \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)} = f$.\nLet $w_s = 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$. These are powers of 2.\n$f = \\sum_s d_s \\cdot w_s$.\nThe weights $w_s$ are $2^{n-1}, 2^{n-2}, \\dots, 2^0$.\nFor $L=1$, $w_s = 2^{n-1}$. There are $2^1$ such strings.\nFor $L=2$, $w_s = 2^{n-2}$. There are $2^2$ such strings.\n...\nFor $L=n$, $w_s = 2^0 = 1$. There are $2^n$ such strings.\n\nLet $dp[curr\\_L][\\text{current_max_c}][\\text{current_sum}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $curr\\_L$ and their descendants, such that the maximum $c_s$ for a string of length $curr\\_L$ is $\\text{current_max_c}$, and the total sum from these subtrees is $\\text{current_sum}$.\nThis is for a single branch.\nThe total sum $f$ is small. The maximum value of $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ is $f$.\nSo $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nFor $L=1$, $d_s \\le f/2^{n-1}$.\nFor $L=n$, $d_s \\le f$.\nThe relevant $d_s$ values are small for small $L$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_c}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to choose $d_{s'}$ for a single node $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for children of $s$ (length $L+1$) is $\\text{max_c}$, and the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ for $s'$ in $s$'s subtree is $\\text{current_f}$.\nThe `max_c` can still be up to $k$.\n\nThe values $c_s$ can be large, but only their differences $d_s$ matter for the sum.\n$c_s = \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) + d_s$.\nAlso, $c_s \\le k$. So $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) + d_s \\le k$.\nThis implies $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k - d_s$.\nThis means the maximum possible $c$ value for children is limited by $d_s$.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of $s$ of length $L$, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for length $L+1$ is `max_c_val`, and the sum from descendants (excluding $d_s$) is `current_f`.\nBase case $L=n$: No children. `max_c_val` is 0.\n$dp[n][0][0] = 1$. (Represents no children, so max child c is 0, sum from children is 0).\nFor $L = n-1, \\dots, 0$: (Let $L=0$ be the root/empty string)\nWe want to compute $dp[L][\\text{max_c}][\\text{current_f}]$\nThis DP state is for a single node.\nTo combine children $s0, s1$:\nLet $P_{L+1}(\\text{max_c_child}, \\text{f_child})$ be the $dp[L+1]$ values.\nLet $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(M, y) = \\sum_{\\text{f_child}} P_{L+1}(M, \\text{f_child}) y^{\\text{f_child}}$.\nLet $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y) = \\sum_{M' \\le M} P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(M', y)$.\n$Q_M(y) = (P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y))^2 - (P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M-1, y))^2$.\n$Q_M(y)$ represents the sum of $P_{L+1}(M_0, F_0) P_{L+1}(M_1, F_1)$ where $\\max(M_0, M_1)=M$.\nNow, for $dp[L][\\text{max_c}][\\text{current_f}]$:\nWe iterate over $M \\in [0, k]$. This is the $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ value.\nWe iterate over $d_s \\in [0, k-M]$.\nThe contribution of $d_s$ is $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe total sum for $s$'s children is $\\text{current_f} - d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nSo $dp[L][M_s][F_s] = \\sum_{M=0}^k \\sum_{d_s=0}^{k-M} \\text{coeff}(y^{F_s - d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\nHere $M_s$ is $M$.\nThe number of non-zero terms for $d_s$ is $k-M+1$.\nThe $F_s - d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ must be $\\ge 0$.\nSo $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F_s \\le f$.\nThis limits $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nSo $d_s$ loop is $O(\\min(k-M, f/2^{n-L}))$.\nThe $M$ loop is $O(k)$.\nThe calculation for $dp[L]$ is $O(K \\cdot F \\log F + K \\cdot F \\cdot \\min(k, f/2^{n-L}))$.\nThis is still $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot \\max(k, f))$.\nThe $k$ for $\\min(k, f/2^{n-L})$ makes it $O(N \\cdot K^2 F)$.\nThis is $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 10^{16}$.\n\nThe $N=15$ constraint is very small.\nPerhaps this is related to polynomial exponentiation of a polynomial where the coefficients are themselves polynomials.\nFor $n=15$, the number of $c_s$ values is $2(2^{15}-1) = 65534$.\nThe max value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum values of $c_s$ are $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe values $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ must sum to $f$.\nLet $x_i$ be the $d_s$ values. $w_i$ be $2^{n-L}$. $\\sum x_i w_i = f$.\nThis is a variation of subset sum.\nThe number of distinct weights $w_i$ is $n$. The number of strings with weight $w_L=2^{n-L}$ is $2^L$.\nSo we have $2^1$ variables with weight $2^{n-1}$, $2^2$ variables with weight $2^{n-2}$, ..., $2^n$ variables with weight $1$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ values.\nThe maximum value of $d_s$ is $k$.\nThe sum $f$ is small.\nThe number of ways to choose $d_s$ values, such that $\\sum d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} = f$, and $d_s \\le k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThe $c_s$ values are coupled.\n\nConsider a simpler problem: what if $k$ was small?\nThen $dp[L][\\text{max_c}][\\text{current_f}]$ would be $O(N \\cdot K^2 \\cdot F)$.\nBut $k$ is large.\n\nIf $k$ is very large, say $k \\ge f$. Then $d_s \\le k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ becomes $d_s \\le k$.\nAnd $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$. So $d_s \\le \\min(k, f/2^{n-L})$.\nIf $k \\ge f$, then $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nThis means $d_s$ values are effectively bounded by $f$.\nThe `max_c` in $dp[L][\\text{max_c}][\\text{current_f}]$ can still be $k$.\nBut if $c_s > f$, then $d_s$ must be 0 for $s$ to contribute to $f$.\nNo, this logic is incorrect. $c_s$ can be $k$, and $d_s$ can be positive.\nE.g., $c_s=k=100$, $c_{s0}=0, c_{s1}=0$. Then $d_s=100$.\nIf $f=10$, and $n=1, L=1$, $2^{n-L}=1$. $d_s \\cdot 1 \\le 10$. So $d_s \\le 10$.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $c_s$ can be anything from $f+1$ to $k$.\nThis means $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$.\nThis is the key observation.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{limit_c}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for a single node $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that $c_s=\\text{limit_c}$ and the total sum from $s$'s subtree is $\\text{current_f}$.\nWe only need to track $c_s$ up to $f$. If $c_s > f$, it behaves effectively the same.\nLet $C_{\\text{max_eff}} = f$.\nSo $c_s$ can be in $[0, f]$ or $c_s > f$.\nIf $c_s > f$: $c_s \\in [f+1, k]$. There are $k-f$ such values.\nIf $c_s \\le f$: $c_s \\in [0, f]$. There are $f+1$ such values.\nThis means our $C$ dimension can be $f+1$ states for $c_s \\le f$, and one state for $c_s > f$. Total $f+2$ states.\nLet $dp[L][C][F]$ where $C \\in [0, f]$ or $C=f+1$ (representing $c_s \\in [f+1, k]$).\nBase case $L=n$:\n$dp[n][C][C]=1$ for $C \\in [0, f]$.\n$dp[n][f+1][C]=1$ for $C \\in [f+1, k]$. The sum is $C$.\nThis cannot be condensed. The $F$ value still depends on $C$.\nThe sum $\\sum d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ is at most $f$.\nSo $F$ is at most $f$.\n$d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F \\le f$.\nSo $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$, then $c_s$ will be $>f$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le f$, then $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$ implies $d_s > f - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThe $P_L(C,F)$ state is for $C \\in [0, f]$.\nFor $C > f$, $P_L(C,F)$ can be written as $P_L(f,F)$ (if $C \\ge f$ means $c_s$ is large enough).\nLet $P_L(C,F)$ be for $C \\in [0, \\min(k, f)]$.\nLet $P_L(f+1, F)$ be for $C \\in [\\min(k,f)+1, k]$.\nThis would make the $C$ dimension $\\min(k,f)$ instead of $k$. Max $F$ is $f$.\nThe $K$ becomes $\\min(k,f)$. $K' = \\min(k,f)$.\nComplexity $O(N \\cdot (K' \\cdot F \\log F + K' \\cdot F \\cdot f))$.\nThis is $O(N \\cdot f \\cdot F \\cdot f) = O(N \\cdot f^3)$.\n$15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^3 \\approx 10^{17}$. Still too slow.\n\nThe only way this works is if $N \\cdot K \\cdot F$ is not the total complexity.\nThe total number of coefficients $P_L(C,F)$ that are non-zero is limited.\n$F \\le f$.\n$C \\le k$.\nMax $C$ that matters for $F$ is $f$.\nIf $C > f$, then $d_s = C - \\max(C_0, C_1)$.\n$F = d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} + F_0 + F_1$.\nIf $C > f$, then $c_s$ is chosen from $f+1 \\dots k$.\nThis gives $k-f$ choices for $c_s$.\nLet $P_L(C,F)$ be defined for $C \\in [0, f]$.\nLet $P_L(\\text{large}, F)$ be the sum of $P_L(C,F)$ for $C \\in [f+1, k]$.\n$P_L(\\text{large}, F) = \\sum_{C=f+1}^k P_L(C,F)$.\nThe maximum sum $F$ is $f$.\n$d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F \\le f$. So $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nThis limits the $d_s$ values to a small range.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nSo $c_s$ can be large if $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ is large.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$, then $c_s$ will be $>f$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le f$, then $c_s$ can be $\\le f$ or $>f$.\n$c_s \\le f$ if $d_s \\le f - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$c_s > f$ if $d_s > f - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n\nThe number of states for $C$ is $\\approx f$.\nThe number of states for $F$ is $\\approx f$.\nThe $P_L(C,F)$ table is $f \\times f$.\nThe $K$ in $K \\cdot F \\log F$ becomes $f$.\nThe $K$ in $K \\cdot F \\cdot f/2^{n-L}$ becomes $f$.\nSo $O(N \\cdot f \\cdot f \\cdot f / 2^{n-L}) = O(N \\cdot f^3)$. Still too slow.\n\nThe small $N$ implies that maybe the number of leaves $2^N$ is important.\nThe number of strings is $2^N$.\nThe total number of prefixes is $2(2^N-1)$.\nThe maximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe $dp[L][C][F]$ state is for a single node.\nThe final answer is for the root (empty string).\n$f = \\sum_{s \\text{ length } 1 \\dots n} d_s \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{MaxC}][\\text{SumF}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of a string $s$ of length $L$, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for all $s'$ of length $L$ is $\\text{MaxC}$ and $\\sum_{s' \\text{ in subtree}} d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ is $\\text{SumF}$.\nNo, this is for a single node.\nThe overall answer is $P_0(C,f)$ for the empty string $s_0$.\nThe length of $s_0$ is 0. So $L=0$.\n$P_0(C,F)$ is the number of ways to assign $c_s$ for all strings of length $1 \\dots n$ such that $c_{\\text{root}}=C$ and total sum is $F$.\nThe $c_{\\text{root}}$ is not part of the problem. $s$ has length $1 \\dots n$.\nSo we need to combine the results for $0$ and $1$ (children of root).\nThe final result is $\\sum_{C_0=0}^k \\sum_{C_1=0}^k \\sum_{F_0, F_1 \\text{ s.t. } F_0+F_1=f} P_1(C_0, F_0) P_1(C_1, F_1)$.\nThis is $\\text{coeff}(x^f, (\\sum_{C=0}^k P_1(C,x))^2)$.\nThis is $O(F \\log F)$ after computing $P_1(C,F)$.\n\nThe problem is that $P_L(C,F)$ has $K \\cdot F$ states.\nThe transitions $Q_M(y)$ are $K$ convolutions. $O(K F \\log F)$.\nThen $P_L(C,F)$ from $Q_M(y)$ is $O(K \\cdot F \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{L=1}^n f/2^{n-L}$ is $O(f)$.\nSo the total complexity is $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\log F + N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f)$.\nThis is $15 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2\\cdot 10^5) + 15 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^5$.\nThe second term is $10^{16}$.\nThe first term is $15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{10} \\cdot 18 \\approx 10^{13}$.\n\nThis is a well-known problem structure that uses a technique called \"small to large\" or \"DSU on tree\" for polynomials.\nThe polynomial $P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly_sum}}(M, y)$ is defined as $\\sum_{C_x=0}^M P_{L+1}^{\\text{poly}}(C_x, y)$.\nThe coefficients $P_{L+1}(C_x, F_x)$ are counts.\nThe maximum value of $F_x$ is $f$.\nThe maximum value of $C_x$ is $k$.\nThe $P_L(C,F)$ should have $C$ bounded by $f$.\nLet $P_L(C,F)$ for $C \\in [0,f]$. If $c_s > f$, we can treat it as $c_s=f+1$ (or some sentinel value).\nLet $P_L(C,F)$ be the number of ways, for a string $s$ of length $L$, that $c_s=C$ and the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ in $s$'s subtree is $F$.\n$C$ can range from $0$ to $k$. $F$ can range from $0$ to $f$.\nThe $P_L(C,F)$ values for $C > f$ are not just $P_L(f,F)$.\nExample: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$P_1(C,F)$ for $C \\in [0,42], F \\in [0,2]$.\n$L=1$: $P_1(C,C)=1$ for $C \\in [0,42]$.\n$P_1(0,0)=1, P_1(1,1)=1, P_1(2,2)=1, \\dots, P_1(42,42)=1$.\nAll other $P_1(C,F)=0$.\nFinal answer for $n=1$:\n$(\\sum_{C=0}^k P_1(C,x))^2$.\n$Poly_1(x) = \\sum_{C=0}^k P_1(C,C) x^C = \\sum_{C=0}^k x^C = 1+x+x^2+\\dots+x^k$.\nWe need coeff $x^f$ in $(1+x+\\dots+x^k)^2$.\nFor $f=2, k=42$: coeff $x^2$ in $(1+x+\\dots+x^{42})^2$.\n$(1+x+\\dots+x^{42})(1+x+\\dots+x^{42})$.\nCoeff $x^2$ is $1 \\cdot x^2 + x \\cdot x^1 + x^2 \\cdot 1 = 1+1+1=3$. This matches example.\n\nSo the $P_L(C,F)$ definition is correct.\nThe problem is with the complexity of summing $P_L(C,F)$ for $C>f$.\nFor $C > f$, $d_s = C - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F \\le f$.\nThis means $d_s$ must be $\\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nSo $C - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\n$C \\le f/2^{n-L} + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ is large, $C$ can be large.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le f$, then $C \\le f/2^{n-L} + f$. This is $O(f)$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$, then $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ can be up to $k$.\nThen $C$ can be up to $f/2^{n-L} + k$.\nThis means $C$ can be up to $k+f$. But $c_s \\le k$.\nSo $C \\le k$.\nThis means $P_L(C,F)$ for $C \\in [0,k]$ is correct.\n\nThe $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\log F + N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f)$ complexity is correct.\nThe $K \\cdot F \\cdot f$ part comes from $\\sum_{L=1}^n K \\cdot F \\cdot (f/2^{n-L})$.\nThe $\\sum_{L=1}^n (f/2^{n-L})$ is $O(f)$.\nSo the term is $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f)$.\nFor $N=15, K=2 \\cdot 10^5, F=2 \\cdot 10^5, f=2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^3 \\approx 1.2 \\cdot 10^{16}$. This is too high.\n\nThe maximum value of $C$ that is relevant for $P_L(C,F)$ must be related to $f$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $c_s$ can be any value from $f+1$ to $k$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ in this range is $k-f$.\nLet $P_L(C,F)$ be for $C \\in [0,f]$.\nLet $P_L(\\text{large}, F)$ be for $C \\in [f+1, k]$.\n$P_L(\\text{large}, F) = \\sum_{C=f+1}^k P_L(C,F)$.\nFor $P_L(C,F)$ where $C \\le f$:\n  $P_L(C,F) = \\sum_{M=0}^C \\text{coeff}(y^{F - (C-M)2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\n  $M$ ranges from $0$ to $C$. So $M \\le f$.\n  This sum is $O(f \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$. Total $O(f^2 \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nFor $P_L(\\text{large}, F)$:\n  $P_L(\\text{large}, F) = \\sum_{C=f+1}^k \\sum_{M=0}^C \\text{coeff}(y^{F - (C-M)2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\n  This sum is $O((k-f) \\cdot f \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nThe $K$ becomes $f$ (for $C \\le f$) and $k-f$ (for $C > f$).\nThis is $O(N \\cdot f^3 + N \\cdot k \\cdot f^2)$. Still too slow.\n\nThe only way $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\log F + N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot f)$ is fast enough is if $f$ is very small, or $K$ is very small.\nPerhaps the effective $K$ is small.\nThe $c_s$ values are $0 \\dots k$.\nBut $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $c_{s0}, c_{s1}$ are large, $c_s$ can be large.\nThe number of distinct values for $c_s$ can be large.\n\nThis problem is a standard DP with polynomial multiplication.\n$N \\cdot F \\log F$ is $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This is acceptable.\nThe $K$ factor is the problem.\nIf $K$ is replaced by $f$, then $N \\cdot f^2 \\log f$ is $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 \\cdot 18 \\approx 10^{13}$.\nThe $K$ must be removed or reduced to a constant.\n\nThe maximum value of $c_s$ that influences $d_s$ is $f$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $d_s$ must be $0$.\nNo, this is wrong. $d_s$ can be positive if $c_s > f$.\nE.g., $c_s=100, c_{s0}=50$. $d_s=50$. If $f=10$, $c_s > f$.\nThe number of ways to pick $c_s$ where $c_s > f$.\nIf we fix $d_s$, then $c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$c_s$ must be $\\le k$. So $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\nThis implies $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k - d_s$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of $s$ of length $L$, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for children of $s$ (length $L+1$) is `max_c_val`, and the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ for $s'$ in $s$'s subtree is `current_f`.\nThe state for `max_c_val` can be reduced.\nIf `max_c_val > f`, then we can effectively treat it as `f+1`.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$ be for $\\text{max_c_val} \\in [0, f]$.\nLet $dp[L][f+1][\\text{current_f}]$ be for $\\text{max_c_val} \\in [f+1, k]$.\nThis reduces the $K$ dimension to $f$.\nBase case $L=n$: $dp[n][0][0] = 1$. (Max child $c$ is 0, sum from children is 0).\nFor $L < n$:\nTo compute $dp[L][M_s][F_s]$:\nWe iterate over $M \\in [0, f+1]$. This is $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nWe iterate over $d_s \\in [0, k-M]$.\n$d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F_s \\le f$. So $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nSo $d_s$ loop is $O(f/2^{n-L})$.\nThe $M$ loop is $O(f)$.\nThe calculation for $dp[L]$ is $O(f \\cdot F \\log F + f \\cdot F \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nThis is $O(N \\cdot f^2 \\log F + N \\cdot f^2 \\cdot f)$.\n$N \\cdot f^3 = 15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^3 \\approx 10^{17}$.\nThe $f$ factor in $f/2^{n-L}$ is the problem.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to choose $d_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of $s$ of length $L$, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for children of $s$ (length $L+1$) is `max_c_val` (where `max_c_val` is capped at $f+1$), and the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ for $s'$ in $s$'s subtree is `current_f`.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ given $d_s$ and $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$:\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $c_s \\le f$: we need $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le f$.\nIf $c_s > f$: we need $d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$.\nThis means $c_s$ is chosen from $[f+1, k]$. There are $k-f$ choices.\nThis is the key.\nInstead of $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$, define $dp[L][\\text{current_f}]$ as a polynomial where coefficient of $x^M$ is the number of ways for a single node $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that $\\max(c_{s'})$ for children of $s$ (length $L+1$) is $M$, and the sum from children is $\\text{current_f}$.\nLet $Poly[L][M](y) = \\sum_F dp[L][M][F] y^F$.\nThe $M$ dimension is $f+2$.\nThe $F$ dimension is $f$.\nThe overall complexity is $N \\cdot f \\cdot f \\log f$. This is $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 \\cdot 18 \\approx 10^{13}$. This is still too high.\n\nThe maximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum number of distinct weights $2^{n-L}$ is $n$.\n$N \\le 15$.\nThe values $d_s$ are small.\nThe maximum $d_s$ is $f$.\nThe number of ways to pick $d_s$ values is $(f+1)^{2(2^n-1)}$.\nThis is very large.\n\nThe sum is $\\sum_{s} d_s \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s)} = f$.\nThe values $d_s$ are bounded by $d_s \\le k$.\nAnd $d_s \\le f/2^{n-\\text{length}(s)}$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_f}][\\text{max_c_from_children}]$ be the number of ways to assign $d_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L$ and their descendants, such that sum is `current_f` and max $c$ from children is `max_c_from_children`.\nThis is for all $2^L$ strings.\n\nThe solution must use the fact that $f$ is small.\nThe maximum value of $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ is $f$.\nThe $c_s$ values are related by $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThis means $c_s$ must be at least as large as its children's $c$ values.\nSo $c_s \\ge c_{s'}$ for any $s'$ in $s$'s subtree.\nThus, $c_s \\ge \\max_{S \\text{ leaf in subtree}} c_S$.\nSo $c_s \\in [\\max_{S \\text{ leaf in subtree}} c_S, k]$.\nThis implies $d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\in [0, k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})]$.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{min_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for a single node $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that $\\min_{s' \\text{ in subtree}} c_{s'} = \\text{min_c_val}$, and $\\sum_{s' \\text{ in subtree}} d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')} = \\text{current_f}$.\nThis is a different interpretation of the max size of a beautiful multiset.\n\nThe problem is $O(N \\cdot F^2)$ or $O(N \\cdot F \\log F)$ at most.\nThis means the $K$ factor must be a constant.\n$K$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe states for $C$ must be $O(1)$.\nThis implies that we don't care about the exact value of $C$.\nThe only thing that matters for $c_s$ is $c_s \\le k$ and $c_s \\ge \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThe $d_s$ values are what contribute to $f$.\nIf $c_s$ is large enough, then it doesn't constrain $d_s$.\n$d_s \\le k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\ge f$, then $d_s$ can be any value up to $f$.\nThis depends on $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ is small, then $d_s$ can be large.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ is large, then $d_s$ must be small.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_f}]$ be a polynomial in $x$. The coefficient of $x^M$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for a single node $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that the total sum is `current_f` and $\\max(c_{s'})$ for children of $s$ (length $L+1$) is $M$.\nThe $M$ is capped at $f$. And one state for $M > f$.\nSo $M \\in [0, f+1]$.\nThe number of states for $M$ is $f+2$.\nThe number of states for $F$ is $f+1$.\n$dp[L]$ is a $(f+2) \\times (f+1)$ table.\nTransition from $L+1$ to $L$:\nFor each $M \\in [0, f+1]$:\n  Let $Poly_{L+1}(M, y) = \\sum_F dp[L+1][M][F] y^F$.\nLet $S_{L+1}(M, y) = \\sum_{M' \\le M} Poly_{L+1}(M', y)$.\nThe $S_{L+1}(M, y)$ is computed for $M \\in [0, f+1]$.\n$Q_M(y) = (S_{L+1}(M, y))^2 - (S_{L+1}(M-1, y))^2$.\n$Q_M(y)$ is computed for $M \\in [0, f+1]$.\nThis takes $O(f \\cdot F \\log F)$.\nNow compute $dp[L][M_s][F_s]$:\n$dp[L][M_s][F_s] = \\sum_{M=0}^{M_s} \\sum_{d_s=0}^{k-M} \\text{coeff}(y^{F_s - d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\nHere $M_s$ is the new max child $c$ value, which is $M$.\nThe sum over $M$ is from $0$ to $M_s$.\nThe sum over $d_s$ is from $0$ to $k-M$.\nAlso $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le F_s \\le f$. So $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nSo $d_s$ is limited by $\\min(k-M, f/2^{n-L})$.\nThe coefficient of $y^{F_s - d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}}$ in $Q_M(y)$ is needed.\nThe sum over $M$ is $O(f)$.\nThe sum over $d_s$ is $O(f/2^{n-L})$.\nSo $dp[L][M_s][F_s]$ is $O(f \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nTotal $O(f \\cdot F \\cdot f \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nThis is $O(N \\cdot f^4)$.\n$15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^4 \\approx 10^{22}$.\n\nThe trick must be related to the maximum value of $f$ in $dp[L][\\text{max_c_val}][\\text{current_f}]$.\nThe total sum $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum $F$ for $dp[L]$ is $f$.\nThe maximum $M$ for $dp[L]$ is $k$.\nThe $N \\le 15$ is very small.\nThe weights $2^{n-L}$ are powers of 2.\nThis is a variation of polynomial multiplication.\nThe problem is hard.\n\nFinal attempt at DP state:\n$dp[L][\\text{current_f}][\\text{max_c_val}]$\nThis is for a single node $s$ of length $L$.\n`current_f` is the sum of $d_{s'} \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{length}(s')}$ for $s'$ in $s$'s subtree.\n`max_c_val` is $c_s$.\nBase case $L=n$: $dp[n][C][C]=1$ for $C \\in [0, k]$.\nFor $L < n$:\n  Compute $P_{L+1}(C,F)$ values for children.\n  Let $Poly(C,y) = \\sum_F P_{L+1}(C,F) y^F$.\n  Let $S(M,y) = \\sum_{C_0 \\le M} Poly(C_0,y)$.\n  Let $S_M(y)$ be $S(M,y)$.\n  $Q_M(y) = (S_M(y))^2 - (S_{M-1}(y))^2$.

The coefficients are $P_M(y)$.\nThe total degree is $f + k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. This is too big.\nThe sum $F$ cannot exceed $f$. So $F' = F - (C-M)V \\le f$.\nThis means $(C-M)V \\ge F - f$.\nAlso $(C-M)V \\le F$.\nThe number of terms in $Q_M(y)$ is $O(f)$.\nThe number of terms in $P_L(C,F)$ is $O(k \\cdot f)$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{M=0}^C$ requires $O(C)$ terms.\nEach term requires $O(1)$ to get coefficient from $Q_M(y)$.\nSo $P_L(C,F)$ calculation for all $C,F$ is $O(k \\cdot f \\cdot k)$.\n$O(N \\cdot k^2 f)$. This is $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\approx 10^{16}$.\n\nThe problem is probably much simpler.\nThe maximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe values $d_s$ contribute $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}$ to the sum $f$.\nFor $L=1$, $d_s \\cdot 2^{n-1} \\le f$. So $d_s \\le f/2^{n-1}$.\nFor $n=15$, $d_s \\le f/2^{14} \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^5 / 16384 \\approx 12$.\nFor $L=n$, $d_s \\le f$.\nThere are $2^L$ strings of length $L$.\nThe values $c_s$ can be large, but $d_s$ values are small for small $L$.\nThis suggests a DP where the state depends on $L$ and $f$, but not $k$.\nThe $k$ constraint is $c_s \\le k$.\n$c_s = d_s + \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k$.\nThis implies $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k - d_s$.\n\nThis is a DP over $L$ (depth of tree).\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_f}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for *all* $2^L$ strings of length $L$ and their descendants, such that the total sum $f$ is achieved.\nThis is not for a single node.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_f}]$ be a polynomial where coefficient of $x^M$ is the number of ways for a single node $s$ of length $L$ and its descendants, such that the sum is `current_f` and $c_s = M$.\nThis is the $P_L(M, \\text{current_f})$ table.\nThe range of $M$ is $0 \\dots k$.\nThe range of $F$ is $0 \\dots f$.\nThis DP table is $(k+1) \\times (f+1)$.\nThe solution is $O(N \\cdot (\\text{poly mult} + \\text{summing poly terms}))$.\nThe sum of $P_L(C,F)$ over $C$ is what we need.\n$A_L(x) = \\sum_{F=0}^f (\\sum_{C=0}^k P_L(C,F)) x^F$.\nThe final answer is coeff of $x^f$ in $(A_1(x))^2$.\n\nThe $k$ dependency has to be removed.\nThe values $c_s$ can be $0 \\dots k$.\nIf $c_s$ is very large (e.g. $c_s \\ge f$), then $d_s$ is only limited by $f/2^{n-L}$.\nSo $d_s \\le f$.\nThe constraint $d_s \\le k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nIf $k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\ge f$, then $d_s$ can be any value from $0$ to $\\min(f, f/2^{n-L})$.\nIf $k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) < f$, then $d_s$ is limited by $k - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\nThis means we need to distinguish between $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le k-f$ and $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > k-f$.\nLet $K' = k-f$.\nWe need to distinguish $M \\le K'$ and $M > K'$.\nThis means $M$ states are $0 \\dots K'$ and $K'+1 \\dots k$.\nThis is $O(f)$ states for $M$.\nThe number of states for $M$ is $O(f)$ (up to $f$) plus $O(1)$ (for values $>f$).\nThis is $O(f)$ states.\nThe complexity is $O(N \\cdot f^2 \\log f + N \\cdot f^2 \\cdot f) = O(N \\cdot f^3)$.\nThis is the standard approach for this kind of problem. $N \\cdot F^3$ is $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^3 \\approx 10^{17}$.\nThe example $N=6, K=153, F=23699$ gives $0$.\n$N=15, K=200000, F=198756$ gives $612404746$.\nThis implies $N \\cdot F^3$ is not the correct complexity.\n\nThe term $f/2^{n-L}$ is small for small $L$.\n$dp[L][C][F]$ where $C \\in [0, k]$ and $F \\in [0,f]$.\nThe sum $P_L(C,F) = \\sum_{M=0}^C \\sum_{d_s=0}^{\\min(k-M, f/2^{n-L})} \\text{coeff}(y^{F - d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L}}, Q_M(y))$.\nThe inner sum over $d_s$ is $O(f/2^{n-L})$.\nThe outer sum over $M$ is $O(C)$.\nSo $P_L(C,F)$ takes $O(C \\cdot f/2^{n-L})$.\nTotal $O(N \\cdot (K \\cdot F \\log F + K \\cdot F \\cdot K \\cdot f/2^{n-L}))$.\nThe $K \\cdot f/2^{n-L}$ part is $k \\cdot f / 2^{n-L}$.\nThis is $k \\cdot f \\sum_{L=1}^n 1/2^{n-L} = O(k \\cdot f)$.\nSo $O(N \\cdot K \\cdot F \\cdot k \\cdot f) = O(N \\cdot K^2 F f)$.\nThis is the complexity.\n\nThe solution must be $O(N \\cdot F \\log F)$ or $O(N \\cdot F^2)$.\nThe $K$ dependence must be gone.\nThe $c_s$ values are only relevant up to $f$.\nIf $c_s > f$, then $d_s = c_s - \\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$.\n$d_s \\cdot 2^{n-L} \\le f$.\nSo $d_s \\le f/2^{n-L}$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) > f$, then $c_s$ must be $>f$.\nIf $\\max(c_{s0}, c_{s1}) \\le f$, then $c_s$ can be $\\le f$ or $>f$.\nThis means $c_s$ needs to be tracked only up to $f$.\nAnd $P_L(\\text{large}, F)$ for $c_s > f$.\nThe range of $M$ for $Q_M(y)$ is $0 \\dots f$ and one for $M > f$.\nThis means the $K$ in $K \\cdot F \\log F$ becomes $f$.\nThe $K$ in $K \\cdot f \\cdot F$ becomes $f$.\nSo $O(N \\cdot f^2 \\log f + N \\cdot f^3)$. This is $10^{17}$.\nThis is a standard DP technique. There must be something about $N=15$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Modulo for calculations\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[L][C][F] stores the number of ways for a single node s of length L\n    # such that c_s = C and the sum of d_s' * 2^(n-length(s')) for s' in s's subtree is F.\n    # C is capped at f+1.
