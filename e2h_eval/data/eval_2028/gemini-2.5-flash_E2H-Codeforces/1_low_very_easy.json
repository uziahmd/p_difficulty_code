The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this gilded cell problem. Essentially, I need a Python script to determine the total number of cells painted on a rectangular plate, given its dimensions (`w` for width, `h` for height) and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  My understanding is that these rings are nested, each one cell wide, and separated by a non-gilded gap.\n\nThe core of the issue lies in understanding how to calculate the number of cells in each ring.  Each ring essentially forms the border of a smaller, inner rectangle.  The outer ring, `i=1`, is the plate's perimeter. As we move inwards, the `i`-th ring is defined by an inner rectangle of dimensions `(w - 4*(i - 1))` by `(h - 4*(i - 1))`.  The number of cells in this ring is then the perimeter of that inner rectangle, minus the overcounted corners which gives the formula: `2 * ((w - 4*(i - 1)) + (h - 4*(i - 1))) - 4`.\n\nI'll iterate from `i = 1` up to `k`. At each step, I will calculate the number of cells in the current ring using the formula. And then I'll keep a running total of the cells as i increases.\n\nThe constraints are important.  `w` and `h` are between 3 and 100, and `k` is between 1 and `floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This latter constraint on `k` is crucial; it limits how deep the nested rings can go before the inner rectangle has dimensions too small to form a ring. I verified that this constraint, derived from the requirement that the inner rectangle's smallest dimension is at least 1, is correctly defined. I need to be mindful to handle edge cases or input that does not satisfy these constraints.\n\nEffectively, I'll be summing the perimeter of the rectangles generated, being careful to account for the overlapping corner cells. My Python code will implement this logic straightforwardly; I anticipate it should be fairly efficient.\n",
