    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this problem:**\n\nMy core objective is to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, given its dimensions (`w` for width, `h` for height), and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  Each ring is a border drawn on an inner rectangle.\n\nThe initial approach is to break down the rings' structure. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring are `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. This seems straightforward.  Now, the key here is the formula for the number of cells in the perimeter of a rectangle, which is `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` - that's valid for rectangles with sides greater or equal to 2.\n\nWe need to make sure we consider the edge cases, rectangles of small dimensions, as the formula is not valid for `1x1` or when either side is 1. We redefine the perimeter formula to account for the smallest possibilities. However, the problem statement provides a crucial constraint: `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`.  This constraint means the smallest dimension of each ring will always be large enough, so the general perimeter formula is valid.\n\nI am re-evaluating the perimeters to make sure I am accounting for border cells. I then carefully re-read the problem statement to ensure my understanding of rings is correct. The problem's \"k\" constraint is the key that avoids having to deal with simpler rings.\n\nThe total number of gilded cells is the sum of the perimeters of these `k` rings. Iterating through each ring and calculating the perimeter of its corresponding rectangle is the plan, decreasing the inner rectangle's dimensions by 4 for each new ring.\n\nSince the constraint ensures the inner rectangles never become too small, the perimeter calculation is now straightforward:  for each ring, the calculation is just `2 * w_i + 2 * h_i - 4`, with w_i and h_i being the dimensions of the i-th ring's rectangle.\n\nThe final code is a loop that runs `k` times. In each iteration, it updates current dimensions (reduces by 4) and adds perimeter of a ring to the total count. I add plenty of comments to make sure anyone reading it understands what is going on. I do several test cases and examples to make sure the code works, and finally I confirm it works for the given examples. The python code is written in a simple and readable manner to make sure it will be easy to understand.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width/columns) and `h` (height/rows). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nAccording to the formal definition, the `i`-th ring (1-indexed) consists of all bordering cells on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the rectangle for the `i`-th ring as `W_i` and `H_i`:\n`W_i = w - 4(i - 1)`\n`H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`\n\nThe number of cells forming the border of a `W x H` rectangle depends on `W` and `H`.\n- If `W <= 0` or `H <= 0`, there are 0 cells.\n- If `W = 1` and `H = 1`, there is 1 cell.\n- If `W = 1` and `H > 1`, there are `H` cells.\n- If `W > 1` and `H = 1`, there are `W` cells.\n- If `W > 1` and `H > 1`, the number of border cells is `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`.\n\nHowever, we need to carefully examine the constraints given for `w`, `h`, and `k`:\n`3 <= w, h <= 100`\n`1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`\n\nLet `M = min(w, h)`. The constraint on `k` is `k <= floor((M + 1) / 4)`.\nThis implies `4 * k <= M + 1`.\nFrom this, we can derive `4 * k - 4 <= M - 3`, which simplifies to `4 * (k - 1) <= M - 3`.\nRearranging, we get `M - 4 * (k - 1) >= 3`.\n\nThe dimensions of the `i`-th ring are `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`.\nThe minimum dimension for any ring `i` (where `1 <= i <= k`) will be `min(W_i, H_i) = min(w, h) - 4(i - 1) = M - 4(i - 1)`.\nThis value is smallest when `i` is largest, i.e., when `i = k`.\nFor `i = k`, the minimum dimension is `M - 4(k - 1)`. As shown above, `M - 4(k - 1) >= 3`.\nThis means that for all rings from `i=1` to `i=k`, both `W_i` and `H_i` will always be at least 3.\n\nSince `W_i >= 3` and `H_i >= 3` for all rings, we can consistently use the formula `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` to calculate the number of cells for each ring. This simplifies the problem significantly, as we don't need to handle special cases for small dimensions.\n\nThe total number of gilded cells will be the sum of cells in each of the `k` rings. We can iterate `k` times, calculate the perimeter for the current dimensions, add it to a running total, and then reduce the dimensions by 4 for the next inner ring.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `w`, `h`, and `k` from the input.\n2. Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n3. Initialize `current_w = w` and `current_h = h`. These will represent the dimensions of the rectangle for the current ring.\n4. Loop `k` times:\n   a. Calculate the cells for the current ring: `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n   b. Add this to the total: `total_gilded_cells += cells_in_current_ring`.\n   c. Update dimensions for the next inner ring: `current_w -= 4` and `current_h -= 4`.\n5. Print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (7 9 2):**\n- `w = 7`, `h = 9`, `k = 2`\n- `total_gilded_cells = 0`\n- `current_w = 7`, `current_h = 9`\n\n**Iteration 1 (for i=1):**\n- `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n- `total_gilded_cells = 0 + 28 = 28`\n- `current_w = 7 - 4 = 3`\n- `current_h = 9 - 4 = 5`\n\n**Iteration 2 (for i=2):**\n- `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n- `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n- `current_w = 3 - 4 = -1`\n- `current_h = 5 - 4 = 1`\n\nLoop finishes. Print `40`. This matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input line and parse w, h, k\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    w = int(line[0])\n    h = int(line[1])\n    k = int(line[2])\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n    \n    # Initialize current dimensions for the first ring (i=1)\n    current_w = w\n    current_h = h\n    \n    # Iterate k times, once for each ring\n    for _ in range(k):\n        # As per the problem constraints, for any valid k,\n        # current_w and current_h will always be at least 3.\n        # This means we can always use the formula 2 * W + 2 * H - 4\n        # to calculate the number of border cells for a WxH rectangle.\n        \n        cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        total_gilded_cells += cells_in_current_ring\n        \n        # For the next inner ring, the dimensions shrink by 4 (2 from each side).\n        current_w -= 4\n        current_h -= 4\n        \n    # Print the final calculated total\n    print(total_gilded_cells)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the logic\nsolve()\n\n```",
