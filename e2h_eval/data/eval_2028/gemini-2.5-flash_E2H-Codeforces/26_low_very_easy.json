    "thought": "**Thinking Through Triangle Counting**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how many non-degenerate triangles I can make with integer sides, given some specific constraints on those sides.  I've got three side lengths, *x*, *y*, and *z*, and they need to fall within certain ranges:  *A* to *B* for *x*, *B* to *C* for *y*, and *C* to *D* for *z*.  Crucially,  *x* must be less than or equal to *B*, which in turn is less than or equal to *y*, which in turn is less than or equal to *C*, and finally which is less than or equal to *z* (and *z* needs to be less than or equal to *D*).\n\nThe usual triangle inequality rules apply, of course, but after considering the constraints, I realize that given the implied ordering (*x* <= *y* <= *z*), I only really need to worry about one inequality: *x* + *y* > *z*. The other two inequalities (*x* + *z* > *y* and *y* + *z* > *x*) are automatically satisfied because of the constraints.\n\nMy initial thought was to use a triple nested loop, but that would be way too slow.  The time complexity would be something like *O(D<sup>3</sup>)*, which is impractical given the maximum value of *D* is *5 * 10<sup>5</sup>*.  That's a lot of calculations.\n\nSo, I need to optimize.  The idea is to iterate over *x* and *y* and then efficiently count the valid *z* values for each pair (*x*, *y*).  The range for *x* is *A* to *B* and the range for *y* is *B* to *C*.\n\nGiven *x* and *y*, *z* has to be within the range *C* to *D*.  I also know that *z* must be strictly less than *x* + *y*.  So, the possible values for *z* are the integers from *C* up to, but not including, *x* + *y*, which must also be less than or equal to *D*. In other words, *z* must be between *C* and the minimum of *D* and *x* + *y* - 1.\n\nThe number of valid *z* values for a given *x* and *y* would be `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nNow I need to sum this for all possible pairs of *x* and *y*. I have:\n`Total = sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`\n\nEven though this is better than triple nested loops, the nested sum seems to be *O(D<sup>2</sup>)*, which is still too slow. This means I haven't quite cracked the performance challenge yet. I need to rethink this approach to get something faster than *O(D^2)*.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x, y, z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle with sides `x, y, z`:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x, y, z` are positive integers (since `A >= 1`).\nAlso, from `B <= y` and `C <= z`, we have `x <= y <= z` (or at least `x <= y` and `y <= z` are generally true).\nLet's verify the triangle inequalities:\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= B >= A` and `z >= C >= A`, and `x <= B`, `y + z >= B + C`. Since `C >= B` and `B >= x`, `B + C >= B + B >= B + x` (if `B>=x` and `C>=B`). More simply, `y >= x` and `z >= C >= 1`, so `y + z > y >= x`. This inequality always holds.\n- `x + z > y`: Since `x >= A >= 1` and `z >= C`, `x + z >= A + C`. Since `y <= C`, `x + z >= A + C > C >= y`. This inequality also always holds.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (which means `z <= x + y - 1`)\n\nCombining the constraints on `z`, for fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n`C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`\n\nLet `max_z_val = min(D, x + y - 1)`. The number of valid `z` values for a given `x, y` is `max(0, max_z_val - C + 1)`.\n\nA direct iteration over `x` and `y` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`, which can be up to `O(D^2)`. Given `D <= 5 * 10^5`, `D^2` is too slow. We need a faster approach.\n\nLet's iterate over `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, we need to sum up the counts for `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `k = x + y - 1`. The condition is `z <= k`.\nThe term `min(D, k)` can be split into two cases:\nCase 1: `k <= D`. Then `min(D, k) = k`. The count is `max(0, k - C + 1) = max(0, x + y - 1 - C + 1) = max(0, x + y - C)`.\nCase 2: `k > D`. Then `min(D, k) = D`. The count is `max(0, D - C + 1)`.\n\nNotice that `x + y - C` is an increasing function of `y`.\nThe value `x + y - C` becomes positive when `y > C - x`.\nSo, for a fixed `x`, we are summing `max(0, x + y - C)` for `y` such that `B <= y <= C` and `x + y - 1 <= D`.\nAnd `D - C + 1` for `y` such that `B <= y <= C` and `x + y - 1 > D`.\n\nLet's rewrite `x + y - C` as `y - (C - x)`.\nThe sum for a fixed `x` is `sum_{y=B to C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `y_min = B` and `y_max = C`.\nThe term `x + y - 1` increases with `y`.\nLet `y_limit_D = D - x + 1`. This is the maximum `y` such that `x + y - 1 <= D`.\nLet `y_limit_C = C - x`. This is the maximum `y` such that `x + y - C <= 0`. For `y > y_limit_C`, `x + y - C` is positive.\n\nFor a fixed `x`, we iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe contributions can be categorized based on `x + y - 1` vs `D` and `x + y - C` vs `0`.\nLet `y_start = B`.\nLet `y_end = C`.\n\nThe maximum possible sum `x+y` is `B+C`, minimum is `A+B`.\nThe range `[A, B]` for `x` and `[B, C]` for `y` means `x+y` ranges from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nThe maximum value `x+y-1` can take is `B+C-1`.\nThe maximum `z` is `D`.\n\nThe total number of triangles is `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} (count_z(x, y))`.\nLet `S = x + y`.\nThe condition `z <= S - 1` means `z` must be in `[C, min(D, S - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` for a given `x, y` is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nWe can iterate `S` (the sum `x+y`) instead of `x` and `y` separately.\nThe minimum value for `S = x + y` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum value for `S = x + y` is `B + C`.\nSo `S` ranges from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nFor each `S` in this range, we need to find how many pairs `(x, y)` exist such that `x+y=S` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\nOnce we have this count for each `S`, say `count_xy[S]`, we multiply it by `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet's precompute `count_xy[S]` for `S` from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nFor a fixed `S`, `x+y=S`.\n`A <= x <= B`\n`B <= y <= C`\nSubstitute `y = S - x`:\n`B <= S - x <= C`\n`S - C <= x <= S - B`\n\nSo `x` must satisfy `max(A, S - C) <= x <= min(B, S - B)`.\nThe number of such `x` values is `max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\nThis calculation for `count_xy[S]` takes `O(1)` for each `S`.\nThe range of `S` is `(B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1`. This is `O(D)`.\nSo precomputing `count_xy` array takes `O(D)` time.\n\nAfter computing `count_xy[S]` for all relevant `S`:\n`total_triangles = sum_{S=A+B to B+C} count_xy[S] * max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`\n\nThis sum also takes `O(D)` time.\nThe overall complexity is `O(D)`. This is efficient enough for `D = 5 * 10^5`.\n\nLet's trace the calculation for an example: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`.\n`x` in `[1, 2]`, `y` in `[2, 3]`, `z` in `[3, 4]`.\n`S = x + y`.\nMin `S = A+B = 1+2 = 3`. Max `S = B+C = 2+3 = 5`.\nSo `S` ranges from `3` to `5`.\n\nFor each `S`, calculate `count_xy[S]`: `max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`\n- `S = 3`:\n  `x` must be in `[max(1, 3-3), min(2, 3-2)] = [max(1, 0), min(2, 1)] = [1, 1]`.\n  `x = 1`. `y = S - x = 3 - 1 = 2`. Pair `(1, 2)`.\n  `count_xy[3] = 1`.\n- `S = 4`:\n  `x` must be in `[max(1, 4-3), min(2, 4-2)] = [max(1, 1), min(2, 2)] = [1, 2]`.\n  `x = 1, 2`. If `x=1, y=3`. Pair `(1, 3)`. If `x=2, y=2`. Pair `(2, 2)`.\n  `count_xy[4] = 2`.\n- `S = 5`:\n  `x` must be in `[max(1, 5-3), min(2, 5-2)] = [max(1, 2), min(2, 3)] = [2, 2]`.\n  `x = 2`. `y = S - x = 5 - 2 = 3`. Pair `(2, 3)`.\n  `count_xy[5] = 1`.\n\nNow calculate `total_triangles`:\n`term_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`\n- `S = 3`: `count_xy[3] = 1`.\n  `term_z(3) = max(0, min(4, 3 - 1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 2) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n  Contribution: `1 * 0 = 0`.\n  (For `(1,2)`, `z` must be in `[3, min(4, 1+2-1)] = [3, min(4,2)] = [3,2]`, empty range).\n- `S = 4`: `count_xy[4] = 2`.\n  `term_z(4) = max(0, min(4, 4 - 1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 3) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n  Contribution: `2 * 1 = 2`.\n  (For `(1,3)` and `(2,2)`, `z` must be in `[3, min(4, 1+3-1)] = [3, min(4,3)] = [3,3]`. So `z=3`. Pairs: `(1,3,3), (2,2,3)`).\n- `S = 5`: `count_xy[5] = 1`.\n  `term_z(5) = max(0, min(4, 5 - 1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 4) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 4 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2) = 2`.\n  Contribution: `1 * 2 = 2`.\n  (For `(2,3)`, `z` must be in `[3, min(4, 2+3-1)] = [3, min(4,4)] = [3,4]`. So `z=3, 4`. Pairs: `(2,3,3), (2,3,4)`).\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nThe maximum value for `S` is `B+C`, which can be up to `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\nSo the `count_xy` array needs to be of size `10^6 + 1`. This is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Max possible sum S = x + y is B + C.\n    # Min possible sum S = x + y is A + B.\n    # The array `count_xy` will store the number of pairs (x, y) such that x+y = S\n    # and A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C.\n    # Max S is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6.\n    max_S = B + C\n    count_xy = [0] * (max_S + 1)\n\n    # Iterate over x from A to B\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        # For each x, y must be in [B, C]\n        # x + y = S => y = S - x\n        # B <= S - x <= C\n        # S - C <= x <= S - B\n        # This means for a fixed x, y ranges from B to C.\n        # The sum S = x + y will range from x + B to x + C.\n        # For each S in [x+B, x+C], we increment count_xy[S].\n        # This is equivalent to adding 1 to a range.
