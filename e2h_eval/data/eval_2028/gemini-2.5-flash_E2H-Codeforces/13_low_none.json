For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing and Classifying Musical Triads**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a really interesting problem. I need to take a set of three musical notes (a \"triad\"), and determine whether it's a major triad, a minor triad, or something else entirely. The key here is to take the user's input of note strings and then categorize that triad.\n\nFirst, the notes need to be translated into something I can work with easily - numbers! I'll create a simple mapping, something like a dictionary, that translates each note (C, C#, D, etc.) into its corresponding position on the chromatic scale (0, 1, 2, etc.).\n\nNext, I need to take the input and convert those note strings into their numerical equivalents. Now, the magic happens. I need to calculate the *distances* (in semitones) between the notes. Since a triad is an *unordered* set, I need to consider all possible arrangements. However, a simpler way to do this is to sort the numerical values first. Let's call them *n_a, n_b, n_c*.\n\nThe distance between notes is where the music theory comes in - it's the difference between the numerical values, taken modulo 12 (because the scale is cyclic). If I sort the notes so that *s1 <= s2 <= s3*, then I can calculate the distances between all pairs within the triad. I'm focusing on the interval distances between the sorted notes.\n\nFinally, I can use the knowledge of major and minor triad structures. A major triad should have intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (or 7 overall), and a minor triad will have 3 and 4 semitones (or 7 overall). With the distances calculated, it's a straightforward comparison! If it matches the major or minor pattern, I can confidently classify the triad; otherwise, it's considered \"strange\". I know the problem states the answer will be unambiguous (not both major and minor), which is helpful.\n",
