    "thought": "**Calculating Gilded Cells on a Rectangular Plate**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem involves a rectangular plate that we need to \"gild\" with gold cells. We're given the plate's width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`) that need gilding.  Each ring is a one-cell-wide border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the outer edge, the second is two cells in, and so on.\n\nMy main goal is to efficiently calculate the total number of cells to gild. I'll need to compute the number of cells per ring and then sum them up.\n\nThe key observation is how each ring's dimensions change. The `i`-th ring encloses an inner rectangle that is smaller than the plate by a factor of `4` in each dimension (twice the `i-1` value, i.e., `w - 4(i-1)` and `h - 4(i-1)`). This inner rectangle's border gives the number of gilded cells for this ring, i.e., `2W + 2H - 4` where `W` and `H` are the current ring's inner rectangle's width and height.\n\nI need to make sure the rings are valid. This means the formula used for each ring's width and height will remain larger than or equal to 1.  The problem states that `k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)`.  I can see that this constraint, while seemingly slightly more restrictive than what I originally came up with, ensures that the innermost rectangle is at least 3x3. The code will handle this easily, though, as long as it does not try to process an invalid ring.\n\nSo the overall approach will be to iterate from 1 to `k` (the ring number). For each ring, determine its dimensions using the formula and calculate the border cells using `2W + 2H - 4`. The constraint on `k` ensures that each calculation is well-defined. I'll accumulate the number of gilded cells per ring and get the final answer. The edge case of very small values like `w=3`, `h=3`, `k=1` is handled correctly by the code.\n\nGiven the constraints, I can calculate `total_gilded_cells` directly. I will use a for-loop for the calculations. The output will simply be an integer, which is the total amount of cells. I can now start to implement my Python solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the `i`-th ring consists of all bordering cells on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's analyze the dimensions for a given ring `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`):\n1.  **Dimensions of the rectangle for the `i`-th ring**:\n    Let `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)`\n    Let `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`\n    These `W_i` and `H_i` represent the effective width and height of the rectangle whose border forms the `i`-th ring.\n\n2.  **Number of cells in a 1-cell wide border**:\n    For any rectangle of dimensions `W x H`, the number of cells forming its 1-cell wide border is given by the perimeter formula, adjusted for corners being counted twice: `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`.\n\n3.  **Total gilded cells**:\n    The problem states that the rings are distinct and non-overlapping. The first ring is on the `w x h` rectangle, the second on `(w-4) x (h-4)`, and so on. The `(w-4) x (h-4)` rectangle is strictly inside the `w x h` rectangle, and its border is 2 cells away from the `w x h` border. This means we can simply sum the number of cells for each ring.\n\nThe `k` constraint, `1 <= k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)`, guarantees that the dimensions `W_i` and `H_i` for any ring `i` will always be at least 3. This ensures that the formula `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` is always applied to valid rectangles with a meaningful border and yields a positive number of cells.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` from standard input.\n2.  Initialize a variable `total_gilded_cells` to 0.\n3.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `k-1` (this corresponds to rings 1 through `k`):\n    a.  Calculate the current width for this ring: `current_w = w - 4 * i`.\n    b.  Calculate the current height for this ring: `current_h = h - 4 * i`.\n    c.  Calculate the number of gilded cells for this specific ring: `ring_cells = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n    d.  Add `ring_cells` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n4.  Print the final `total_gilded_cells`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (w=7, h=9, k=2):**\n*   Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n*   **Loop `i = 0` (for the 1st ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * 0 = 9`\n    *   `ring_cells = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 0 + 28 = 28`\n*   **Loop `i = 1` (for the 2nd ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * 1 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * 1 = 5`\n    *   `ring_cells = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n*   Loop finishes.
