Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Detecting 'X' Shape in a Grid**\n\nAlright, I need to create a Python script to determine if a given `n x n` grid of characters forms an 'X' shape based on specific criteria.  The rules are straightforward: all characters on both main diagonals must be the same (let's call that `diag_char`), and all other characters must also be the same (let's call that `other_char`).  Crucially, `diag_char` and `other_char` *must* be different, and `n` is always odd, with a value between 3 and 299 inclusive.\n\nI'm thinking I'll represent the grid as a list of strings (or a list of lists of characters). First, I need to read the value of `n` from standard input. Then, I'll read the grid itself, line by line. I'll initialize a few variables: `diag_char`, `other_char`, and a boolean flag `is_valid` set to `True` initially.\n\nThe core of the algorithm will involve nested loops to iterate through each cell of the grid.  Within the loop, for each cell at `(r, c)`, I'll check if it's on either diagonal (`r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`). If it is, and `diag_char` isn't set yet, I'll assign the current character to `diag_char`. If `diag_char` is already set, I'll compare the current character with the existing `diag_char`.  If they differ, `is_valid` becomes `False`, and I'll break out of the inner loop (and potentially the outer loop as well).\n\nIf a cell is *not* on a diagonal, and `other_char` isn't set, I'll assign the current character to `other_char`. If `other_char` *is* set, I'll compare the current character with the existing `other_char`. If they differ, again, `is_valid` becomes `False`, and I'll break out of the loops.\n\nAfter completing the grid traversal, I'll do one final check: if `diag_char` and `other_char` are equal, `is_valid` is set to `False`. Finally, I'll print \"YES\" if `is_valid` is still `True`, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nI need to make sure I'm handling the edge cases correctly. Since `n` is guaranteed to be odd and greater than or equal to 3, I should always have both diagonal and non-diagonal characters to work with.\n\nI should also make sure to break out of the inner and outer loops once an invalid condition is found. The goal is efficiency. I might also add some comments to the code, so it is easier to read and understand.\n",
