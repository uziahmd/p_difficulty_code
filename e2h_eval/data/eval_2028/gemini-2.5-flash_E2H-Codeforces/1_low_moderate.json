The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The input parameters are the plate's width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`) that need to be gilded. Each ring forms a border around an inner rectangle.\n\nHere's my thought process. The `i`-th ring is a border around a rectangle with dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. This inner rectangle shrinks with each ring. So, I have to iterate through each of the `k` rings and figure out the number of cells for each ring and then sum them up.\n\nThe key is in determining the number of cells in a single ring, based on the inner rectangle's dimensions.  I know that for a rectangle with dimensions W x H, a formula is 2W + 2H - 4, if W and H are greater than or equal to 2.  However, this doesn't work if either W or H are 1. In these cases, it's just the longer of the dimension.  So, I need to adjust the formula for cases where either the width or height of the inner rectangle is less than 2.  I need to handle these edge cases to ensure accuracy. I'll need a way to encapsulate this calculation into a function to be called within a loop that'll sum up the cells in each of the `k` rings.\n",
