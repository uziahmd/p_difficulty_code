Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Amusing Joke Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is figuring out if the pile of letters is an exact match for the combined names of the guest and host, allowing for shuffling. My initial thought process is to sort the letters. If the letters in the `pile_letters` sorted are the same as the `guest_name` + `host_name` sorted, then the answer is \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThe problem constraints are manageable: each line has a maximum length of 100 characters. So, sorting strings with a maximum length of 200 (combined guest and host names) won't be an issue regarding performance.\n\nFirst, I'll take three input lines, guest name, host name, and pile letters. I'll concatenate the guest and host names into a new string to work with.\n\nThen I'll sort the concatenated guest + host name, and sort the pile letters and compare the results. The comparison itself is simple, just check if the sorted lists are equal.  If they are, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\". This `sorted()` method is very efficient for checking anagrams, and perfect for this problem.\n\nI've carefully considered various edge cases, including single-character and all-same-character names to make sure the program is robust. An alternative could be to use a `collections.Counter` but sorting is more efficient and simpler. The script will be straightforward, reading from standard input, processing the strings, and printing the appropriate answer to standard output. Seems good to me.\n",
