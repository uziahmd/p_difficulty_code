For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The core of this problem lies in understanding the constraints imposed by the \"beautiful multiset\" definition and how these constraints affect the maximum size of such a multiset.** I recognize that we're given *n*, *k*, and *f*, and our goal is to compute an answer modulo 998244353. The problem involves binary strings and the relationships between prefixes and suffixes. We need to find the number of ways to choose coefficients *c<sub>s</sub>* for these strings, such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly *f*.\n\nTo simplify the problem, I'm thinking of how to model the binary strings as nodes in a binary tree or, more appropriately, a trie. The length of a string corresponds to the depth of a node in this tree. The value *c<sub>s</sub>* acts as a constraint, limiting the number of strings that can have *s* as a prefix. This *c<sub>s</sub>* value becomes central to determining the maximum size of any multiset under these conditions.\n\nI'm starting to build a recursive solution. Let `M(s)` represent the maximum size of a beautiful multiset limited to strings that have *s* as a prefix. If we have a string of length *n*, `M(s)` is simply equal to *c<sub>s</sub>* (the constraint on that string). For shorter prefixes, the maximum size is a trade-off between the constraints of the current prefix and those of its children. In other words, `M(s) = min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))`, where *s0* and *s1* are the two possible extensions of the prefix *s* (appending \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nThis recursive definition is crucial and leads me towards a dynamic programming approach. I define a `dp` table. `dp[d][val]` represents the number of ways to assign `c_s` values for all strings *s* of length up to *n*, such that *s* has length *d*, and the maximum size of strings rooted at any one particular node of length *d* equals `val`. Initially, `dp[n][val]` is set to 1 for `0 <= val <= k` (since any `c_s` from 0 to *k* is valid for strings of length *n*).\n\nTo move up the trie, I need to calculate `dp[d][val]` from `dp[d+1][...]`. To do this, I have to consider the maximum sizes of the subtrees corresponding to the children of nodes at depth *d*. Specifically, I compute `max_size(0) + max_size(1)`, and then use that information to correctly choose the corresponding `c_s` value. The critical point is to choose *c<sub>s</sub>* such that `min(c_s, val0 + val1) = val`, where `val0` and `val1` are the maximum subtree sizes of the children. This recursive approach seems sound.\n\nTo make the algorithm more efficient, I realize that I can compute the convolution of the previous depth level to compute the `dp` state for a single node at the current level. I think of using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) to accelerate convolution operations. NTT allows us to perform multiplication of polynomials in `O(n log n)` time, allowing us to compute all convolutions required to update my dynamic programming table. This approach will allow us to handle the relatively large values of *k* within the given time constraints, *O(n*k log k)*. The logic of the NTT part seems sound. I must take into account that the final number of ways to pick the `c_s` for the strings such that the global maximum size is *f* corresponds to a convolution of two `dp[1]` results, so the answer corresponds to `S_0[f]` where `S_0` is the convolution. I consider edge cases such as what to do when *f* is larger than allowed. Overall, the logic is sound.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ (from $0$ to $k$) for every binary string $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length exactly $n$ is exactly $f$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of $c_s$ values.\nA multiset is beautiful if for every string $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\nLet $x_S$ be the count of string $S$ (of length $n$) in the multiset. We want to maximize $\\sum_{S: \\text{len}(S)=n} x_S$.\nLet $count(s)$ be the sum of $x_S$ for all $S$ such that $s$ is a prefix of $S$.\nThe condition is $count(s) \\le c_s$.\nIf $s$ is a string of length $L < n$, then $count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1)$.\nIf $s$ is a string of length $n$, then $count(s) = x_s$.\nTo maximize the total sum, we should try to make each $count(s)$ as large as possible without violating its constraint.\nSo, for a string $s$ of length $L < n$, the maximum value $count(s)$ can take is $\\min(c_s, \\text{max_count}(s0) + \\text{max_count}(s1))$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, the maximum value $count(s)$ can take is $c_s$.\nCrucially, since $count(s) \\le c_s$, and $c_s \\le k$, it means that $\\text{max_count}(s) \\le k$ for any string $s$. This significantly limits the range of values we need to consider.\n\nLet $dp[d][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ values for all strings $t$ that are descendants of some string $s$ of length $d$ (including $s$ itself if $len(s) \\le n$), such that $\\text{max_count}(s)$ (as defined above) is $val$.\nSince the structure of all subtrees rooted at the same depth $d$ is identical, this $dp$ array is valid for any string $s$ of length $d$.\n\nWe can compute $dp[d]$ values iteratively, starting from $d=n$ down to $d=1$.\n\nBase case: $d=n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $\\text{max_count}(s) = c_s$. Since $c_s$ can be any integer from $0$ to $k$, there is 1 way to choose $c_s$ for each possible value $val$ from $0$ to $k$.\nSo, $dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nRecursive step: For $d < n$.\nWe want to compute $dp[d][val]$.\n$\\text{max_count}(s) = \\min(c_s, \\text{max_count}(s0) + \\text{max_count}(s1))$.\nLet $\\text{max_count}(s0) = val0$ and $\\text{max_count}(s1) = val1$. The choices for $c_t$ in the subtree of $s0$ are independent of those in the subtree of $s1$. So, there are $dp[d+1][val0] \\cdot dp[d+1][val1]$ ways to achieve these $val0, val1$.\nNow we need to choose $c_s$ (from $0$ to $k$) such that $\\min(c_s, val0 + val1) = val$.\n1. If $val < val0 + val1$: This implies $c_s = val$. There is $1$ way to choose $c_s$, provided $val \\le k$.\n2. If $val = val0 + val1$: This implies $c_s \\ge val$. There are $k - val + 1$ ways to choose $c_s$, provided $val \\le k$.\n3. If $val > val0 + val1$: This is impossible, as $\\min(c_s, val0 + val1)$ cannot exceed $val0 + val1$.\n\nLet $S_d[V] = \\sum_{val0=0}^k \\sum_{val1=0}^k \\left( dp[d+1][val0] \\cdot dp[d+1][val1] \\text{ such that } val0+val1 = V \\right)$.\nThis $S_d$ array is the convolution of $dp[d+1]$ with itself. It can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). The maximum possible sum $V$ is $2k$.\nLet $SuffixSum_d[V] = \\sum_{j=V}^{2k} S_d[j]$. This can be computed in $O(k)$ time from $S_d$.\n\nThen, $dp[d][val]$ can be expressed as:\n$dp[d][val] = \\left( S_d[val] \\cdot (k - val + 1) \\right) + SuffixSum_d[val+1]$\n(The term $SuffixSum_d[val+1]$ covers all cases where $val0+val1 > val$, and for each such case, $c_s$ must be $val$, so there's $1$ way to choose $c_s$).\nAll calculations are modulo $998244353$.\n\nThe final answer:\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $\\text{max_count}(0) + \\text{max_count}(1)$.\nThe choices for $c_s$ in the subtree of $0$ are independent of those in the subtree of $1$.\nSo, the number of ways to have $\\text{max_count}(0) = val0$ and $\\text{max_count}(1) = val1$ is $dp[1][val0] \\cdot dp[1][val1]$.\nWe need the sum $val0 + val1$ to be exactly $f$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\sum_{val0=0}^k \\sum_{val1=0}^k \\left( dp[1][val0] \\cdot dp[1][val1] \\text{ such that } val0+val1 = f \\right)$.\nThis is exactly $S_0[f]$ (the convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself, evaluated at index $f$).\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize `current_dp = [1] * (k + 1)` (representing $dp[n]$).\n2. For $d$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n   a. Compute `S_d = multiply_poly(current_dp, current_dp)` using NTT. This stores the convolution of $dp[d+1]$ with itself. The length of `S_d` can be up to $2k+1$.\n   b. Compute `SuffixSum_d` array from `S_d`. `SuffixSum_d[V] = (SuffixSum_d[V+1] + S_d[V]) % MOD`.\n   c. Create `next_dp = [0] * (k + 1)`. For each `val` from $0$ to $k$:\n      `next_dp[val] = (S_d[val] * (k - val + 1)) % MOD`\n      If `val + 1 <= 2k`, add `SuffixSum_d[val+1]` to `next_dp[val]`.\n   d. Set `current_dp = next_dp`.\n3. After the loop, `current_dp` holds $dp[1]$.\n4. Compute `final_convolution = multiply_poly(current_dp, current_dp)` using NTT.\n5. The answer is `final_convolution[f]` if `f` is a valid index, otherwise $0$.\n\nComplexity:\n- `n` iterations for the DP loop.\n- Each iteration involves one NTT-based polynomial multiplication (convolution), which takes $O(K \\log K)$ time, where $K$ is the smallest power of 2 greater than $2k$.\n- Suffix sum computation and `next_dp` calculation take $O(k)$ time.\n- Total time complexity: $O(n \\cdot k \\log k)$.\n- Space complexity: $O(k)$ for storing DP arrays and NTT temporary arrays.\nGiven $n \\le 15, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^5$. The smallest power of 2 greater than $4 \\cdot 10^5$ is $2^{19} = 524288$.
