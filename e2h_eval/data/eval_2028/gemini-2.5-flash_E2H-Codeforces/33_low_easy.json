You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem with a Greedy Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The core idea here is to maximize a number, `a`, by strategically swapping its digits with digits from a sequence, `s`.  We're looking at competitive programming, so efficiency is key, and the constraints (lengths up to 10^5) are a good indicator that we need a reasonably optimized solution.\n\nMy initial thought is to make `a` as large as possible.  I know that the most significant digits contribute the most to the magnitude of the number, so a greedy approach seems promising.  I figure, let's start with the leftmost digits of `a` and replace them with the largest available digits from `s`, if that replacement actually results in an increase.\n\nThe constraints also give a hint. We don't have to worry about leading zeros after replacements, since the original input `a` doesn't have leading zeros and we'll only replace existing digits.\n\nHere's how I envision it:\n\n1.  I'll sort the digits in `s` in descending order. This gives me a ready-made list of the largest digits available for replacements.\n2.  I'll iterate through `a` from left to right (most significant digit to least).\n3.  For each digit in `a`, I'll compare it to the largest unused digit in `s`.\n4.  If the digit from `s` is *larger*, I'll make the swap.  This will definitely increase the value of `a`. I'll also update my pointer for `s` to point to the *next* largest unused digit.\n5.  If the digit from `s` is not larger (or if I've run out of digits in `s`), I'll move on to the next digit in `a`. Since we've sorted `s` in descending order, we *know* we've made the best possible replacement, or that no replacement improves the digit.\n\nEssentially, I am iterating through each position of `a` and comparing it with the largest available digit of `s`. If the digit from `s` is greater, it replaces the `a` digit. This ensures the output is optimal, using a greedy method.\n\nThis should be a pretty straightforward Python script. I'll need to handle the input, do the sorting, and then iterate through the strings while managing the pointer for the `s` string, but the core logic should be efficient and easily implementable.\n",
