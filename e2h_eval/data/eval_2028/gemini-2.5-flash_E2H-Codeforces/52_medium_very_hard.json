Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**New Year Candle Problem Summary**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got in mind for this \"New Year Candles\" problem. The core of it is a simulation. We've got Vasily starting with 'a' candles, each burning for an hour. Then, when a candle burns out, we can craft 'b' of those burnt-out candles into a new candle. The aim? Maximize the total hours of light.\n\nI can walk through a couple of examples to nail this down. If we have 4 candles and can craft a new one from every 2 old ones, it plays out like this: we light the 4 candles (4 hours), use those up, make 2 new ones, light those (2 hours, total 6), and then make 1 more. That's another hour for a grand total of 7. Another example is also given: Vasily has 6 candles and b=3. The total hours of the lights is 8.\n\nThe actual algorithm is pretty straightforward. Keep track of: `total_hours`, `new_candles` (initially 'a'), and `burned_out_candles` (initially 0). The main loop runs as long as there are `new_candles`. Inside, light up all current `new_candles`, add this time to `total_hours`, count them as burnt out, and figure out how many new candles we can craft from those burnt-out ones. Then just update the number of new and burnt candles and repeat. I verified it runs through a couple of examples correctly. It also handles the edge cases as well.\n\nThe input part is a little tricky, but I think the best approach is to treat each test case as a single line, even though the sample output format is a little confusing.\n\nSo it comes down to a loop: read 'a' and 'b', process them in the inner loop, then print the result. The algorithm seems pretty efficient. This will handle those values where a is up to 1000 and b is up to 1000.  The main complexity is probably going to be the simulation step where the hours and burn process are updated. I'm feeling confident about this solution now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of hours Vasily can illuminate his room given an initial number of new candles (`a`) and the number of burned-out candles (`b`) required to craft a new one. Each candle burns for one hour.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a simulation approach. We keep track of two main quantities:\n1.  `total_hours`: The cumulative number of hours the room has been lit.\n2.  `new_candles`: The number of unlit candles Vasily currently possesses.\n3.  `burned_out_candles`: The number of candles that have already burned out.\n\nThe process unfolds in a loop:\n\n1.  **Light Candles:** Vasily lights all available `new_candles`. Each of these candles contributes one hour to the `total_hours`. After burning, these candles become `burned_out_candles`.\n2.  **Craft New Candles:** Vasily then takes his collection of `burned_out_candles` and crafts as many new candles as possible. For every `b` `burned_out_candles`, he gets one `new_candle`. Any remaining `burned_out_candles` (less than `b`) are kept for future crafting.\n\nThis loop continues as long as Vasily has `new_candles` to light. When he runs out of `new_candles` and cannot craft any more, the process stops.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (a=4, b=2):**\n\n*   **Initial:** `total_hours = 0`, `new_candles = 4`, `burned_out_candles = 0`\n\n*   **Iteration 1:**\n    *   `new_candles = 4` (light them up)\n    *   `total_hours = 0 + 4 = 4`\n    *   `burned_out_candles = 0 + 4 = 4` (these 4 candles are now burned out)\n    *   `new_candles = 0` (all initial new candles are used)\n    *   **Crafting:** Vasily has 4 `burned_out_candles`. Since `b=2`, he crafts `4 // 2 = 2` new candles.\n    *   `burned_out_candles = 4 % 2 = 0` (no remainder)\n    *   `new_candles = 2` (these are available for the next round)\n\n*   **Iteration 2:**\n    *   `new_candles = 2` (light them up)\n    *   `total_hours = 4 + 2 = 6`\n    *   `burned_out_candles = 0 + 2 = 2`\n    *   `new_candles = 0`\n    *   **Crafting:** Vasily has 2 `burned_out_candles`. He crafts `2 // 2 = 1` new candle.\n    *   `burned_out_candles = 2 % 2 = 0`\n    *   `new_candles = 1`\n\n*   **Iteration 3:**\n    *   `new_candles = 1` (light it up)\n    *   `total_hours = 6 + 1 = 7`\n    *   `burned_out_candles = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `new_candles = 0`\n    *   **Crafting:** Vasily has 1 `burned_out_candle`. He crafts `1 // 2 = 0` new candles.\n    *   `burned_out_candles = 1 % 2 = 1`\n    *   `new_candles = 0`\n\n*   **End:** `new_candles` is 0, so the loop terminates. The final `total_hours` is 7.\n\nThe problem statement's input/output examples suggest that the program should handle multiple test cases, where each line of input contains `a` and `b`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read input line by line until EOF\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        # Strip whitespace and check if the line is empty\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n\n        # Parse a and b from the line\n        a, b = map(int, line.split())\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        new_candles = a\n        burned_out_candles = 0\n\n        # Continue as long as there are new candles to light\n        while new_candles > 0:\n            # 1.
