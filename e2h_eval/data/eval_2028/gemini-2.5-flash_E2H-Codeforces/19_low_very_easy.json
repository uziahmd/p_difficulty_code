    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem that's got my attention. It's asking me to select a subset of districts, specifically `n - k` of them, from a larger set. There's this network of roads that connects these districts, forming a tree. The key is that the selected districts must be a *connected component* within that tree.  Each district has a value associated with it – the number of fans, represented by `2^i` for district `i`.  I need to maximize the total fan count. The goal is to output the `k` districts that are removed, in increasing order.\n\nMy initial thought is that the exponential growth of `2^i` is important here. A larger `i` always contributes more than the combined values of all smaller `i`s. That's a good starting point.  So, I immediately think: \"maximize the sum of `2^i` by favoring districts with higher indices.\" That is, I'd like to try to keep the districts `n`, then `n-1`, and so on, as long as it forms a connected set of `n-k` districts.\n\nThis leads me to think about what the problem is *really* asking: I need to *remove* `k` districts, and the remaining ones must be a connected component.  So,  to maximize the sum of kept districts, I should be *minimizing* the sum of the removed districts!  That simplifies the problem: remove the smallest indices.  I'll start removing from index 1, 2, and so on...\n\nLet's try a greedy strategy.  I'll consider the districts in decreasing order: `n, n-1`, etc. Should I keep district `i`? If I can include `i` in the connected component, great. But what conditions must be met? Hmm, this gets tricky when I try to find a condition such that I will always find a connected component of size `n-k`.\n\nNow, the tree structure offers insights. It must be a subtree of the original tree. How do I optimally find that subtree? To maximize the sum of kept values, I want that subtree to include the nodes with the largest possible indices.  This greedy approach seems to be the right track. My plan is to remove the smallest indices to ensure I can maintain a connected subtree that contains the districts with largest indices. I'll need to carefully consider how the connections work in the tree to make sure I'm not disconnecting the kept set by removing a critical district. Okay, now I have a good plan.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of their fan counts is maximized. The fan count for district `i` is `2^i`. We need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. Specifically, `2^j > sum(2^i for i < j)`. This means that to maximize the total fan count, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. For example, keeping district `n` is always better than not keeping `n` and instead keeping any combination of other districts, as long as we can still form a connected component of the required size.\n\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1. We want to keep `n-k` districts.\n2. We should try to keep districts with the largest possible indices. Let's iterate from district `n` down to `1`.\n3. For each district `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\n   If we have already selected `n-k` districts, we are done. The remaining districts will be removed.\n   Otherwise, we consider district `i`. We want to keep `i` if it helps maximize the total fans. Since `2^i` is so large, we should always try to keep `i` if it's possible to form a connected component of `n-k` nodes that includes `i` and the nodes we've already decided to keep (which are all greater than `i`).\n   This \"if possible\" condition is tricky. A simpler approach is to think about which nodes we *must* remove.\n\nLet's maintain a set of `n-k` districts that we are currently considering to keep. Initially, this set is empty.\nWe iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nFor each district `i`:\nWe tentatively add `i` to our set of \"kept\" districts. If this set now has `n-k` districts, we are done. The remaining `k` districts (those not in our set) are the ones to be removed.\nHowever, just adding `i` is not enough. We need to ensure that the `n-k` districts form a connected component.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. We will try to keep as many large-indexed districts as possible.\nLet `kept_count` be the number of districts we have decided to keep so far.\nLet `removed_set` be the set of districts we have decided to remove.\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nIf `kept_count < n-k`:\n  We tentatively add `i` to our \"kept\" set.\n  Now, we have a set of `kept_count + 1` nodes. These nodes must form a connected component.\n  If adding `i` disconnects the component formed by previously kept nodes, or if it makes it impossible to form a connected component of `n-k` nodes later, this approach is flawed.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy involves identifying the \"root\" of the desired connected component.\nIf we remove `k` nodes, the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component. This means the remaining `n-k` nodes form a subtree of the original tree.\nTo maximize the sum of `2^i`, we want this subtree to contain nodes with the largest possible indices.\nThis means the subtree should \"reach out\" to include `n`, then `n-1`, etc.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of index: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts.\nLet `current_kept_nodes` be the set of nodes we have decided to keep. Initially, `current_kept_nodes = {n}`.\nWe have `1` node kept. We need to keep `n-k-1` more.\nWe can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from node `n` to find `n-k` nodes that form a connected component.\nWhen exploring from a node `u` to its neighbor `v`, we prioritize `v` if `v` has a larger index. This is implicitly handled by iterating from `n` downwards.\n\nLet's try this:\n1. Initialize an empty list `removed_nodes`.\n2. Initialize a boolean array `is_kept` of size `n+1` to all `False`.\n3. Keep track of the number of nodes we have decided to keep, `kept_count = 0`.\n4. Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n   If `kept_count < n-k`:\n     We want to keep node `i`. Mark `is_kept[i] = True`, `kept_count += 1`.\n   Else (if `kept_count == n-k`):\n     We have already selected `n-k` nodes. All remaining nodes (from `i` down to `1`) must be removed. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n     This is not quite right because the `n-k` nodes must form a connected component. Simply picking the `n-k` largest nodes doesn't guarantee connectivity.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` with maximum sum of `2^i`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` that minimizes the sum of `2^i` for the `k` nodes *not* in the component.\nTo minimize `sum(2^i)` for removed nodes, we should prioritize removing nodes with smaller indices.\n\nLet's try to remove `k` nodes starting from `1`.\nWe can use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or a similar structure to track connected components.\nInitially, all `n` nodes are \"active\". We want to remove `k` nodes.\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf `i` is not already marked as \"removed\":\n  Try to remove `i`. If removing `i` disconnects the graph such that it's impossible to form a single connected component of `n-k` nodes, then we cannot remove `i`.\n  This is still too complex.\n\nThe simplest approach that works for this greedy structure (where `2^i` dominates) is to find the \"root\" of the desired connected component.\nThe largest index `n` will almost certainly be part of the optimal solution.\nLet's try a BFS/DFS starting from node `n`.\nWe want to select `n-k` nodes.\nStart a BFS from node `n`. Add `n` to the set of `kept_nodes`.\nWhile `len(kept_nodes) < n-k`:\n  From the `kept_nodes`, find all their neighbors that are not yet kept.\n  Among these neighbors, pick the one with the largest index. Add it to `kept_nodes`.\nThis ensures connectivity and prioritizes larger indices.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Build adjacency list `adj` for the tree.\n3. Initialize `kept_nodes_count = 0`.\n4. Initialize `is_kept` array of size `n+1` to `False`.\n5. Initialize a `deque` for BFS, `q`.\n6. Add district `n` to `q`. Mark `is_kept[n] = True`. Increment `kept_nodes_count`.\n\n7. While `q` is not empty and `kept_nodes_count < n-k`:\n   `u = q.popleft()`\n   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n     If `v` is not `is_kept[v]`: (This check is not enough, we need to consider if `v` is a good candidate)\n       We need to find the best candidate neighbor from *all* currently kept nodes.\n       This means we need to find the unkept neighbor with the largest index among all neighbors of *any* node in `kept_nodes`.\n\nLet's refine the BFS-like approach:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Build adjacency list `adj` for the tree.\n3. Initialize `is_kept` array of size `n+1` to `False`.\n4. `kept_nodes_count = 0`.\n5. `q = collections.deque()`\n6. `removed_nodes = []`\n\n7. Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n   If `is_kept[i]` is already `True`, continue (it was added by a previous step).\n   If `kept_nodes_count == n-k`:\n     All remaining nodes must be removed. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n     Continue to the next `i`.\n\n   // At this point, `i` is not kept, and `kept_nodes_count < n-k`.\n   // We want to try to keep `i`.\n   // The condition for keeping `i` is that it doesn't leave us with too few nodes to remove.\n   // The number of nodes we *must* remove is `k`.\n   // The number of nodes we have *already* removed is `len(removed_nodes)`.\n   // The number of nodes remaining to be processed (from `i-1` down to `1`) is `i-1`.\n   // If we keep `i`, then `kept_nodes_count` becomes `kept_nodes_count + 1`.\n   // The number of nodes we still need to keep is `(n-k) - (kept_nodes_count + 1)`.\n   // If this number is greater than `i-1`, it means we cannot possibly select enough nodes from `1` to `i-1` to reach `n-k` kept nodes.\n   // So, we must remove `i`.\n   // This is the crucial condition:\n   // Number of nodes we will keep = `kept_nodes_count + 1` (if we keep `i`) + (nodes from `1` to `i-1` that we will keep).\n   // Total nodes available to keep from `1` to `i-1` is `i-1`.\n   // So, max possible kept nodes if we keep `i` = `kept_nodes_count + 1 + (i-1)`.\n   // If `kept_nodes_count + 1 + (i-1) < n-k`, then we *must* remove `i`.\n   // This simplifies to `kept_nodes_count + i < n-k`.\n   // If `kept_nodes_count + i < n-k`, then we must remove `i`.\n   //\n   // Example: n=6, k=3 => n-k=3.\n   // i=6: kept_count=0. 0+6 >= 3. Keep 6. kept_count=1. is_kept[6]=T. Add 6 to q.\n   // i=5: kept_count=1. 1+5 >= 3. Keep 5. kept_count=2. is_kept[5]=T. Add 5 to q.\n   // i=4: kept_count=2. 2+4 >= 3. Keep 4. kept_count=3. is_kept[4]=T. Add 4 to q.\n   // Now kept_count = n-k = 3. All remaining nodes 3, 2, 1 are removed.\n   // Removed: 1, 2, 3.\n   // But this doesn't guarantee connectivity. If 4, 5, 6 are not connected, this fails.\n\nThe example shows that the largest `n-k` nodes are not always kept.\nExample 1: n=6, k=3. n-k=3. Max fans: 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6. Removed: 1, 3, 4.\nThe nodes kept are 2, 5, 6.\nIf we apply the strategy of keeping `n`, `n-1`, etc. as much as possible:\nKeep 6. Kept: {6}. Count=1.\nKeep 5. Kept: {6,5}. Count=2.\nKeep 4. Kept: {6,5,4}. Count=3.\nThis would remove 1,2,3. Is {6,5,4} connected?\nGraph: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\nNeighbors of 6: {2,5}. Neighbors of 5: {6}. Neighbors of 4: {2}.\n{6,5,4} is not connected because 4 is only connected to 2, and 2 is not in {6,5,4}.\n\nThe correct approach is a modified BFS/DFS that prioritizes larger indices, but *only* if they are reachable from the current component.\nWe want to find a connected component of size `n-k` that maximizes `sum(2^i)`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` such that the sum of `2^i` for the `k` nodes *not* in the component is minimized.\nTo minimize `sum(2^i)` for removed nodes, we should remove nodes with the smallest possible indices.\n\nLet `nodes_to_remove = []`.\nLet `current_kept_nodes = set()`.\nLet `current_component_size = 0`.\nLet `q = collections.deque()`.\n\nWe start by adding node `n` to our component.\n`current_kept_nodes.add(n)`.\n`current_component_size = 1`.\n`q.append(n)`.\n\nNow, we need to select `n-k-1` more nodes.\nWe can iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nIf `i` is not in `current_kept_nodes` and `i` is adjacent to any node in `current_kept_nodes`:\n  And if `current_component_size < n-k`:\n    Add `i` to `current_kept_nodes`.\n    `current_component_size += 1`.\n    Add `i` to `q` (for BFS expansion).\n  Else (`current_component_size == n-k`):\n    We have enough nodes. All remaining `i` will be removed.\n\nThis greedy choice of picking the largest available neighbor might still not be optimal if picking a slightly smaller neighbor allows us to pick many more large nodes later.\nHowever, because `2^i` is so dominant, picking the largest available index is *always* optimal if it maintains connectivity and doesn't prevent us from reaching the target size.\n\nLet's maintain a set of candidate nodes to add to our component.\n1. Initialize `is_kept` array (size `n+1`) to `False`.\n2. `kept_count = 0`.\n3. `removed_nodes = []`.\n4. `candidates = set()`. // Stores nodes that are adjacent to a `kept` node, but not yet `kept`.\n\n5. Start with node `n`:\n   `is_kept[n] = True`.\n   `kept_count = 1`.\n   For each neighbor `v` of `n`:\n     `candidates.add(v)`.\n\n6. While `kept_count < n-k`:\n   If `candidates` is empty, it means our current component is isolated and cannot grow further. This should not happen if `n-k >= 1`.\n   Find the node `u` in `candidates` with the largest index.\n   Remove `u` from `candidates`.\n   `is_kept[u] = True`.\n   `kept_count += 1`.\n   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n     If `not is_kept[v]`:\n       `candidates.add(v)`.\n\n7. After the loop, `is_kept` array marks the `n-k` chosen nodes.\n8. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`. If `not is_kept[i]`, add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n9. Print `removed_nodes` in increasing order.\n\nLet's trace Example 1: `n=6, k=3`. Target `kept_count = 3`.\nGraph: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\nAdj:\n1: {2}\n2: {1,6,4,3}\n3: {2}\n4: {2}\n5: {6}\n6: {2,5}\n\n1. `is_kept = [F,F,F,F,F,F,F]`\n2. `kept_count = 0`\n3. `removed_nodes = []`\n4. `candidates = set()`\n\n5. Start with `n=6`:\n   `is_kept[6] = T`\n   `kept_count = 1`\n   Neighbors of 6: {2,5}. Add them to `candidates`. `candidates = {2,5}`.\n\n6. While `kept_count < 3`:\n   Loop 1: `kept_count = 1`.\n     `candidates = {2,5}`. Largest index is 5.\n     `u = 5`. Remove 5 from `candidates`. `candidates = {2}`.\n     `is_kept[5] = T`.\n     `kept_count = 2`.\n     Neighbors of 5: {6}. `is_kept[6]` is T. No new candidates.\n\n   Loop 2: `kept_count = 2`.\n     `candidates = {2}`. Largest index is 2.\n     `u = 2`. Remove 2 from `candidates`. `candidates = {}`.\n     `is_kept[2] = T`.\n     `kept_count = 3`.\n     Neighbors of 2: {1,6,4,3}.\n       `is_kept[1]` is F. Add 1 to `candidates`. `candidates = {1}`.\n       `is_kept[6]` is T.\n       `is_kept[4]` is F. Add 4 to `candidates`. `candidates = {1,4}`.\n       `is_kept[3]` is F. Add 3 to `candidates`. `candidates = {1,3,4}`.\n\n7. `kept_count = 3`. Loop terminates.\n   Nodes marked `is_kept`: 6, 5, 2.\n   Remaining `candidates` are {1,3,4}. These are nodes adjacent to the component {2,5,6} but not chosen because we reached `n-k` nodes.\n\n8. Identify removed nodes:\n   `i=1`: `is_kept[1]` is F. Add 1 to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [1]`.\n   `i=2`: `is_kept[2]` is T.\n   `i=3`: `is_kept[3]` is F. Add 3 to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [1,3]`.\n   `i=4`: `is_kept[4]` is F. Add 4 to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [1,3,4]`.\n   `i=5`: `is_kept[5]` is T.\n   `i=6`: `is_kept[6]` is T.\n\n9. Print `removed_nodes` in increasing order: `1 3 4`. This matches the example output!\n\nThis greedy strategy works because of the dominant nature of `2^i`. By always picking the largest available index node that connects to the current component, we ensure that we maximize the sum. If we were to pick a smaller index node instead of a larger one, we would lose `2^L - 2^S` (where L is larger index, S is smaller index) in fan count, and this loss cannot be compensated by any future choices because any `2^X` for `X < L` is smaller than `2^L`. The only constraint is connectivity and size `n-k`. This greedy choice respects both.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Adjacency list for graph: `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`.\n- `is_kept` array: `is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n- `candidates` set: To efficiently find the maximum element, a `heapq` (min-heap) can be used for negative values, or a `SortedList` (from `sortedcontainers` library) or a custom data structure if not allowed. Since `N` can be `10^6`, iterating through a set to find max is `O(N)` in worst case, leading to `O(N^2)` total which is too slow.\n  A `heapq` stores `(-value, value)` to retrieve max.\n  `heapq` operations are `O(log C)` where `C` is number of candidates. Max `C` is `N`.\n  Total time: `N` additions to component. Each involves `log N` for heap, and `deg(u)` for neighbors. Sum of `deg(u)` is `2(N-1)`. So `O(N log N + N) = O(N log N)`. This is efficient enough.\n\nLet's use `heapq`.
