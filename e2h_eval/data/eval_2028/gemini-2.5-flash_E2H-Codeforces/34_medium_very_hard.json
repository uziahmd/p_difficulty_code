            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Average Sleep Time\n\nIt's been almost a week since Polycarp couldn't get rid of insomnia. And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the plan to tackle this sleep time problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the average sleep time over all possible 'weeks', where each week is a set of `k` consecutive days from Polycarp's sleep records (which is the array `a`). There are `n - k + 1` such weeks.\n\nMy approach is to find the sum of sleep times for each week and then average them. I can compute each week's sum directly, but that'll get pretty slow. Instead, I'll use a sliding window technique.\n\nThe key idea is this:\n1. I'll calculate the sum of the first `k` elements in the `a` array. That's my initial \"window\" (first week).\n2. For the subsequent weeks, I can reuse the previous week's sum. For example, to calculate the sum of the second week, I'll subtract the first element of the first week (the element that \"slides out\") and add the new element from `a` (the element that \"slides in\"). This means I can update the sum in O(1) time.\n3. Keep track of a total sum for all these \"window sums\"\n\nI'll divide the sum of all week-sums by the total number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nLet's say `a = [3, 4, 7]` and `k = 2`, the weeks are `[3,4]` and `[4,7]`.\n\nSum of first window = 3 + 4 = 7. Next window sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11\n\nSo the total will be the first week sum which is `S_1` (which needs to be initialized), then a loop that sums the rest of the sums for each week from `S_2` to `S_{n-k+1}`\nTotal sum  = sum(first k elements) + (sliding window loop for n-k elements)\n\nThis sliding window method will make things efficient, running in O(n) time.\n\nI can make sure that my code prints the output with the required precision (at least 6 digits after the decimal point). I can use f-strings to format the output string.\n\nSeems like a solid plan! Now, I just need to translate that logic into a Python script and make sure everything is perfect with the edge cases and constraints in mind. It's a classic example of algorithm design and implementation; I'll check my trace runs and all edge cases.\n",
