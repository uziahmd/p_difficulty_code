She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving tab management. I need a Python script to figure out the fastest way to close tabs outside a specific range.  Let's break down my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: the total number of tabs (`n`), my initial cursor position (`pos`), and the range of tabs I want to keep (`l` to `r`).  The goal is to close everything *outside* this range.  \n\nThe possible actions are: moving the cursor left or right (each takes a second), and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor (also a second per action). The minimum and maximum indices of the remaining tabs change after each closing action, affecting where the cursor can move. Initially, the entire range from 1 to n are \"open\" tabs.\n\nMy ultimate objective is to end up with *only* tabs within the range `[l, r]` remaining. That means I have to close everything before `l` and everything after `r`.\n\nThinking this through, the key seems to be getting the cursor positioned correctly. To close tabs to the left of `l`, I need the cursor at or to the right of `l`, and then I can perform the \"close left\" operation. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of `r`, the cursor needs to be at or to the left of `r`.\n\nEssentially, I need to get the \"active\" range to be `[l, r]` after the closures. This means `a` will ultimately equal `l`, and `b` will equal `r`.\n\nNow, I'm considering different scenarios:\n\n*   **Trivial Case:** If the range I want to keep is *already* all the tabs (`l = 1` and `r = n`), I don't need to do anything. The cost is zero.\n\n*   **Left-Side Closure:** If I only need to close tabs to the left of `l` (and `r = n`), the cursor has to land at `l`.\n    *   If I'm already at or to the right of `l`, I just move to `l` (taking `|pos - l|` steps) and then close the left tabs.\n    *   If I'm left of `l`, I do the same steps (`|pos - l|` steps to get there, and the \"close left\" action.\n\nThis is a good start. I need to keep exploring other scenarios, like when I only need to close tabs to the right of r and cases where I need to move in both directions. The general idea is to get to a point (l or r) and then close tabs, so I need to factor cursor movement into the equations.\n",
