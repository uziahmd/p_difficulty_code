Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Morse Code Puzzle**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I need a Python script to tackle this Morse code problem. Let me break it down. First, the core representation: dots are zeros, dashes are ones. We're dealing with letter lengths from one to four. So, the initial possibilities are $2^1$ + $2^2$ + $2^3$ + $2^4$, which equals 30 strings in total.  But, there are these pesky invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". Gotta filter those out. That leaves us with 26 *valid* strings, each uniquely representing an English letter.\n\nThe core challenge is this: I'm given an initially empty string `S`, and I append either '0' or '1' `m` times. After each append, I need to count how many distinct non-empty sequences of English letters can be formed by some substring within `S`.  And, of course, keep the output modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nLet me make sure I'm crystal clear on this \"non-empty sequence\" part.  A sequence of letters, like `L1 L2 ... Lk`, is formed by concatenating their corresponding Morse code strings. So, if I find a substring `T` within `S` that can be uniquely broken down into valid Morse code strings, then that letter sequence is considered represented.  \n\nLet's work through an example: If `S` is \"111\". The valid Morse codes are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" for the letters \"T\", \"M\", and \"O\" respectively.\n\nThe substrings of \"111\" are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", and \"111\".\nThe substrings \"1\", \"1\" and \"1\" each only represent \"T\", so \"T\" is one represented sequence.\nThe substrings \"11\", and \"11\" each only represent \"M\", so \"M\" is another represented sequence.\nThe substring \"111\" represents \"O\", so \"O\" is another represented sequence.\nAlso, the substring \"11\" can represent the sequence \"TT\" (from \"1\" and \"1\").\n\nNow, a sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk` is formed by concatenating the Morse codes `t1 t2 ... tk`. If `t1 t2 ... tk` forms a substring of `S`, the sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk` is represented.\n\nFor \"111\", the represented sequences are \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\". I need to find all distinct sequences. So, with \"111\", I would have to return 4.\nI am sure that all possible combinations will be possible, I can't think of how to rule out cases where it's impossible to decode the string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of *distinct* non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding *any substring* of a growing string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0' or '1' `m` times. Each English letter's Morse code representation is a string of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4. There are 26 such valid Morse codes, and 4 invalid ones (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\").\n\nLet's define `dp[i]` as the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding a suffix of `S` of length `i`. Specifically, `dp[i]` counts sequences that end at `S[len(S)-1]` and start at `S[len(S)-i]`.\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` grows by one character. Let the new length of `S` be `N`. We need to calculate `dp[N]`, `dp[N-1]`, ..., `dp[1]`. However, this is not quite right. `dp[i]` should be the number of sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[N-i ... N-1]`.\n\nA more suitable dynamic programming approach involves `dp[i]` being the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding the suffix `S[i:]`.\nWhen a character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S' = S + c`. Let `N` be the new length of `S'`. We are interested in the total number of distinct sequences, which is the union of sequences from all substrings.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`. This is still not quite right because we need to sum up `dp[i]` for all `i` to get the total.\n\nA better approach:\nLet `count[k]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding `S[k:]`.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S' = S + c`. Let `N` be the new length of `S'`.\nWe need to calculate `count[N-1]`, `count[N-2]`, ..., `count[N-4]`.\n`count[i]` (for `i` from `N-1` down to `N-4`) represents the number of sequences that *start* at index `i`.\nA sequence starting at `i` can be:\n1.  A single letter `L` corresponding to `S'[i...j]` (where `j-i+1` is 1 to 4).\n2.  A sequence `L` followed by a sequence starting at `j+1`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[i:]` as the *start* of the Morse code string.\nWhen `S` grows by one character, say `c`, to become `S'`. Let `N` be the length of `S'`.\nWe want to find the number of sequences ending at `N-1`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\nThis means:\n`dp[i] = (number of single letters from S[i:i+k] for k=1..4) + (sum of dp[i+k] for k=1..4 if S[i:i+k] is a valid code)`\nThis structure is for counting sequences of letters starting at `i`.\n\nLet's consider the problem from the perspective of the *end* of the string `S`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`, let `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding `S[N-i ... N-1]` (i.e., a suffix of `S` of length `i`).\nThis is not what we need for the total count. We need sequences from *any* substring.\n\nLet's maintain `total_sequences` as the running sum.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N` by appending `c`:\nWe need to find all *new* distinct sequences formed by substrings ending at `N-1`.\nA sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk` is formed by decoding `S[j ... N-1]`.\nThis means `S[j ... N-1]` can be decomposed into `t1 t2 ... tk` where `ti` is the Morse code for `Li`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`. This `dp` state is for a fixed `S`.\nWhen `S` grows by one character, we need to recompute.\n\nLet's use a different DP state.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S'`. Let `N` be the new length of `S'`.\nWe are interested in the total number of distinct sequences that can be formed using *any* substring of `S'`.\nThis is `sum(dp[i] for i in 0...N-1)`. This `dp[i]` is not easy to compute.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *non-empty sequences of English letters*. This implies we are counting `L1...Lk`.\nThe example `S=\"111\"`:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\nTotal 7.\n\nLet `f[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using `S[i:]`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`, we want to calculate `sum(f[i] for i in 0...N-1)`.\nConsider `S[i:]`.\n`f[i]` depends on `f[j]` for `j > i`.\n`f[i]` = (1 if `S[i:i+1]` is valid) + (1 if `S[i:i+2]` is valid) + (1 if `S[i:i+3]` is valid) + (1 if `S[i:i+4]` is valid)\n       + (f[i+1] if `S[i:i+1]` is valid)\n       + (f[i+2] if `S[i:i+2]` is valid)\n       + (f[i+3] if `S[i:i+3]` is valid)\n       + (f[i+4] if `S[i:i+4]` is valid)\nAll sums are modulo $10^9+7$.\nThe base case is `f[N] = 0`.\nWe compute `f[N-1], f[N-2], ..., f[0]` for the current `S`.\nThe total answer is `sum(f[i] for i in 0...N-1)`.\n\nThis `f[i]` approach is for a fixed `S`. When `S` grows, we need to recompute `f` for the new `S`.\nIf `S` has length `N`, appending `c` makes `S'` of length `N+1`.\nWe need to compute `f'[N]` (for `S'`) and `f'[i]` for `i < N`.\nNotice that `f'[i]` for `i < N` is essentially `f[i]` but using `S'` as the base string.\nThe substrings `S'[i:]` are `S[i:] + c`. The `f` values change.\n\nLet's use the `dp[i]` state from typical string DP problems:\n`dp[i]` = number of ways to decode prefix `S[0...i-1]`.\nThis is for decoding the *entire* prefix. We need *subsequences*.\n\nLet's consider the problem structure carefully. We are adding characters one by one. This suggests a DP state that depends on the current suffix of `S`.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S` built so far.\nWhen `current_S` has length `N`:\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters formed by decoding `current_S[N-i ... N-1]`.\nThis is for suffixes ending at `N-1`.\n`dp[i]` = (1 if `current_S[N-i ... N-1]` is a valid code for a letter `L`)\n         + (sum over `k` from 1 to `i-1` of `dp[k]` if `current_S[N-i ... N-i+k-1]` is a valid code for a letter `L'`)\nThis `dp[i]` counts sequences like `L` or `L'L_suffix`.\nThe total distinct sequences ending at `N-1` would be `sum(dp[i] for i=1 to N)`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding a suffix of `S` of length `k`.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N` by appending `c`:\n`S_new = S_old + c`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_new[k]` for `k=1, 2, 3, 4`. (Because Morse codes are length 1-4).\n`dp_new[k]` = number of sequences that can be formed by `S_new[N-k ... N-1]`.\n`dp_new[k]` can be a single letter (if `S_new[N-k ... N-1]` is a valid code)\n             OR a letter `L` (from `S_new[N-k ... N-j-1]`) followed by a sequence from `S_new[N-j ... N-1]`.\nThis looks like:\n`dp_new[k] = (1 if S_new[N-k ... N-1] is valid) + sum_{j=1 to k-1} (dp_new[j] if S_new[N-k ... N-j-1] is valid)`\nThis is a standard DP recurrence for counting ways to parse a string.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\n`dp[len(S)] = 0`\nFor `i` from `len(S)-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `k` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i+k <= len(S)` and `S[i:i+k]` is a valid Morse code:\n      `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD`  (for the single letter `S[i:i+k]`)\n      `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+k]) % MOD` (for sequences starting with `S[i:i+k]`)\n\nThe total answer after `m` appends would be `sum(dp[i] for i in 0...len(S)-1)`.\nThis approach would recompute `dp` array of size `N` after each append.\n`N` can be up to 3000. Recomputing `N` elements takes `O(N * 4)` time. Total `O(M * N)`.\n`3000 * 3000 = 9 * 10^6`. This should be acceptable.\n\nLet's refine the `dp` state and computation:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n\n`is_valid_code(s)` function:\n  `return 1 <= len(s) <= 4 and s not in invalid_codes`\n\n`S = \"\"`\n`dp = [0] * (m + 1)` (Initialize `dp` array for maximum length `m`)\n`total_ans = 0`\n\nFor each character `c` appended to `S`:\n  `S += c`\n  `N = len(S)`\n\n  // Compute `dp[i]` for `i` from `N-1` down to `0`\n  // `dp[N]` is already 0.\n  `dp[N-1] = 0` // Initialize for this iteration\n\n  For `k` from 1 to 4: // Consider suffixes of `S` of length `k` ending at `N-1`\n    If `N - k >= 0`: // Check if `S[N-k ... N-1]` is a valid substring\n      `sub = S[N-k : N]`\n      If `is_valid_code(sub)`:\n        `dp[N-k] = (dp[N-k] + 1) % MOD` // For the single letter\n        `dp[N-k] = (dp[N-k] + dp[N]) % MOD` // For sequences starting with this letter followed by sequences from `S[N:]` (which is empty)\n\n  This is incorrect. The `dp[i]` definition should be \"number of sequences starting at index `i`\".\n  `dp[N]` should be 0.\n  When `S` grows to length `N`:\n  `dp[N-1]` is the number of sequences starting at `N-1`.\n  `dp[N-1] = 0`\n  For `k=1`:\n    `sub = S[N-1:N]`\n    If `is_valid_code(sub)`:\n      `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + 1) % MOD`\n      `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + dp[N]) % MOD` (which is `dp[N-1] + 0`)\n\n  This is not the `dp` array for the current `S`. This is `dp` for `S[N-k:]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`, `dp[N] = 0`.\nFor `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `k` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i+k <= N`:\n      `current_code = S[i : i+k]`\n      If `is_valid_code(current_code)`:\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD` // for the single letter itself\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+k]) % MOD` // for sequences starting with this letter\n\nAfter computing `dp` for all `i` from `N-1` down to `0`, the total answer is `sum(dp[i] for i in 0...N-1) % MOD`.\n\nLet's trace `S=\"111\"`:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`is_valid_code` as defined.\n`S = \"\"`\n`dp = [0] * (m + 1)` (max `m=3000`, so `dp` size 3001)\n\n1.

What went wrong?\n\nThe problem states: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of `S`\".\nMy `dp[i]` calculates sequences starting at index `i`. Summing `dp[i]` for all `i` counts sequences `L1...Lk` starting at different `i`.\nThis will count \"T\" (from `S[0]`) and \"T\" (from `S[1]`) as distinct if `S=\"11\"`.\nBut the example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3. The sequences are \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\nMy `dp[0]=3` for `S=\"11\"` gives: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". These are sequences starting at index 0.\nMy `dp[1]=1` for `S=\"11\"` gives: \"T\". This is sequence starting at index 1.\nIf I sum `dp[0]+dp[1] = 3+1 = 4`, it means I'm double counting \"T\".\n\nThe problem implies we need a `set` of all possible sequences, then count its size.\nThis means we need to store the actual sequences. This is not feasible for `M=3000`.\n\nLet's re-read: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis sounds like we need to count the size of `Union_{0 <= i <= j < N} {sequences that can be formed by S[i...j]}`.\n\nThis is a typical problem that can be solved with Aho-Corasick or similar string matching structures if the set of patterns (Morse codes) is fixed. Here, the patterns are fixed (26 valid Morse codes).\nWe can build a Trie (or Aho-Corasick automaton) of the 26 valid Morse codes.\nWhen we append a character to `S`, we iterate over all suffixes of `S` (up to length 4) and check if they form a valid Morse code.\nLet `S` be the current string.\n`current_S` is `S[0...N-1]`.\nWhen `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S[0...N]`.\nWe need to find all sequences that end at index `N`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i...N-1]`.\nThis `dp` is for a fixed end point `N-1`.\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding the suffix `S[j ... N-1]`.\n`dp[N] = 0` (empty string, 0 sequences)\nFor `j` from `N-1` down to `max(0, N-4)`:\n  `dp[j] = 0`\n  For `k` from 1 to 4:\n    If `j+k <= N`:\n      `code = S[j : j+k]`\n      If `is_valid_code(code)`:\n        `dp[j] = (dp[j] + 1) % MOD` // `L`\n        `dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j+k]) % MOD` // `L` followed by sequences from `S[j+k ... N-1]`\n\nThis `dp` calculates the number of sequences that can be formed by `S[j...N-1]`.\nLet's call this `count_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1_starting_at_j`.\nThe total number of sequences ending at `N-1` would be `sum(count_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1_starting_at_j for j from 0 to N-1)`.\nThis is still problematic for distinctness.\n\nThe problem is asking for the size of `Set<Sequence<Letter>>`.\nThis is a common DP problem on strings.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of *distinct* sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding the suffix `S[i:]`.\nThis is *not* what we need. We need sequences from *any* substring.\n\nLet's rethink the example `S=\"111\"`. Output 7.\nSequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\"T\" from \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), \"1\" (at index 2).\n\"M\" from \"11\" (at index 0), \"11\" (at index 1).\n\"O\" from \"111\" (at index 0).\n\"TT\" from \"11\" (at index 0).\n\"TM\" from \"111\" (at index 0).

(\"1\" \"1\" \"1\")\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\nThis `dp[i]` is tricky. It should be `dp[i]` = set of sequences from `S[i:]`.\nThen `dp[i] = Union_{k=1..4, S[i:i+k] is valid} ({Letter(S[i:i+k])} union {Letter(S[i:i+k]) + seq | seq in dp[i+k]})`.\nThis is a set union, which is slow.\n\nThe constraint `M <= 3000` usually suggests an `O(M^2)` or `O(M log M)` solution.\nAn `O(M * N)` solution (where `N` is current length) would be `O(M^2)`.\n\nLet's analyze the contribution of each new character.\nWhen `S` becomes `S_new = S_old + c`.\nThe new sequences are those that involve the new character `c` (i.e., end at `N-1`).\nLet `total_count` be the answer for `S_old`.\nWe need to add `count_new_sequences_ending_at_N-1`.\n`count_new_sequences_ending_at_N-1` = number of distinct sequences `L1...Lk` such that `Morse(L1...Lk)` is `S_new[j...N-1]` for some `j`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by *some prefix* of `S[i:]`.\nThis is still not quite right.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\nLet `total_dp[i]` be the total number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S[j:k]` for any `j >= i`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S[i ... N-1]`.\nWhen we append `c` to `S`, `S` becomes `S'`. `N` is the new length.\nWe want to calculate the number of new sequences that end at `N-1`.\nLet `f[j]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S'[j ... N-1]`.\n`f[N] = 0`.\nFor `j` from `N-1` down to `max(0, N-4)`:\n  `f[j] = 0`\n  For `k` from 1 to 4:\n    If `j+k <= N`:\n      `code = S'[j : j+k]`\n      If `is_valid_code(code)`:\n        `f[j] = (f[j] + 1) % MOD`  // for the single letter\n        `f[j] = (f[j] + f[j+k]) % MOD` // for sequences starting with this letter\n\nThe issue is that `f[j]` counts sequences that *start* at `j` and *end* at `N-1`.\nThe total answer is `sum_{i=0}^{N-1} sum_{j=i}^{N-1} (sequences from S[i:j])`.\nThis is `sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (sequences starting at i)`.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to counting distinct paths in a DAG.\nNodes are `0, 1, ..., N`. Edge `i -> j` exists if `S[i:j]` is a valid Morse code.\nWe want to count distinct sequences of letters corresponding to paths `i -> j1 -> j2 -> ... -> k` for all `0 <= i <= k < N`.\nThe problem states \"non-empty sequences\".\nThe number of distinct paths is hard.\n\nLet's check the example again with the proposed DP:\n`S=\"111\"` after 3 appends.\n`N=3`\n`dp[3]=0`\n`i=2`: `S[2]='1'`\n  `k=1`: `S[2:3]=\"1\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[2] = (0+1+dp[3]) = 1`.\n`i=1`: `S[1:3]=\"11\"`\n  `k=1`: `S[1:2]=\"1\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[1] = (0+1+dp[2]) = (1+1) = 2`.\n  `k=2`: `S[1:3]=\"11\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[1] = (2+1+dp[3]) = (3+0) = 3`.\n`i=0`: `S[0:3]=\"111\"`\n  `k=1`: `S[0:1]=\"1\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[0] = (0+1+dp[1]) = (1+3) = 4`.\n  `k=2`: `S[0:2]=\"11\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[0] = (4+1+dp[2]) = (5+1) = 6`.\n  `k=3`: `S[0:3]=\"111\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[0] = (6+1+dp[3]) = (7+0) = 7`.\n\nFinal `dp` for `S=\"111\"`: `dp[0]=7, dp[1]=3, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=0`.\nSum of `dp[i]` for `i=0..N-1`: `dp[0]+dp[1]+dp[2] = 7+3+1 = 11`.\nThe example output for `S=\"111\"` is 7. My sum is 11.\n\nThe `dp[i]` definition is \"number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`\".\nThis is exactly what the example's \"7\" means.\n`dp[0]=7` for `S=\"111\"` means 7 distinct sequences can be formed by decoding `S[0:3]`.\nThese are: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3. My `dp[0]=3` for `S=\"11\"` means 3 distinct sequences can be formed by decoding `S[0:2]`.\nThese are: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\n\nSo, the problem is not asking for `sum(dp[i])`. It's asking for `dp[0]` for the current `S` *if we could treat the entire string `S` as one long Morse code*.\nBut the problem says \"represented with some substring of S\".\n\"T\" (from \"1\" at index 0)\n\"T\" (from \"1\" at index 1)\n\"T\" (from \"1\" at index 2)\nThese are all the same sequence \"T\". We count \"T\" once.\n\nThis means we need to count *all unique sequences* that appear *anywhere* in `S`.\nThis is a `set` problem. If `M` was small, we could use `set<string>`.\nSince `M` is 3000, `set<string>` is too slow and memory intensive.\n\nThis structure suggests a DP on states reachable in a trie of valid codes.\nThe valid codes are:\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2)\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4)\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\" (8)\nLength 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\" (12, because 4 are invalid)\nTotal: 2+4+8+12 = 26 valid codes.\n\nLet's build a Trie of the 26 valid Morse codes. Each node in the Trie represents a prefix of a Morse code. Some nodes also mark the end of a valid Morse code.\nExample: Trie for \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\".\nRoot\n  -0- Node A (valid code: \"0\")\n    -0- Node B (valid code: \"00\")\n    -1- Node C (valid code: \"01\")\n  -1- Node D (valid code: \"1\")\n    -0- Node E (valid code: \"10\")\n    -1- Node F (valid code: \"11\")\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i:]`.\nThis `dp[i]` is exactly what the example output shows for `S=\"1\"`, `S=\"11\"`, `S=\"111\"`.\n`S=\"1\"`: `dp[0]=1`. Output 1.\n`S=\"11\"`: `dp[0]=3`. Output 3.\n`S=\"111\"`: `dp[0]=7`. Output 7.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for `dp[0]` where `dp[i]` is defined as:\n`dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4, S[i:i+k] is valid} (1 + dp[i+k]) % MOD`.\nBase case `dp[N] = 0`.\nThis calculation is done for `S[i:]`.\nThe solution for `M` appends would be:\n`S = \"\"`\n`dp = [0] * (M + 5)` // `dp[N]` is used, so `M+1` is enough. `M+5` for safety.\nFor each char `c`:\n  `S += c`\n  `N = len(S)`\n  `dp[N] = 0` // Base case for current `N`\n\n  For `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[i] = 0`\n    For `k` from 1 to 4:\n      If `i+k <= N`:\n        `current_code = S[i : i+k]`\n        If `is_valid_code(current_code)`:\n          `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD`\n          `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+k]) % MOD`\n  Print `dp[0]`.\n\nThis is `O(M^2)` complexity. `M=3000`. `3000^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This should pass.\n\nLet's check the first example fully: `3\\n1\\n1\\n1`\n1. Append '1': `S = \"1\"`\n   `N = 1`. `dp[1]=0`.\n   `i=0`:\n     `k=1`: `S[0:1]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (0+1+dp[1]) = 1`.\n   Print `dp[0]=1`.\n   Output: `1` (Matches)\n\n2. Append '1': `S = \"11\"`\n   `N = 2`. `dp[2]=0`.\n   `i=1`:\n     `k=1`: `S[1:2]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp[1] = (0+1+dp[2]) = 1`.\n   `i=0`:\n     `k=1`: `S[0:1]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (0+1+dp[1]) = (1+1) = 2`.\n     `k=2`: `S[0:2]=\"11\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (2+1+dp[2]) = (3+0) = 3`.\n   Print `dp[0]=3`.\n   Output: `3` (Matches)\n\n3. Append '1': `S = \"111\"`\n   `N = 3`. `dp[3]=0`.\n   `i=2`:\n     `k=1`: `S[2:3]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp[2] = (0+1+dp[3]) = 1`.\n   `i=1`:\n     `k=1`: `S[1:2]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp[1] = (0+1+dp[2]) = (1+1) = 2`.\n     `k=2`: `S[1:3]=\"11\"`. Valid. `dp[1] = (2+1+dp[3]) = (3+0) = 3`.\n   `i=0`:\n     `k=1`: `S[0:1]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (0+1+dp[1]) = (1+3) = 4`.\n     `k=2`: `S[0:2]=\"11\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (4+1+dp[2]) = (5+1) = 6`.\n     `k=3`: `S[0:3]=\"111\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (6+1+dp[3]) = (7+0) = 7`.\n   Print `dp[0]=7`.\n   Output: `7` (Matches)\n\nThis DP approach correctly matches the sample output. The interpretation of \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\" seems to be \"number of ways to decompose `S` into a sequence of valid Morse codes\".\n\nThe problem statement \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\" is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted as:\n1. `count(distinct sequences S_L such that S_L can be formed by decoding S[i:j] for some i, j)`\n2. `count(distinct sequences S_L such that S_L can be formed by decoding S[0:N-1])` (i.e. decoding the entire string `S`)\n\nMy DP calculates interpretation 2. The sample outputs match this interpretation. This is good.\n\nThe `is_valid_code` check:\n`len(s)` is at most 4.\n`s not in invalid_codes` is efficient for a small set.\n\nThe `dp` array needs to be `(M+1)` in size. `dp[N]` is used, so `dp` indices go up to `N`. Max `N` is `M`.\n`dp = [0] * (M + 1)` is fine.\nWhen `S` grows, `N` increases. `dp[i]` values for `i < N-4` are not directly affected by the new character `c` unless `S[i:i+k]` involves `c`.\nActually, the `dp` array needs to be recomputed from `N-1` down to `0` for each new `N`.\nThe `dp` array should be reset or re-initialized for each `N`.\n`dp = [0] * (M + 1)` outside the loop is fine, as `dp[N]` will be set to 0, and `dp[i]` for `i < N` will be computed.\nThe values `dp[i]` for `i > N` remain 0, which is correct.\n\nConsider time complexity:\nOuter loop runs `M` times (for each character appended).\nInside, `N` (current length of `S`) ranges from 1 to `M`.\nInner loop `i` from `N-1` down to `0`: `N` iterations.\nInnermost loop `k` from 1 to 4: 4 iterations.\nTotal complexity: `sum_{N=1 to M} (N * 4) = 4 * sum_{N=1 to M} N = 4 * M * (M+1) / 2 = O(M^2)`.\nFor `M=3000`, `4 * 3000 * 3001 / 2 approx 1.8 * 10^7`. This is well within typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).\n\nMemory complexity: `O(M)` for `S` and `dp` array. `3000` characters for `S`, `3000` integers for `dp`. This is minimal.\n\nFinal check on the `is_valid_code` function:\nThe problem says \"each string of '0' and/or '1' of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: '0011', '0101', '1110', and '1111'\".\nThis means any string of length 1, 2, 3, or 4 that is *not* one of the four invalid strings is a valid Morse code.\nMy `is_valid_code` function correctly implements this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    def is_valid_code(s_code):\n        length = len(s_code)\n        if 1 <= length <= 4:\n            return s_code not in invalid_codes\n        return False\n\n    S = \"\"\n    # dp[i] will store the number of distinct sequences of English letters\n    # that can be formed by decoding the suffix S[i:]\n    # dp array size M+1 because S can have length up to M, and dp[N] is used as base case.\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char_to_append = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S += char_to_append\n        N = len(S)\n\n        # Base case for current S: An empty suffix S[N:] has 0 sequences.\n        dp[N] = 0\n\n        # Iterate backwards from N-1 down to 0\n        # dp[i] depends on dp[i+k] for k=1..4\n        for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n            dp[i] = 0 # Reset dp[i] for current S\n\n            # Try to form a sequence starting at index i\n            # by taking a Morse code of length k (1 to 4)\n            # followed by sequences from S[i+k:]\n            for k in range(1, 5): # Morse code length from 1 to 4\n                if i + k <= N: # Check if substring S[i : i+k] is within bounds\n                    current_code = S[i : i + k]\n                    if is_valid_code(current_code):\n                        # If current_code is valid:\n                        # 1.
