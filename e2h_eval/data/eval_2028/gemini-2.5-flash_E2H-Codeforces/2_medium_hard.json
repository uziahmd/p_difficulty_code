Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for X-Shape Detection**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. I need to write a Python script to figure out if a given grid of characters makes an \"X\" shape, according to these rules: the characters on both main diagonals have to be the same, and different from those outside the diagonals, with everything else being identical. And, the grid has to be square with an odd number of rows (n), which is important. The code will represent the grid as a 2D array, and I'll use nested loops to check each cell.\n\nFirst, I'll read the grid's size (n). Then, I'll read in the grid itself, storing it in a list of strings, or a list of lists of characters.  I'll initialize some variables: `diag_char` to hold the character found on the diagonals (starting with the top-left cell), `nondiag_char` for the non-diagonal character, and a boolean flag `is_x` set to `True` initially.\n\nI'll iterate through the grid, row by row and column by column. Inside the loops, I'll figure out if the current cell is on a diagonal (`row == col` or `row + col == n - 1`). If it is, and `diag_char` isn't set yet, I'll set it to the current cell's character. If it *is* set, and the current cell's character doesn't match `diag_char`, that's a violation, so `is_x` goes to `False`, and I'll break out of the loops. If the cell is not on a diagonal, the same process, but for `nondiag_char`.\n\nAfter the loops finish (or if I've already determined it's *not* an X), I have to check one last thing: the diagonal character and non-diagonal character *must* be different. If they are the same, that's another violation, and `is_x` gets set to `False`. Finally, I print \"YES\" if `is_x` is still `True`, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nI need to make sure I handle the edge cases correctly. `n` is odd (3 <= n < 300), which means the central element will always be on both diagonals. This also means there will always be non-diagonal elements, so the `nondiag_char` will always be set if the diagonals pass the test. And the characters are just lowercase English letters, which simplifies things.\n",
