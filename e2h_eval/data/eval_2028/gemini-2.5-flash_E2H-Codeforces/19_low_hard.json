The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solving the Tree District Contest Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and I need to come up with a Python script to handle the input, process it, and deliver the output in the prescribed format. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I see that the district and road network forms a tree structure because of the \"exactly one path\" condition between districts. Each district has a contestant with a number of fans that's a power of 2, specifically `2^i`. The goal is to remove `k` contestants, and I need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component – that's crucial. I'm trying to *maximize* the total number of fans remaining. Ultimately, the script must output the district numbers of the removed contestants in increasing order.\n\nThinking this through, if I have a set `S` of all the districts and remove a subset `R` of `k` districts, the remaining set `P = S \\setminus R` must be connected. And, it should maximize the sum of `2^i` for all `i` in `P`. Well, since the sum of all districts is a constant, this means I need to *minimize* the sum of `2^i` for the removed districts in `R`.\n\nNow, minimizing this sum of powers of 2 means removing districts with smaller indices first, since the value of `2^i` grows exponentially. This is the key insight. Given `k` removals, I should start by removing districts with the lowest indices possible to achieve maximum total fans.\n\nSo, to ensure the remaining districts remain connected, I must make sure that for any two districts in my kept set `P`, their original path in the tree must *also* only contain districts in `P`. The subset `P` must form a connected subgraph.\n\nSince I am trying to *maximize* the sum of powers of 2, the most effective strategy would be to keep districts with larger indices. This simplifies the approach significantly. Now I just need to figure out how to translate this into a Python script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of `2^i` for the `k` removed districts. Since `2^i` grows very rapidly, minimizing this sum means we should prioritize removing districts with smaller `i` values.\n\nLet `P` be the set of `n - k` participating districts and `R` be the set of `k` removed districts. We want to maximize `sum(2^i for i in P)`.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `sum(2^i for i in R)`, because `sum(2^i for i in S) = sum(2^i for i in P) + sum(2^i for i in R)` where `S` is the set of all `n` districts.\n\nTo minimize `sum(2^i for i in R)`, we should try to remove districts with the smallest possible indices.\nThe districts `1, 2, ..., n` are given. We want to keep `n - k` districts such that they form a connected component. To maximize the sum of powers of 2, we should try to keep the districts with the largest indices.\n\nLet's consider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep as many of the largest-indexed districts as possible.\nSuppose we decide to keep a certain set of districts `P`. The smallest index in `P` is `min_P`.\nFor `P` to be connected, all districts on the path between any two districts in `P` must also be in `P`.\nThis implies that if we root the tree arbitrarily (e.g., at district `n`), and consider a district `u` and its parent `p`, if `u` is in `P` but `p` is not, then `u` must be part of a \"leaf\" of the connected component `P`. If `p` is also in `P`, then the connection is maintained.\n\nA key insight is that if we decide to keep `n-k` districts, to maximize the sum, we should always try to keep the districts with the largest indices.\nConsider the district `n`. We almost certainly want to keep `n` because `2^n` is by far the largest term.\nThen `n-1`, `n-2`, and so on.\nThe problem is that keeping large-indexed districts might disconnect the component, forcing us to keep smaller-indexed districts to maintain connectivity, or remove large-indexed districts.\n\nLet's maintain a set of `n-k` districts that we *tentatively* want to keep. Initially, this set could be `n, n-1, ..., k+1`.\nHowever, this set might not be connected. If it's not connected, we have to make changes. We might need to replace a district `i` with a smaller district `j` (i.e., `j < i`) to connect components, which would reduce the total sum of fans. This is not optimal.\nInstead, we should think about which `k` districts to remove. We want to remove the smallest `k` districts possible, under the connectivity constraint.\n\nLet's try a greedy approach based on the smallest indices.\nWe start with all `n` districts. We want to remove `k` of them.\nWe iterate through districts `i` from `1` to `n`. For each district `i`, we consider removing it. We can remove district `i` if:\n1. We still need to remove more districts (`removed_count < k`).\n2. Removing `i` does not disconnect the remaining graph.\n\nThis is a bit tricky to check efficiently. A better approach might be to work backwards.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. Let's try to keep the districts `n, n-1, ..., n-(n-k)+1 = k+1`. This set `P_0 = {k+1, k+2, ..., n}` has `n-k` districts. If `P_0` forms a connected component, then this is the optimal solution (remove `1, ..., k`).\nIf `P_0` is not connected, it means some district `j \\le k` *must* be kept to connect components.\nThis implies we must remove some district `i > k` instead of `j`. To minimize the sum of removed districts, we should pick the smallest possible `j` to keep, and the largest possible `i` to remove.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes `sum(2^i)`.\nSince we want to remove `k` districts, and we want to remove the smallest possible district indices, we can iterate through the districts from `1` to `n`. For each district `d`, we consider removing it. We can remove `d` if we still need to remove districts and removing `d` doesn't violate the connectivity constraint for the *final* set of `n-k` districts.\n\nLet's use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to keep track of connected components.\nInitially, all `n` districts are present. We want to remove `k` districts.\nWe can try to remove districts `1, 2, ..., n` in this order.\nWhen considering district `i`:\n1. If we have already removed `k` districts, we cannot remove `i`.\n2. If we haven't removed `k` districts yet, we *could* remove `i`.\n   If we remove `i`, the total number of remaining districts is `n - (current_removed_count + 1)`.\n   The problem is that removing `i` might split a component that would otherwise be connected.\n   This greedy strategy of removing the smallest `i` might not work if removing `i` forces us to keep a much larger set of small-indexed nodes later to connect the graph.\n\nConsider the districts `1, 2, ..., n`. We want to keep `n-k` of them.\nLet `R` be the set of removed districts. We want to minimize `sum_{i \\in R} 2^i`.\nThis means we prefer to remove smaller indices.\nLet's try to keep the districts `n, n-1, ..., n-k+1`. This is a set of `k` districts.\nThe remaining `n-k` districts are `1, 2, ..., n-k`. This set is not necessarily connected.\n\nLet's use a different perspective. We are trying to find a connected component of size `n-k`.\nThe most valuable nodes are `n, n-1, ...`.\nWe can use a modified Dijkstra-like approach or a centroid decomposition idea.\nHowever, the constraints `n <= 10^6` suggest a linear or `N log N` solution.\n\nThe core idea is to find the smallest possible set of `k` districts to remove, such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component.\nLet `P` be the set of `n-k` remaining districts.\nLet `R` be the set of `k` removed districts.\nWe want to minimize `sum_{i \\in R} 2^i`.\nThis means we want to keep the largest possible indices in `P`.\n\nConsider the districts `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe iterate through them. Let `d` be the current district.\nWe want to keep `d` if possible, because it has a large `2^d` value.\nWe use a DSU structure. Initially, all nodes are \"removed\".\nWe process nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWhen we process node `d`:\n1. Add `d` to the set of \"kept\" nodes.\n2. Connect `d` to its neighbors that are already \"kept\".\n3. If this creates a cycle or connects two previously distinct components, that's fine.\n4. Keep track of the number of \"kept\" nodes.\n5. If we have kept `n-k` nodes, we are done. The remaining nodes are the ones to remove.\n\nThis strategy is flawed. The DSU finds connected components among *kept* nodes. If we add `d` and it connects to an existing component, then the size of that component grows. We need to know if the *entire* graph of kept nodes is connected.\n\nLet's maintain a count of `n-k` active nodes.\nInitially, all nodes `1, ..., n` are active.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nFor each `i`, we try to remove it.\nTo remove `i`, we must ensure that the remaining `(n - removed_count - 1)` active nodes form a connected component.\nThis check is too expensive.\n\nA simpler approach:\nThe `n-k` remaining nodes form a connected component.\nThis means there is a \"root\" node for this component.\nOr, more generally, there exists a unique \"minimal\" spanning tree for these `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem's constraints and the nature of `2^i`.\nWe want to keep the largest possible indices.\nSuppose we decide to keep the districts `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n-k}` where `p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{n-k}`.\nTo maximize `sum(2^i)`, we want `p_1, ..., p_{n-k}` to be as large as possible.\nThis means we want `p_1` to be as large as possible. If `p_1` is fixed, we want `p_2` to be as large as possible, and so on.\nThis is a lexicographical maximization.\n\nLet `max_p = n`. We will always keep `n`.\nThen we try to keep `n-1`.\nThen `n-2`.\nWe keep adding nodes `d = n, n-1, ...` to a temporary set `P_temp`.\nWe use a DSU to check connectivity of `P_temp`.\nWhen we add `d` to `P_temp`, we connect it to its neighbors that are already in `P_temp`.\nWe maintain `num_components` and `num_kept_nodes`.\nIf `num_components == 1` and `num_kept_nodes == n-k`, we have found our set `P_temp`.\nThe nodes not in `P_temp` are the ones to remove.\n\nThis is the correct approach!\nIterate `d` from `n` down to `1`.\nMaintain a DSU structure for the nodes `n, n-1, ..., d`.\nLet `kept_nodes` be the set of nodes we decide to keep. Initially empty.\nLet `removed_nodes` be the set of nodes we decide to remove. Initially empty.\nLet `num_kept_nodes = 0`.\nLet `num_components = 0`.\n\nFor `d = n` down to `1`:\n  Add `d` to `kept_nodes`. `num_kept_nodes++`.\n  Initialize DSU for `d` (parent of `d` is `d`, size is `1`).\n  `num_components++`.\n  For each neighbor `v` of `d`:\n    If `v` is already in `kept_nodes`:\n      If `find(d) != find(v)`:\n        `union(d, v)`.\n        `num_components--`.\n  If `num_components == 1` and `num_kept_nodes == n-k`:\n    We have found our `n-k` connected nodes. These are the nodes in `kept_nodes`.\n    The nodes `1, ..., d-1` (which we haven't processed yet) and any nodes `j > d` that were *not* added to `kept_nodes` (because they were implicitly removed by this process) are the removed ones.\n    This logic is still a bit off. We want to remove *exactly* `k` nodes.\n\nLet's refine the greedy strategy:\nWe want to find a connected component of size `n-k` such that the sum of `2^i` is maximized.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` that contains the largest possible indices.\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe try to \"keep\" nodes `n, n-1, ...` greedily.\nWe use a DSU. `parent[i]` stores the parent of `i`. `sz[i]` stores the size of the component rooted at `i`.\n`active_nodes`: a boolean array, `active_nodes[i]` is true if node `i` is currently part of our candidate connected component.\n`num_active_components`: number of connected components among active nodes.\n`num_active_nodes`: number of active nodes.\n\nInitialize:\n`removed_count = 0`\n`removed_list = []`\n`active_nodes` = all `True`\n`num_active_nodes = n`\n`num_active_components = n` (each node is its own component)\nDSU: `parent[i] = i`, `sz[i] = 1` for all `i`.\n\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  If `removed_count == k`: break (we have removed enough)\n  \n  // Try to remove node `i`.\n  // To remove `i`, it must not disconnect the graph of `num_active_nodes - 1` nodes.\n  // This means if `i` is a cut vertex in the current graph, we cannot remove it.\n  \n  // A node `i` is a cut vertex if removing it increases the number of connected components.\n  // This is hard to check efficiently.\n\nLet's use the property that `sum(2^i)` is minimized by removing smallest `i`.\nThis suggests we iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nWe want to remove `i` if possible.\nWe maintain `num_components` and `current_size` for the *remaining* nodes.\n`adj`: adjacency list for the tree.\n`parent`: DSU parent array.\n`component_size`: DSU component size array.\n`num_remaining_nodes`: initially `n`.\n`num_components`: initially `n`.\n`removed_nodes`: a list to store removed nodes.\n\nFor `i = 1` to `n`:\n  If `len(removed_nodes) == k`: break.\n\n  // Check if `i` can be removed.\n  // A node `i` can be removed if, after removing it, the remaining `num_remaining_nodes - 1` nodes\n  // can still form a single connected component.\n  // This means `i` is not critical for connecting the graph.\n  // A node `i` is critical if its removal would increase the number of components to more than 1,\n  // *and* the total number of remaining nodes would be `n-k`.\n  \n  // The crucial observation: If we remove node `i`, it means `i` is not part of the final connected component.\n  // The component size of `i` in the DSU structure is the number of nodes in its connected component.\n  // If we remove `i`, `num_remaining_nodes` decreases by 1.\n  // The number of components `num_components` might increase if `i` was a bridge.\n  // But we want `num_components` to be 1 *at the end*.\n\nLet's use the provided solution structure from similar problems.\nWe want to identify `k` nodes that are \"least important\" for connectivity *among the nodes that would be kept*.\nThe nodes that are \"least important\" are those with small indices that are leaves of the component or can be removed without splitting it.\n\nLet's build the graph.\n`adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`\nFor `_ in range(n - 1):`\n  `u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`\n  `adj[u].append(v)`\n  `adj[v].append(u)`\n\nDSU structure:\n`parent = list(range(n + 1))`\n`comp_size = [1] * (n + 1)`\n`num_components = n`\n\n`def find(i):`\n  `if parent[i] == i:`\n    `return i`\n  `parent[i] = find(parent[i])`\n  `return parent[i]`\n\n`def union(i, j):`\n  `root_i = find(i)`\n  `root_j = find(j)`\n  `if root_i != root_j:`\n    `if comp_size[root_i] < comp_size[root_j]:`\n      `root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i`\n    `parent[root_j] = root_i`\n    `comp_size[root_i] += comp_size[root_j]`\n    `return True`\n  `return False`\n\n`removed_nodes = []`\n`is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`\n`current_num_components = n`\n`current_num_nodes = n`\n\nThe crucial insight is that the `n-k` remaining nodes must form a connected component. This implies that if we remove `k` nodes, the remaining `n-k` nodes must still be connected.\nThis means that the `k` removed nodes must not be \"critical\" for the connectivity of the remaining `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's process the nodes from `n` down to `1`.\nWhen we consider node `i`:\nWe want to keep `i` if possible, because `2^i` is large.\nWe use a DSU on all nodes.\nWe maintain a count of \"active\" nodes.\n`active = [False] * (n + 1)`\n`num_active = 0`\n`num_active_components = 0`\n\n`removed_count = 0`\n`removed_list = []`\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  `active[i] = True`\n  `num_active += 1`\n  `num_active_components += 1` // This node is a new component\n  \n  For `neighbor` in `adj[i]`:\n    If `active[neighbor]`: // If neighbor is already processed and active\n      If `union(i, neighbor)`: // If they were in different components\n        `num_active_components -= 1`\n  \n  // Now, `i` is active. We have `num_active` nodes.\n  // If `num_active_components == 1` (all active nodes form one component)\n  // AND `num_active == n - k` (we have exactly `n-k` nodes)\n  // Then we have found our set of `n-k` nodes.\n  // The nodes that are not `active` are the `k` nodes to remove.\n  // This would mean `removed_count` is exactly `k`.\n  // However, this approach doesn't guarantee `k` removals. It stops when `n-k` nodes are connected.\n  // The nodes `1...i-1` would be implicitly removed.\n\nThis is a standard problem type solvable with the following strategy:\n1. Initialize a DSU structure for all `n` nodes.\n2. Maintain `is_removed` array (boolean) for each node.\n3. Maintain `num_remaining_nodes = n` and `num_components = n`.\n4. We want to remove `k` nodes. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\n5. For each `i`, we check if it can be removed.\n   A node `i` can be removed if removing it does not disconnect the graph of *remaining* nodes *such that the final count of remaining nodes is `n-k` and they form a single component*.\n   This is tricky.\n\nLet's try a different perspective:\nWe want to find the minimal `m` such that if we keep all nodes `m, m+1, ..., n`, they form a connected component.\nIf this set has size `n - m + 1`, and `n - m + 1 >= n - k`, then we can remove `1, ..., m-1` and `n - k - (n - m + 1)` other nodes from `m, ..., n`. This is not quite right.\n\nThe problem is essentially asking for a connected subgraph of size `N-K` with maximum sum of `2^i`.\nThis means we want to keep the largest possible node indices.\nLet's try to find the smallest node index `x` that must be included in the final connected component.\nAll nodes `x, x+1, ..., n` are candidates to be in the component.\nAll nodes `1, ..., x-1` are candidates to be removed.\nThe final component will be a subset of `{x, ..., n}`.\n\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe add them one by one to a set `P`.\n`P` starts empty.\n`removed_nodes = []`\n`num_nodes_to_keep = n - k`\n\n`parent = list(range(n + 1))`\n`comp_size = [0] * (n + 1)` // 0 for nodes not yet considered active\n`num_active_components = 0`\n`num_active_nodes = 0`\n\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  `comp_size[i] = 1` // This node is now active and its own component\n  `num_active_nodes += 1`\n  `num_active_components += 1`\n  \n  For `neighbor` in `adj[i]`:\n    If `comp_size[neighbor] > 0`: // If neighbor is already active\n      If `union(i, neighbor)`: // If they were in different components\n        `num_active_components -= 1`\n  \n  // At this point, `i` has been added.\n  // We have `num_active_nodes` nodes, forming `num_active_components` components.\n  // If `num_active_components == 1`:\n  //   All currently active nodes form a single connected component.\n  //   If `num_active_nodes == num_nodes_to_keep`:\n  //     We have found our solution. The active nodes are the ones to keep.\n  //     The nodes `1, ..., i-1` (which are not yet active) are the ones to remove.\n  //     This gives `i-1` removed nodes.\n  //     We need to remove `k` nodes. So `i-1` must be `k`.\n  //     If `i-1 == k`, then we remove `1, ..., k`.\n  //     This means the set `{k+1, ..., n}` is connected.\n  //     This is the ideal case.\n\n  // What if `num_active_components > 1`?\n  // It means that `i` is not connected to any previously active node, or `i` connected two previously active components, but there are still other components.\n  // We cannot stop here. We must continue adding smaller nodes.\n  \n  // What if `num_active_components == 1` but `num_active_nodes < num_nodes_to_keep`?\n  // This means we have a connected component, but it's too small. We need to add more nodes.\n  // We continue adding `i-1, i-2, ...`\n  \n  // The problem is that we need to remove EXACTLY `k` nodes.\n  // The nodes we are *not* adding to `active` are implicitly removed.\n  // If `num_active_components > 1`: We must add more nodes to connect them.\n  // If `num_active_components == 1`: We have a candidate connected component.\n  //   Its size is `num_active_nodes`.\n  //   The number of implicitly removed nodes is `n - num_active_nodes`.\n  //   If `n - num_active_nodes == k`: We are done. The `n - num_active_nodes` nodes are `1, ..., i-1`.\n  //   If `n - num_active_nodes < k`: We have removed too few nodes. We need to remove more.\n  //     But we are trying to keep the largest indices. So if we have a connected component of size `num_active_nodes`\n  //     and `num_active_nodes > n-k`, we have too many nodes.\n  //     This means we need to remove some of the `active` nodes.\n  //     Which active nodes to remove? The ones with the smallest indices.\n  //     So we remove `i` if `num_active_nodes > n-k`.\n\nLet's refine the greedy strategy based on the optimal substructure.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. Let `S_kept` be this set.\nTo maximize sum of `2^i`, `S_kept` should contain `n, n-1, ...,` as much as possible.\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWe *tentatively* add `i` to `S_kept`.\nWe use a DSU to track connected components of `S_kept`.\n`parent = list(range(n + 1))`\n`sz = [0] * (n + 1)` // `sz[i]` is 0 if `i` is not in `S_kept`\n`num_kept_nodes = 0`\n`num_components = 0`\n`removed_count = 0`\n`removed_list = []`\n\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  // Consider node `i`.\n  // If we have already removed `k` nodes, we MUST keep `i` and all remaining `j < i`.\n  // This implies that `i` and `j < i` will be part of `S_kept`.\n  // This is not quite right.

This is the ideal.\n  //     This case happens if `{k+1, ..., n}` forms a connected component.\n  //     Example: `n=6, k=3`. We need `n-k=3` nodes.\n  //     `i=6`: kept. `num_kept=1, num_comp=1`.\n  //     `i=5`: kept. Connects to 6. `num_kept=2, num_comp=1`.\n  //     `i=4`: kept. Connects to 6. `num_kept=3, num_comp=1`.\n  //     Now `num_kept=3 == n-k`. `num_comp=1`. We stop.\n  //     The kept nodes are `4,5,6`. Removed are `1,2,3`. These are `k` nodes.\n\n  // What if `num_components > 1`?\n  //   This means `i` connected to some nodes, but there are still multiple components.\n  //   We MUST keep `i` to try and connect them.\n  //   So we always keep `i` if `num_components > 1`.\n  //   This ensures we eventually get `num_components == 1`.\n  \n  // What if `num_components == 1` and `num_kept_nodes > n - k`?\n  //   This means we have too many nodes, but they are already connected.\n  //   So we can remove `i` (because it's the smallest among the current `num_kept_nodes` that we are considering removing).\n  //   We remove `i`.\n  //   `removed_count += 1`.\n  //   `removed_list.append(i)`.\n  //   We need to revert `i` from `S_kept`.\n  //   This means `sz[i]` becomes 0. `num_kept_nodes` decreases.\n  //   But removing `i` might disconnect `S_kept`!\n  //   This is the hard part. Checking if `i` is a cut vertex in `S_kept` is expensive.\n\nThis is a variant of \"remove `k` edges to maximize value\" or \"remove `k` nodes to maximize value\".\nThe constraint \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\" is key.\nIt means the induced subgraph must be connected.\n\nThe standard approach for this kind of problem is:\n1. Initialize `removed_count = 0`, `removed_list = []`.\n2. Initialize a DSU for all `n` nodes. Each node `i` is its own component.\n3. For `i = 1` to `n`:\n   If `i` is already marked as removed, skip.\n   If `removed_count == k`, break.\n   \n   Consider temporarily removing `i`.\n   If `i` has degree `1` in the *current* graph (excluding already removed nodes), and `num_remaining_nodes - 1 >= n-k`, we can remove `i`.\n   This is because removing a leaf node doesn't disconnect the graph.\n   \nThis is also not quite right. The \"current graph\" changes.\n\nLet's use the actual solution strategy for this problem, which is a common trick for tree problems with connectivity and value maximization/minimization:\n1. We want to remove `k` nodes. To minimize `sum(2^i)`, we want to remove nodes with smallest indices.\n2. We can try to remove nodes `1, 2, ..., n` in increasing order.\n3. When considering node `i`, we remove it if:\n   a. We still need to remove nodes (`removed_count < k`).\n   b. Removing `i` does not disconnect the *final* set of `n-k` nodes.\n   \n   How to check (b)?\n   Consider the state where we have already decided to remove `removed_count` nodes, and `i` is the current node we are considering.\n   If we remove `i`, then `num_remaining_nodes` becomes `n - removed_count - 1`.\n   If `num_remaining_nodes - 1 < n - k`, we cannot remove `i` because we would end up with fewer than `n-k` nodes. So we must keep `i`.\n   If `num_remaining_nodes - 1 >= n - k`, we *could* remove `i`.\n   \n   The problem is to determine if `i` is a cut vertex *among the `n - removed_count` nodes that are currently active*.\n   This is equivalent to checking if `i` is a bridge for any of its incident edges, *if we consider only edges between active nodes*.\n   \n   A simpler check:\n   If `i` is a leaf node in the *original* tree, it can always be removed (if `removed_count < k` and `n-1 >= n-k`).\n   This is because removing a leaf cannot disconnect the graph.\n   This is not true if `n-k = 1`. If `n-k=1`, we must keep one node. If `i` is that node, we can't remove it.\n\nThe actual solution involves processing nodes in a specific order and using a DSU.\nLet `removed_cnt = 0`.\n`removed_list = []`.\n`active = [True] * (n + 1)` // `active[i]` is True if node `i` is currently considered part of the component.\n`num_active = n`\n\nDSU: `parent = list(range(n + 1))`, `comp_size = [1] * (n + 1)`.\n`num_components = n`.\n\n`def find(i):`\n  `if parent[i] == i: return i`\n  `parent[i] = find(parent[i])`\n  `return parent[i]`\n\n`def union(i, j):`\n  `root_i = find(i)`\n  `root_j = find(j)`\n  `if root_i != root_j:`\n    `if comp_size[root_i] < comp_size[root_j]: root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i`\n    `parent[root_j] = root_i`\n    `comp_size[root_i] += comp_size[root_j]`\n    `return True`\n  `return False`\n\nThe trick is to iterate from `n` down to `1`.\nWhen we consider node `i`:\nWe want to keep `i` if possible.\nWe add `i` to the current set of nodes we are considering.\nIf `num_active` (nodes currently in the DSU, which are `i` and all `j > i` that were added) is `n-k`, and they form a single component, then we are done. The remaining nodes `1, ..., i-1` are removed.\nThis is the approach I tried before. It's correct.\n\nLet's re-simulate the second sample: `n=8, k=4`.

Because `i` is the smallest-indexed node among the currently `active` nodes that could be removed to reduce `num_active_nodes`. If we don't remove `i`, we would have to remove some `j > i` later, which is worse for the sum.\nWhen we remove `i`, `num_active_components` might increase.\nBut we are only interested in the state where `num_active_components == 1` and `num_active_nodes == n-k`.\nIf removing `i` breaks the component, then `num_active_components` will become `>1`.

Stop.\n     // Output: `3 4 5 6`. This is NOT the example output `1 3 4 5`.\n\nMy peeling algorithm is incorrect for the second example.\nThe example output `1 3 4 5` implies that `1` was removed, but `1` has degree 2 initially.\nMy algorithm only removes nodes with current degree 1.\n\nThe issue is that `current_degree[u] == 1` check.\nWhen `u` is popped from heap, its `current_degree[u]` might be > 1.\nFor example, if `1` was pushed to the heap because its degree became 1, but then `3` was removed and `1`'s degree became 1.\nNo, the `current_degree[u]` is correct when it's pushed.\nIf `u` is popped, and `current_degree[u]` is not 1, it means `u` was a leaf when added to the heap, but its only neighbor was also removed *before* `u` was processed. This would make `current_degree[u]` become 0.\nSo `current_degree[u] == 1` is correct.\n\nThe example `1 3 4 5` for `n=8, k=4` implies that node `1` (degree 2) was removed before node `6` (degree 1).\nThis means the simple \"remove leaves\" strategy is not sufficient.\nThe strategy must be: keep the `n-k` nodes with largest indices that form a connected component.\n\nThis means the \"iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`\" strategy is probably correct.\nLet's trace it again for `n=8, k=4`. Need to keep 4 nodes.\n`adj` and `degree` as before.\n`is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`\n`removed_list = []`\n`num_kept_nodes = 0`\n\nDSU: `parent = list(range(n + 1))`, `comp_size = [0] * (n + 1)` (0 means not active/kept)\n`num_components = 0` // number of components among `is_kept` nodes.\n\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  `is_kept[i] = True`\n  `comp_size[i] = 1`\n  `num_kept_nodes += 1`\n  `num_components += 1`\n  \n  For `neighbor` in `adj[i]`:\n    If `is_kept[neighbor]`: // If neighbor is already kept\n      If `union(i, neighbor)`:\n        `num_components -= 1`\n  \n  // After adding `i` to `is_kept` and updating DSU:\n  // If `num_components == 1` (all currently kept nodes form one component)\n  // AND `num_kept_nodes > n - k` (we have too many nodes):\n  //   We must remove one node from the `is_kept` set to reduce its size.\n  //   To maximize fan sum, we remove the smallest-indexed node.\n  //   The smallest-indexed node among `is_kept` nodes is `i`.\n  //   So, we remove `i`.\n  //   `removed_list.append(i)`.\n  //   `is_kept[i] = False`.\n  //   `comp_size[i] = 0`. // Mark `i` as not kept.\n  //   `num_kept_nodes -= 1`.\n  //   // DSU for `i` is now invalid. `num_components` might increase.\n  //   // We can't easily revert DSU.\n  //   // This means the `num_components` and `num_kept_nodes` for `i` are not actual.\n\nThe problem is that `num_components` can only decrease with `union`. If we remove `i`, it might split a component, making `num_components` increase.\nWe need a DSU that supports removal or a way to re-calculate `num_components` quickly.\nA DSU on `n` elements with `n-k` components remaining.\n\nThe \"peeling\" algorithm works correctly if `n-k` is the size of a subtree.\nBut here, it's any connected component.\n\nLet's rethink the greedy choice.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes, minimizing `sum(2^i)`.\nThis means we want to remove the smallest indices *if possible*.\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nFor each `i`, we try to remove it.\nWe can remove `i` if `removed_count < k` AND `num_nodes_to_keep > n-k`.\nThe crucial condition is that removing `i` must not disconnect the *final* set of `n-k` nodes.\n\nThe correct solution for this problem is indeed the \"peeling\" algorithm, but it needs to be applied in a specific way.\nThe total number of nodes to keep is `n-k`.\nThe number of nodes to remove is `k`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes with smallest indices.\nThe nodes that are part of the final connected component of size `n-k` cannot be removed.\nThe nodes that are *not* part of this component *must* be removed.\n\nThe algorithm that passes is:\n1. Build adjacency list `adj` and `degree` array for all nodes.\n2. `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n3. `removed_list = []`.\n4. `num_kept_nodes = n`.\n\n5. `q = collections.deque()`.\n   For `i = 1` to `n`:\n     If `degree[i] == 1`: // Initial leaves\n       `q.append(i)`\n\n6. While `q` and `num_kept_nodes > n - k`:\n   `u = q.popleft()`\n   \n   If `is_removed[u]`: continue\n   \n   `is_removed[u] = True`\n   `removed_list.append(u)`\n   `num_kept_nodes -= 1`\n   \n   For `v` in `adj[u]`:\n     If not `is_removed[v]`:\n       `degree[v] -= 1`\n       If `degree[v] == 1`:\n         `q.append(v)`\n\n7. Sort `removed_list` and print.\n\nLet's re-trace Example 2 (`n=8, k=4`) with this algorithm:\nDegrees: 1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:3, 8:1\n`num_kept_nodes = 8`. Target `n-k = 4`.\nInitial `q`: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 8]` (all nodes with degree 1).\n\nWhile `q` is not empty and `num_kept_nodes > 4`:\n1. `u = 3`. `is_removed[3]=T`. `removed_list=[3]`. `num_kept_nodes=7`.\n   Neighbor of 3: 1. `is_removed[1]=F`. `degree[1]=1`. `q.append(1)`.\n   `q`: `[4, 5, 6, 8, 1]`\n2. `u = 4`. `is_removed[4]=T`. `removed_list=[3,4]`. `num_kept_nodes=6`.\n   Neighbor of 4: 2. `is_removed[2]=F`. `degree[2]=3`.\n   `q`: `[5, 6, 8, 1]`\n3. `u = 5`. `is_removed[5]=T`. `removed_list=[3,4,5]`. `num_kept_nodes=5`.\n   Neighbor of 5: 7. `is_removed[7]=F`. `degree[7]=2`.\n   `q`: `[6, 8, 1]`\n4. `u = 6`. `is_removed[6]=T`. `removed_list=[3,4,5,6]`. `num_kept_nodes=4`.\n   Neighbor of 6: 2. `is_removed[2]=F`. `degree[2]=2`.\n   `num_kept_nodes` is 4. Loop terminates.\n   `removed_list = [3, 4, 5, 6]`. Sorted: `3 4 5 6`.\n\nThis still gives `3 4 5 6`, not `1 3 4 5`.\nThe example output `1 3 4 5` implies that `1` (degree 2) was removed, and `6` (degree 1) was kept.\nThis means the \"remove leaves first\" strategy is incorrect.\nThe problem is `2^i` values. `2^1` is smaller than `2^6`.\nSo removing `1` is preferred over removing `6`.\nMy algorithm removed `6` because it was a leaf. It kept `1` because `1` was not a leaf.\nThis means the \"peeling\" algorithm is *not* the solution.\n\nThe solution must involve iterating from `n` down to `1` and making decisions.\nThe `num_components == 1` and `num_active_nodes > n - k` logic must be right.\nThe issue is the DSU not supporting removal.\nWhat if we use a DSU on the *removed* nodes? No.\n\nThe only way to make `num_components` increase after removing `i` is if `i` was a bridge.\nIf `i` is removed, and it was connecting two components `C1` and `C2`, then `C1` and `C2` become separate components.\nThe `num_components` would increase.\nWe cannot simply remove `i` if `num_active_components == 1` and `num_active_nodes > n-k`.\nWe can only remove `i` if `num_active_nodes - 1 >= n - k` AND if removing `i` does not cause `num_active_components` to become `> 1` when the final `n-k` nodes are selected.\n\nThis is a specific type of problem where the node values `2^i` are so dominant that we essentially want to keep `n, n-1, ..., n-k+1` if possible.\nThis means we want to keep `n-k` nodes, and these nodes should be the `n-k` largest indices if they form a connected component.\nIf `{k+1, ..., n}` is connected, then we remove `1, ..., k`.\nIf not, then some `j <= k` must be kept to connect `{k+1, ..., n}`.\nThis means we must remove some `i > k` instead of `j`.\nTo minimize sum of removed, we want to remove the largest possible `i` and keep the smallest possible `j`.\n\nThis is the exact logic for the `n` down to `1` approach with DSU.\nLet's try to fix the DSU removal issue.\nWe don't actually need to \"remove\" `i` from the DSU.\nWhen `num_components == 1` and `num_active_nodes > n - k`, we mark `i` as `is_removed`.\n`removed_list.append(i)`.\n`active[i] = False`.\n`num_active_nodes -= 1`.\nThe `num_components` value in the DSU is for the *currently active* nodes.\nIf `i` is removed, `num_active_components` might change.\nWe can't just decrement `num_active_components` when `union` happens, and then assume it's correct after removal.\n\nThe number of connected components in the graph of active nodes can be found by iterating through all `active` nodes and counting unique `find(node)` values. This is too slow.\n\nThe key must be simpler.\nThe problem is that the \"peeling\" algorithm removes leaves. If `1` is not a leaf but `6` is, `6` gets removed. But `2^1 < 2^6`. So removing `1` is better.\nThis means we should remove `1` even if it's not a leaf, if it helps connect the higher-indexed nodes.\n\nThe correct algorithm is the one that processes nodes from `n` down to `1`.\n`is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`\n`removed_count = 0`\n`removed_list = []`\n\nDSU: `parent = list(range(n + 1))`, `comp_size = [1] * (n + 1)`\n`num_components = n` // This DSU always refers to ALL nodes, not just kept.\n\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  // If `i` is not yet removed and we still need to remove nodes.\n  If `removed_count < k`:\n    // Consider removing `i`.\n    // If `i` is a candidate for removal.\n    // If `i` is not a leaf in the original graph (degree > 1), or `i` is a leaf but its removal would disconnect the graph...\n    // This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's simplify.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nThe final `n-k` nodes must form one connected component.\nThis means the `k` removed nodes must not form a cut set that splits the `n-k` nodes.\n\nThe problem \"The Number Games\" is a well-known competitive programming problem. The solution involves the `n` down to `1` DSU strategy, but needs to be careful about the `num_components` update.\nThe `num_components` variable should track the number of components among the *currently active* nodes.\nWhen `i` is removed, its contribution to `num_components` is removed.\nIf `i` was a cut vertex, then its removal splits one component into multiple.\n\nThe `num_active_components` should be tracked as:\n`num_active_components = 0`\n`active_roots = set()`\nFor `j = n` down to `1`:\n  If `active[j]`: `active_roots.add(find(j))`\n`num_active_components = len(active_roots)`\nThis is too slow if done repeatedly.\n\nThe standard way to handle DSU with removals is to use a \"rollback\" DSU or similar.\nBut `N=10^6` means `O(N log N)` or `O(N alpha N)`.\n\nThe actual solution for this problem is the peeling algorithm. The example output is misleading or there's a specific interpretation.\nThe peeling algorithm:\n1. Initialize `current_degree` for all nodes.\n2. Initialize `is_removed` to false.\n3. `removed_count = 0`.\n4. `q` (a min-priority queue) contains all nodes `i` with `current_degree[i] == 1`.\n5. While `removed_count < k` and `q` is not empty:\n   `u = heapq.heappop(q)`.\n   If `is_removed[u]`: continue.\n   \n   `is_removed[u] = True`.\n   `removed_count += 1`.\n   `removed_list.append(u)`.\n   \n   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n     If not `is_removed[v]`:\n       `current_degree[v] -= 1`.\n       If `current_degree[v] == 1`:\n         `heapq.heappush(q, v)`.\n6. Sort `removed_list` and print.\n\nLet's re-check Example 2 with this: `n=8, k=4`.\nDegrees: 1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:3, 8:1\n`is_removed = [F]*9`. `removed_count = 0`. `removed_list = []`.\n`q = [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]` (min-heap).\n\n1. `u = 3`. `is_removed[3]=T`. `removed_count=1`. `removed_list=[3]`.\n   Neighbor of 3: 1. `is_removed[1]=F`. `current_degree[1]=1`. `heapq.heappush(q, 1)`.\n   `q = [1, 4, 5, 6, 8]`\n2. `u = 1`. `is_removed[1]=T`. `removed_count=2`. `removed_list=[3,1]`.\n   Neighbor of 1: 2. `is_removed[2]=F`. `current_degree[2]=3`.\n   Neighbor of 1: 3. `is_removed[3]=T`. Skip.\n   `q = [4, 5, 6, 8]`\n3. `u = 4`. `is_removed[4]=T`. `removed_count=3`. `removed_list=[3,1,4]`.\n   Neighbor of 4: 2. `is_removed[2]=F`. `current_degree[2]=2`. `heapq.heappush(q, 2)`.\n   `q = [2, 5, 6, 8]`\n4. `u = 5`. `is_removed[5]=T`. `removed_count=4`. `removed_list=[3,1,4,5]`.\n   Neighbor of 5: 7. `is_removed[7]=F`. `current_degree[7]=2`.\n   `removed_count` is 4, which is `k`. Stop.\n   `removed_list = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Sorted: `1 3 4 5`.\nThis matches the example output!\n\nSo the peeling algorithm is correct. The previous trace mistake was in not updating `current_degree` for neighbors and not pushing new leaves to the queue. The key is that the min-heap ensures we always remove the smallest-indexed available leaf.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    current_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        current_degree[u] += 1\n        current_degree[v] += 1\n\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    removed_list = []\n    \n    # Min-priority queue to store leaves (nodes with degree 1)\n    # We push nodes with degree 1 to the heap.\n    # When popping, we always get the smallest-indexed leaf.\n    min_heap = []\n\n    # Initialize the heap with all initial leaves\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # For a tree with N > 1, degree 0 is not possible.\n        # If N=1, k must be 0, but k >= 1.\n        # So degree will be >= 1 for all nodes.\n        if current_degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, i)\n            # Mark as tentatively removed.
