Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This Boot Problem!**\n\nOkay, I've got the \"Colored Boots\" problem in mind, and I need a Python script to crack it.  First, let's nail down what we're dealing with. We have *n* left boots and *n* right boots, and each boot has a color, a lowercase letter or a question mark.  Compatibility is simple: identical colors match, and a '?' matches anything. The goal is to maximize compatible pairs and output the count and indices.\n\nThe input's clear: *n*, the length of the strings *l* and *r* (left and right boot colors).  The output will be the number of pairs (*k*) and the pairs themselves.\n\nMy initial thought is to store the indices of each color.  A list of lists or even queues for each color seems like a good approach. Let's create `left_indices` and `right_indices`.  We can store the indices for each character from both boot sets. For example, if we have a string \"codeforces\", the `left_indices` dictionary would store each color and the list of positions.\n\nSince we want to *maximize* the number of pairs, it screams \"greedy\" approach.  I'm thinking we should prioritize the most *restrictive* matches first.  Matching specific colors (like 'a' with 'a') is more restrictive than matching a specific color with a '?'. A '?' is super flexible.\n\nSo, here's my greedy strategy. First, match all the identical specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a'). Second, match specific colors with question marks. Third, match any remaining question marks with each other. This should be efficient.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through each specific character. It seems the best plan is to prioritize Step 1.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. We also need to output the indices of the boots forming these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should use a greedy approach. The core idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, thus saving the more flexible '?' boots for situations where they are most needed.\n\nHere's the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** First, parse the input strings `l` and `r` to store the 1-based indices of boots for each color. We can use lists (or deques for efficient popping from the left) for each color, including '?'.\n    `left_boots[color]` will be a list of indices of left boots with `color`.\n    `right_boots[color]` will be a list of indices of right boots with `color`.\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors to Identical Specific Colors:**\n    Iterate through all specific colors from 'a' to 'z'. For each color `c`:\n    While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`, form a pair. Take one left boot index and one right boot index, add them to our `result_pairs`, and remove them from their respective lists. This is the most restrictive type of match, so we should do it first.\n\n3.  **Match Specific Colors to '?' Boots:**\n    After step 2, any remaining specific-colored boots (`c`) cannot be matched with another `c`-colored boot. They can only be matched with '?' boots.\n    Iterate through all specific colors from 'a' to 'z' again. For each color `c`:\n    a.  While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of '?' color, form a pair. Take one left boot index and one '?' right boot index, add them to `result_pairs`, and remove them from their lists.\n    b.  While there are available right boots of color `c` AND available left boots of '?' color, form a pair. Take one '?' left boot index and one right boot index, add them to `result_pairs`, and remove them from their lists.\n    This step handles specific colors matching '?' boots. It doesn't matter which specific color matches which '?' because '?' is compatible with all specific colors. The order of iterating 'a' through 'z' doesn't affect the total count, just which specific boot gets paired.\n\n4.  **Match '?' Boots to '?' Boots:**\n    Finally, after steps 2 and 3, any remaining '?' left boots and '?' right boots can be paired together.\n    While there are available left boots of '?' color AND available right boots of '?' color, form a pair. Take one '?' left boot index and one '?' right boot index, add them to `result_pairs`, and remove them from their lists.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Data Structures:** Using `collections.defaultdict(list)` is convenient for storing boot indices. We can then use `pop()` on these lists to get indices and effectively remove them.\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of boots `n` can be up to 150,000.\n    *   Populating the index lists takes `O(n)` time.\n    *   Step 2 iterates 26 times. Inside the loop, `pop()` operations take `O(1)` amortized time. The total number of `pop()` operations across all specific colors is at most `n`. So, `O(n)`.\n    *   Step 3 also iterates 26 times. Similar to step 2, the total number of `pop()` operations is at most `2n`. So, `O(n)`.\n    *   Step 4 involves `pop()` operations on the '?' lists, at most `n` times. So, `O(n)`.\n    *   Overall time complexity: `O(n)`.\n    *   Space complexity: `O(n)` to store the indices and the resulting pairs.\n\nThis approach correctly maximizes the number of pairs because it prioritizes using specific-colored boots with identical specific-colored boots first, which cannot be matched by '?' boots. Then, it uses '?' boots to match specific-colored boots that couldn't find an identical partner. Finally, any remaining '?' boots are paired with each other. This ensures that '?' boots are only used when strictly necessary or when no other option exists, thus not \"wasting\" their flexibility.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-based indices for each color\n    left_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    result_pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors to identical specific colors\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[char] and right_boots[char]:\n            result_pairs.append((left_boots[char].pop(), right_boots[char].pop()))\n\n    # Step 2: Match specific colors to '?' boots\n    # Left specific, Right '?'\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[char] and right_boots['?']:\n            result_pairs.append((left_boots[char].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n\n    # Left '?', Right specific\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots['?'] and right_boots[char]:\n            result_pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots[char].pop()))\n\n    # Step 3: Match '?' boots to '?' boots\n    while left_boots['?'] and right_boots['?']:\n        result_pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n\n    # Output the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(result_pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for pair in result_pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
