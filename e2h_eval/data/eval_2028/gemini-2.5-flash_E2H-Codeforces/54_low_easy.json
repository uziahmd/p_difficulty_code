Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Competitive Programming Angle Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to find three vertices of a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a target angle 'a'. It's all about geometric relationships here, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that all the vertices sit on a circumcircle. That's key. Angles formed by these vertices are inscribed angles, and those angles are directly related to the arcs they subtend. Since the polygon is regular, the central angle between any two adjacent vertices is a clean `360/n` degrees. Any inscribed angle will be half that arc, so `k * 180 / n`, where k is the number of sides defining the arc.\n\nThe trick is figuring out how to efficiently generate and compare these angles. I'll probably fix one vertex, let's say vertex `2` (without loss of generality, and re-indexing later will be easy if needed).  Then I need to find the other two. The important thing here is to calculate the arc *not* containing the fixed vertex.  Letting `v1` be `i` and `v3` be `j`, the arc *not* containing `v2` is  `(j - i) mod n`.\n\nEssentially, I need to iterate through possible pairs `(i, j)` and compute the angle for each pair.  Then, I'll compare those angles with the target angle 'a' and keep track of the closest one.  That difference, the number of sides, needs to be calculated. The problem simplifies to iterating through a specific combination of points and checking the angle formed by them using the formula I've worked out here. I think I'm ready to code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices.\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices of the polygon is an inscribed angle in this circumcircle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nIn a regular `n`-gon, the central angle subtended by each side is `360/n` degrees. Therefore, an arc formed by `k` sides (or `k` edges) subtends a central angle of `k * (360/n)` degrees. An inscribed angle subtending such an arc will have a measure of `(1/2) * k * (360/n)` degrees, which simplifies to `k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nThe number of sides `k` must be an integer. For three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3`, the arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`) must consist of at least one side. The maximum number of sides on such an arc is `n-2` (if `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2`, the arc `v1v3` would be `n-2` sides long).\nSo, `k` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angle values are `1 * (180/n)`, `2 * (180/n)`, ..., `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\nLet's fix the vertex `v2`. We can choose `v2 = 2` (using 1-based indexing).\nThen `v1` and `v3` must be other vertices.\nWe can choose `v1 = 1`.\nNow, `v3` can be any vertex from `3` to `n`.\nIf `v1 = 1`, `v2 = 2`, and `v3 = i` (where `i` ranges from `3` to `n`), the angle `1-2-i` subtends an arc from vertex `1` to vertex `i` that does not contain vertex `2`.\nThe number of sides on this arc is `i - 1 - 1 = i - 2`.\nFor example:\n- If `v3 = 3`, `k = 3 - 2 = 1`. Angle is `1 * (180/n)`. Vertices `1, 2, 3`.\n- If `v3 = 4`, `k = 4 - 2 = 2`. Angle is `2 * (180/n)`. Vertices `1, 2, 4`.\n- ...\n- If `v3 = n`, `k = n - 2`. Angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`. Vertices `1, 2, n`.\n\nSo, by fixing `v2=2` and `v1=1`, we can generate all possible angles `k * (180/n)` for `k` from `1` to `n-2` by choosing `v3 = k+2`.\n\nOur goal is to find `k` (from `1` to `n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nWe can iterate through all possible values of `k` from `1` to `n-2`, calculate the angle `current_angle = k * (180/n)`, and compare `|current_angle - a|` with the minimum difference found so far.\n\nLet `min_diff` be initialized to a very large value, and `best_k` be initialized to a dummy value.\nFor `k` from `1` to `n-2`:\n  `current_angle = k * 180 / n`\n  `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`\n  If `diff < min_diff`:\n    `min_diff = diff`\n    `best_k = k`\n\nAfter iterating, the optimal angle is `best_k * (180/n)`. The vertices forming this angle would be `v1=1`, `v2=2`, and `v3=best_k+2`.\n\nLet's test this with the examples:\n1. `n=3, a=15`\n   Possible `k` values: `1` to `3-2=1`. So, only `k=1`.\n   `current_angle = 1 * 180 / 3 = 60`.\n   `diff = abs(60 - 15) = 45`.\n   `best_k = 1`.\n   Output: `1 2 1+2` -> `1 2 3`. Correct.\n\n2. `n=4, a=67`\n   Possible `k` values: `1` to `4-2=2`.\n   For `k=1`: `current_angle = 1 * 180 / 4 = 45`. `diff = abs(45 - 67) = 22`. `min_diff = 22`, `best_k = 1`.\n   For `k=2`: `current_angle = 2 * 180 / 4 = 90`. `diff = abs(90 - 67) = 23`.\n   Since `22 < 23`, `best_k` remains `1`.\n   Output: `1 2 1+2` -> `1 2 3`. The example output is `2 1 3`. This is also a valid set of vertices for an angle of 45 degrees. The angle `2-1-3` subtends an arc of 1 side (`2-3`). So it's `1 * (180/4) = 45`. Our choice `1 2 3` also forms `1 * (180/4) = 45`. Any valid set of vertices is accepted.\n\n3. `n=4, a=68`\n   Possible `k` values: `1` to `4-2=2`.\n   For `k=1`: `current_angle = 1 * 180 / 4 = 45`. `diff = abs(45 - 68) = 23`. `min_diff = 23`, `best_k = 1`.\n   For `k=2`: `current_angle = 2 * 180 / 4 = 90`. `diff = abs(90 - 68) = 22`.\n   Since `22 < 23`, `min_diff` becomes `22`, `best_k` becomes `2`.\n   Output: `1 2 2+2` -> `1 2 4`. The example output is `4 1 2`. This is also a valid set of vertices for an angle of 90 degrees. The angle `4-1-2` subtends an arc of 2 sides (`4-3-2`). So it's `2 * (180/4) = 90`. Our choice `1 2 4` also forms `2 * (180/4) = 90`. Any valid set of vertices is accepted.\n\nThe approach is correct. The time complexity will be `O(n)` because we iterate `n-2` times. Given `n <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # Iterate through all possible number of sides 'k' that the angle can subtend.\n    # 'k' ranges from 1 to n-2.\n    # An angle subtending 'k' sides has measure k * (180/n) degrees.\n    for k in range(1, n - 1): # k goes from 1 to n-2 inclusive\n        current_angle = k * 180 / n\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        # If diff is equal, we can take any.
