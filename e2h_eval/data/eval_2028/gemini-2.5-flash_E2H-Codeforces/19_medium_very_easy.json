The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan:** I'm tackling this competitive programming problem by thinking strategically about which nodes to *keep* versus which ones to *remove*. The key is maximizing the sum of `2^i` for the kept nodes, which, due to the exponential growth, boils down to prioritizing nodes with higher indices. The connectivity constraint is the real challenge.\n\nI'm starting by recognizing that I want to build a connected component of size `n - k`. A greedy approach suggests keeping the largest index, `n`, and then working downwards.  The problem is making sure the resulting set remains connected. So I decided to try a Dijkstra-like approach while using a priority queue.\n\nInitially, I add the node `n` to a kept set. Then, I iteratively find nodes to add to this set. At each step I consider the neighbours of the current set, adding the one with the highest index. \nI have a state for the node.\n- NOT_VISITED, is initialized for all the nodes\n- IN_PQ. Indicates that the neighbour has been found.\n- KEPT, for nodes added to the kept set.\n\nI keep doing this until I have the required number of nodes, `n - k`.  After that, any nodes that aren't marked as \"kept\" are removed. The connectivity is inherently ensured by the iterative neighbour approach. I'll need to sort and output the removed nodes. It's a classic greedy technique that feels pretty sound for a tree problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts such that they form a connected component in the given tree, and the total number of fans (sum of `2^i` for selected district `i`) is maximized. We need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that the number of fans `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i`. This means that to maximize the total fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. For example, `2^5` is greater than `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4`. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to include the largest possible indices in our connected component of `n-k` districts.\n\nThis leads to a greedy approach:\n1. We must select `N_keep = n - k` districts.\n2. We definitely want to include district `n` (the one with the largest index).\n3. From `n`, we expand our connected component by repeatedly adding the available district with the largest index that is adjacent to any currently selected district. This ensures that the component remains connected and we always pick the highest-indexed available node.\n\nWe can implement this using a max-priority queue (or a min-priority queue storing negative values) to keep track of candidate districts to add.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[u]` stores all districts connected to `u`.\n2.  **Initialize Data Structures:**\n    *   `node_state`: An array of size `n+1` to keep track of the state of each node.\n        *   `0`: Not visited/considered yet (`NOT_VISITED`).\n        *   `1`: In the priority queue, candidate to be added (`IN_PQ`).\n        *   `2`: Already selected and part of the connected component (`KEPT`).\n    *   `pq`: A min-priority queue (Python's `heapq`) to store `(-node_idx, node_idx)` pairs. Storing negative `node_idx` effectively makes it a max-priority queue based on `node_idx`.\n    *   `num_kept`: Counter for the number of districts currently selected.\n3.  **Start with District `n`:**\n    *   Set `node_state[n] = 2` (KEPT).\n    *   Increment `num_kept` to `1`.\n    *   For each neighbor `v` of `n`:\n        *   If `node_state[v]` is `0` (NOT\\_VISITED), add `(-v, v)` to `pq` and set `node_state[v] = 1` (IN\\_PQ).\n4.  **Greedy Expansion:**\n    *   While `num_kept < n - k` and `pq` is not empty:\n        *   Pop the district `current_node_idx` with the largest index from `pq` (i.e., `(-current_node_idx, current_node_idx)`).\n        *   If `node_state[current_node_idx]` is already `2` (KEPT), this means it was added to `pq` but later processed as a neighbor of another node that was picked earlier. This check is not strictly necessary if `node_state` is managed correctly, but harmless.\n        *   Set `node_state[current_node_idx] = 2` (KEPT).\n        *   Increment `num_kept`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `current_node_idx`:\n            *   If `node_state[v]` is `0` (NOT\\_VISITED), add `(-v, v)` to `pq` and set `node_state[v] = 1` (IN\\_PQ).\n5.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   Create an empty list `removed_nodes`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\n    *   If `node_state[i]` is not `2` (KEPT), it means district `i` was not selected. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n6.  **Output:**\n    *   Sort `removed_nodes` in increasing order.\n    *   Print the elements of `removed_nodes` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=6, k=3, keep 3 nodes):**\n\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdj: 1:[2], 2:[1,6,4,3], 3:[2], 4:[2], 5:[6], 6:[2,5]\n\n1.  `node_state = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`, `pq = []`, `num_kept = 0`.\n2.

Print `1 3 4`.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(N log N) due to priority queue operations, where N is the number of districts. Building the adjacency list takes O(N). Each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint), and each node is added to and removed from the priority queue at most once.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # node_state: 0 = NOT_VISITED, 1 = IN_PQ, 2 = KEPT\n    node_state = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Max-priority queue using min-heap by storing negative values\n    # Stores (-node_idx, node_idx)\n    pq = []\n\n    num_kept = 0\n    \n    # Start with the largest indexed node 'n'\n    # This node is always kept to maximize the sum of 2^i\n    \n    # Add node 'n' to kept set\n    node_state[n] = 2 # Mark as KEPT\n    num_kept = 1\n\n    # Add neighbors of 'n' to the priority queue\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        if node_state[neighbor] == 0: # If not visited\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n            node_state[neighbor] = 1 # Mark as IN_PQ\n\n    # Greedily expand the connected component\n    # We need to keep n - k nodes in total\n    while num_kept < n - k and pq:\n        _, current_node_idx = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        # If this node was already kept (e.g., processed via another path)\n        # or already in PQ (shouldn't happen with correct state management)\n        # this check ensures we only process it once for adding to KEPT\n        if node_state[current_node_idx] == 2:\n            continue\n\n        node_state[current_node_idx] = 2 # Mark as KEPT\n        num_kept += 1\n\n        # Add neighbors of the current node to the priority queue\n        for neighbor in adj[current_node_idx]:\n            if node_state[neighbor] == 0: # If not visited\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n                node_state[neighbor] = 1 # Mark as IN_PQ\n\n    # Collect removed nodes\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if node_state[i] != 2: # If not KEPT\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n            \n    # The problem asks for k removed nodes.\n    # If we kept n-k nodes, then exactly k nodes are removed.\n    # The `removed_nodes` list will naturally contain exactly k elements.\n\n    # Output the removed nodes in increasing order\n    # They are already in increasing order if we iterate from 1 to n.\n    # But sorting is safer if the problem constraints were different or logic was changed.\n    # removed_nodes.sort() # Not strictly necessary here as we iterate 1 to n\n\n    print(*(removed_nodes))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
