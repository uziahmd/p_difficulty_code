Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to solve this Vanya and Lanterns problem. The goal is to figure out the smallest radius, `d`, for the lanterns to light up the whole street. The street is of length `l`, and we have `n` lanterns at specific locations `a_i`.\n\nFirst, it’s always smart to sort the lantern positions, so let's do that. Once they're sorted, I can figure out what `d` has to be at a minimum.\n\nI need to make sure the whole street gets lit, meaning from 0 to `l`. There are a few things to consider:\n\n*   **The Start:** The very first lantern has to reach the beginning of the street, so its radius `d` has to be at least `a_0`.\n*   **The End:** The very last lantern needs to illuminate the end of the street, so its radius `d` must be at least `l - a_{n-1}`.\n*   **The Gaps:** Here's the tricky part. Between any two lanterns, there's a gap that needs to be covered. Think about it: the distance between any two lanterns, divided by 2 is the exact distance the radius of the light should reach to connect both lights in the middle.\n\nSo, I'm going to do the following:\n\n1.  Read in `n` (number of lanterns) and `l` (street length).\n2.  Read in the lantern positions, `a`, and sort them.\n3.  Calculate the radius for the beginning: `d_left = a[0]`\n4.  Calculate the radius for the end: `d_right = l - a[n-1]`\n5.  Iterate through the gaps and find the maximum radius needed to cover them: `d_gap = max((a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 for i in range(n-1))`\n6.  The overall `d` has to be the maximum of `d_left`, `d_right`, and `d_gap`. This guarantees that the entire street is lit.\n7.  Print the result, being sure to use `:.10f` to satisfy the requested precision requirements.\n\nI'll check for the edge cases. For instance, what if there is only one lantern? Also what if a lantern is at the start or the end? The logic still works. No need to specially handle these.\n\nI’m aiming for an `O(n log n)` time complexity due to the sorting, and `O(n)` space complexity. The constraints indicate that this is efficient enough, and that this code should run fast. Also, I will use Python’s float for the calculations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns, placed at given positions `a_i` along a street of length `l` (from 0 to `l`), can light the entire street. Each lantern lights points within distance `d` from its position.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution approach:\n\n1.  **Sort Lantern Positions:** The first step is to sort the lantern positions `a_i` in ascending order. This makes it easier to work with adjacent lanterns and determine the leftmost and rightmost lanterns. Let the sorted positions be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n\n2.  **Identify Critical Gaps:** The entire street `[0, l]` must be lit. This implies three types of segments must be covered:\n    *   **The beginning of the street:** Point 0 must be lit. The first lantern `a_0` is responsible for covering this. For point 0 to be lit, `a_0 - d` must be less than or equal to 0, which means `d >= a_0`.\n    *   **The end of the street:** Point `l` must be lit. The last lantern `a_{n-1}` is responsible for covering this. For point `l` to be lit, `a_{n-1} + d` must be greater than or equal to `l`, which means `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.\n    *   **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two consecutive lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the segment between them must be lit. The most challenging point to cover in this segment is the one exactly in the middle, `(a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`. For this point to be covered, `a_i + d` must be greater than or equal to `(a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`. This simplifies to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum of these `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` values across all adjacent pairs.\n\n3.  **Determine the Minimum `d`:** The minimum light radius `d` required to light the entire street is the maximum of all the individual `d` requirements calculated above. That is, `d = max(a_0, l - a_{n-1}, max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2))` for all `i` from `0` to `n-2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample: `n=2, l=5, a=[2, 5]`):**\n\n1.  Sorted `a`: `[2, 5]`\n\n2.  **Left end (0):** The first lantern is at `a[0] = 2`. To cover 0, `d` must be at least `a[0] = 2`.\n    `max_d = 2.0`\n\n3.  **Right end (l):** The last lantern is at `a[1] = 5`. To cover `l = 5`, `d` must be at least `l - a[1] = 5 - 5 = 0`.\n    `max_d = max(2.0, 0.0) = 2.0`\n\n4.  **Gaps between lanterns:**\n    Only one gap between `a[0]=2` and `a[1]=5`.\n    `gap_length = a[1] - a[0] = 5 - 2 = 3`.\n    Required `d` for this gap is `3 / 2.0 = 1.5`.\n    `max_d = max(2.0, 1.5) = 2.0`\n\n5.  The final minimum `d` is `2.0`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Use floating-point numbers for `d` to maintain precision.\n*   Sort the array `a`.\n*   Calculate `max_d` based on the three conditions, taking the maximum value found.\n*   Print the result formatted to at least 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirements.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n (number of lanterns) and l (length of the street)\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the lantern positions and convert them to a list of integers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions.
