Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**X Pattern Verification: My Python Script Design**\n\nOkay, I'm thinking I need to write a Python script to analyze an `n x n` character grid and determine if it forms a valid 'X' pattern based on these specific rules. I'll need to break this down into logical steps.\n\nFirst, the core of the 'X' structure is this: the diagonals must be identical letters, and everything else has to be the same, but different from the diagonals.  Since 'n' is always odd, I should be able to rely on that fact for my algorithm.\n\nThe diagonals are clearly defined: the main diagonal where the row and column indices are equal, and the anti-diagonal where their sum equals `n-1`. I'll represent the grid as `paper[row][col]`.\n\nMy algorithm will go something like this:\n\n1.  **Input:** I'll read `n` and then the grid itself. Easy enough, likely as a list of strings or a list of lists.\n2.  **Character Identification:** I'll start by initializing `diagonal_char` and `other_char` to `None`. Then I'll iterate through the grid.\n3.  **Iteration and Validation:** For each cell, I'll check if it's on a diagonal using `(r == c) or (r + c == n - 1)`. If it is, I'll compare its character to `diagonal_char`. If `diagonal_char` is still `None`, I'll set it. If it's not the same, the 'X' is invalid, and I'll print \"NO\" and quit. If the cell is not on a diagonal, I'll do the same check against `other_char`. If that value hasn't been set, I'll save the character.  If it doesn't match, \"NO\" and out.\n4.  **Final Check:** If I get through the whole grid without printing \"NO,\" I need one final check. I have `diagonal_char` and `other_char`. I need to make sure they're different. If they're equal, it's not a valid 'X', so \"NO\". Otherwise, it meets all criteria, and I can confidently output \"YES\".\n\nGiven `n >= 3` there will always be at least one diagonal and one non-diagonal character, so I don't need to worry about the initial character values not being set. That simplifies things. The constraints on `n` are 3 to 299 and odd, which I'll keep in mind if I decide to add input validation or optimization. I'll need to double check that I handle the edge cases correctly. Seems like a solid plan. I'm ready to start coding this!\n",
