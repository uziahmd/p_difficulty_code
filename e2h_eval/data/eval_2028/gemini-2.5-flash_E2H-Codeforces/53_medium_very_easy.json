    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Algorithm Development**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this problem is finding the *longest* substring that repeats within a larger string. My initial approach is to iterate through possible substring lengths, starting with the longest possible and working down, and for each length, check if any substring of that length repeats. The longest possible substring length is the string's length minus one, and the shortest could be one if single characters are repeating.\n\nSo, I'll first get the string and its length, then start this nested loop: the outer one is for substring lengths from N-1 down to 1, and the inner one goes through all the substrings of that length within the original string. Within the inner loop, for each substring, I'll use the find() method to search the string *after* the initial occurrence of that substring to see if it repeats. As soon as I find a repeating substring, I know I've found the longest because I'm working from longest to shortest, so I can return its length. If the loops complete without finding a repeating substring, then the answer is 0.\n\n**Implementation Details and Optimization Considerations**\n\nI'm thinking Python is the way to go here because string manipulation in Python is pretty straightforward. I'll need to use the `find()` method, but I need to make sure I'm using it efficiently. I'll start the search at index i+1 to be sure I'm checking for a second occurrence after the first.\n\nI need to be aware of the time complexity. The find() method could have a worse case time complexity of O(N*L), and the total complexity for this algorithm will then be something along the lines of N^3 * L which will then be something like N^4 given that L <=N. However, for such an easy question, given that N <= 100, N^4 might be borderline for time limits. But I also remember Python's `find()` isn't actually just a brute-force search. It uses a faster algorithm, which could be O(N) or O(N + M) or even slightly better. Also, it states very easy question, which suggest straightforward approach might be good enough. So I'll go with this complexity and run it.\n\n**Final Algorithm and Code**\n\nTo summarize the steps, I'll:\n\n1.  Get the input string `s` and its length `N`.\n2.  Loop from `length = N-1` down to `1`:\n    a.  Loop from `i = 0` to `N - length`:\n        i.  Extract substring `sub` of length `length` starting at `i`.\n        ii. Use `s.find(sub, i+1)` to search for `sub` *after* the initial `i` position. If found, return `length`.\n3.  If no repeating substring is found, return 0.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_single_string(s):\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for length in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            sub = s[i : i + length]\n            if s.find(sub, i + 1) != -1:\n                return str(length)\n    \n    return '0'\n\n# Read input line by line\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    s = line.strip()\n    if not s:\n        continue\n    result = solve_single_string(s)\n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n```\n\nI'll use this format and test it with the examples given in the prompt, along with the edge cases I thought about.  Hopefully, this will be good enough.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length is at most 100.\n\nWe can solve this problem by iterating through all possible substring lengths, from the longest possible down to 1. For each length, we then iterate through all substrings of that specific length. For each substring, we check if it appears again in the original string at a different starting position. The first length for which we find such a repeating substring will be our answer, because we are iterating lengths in decreasing order.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the approach:\n\n1.  **Initialize `n`**: Get the length of the input string `s`.\n2.  **Iterate `length`**: We want the *longest* substring, so we iterate `length` from `n - 1` down to `1`.\n    *   A substring of length `n` can only appear once (it's the string itself).\n    *   A substring of length `n-1` is the maximum possible length for a substring that could appear at least twice.\n    *   We stop at `length = 1`. If no repeating substring is found by then, the answer is 0.\n3.  **Iterate `i`**: For each `length`, we iterate through all possible starting positions `i` for a substring of that length. `i` will range from `0` to `n - length`.\n4.  **Extract `sub`**: The current substring is `s[i : i + length]`.\n5.  **Check for repetition**: We use `s.find(sub, i + 1)` to search for another occurrence of `sub`.\n    *   `s.find(sub, i + 1)` searches for `sub` in `s` starting from index `i + 1`. This ensures that we are looking for a *distinct* occurrence, even if it overlaps with the current one starting at `i`.\n    *   If `s.find(sub, i + 1)` returns a value other than -1, it means `sub` has been found again. Since we are iterating `length` from largest to smallest, this `length` is the answer. We can immediately print `length` and terminate.\n6.  **Handle no repetition**: If the loops complete without finding any repeating substring, it means no substring (of length 1 or more) appears at least twice. In this case, we print `0`.\n\n**Example: `s = \"ababa\"`**\n\n*   `n = 5`\n*   **`length = 4`**:\n    *   `i = 0`: `sub = \"abab\"`. `s.find(\"abab\", 1)` is -1.\n    *   `i = 1`: `sub = \"baba\"`. `s.find(\"baba\", 2)` is -1.\n*   **`length = 3`**:\n    *   `i = 0`: `sub = \"aba\"`. `s.find(\"aba\", 1)` returns `2` (found at index 2).\n        *   Since a repeating substring is found, we print `3` and exit.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   The outer loop runs `O(N)` times (for `length`).\n*   The inner loop runs `O(N)` times (for `i`).\n*   The `s.find()` method in Python is highly optimized (e.g., using a variant of Boyer-Moore). Its average time complexity is `O(N + L)` where `N` is the length of the string being searched and `L` is the length of the substring being sought.\n*   Therefore, the total time complexity is approximately `O(N * N * (N + L))`, which simplifies to `O(N^3)` because `L` is at most `N`.\n*   Given `N <= 100`, `N^3 = 100^3 = 1,000,000`. This number of operations is well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems (usually around `10^8` operations per second).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_single_string(s):\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Iterate through possible substring lengths from longest to shortest.\n    # The maximum possible length for a substring that can appear at least twice is n-1.\n    # The minimum possible length is 1.\n    for length in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions for a substring of the current length.\n        # A substring of length 'length' starting at 'i' ends at 'i + length - 1'.\n        # The last possible starting index 'i' is when 'i + length - 1' is 'n - 1',\n        # so 'i' is 'n - length'.\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            sub = s[i : i + length]\n            \n            # Check if this substring 'sub' appears again in the string 's'.\n            # The search starts from 'i + 1' to ensure that we find a *distinct* occurrence,\n            # even if it overlaps with the current one starting at 'i'.\n            if s.find(sub, i + 1) != -1:\n                # If found, this is the longest such substring because we are\n                # iterating 'length' in decreasing order.\n                return str(length)\n    \n    # If no substring of length 1 or more is found to repeat, the answer is 0.\n    return '0'\n\n# Read input line by line from standard input.\n# The problem example implies multiple test cases, each on a new line.\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    s = line.strip()\n    if not s: # Handle potential empty lines or end of input\n        continue\n    \n    # Solve for the current string and print the result to standard output.\n    result = solve_single_string(s)\n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n\n```",
