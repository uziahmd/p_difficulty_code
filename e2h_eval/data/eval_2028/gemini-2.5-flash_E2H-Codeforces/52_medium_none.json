Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Finalized Python Script for the \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nAlright, after carefully reviewing the problem statement, example, and potential edge cases, I've arrived at my final Python script. The core of the solution is a simulation loop that tracks the total hours Vasily can light up his room, the number of new candles, and the number of burned-out candles. The loop continues as long as there are new candles to burn. In each iteration, the script calculates the total hours for that round, updates the burned-out candle count, and determines the number of new candles that can be made from the burned-out ones. The script takes one line of input from standard input, processes that single test case, and prints the result to standard output. While the example output and input are presented in a way that suggests multiple test cases, the problem description explicitly states a single line input. Therefore, I will stick to this interpretation. This solution provides a concise and correct way to handle the New Year Candles problem.\n",
