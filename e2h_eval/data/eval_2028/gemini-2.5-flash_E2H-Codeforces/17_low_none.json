He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the String Prefix/Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. They've given me a set of strings, specifically $2n-2$ of them, and I need to figure out which are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string, $s$, of length $n$.  The catch is, I'm only given *improper* prefixes and suffixes, meaning lengths from 1 up to $n-1$.  Each length has exactly two strings, one a prefix and the other a suffix. The goal is to output a string of 'P's and 'S's, indicating which input string is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S'), and the number of P's and S's must be equal to $n-1$.\n\nI immediately start by formalizing my understanding of prefixes and suffixes. A prefix $p_k$ is $s_1s_2...s_k$, and a suffix $s_k$ is $s_{n-k+1}s_{n-k+2}...s_n$.  This means that for any length $k$ between 1 and $n-1$, I'll have exactly one prefix and one suffix.  This observation is crucial.\n\nNow, my mind focuses on the key: the length of the original string, $n$. I realize that I have two strings of length $n-1$ amongst the input. One of these must be $p_{n-1}$, which is $s_1s_2...s_{n-1}$, and the other $s_{n-1}$, which is $s_2s_3...s_n$.  Let's call these $str_A$ and $str_B$.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Okay, let's explore the possible scenarios. Suppose $str_A$ is the prefix of length $n-1$ and $str_B$ is the suffix of length $n-1$\". If that is correct, then I can construct the original string, $s$, by appending the last character of $str_B$ to $str_A$.  Therefore, $s = str_A + str_B[-1]$. From this fact, the last character of $str_B$ defines the end of the full string.\nI then realize that the first character of $str_B$ defines the prefix character $s_1$.\n\nThe crucial check is to see if the internal strings match. If $str_A$ is the prefix, then the internal sequence $s_2...s_{n-1}$ must be identical to the internal sequence $str_B[:-1]$.\n\nEssentially, I need to analyze the two strings of length $n-1$. I consider the possible cases, construct $s$ by using those strings, and see if I can satisfy the logic. This seems to be the core strategy! The answer will emerge by testing those hypotheses, checking the logic, and extracting the right combination of P and S to represent the solutions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given $2n-2$ strings are prefixes ('P') and which are suffixes ('S') of an unknown string $s$ of length $n$. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from $1$ to $n-1$, and these correspond to one prefix and one suffix of that length.\n\nLet the unknown string be $s = s_1s_2...s_n$.\nThe prefixes are $p_k = s_1...s_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nThe suffixes are $suf_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nA crucial observation is that the prefix of length $n-1$ ($p_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1}$) and the suffix of length $n-1$ ($suf_{n-1} = s_2...s_n$) are the two longest strings given in the input. These are the only two strings of length $n-1$.\n\nLet's denote the two strings of length $n-1$ as `str1` and `str2`.\nThere are two possibilities for how `str1` and `str2` relate to the original string $s$:\n\n**Possibility 1:** `str1` is $p_{n-1}$ and `str2` is $suf_{n-1}$.\nIf this is the case:\n- $s_1...s_{n-1} = \\text{str1}$\n- $s_2...s_n = \\text{str2}$\nFrom these, we can deduce the full string $s$:\n$s = \\text{str1} + \\text{str2}[-1]$ (append the last character of `str2` to `str1`).\nFor this to be consistent, the common part $s_2...s_{n-1}$ must be identical. That is, `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, we can form a candidate string `s_candidate1 = str1 + str2[-1]`.\n\n**Possibility 2:** `str2` is $p_{n-1}$ and `str1` is $suf_{n-1}$.\nIf this is the case:\n- $s_1...s_{n-1} = \\text{str2}$\n- $s_2...s_n = \\text{str1}$\nFrom these, we can deduce the full string $s$:\n$s = \\text{str2} + \\text{str1}[-1]$ (append the last character of `str1` to `str2`).\nFor this to be consistent, `str2[1:]` must be equal to `str1[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, we can form a candidate string `s_candidate2 = str2 + str1[-1]`.\n\nIt's guaranteed that at least one such string $s$ exists. This means at least one of these possibilities will lead to a valid string $s$ that matches all other given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nOur strategy will be:\n1. Read all input strings and store them along with their original indices.\n2. Identify the two strings of length $n-1$. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n3. Try **Possibility 1**: Assume `str_A` is the prefix of length $n-1$ and `str_B` is the suffix of length $n-1$.\n   a. Check if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n   b. If consistent, form `s_candidate = str_A + str_B[-1]`.\n   c. Validate `s_candidate`: Generate all its prefixes ($p_k$) and suffixes ($suf_k$) of lengths $1$ to $n-1$. Check if the multiset of these generated strings matches the multiset of all input strings.\n   d. If `s_candidate` is valid, then we have found a consistent assignment. We can then determine the 'P'/'S' sequence based on this assumption. `str_A` is a 'P', `str_B` is an 'S'. For all other strings, we check if they are `s_candidate`'s prefixes or suffixes.\n4. If Possibility 1 doesn't lead to a valid `s_candidate` (or if we just want to try the other one), try **Possibility 2**: Assume `str_B` is the prefix of length $n-1$ and `str_A` is the suffix of length $n-1$.\n   a. Check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n   b. If consistent, form `s_candidate = str_B + str_A[-1]`.\n   c. Validate `s_candidate` as in step 3c.\n   d. If `s_candidate` is valid, determine the 'P'/'S' sequence. `str_B` is a 'P', `str_A` is an 'S'.\n\nSince any valid answer is accepted, we can just pick the first one we find.\n\nLet's refine the validation step and 'P'/'S' assignment.\nOnce we have a `s_candidate`, we need to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string.\nWe can create a `used_prefixes` set and `used_suffixes` set to keep track of which generated strings have been matched.\nFor each input string `inp_str` (at its original index `i`):\n- If `s_candidate.startswith(inp_str)` and `inp_str` is not in `used_prefixes`: assign 'P', add `inp_str` to `used_prefixes`.\n- Else if `s_candidate.endswith(inp_str)` and `inp_str` is not in `used_suffixes`: assign 'S', add `inp_str` to `used_suffixes`.\n- The problem guarantees $n-1$ prefixes and $n-1$ suffixes. This means exactly one string of each length $k$ will be a prefix of $s$ and exactly one will be a suffix of $s$.\n\nA simpler way to assign 'P'/'S' after determining `s_candidate` and the initial assumption (e.g., `str_A` is P, `str_B` is S):\n1. Create a `collections.defaultdict(list)` mapping string content to a list of their original indices.\n2. Initialize an `ans` array of size $2n-2$ with empty strings.\n3. For `s_candidate`, generate all its true prefixes $p_k$ and true suffixes $suf_k$.\n4. For each $p_k$: find its first available original index from the `content_to_indices` map, assign 'P' to `ans[index]`, and mark that index as used.\n5. For each $suf_k$: find its first available original index from the `content_to_indices` map, assign 'S' to `ans[index]`, and mark that index as used.\n\nExample Walkthrough (First example):\n$n=5$\nInput strings (with original indices):\n0: ba (len 2)\n1: a (len 1)\n2: abab (len 4)\n3: a (len 1)\n4: aba (len 3)\n5: baba (len 4)\n6: ab (len 2)\n7: aba (len 3)\n\nStrings of length $n-1=4$: `abab` (idx 2), `baba` (idx 5).\nLet `str_A = \"abab\"` (idx 2), `str_B = \"baba\"` (idx 5).\n\n**Attempt 1: `str_A` is P, `str_B` is S.**\n`str_A = \"abab\"`, `str_B = \"baba\"`\nCheck consistency: `str_A[1:]` (\"bab\") == `str_B[:-1]` (\"bab\").

Pick 2. `ans[2] = 'P'`. `used_indices.add(2)`.\n\nFor suffixes:\n$suf_1 = $ \"a\": available indices for \"a\": [1, 3]. Index 1 is used. Pick 3. `ans[3] = 'S'`. `used_indices.add(3)`.\n$suf_2 = $ \"ba\": available indices for \"ba\": [0]. Pick 0. `ans[0] = 'S'`. `used_indices.add(0)`.\n$suf_3 = $ \"aba\": available indices for \"aba\": [4, 7]. Index 4 is used. Pick 7. `ans[7] = 'S'`. `used_indices.add(7)`.\n$suf_4 = $ \"baba\": available indices for \"baba\": [5]. Pick 5. `ans[5] = 'S'`. `used_indices.add(5)`.\n\nResulting `ans`:\n`ans[0] = 'S'`\n`ans[1] = 'P'`\n`ans[2] = 'P'`\n`ans[3] = 'S'`\n`ans[4] = 'P'`\n`ans[5] = 'S'`\n`ans[6] = 'P'`\n`ans[7] = 'S'`\nJoined: \"SPPSPSPS\".
