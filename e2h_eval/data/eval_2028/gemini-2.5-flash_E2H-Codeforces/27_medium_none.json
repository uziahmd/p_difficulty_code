On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"A Twisty Movement\" - Final Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. I need to write a Python script for this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem. The core is optimizing the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after applying a reverse operation to a subsegment. Since the input sequence contains only 1s and 2s, the LNDS structure is simple: it's just a sequence of ones followed by a sequence of twos.\n\nInitially, I considered iterating through all possible subsegments [l, r], reversing them, and calculating the LNDS for each modified sequence.  The LNDS length is essentially `max(prefix_ones + suffix_twos)` across all split points. But, that approach was O(N^3), which is too slow.\n\nSo, I need to optimize. Precomputing prefix sums of ones (`P1[i]`) and suffix sums of twos (`S2[i]`) seemed promising. I'll precompute: `P1[i] = count of 1s up to index i-1`, and `S2[i] = count of 2s starting from index i`.  Then, for each subsegment, I can calculate the LNDS efficiently.\n\nThe key insight is in figuring out the LNDS given a reverse segment. I have the sequence `A`, and I'm reversing `A[l...r]`. The modified sequence is `B`. I realize that the LNDS is formed by combining portions of ones and twos from before and after the reverse, as well as those within the reversed segment.\n\nLet's break down the LNDS calculation for the reversed sequence B:  Iterate through all possible `l, r` and use:\n1.  `max_lnds_prefix[l-1]`.\n2.  `max_lnds_suffix[r+1]`.\n3. `P1[l] + S2[r+1] + max(cnt1_j+1_to_r + cnt2_l_to_j)`, with `cnt1` representing count of ones in reversed segment and `cnt2` count of twos in reversed segment, after mapping indices.\n   Since the original sequence has an upper bound for n as 2000, which means an execution time of 8 seconds.\n\nTo efficiently find the count of 1s in `A[j+1...r]` and 2s in `A[l...j-1]`, I'll use range minimum query (RMQ) preprocessing with a sparse table (or segment tree) to achieve O(1) query time for the max value after applying reverse operations.  I define `val[j] = P1[j+1] + S2[j]` and then use the RMQ approach, and use a range query to compute the minimum.\nNow I've brought the complexity down to O(N^2) overall. Now, the preprocessing time for sparse table is O(N log N).\n\nThis should solve the \"A Twisty Movement\" problem efficiently, given n up to 2000.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a single subsegment `a[l...r]` of the input array `a`. The elements `a_i` can only be 1 or 2.\n\n**Understanding LNDS for sequences of 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence in an array of 1s and 2s will always consist of some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. For example, `1, 1, 2, 2, 2`. To maximize its length, we want to pick as many 1s as possible, followed by as many 2s as possible.\nIf we consider a split point `k` (meaning we take 1s from indices `0` to `k-1` and 2s from indices `k` to `n-1`), the length of the LNDS for that split point is `(count of 1s in a[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in a[k...n-1])`. The overall LNDS length for an array `b` is the maximum of this value over all possible `k` from `0` to `n`.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe need to iterate through all possible `l` and `r` (0-indexed, `0 <= l <= r < n`). For each `(l, r)` pair, we conceptually reverse `a[l...r]` to form a new array `b`, and then calculate the LNDS of `b`. The maximum LNDS found across all `(l, r)` pairs will be our answer.\n\n**Precomputation:**\nTo efficiently calculate LNDS for the modified array `b`, we precompute prefix sums of 1s and suffix sums of 2s for the original array `a`:\n1.  `P1[i]`: Number of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `P1[0]=0`, `P1[i] = P1[i-1] + (1 if a[i-1]==1 else 0)` for `i=1...n`.\n2.  `S2[i]`: Number of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S2[n]=0`, `S2[i] = S2[i+1] + (1 if a[i]==2 else 0)` for `i=n-1...0`.\n\n**Calculating LNDS for a modified array `b` (after reversing `a[l...r]`):**\nThe array `b` consists of three parts:\n*   `a[0...l-1]` (unchanged prefix)\n*   `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]` (reversed middle segment)\n*   `a[r+1...n-1]` (unchanged suffix)\n\nLet `k` be the split point for the LNDS.\n1.  **`k <= l`**: The split point is before or at the start of the reversed segment.\n    The 1s come from `b[0...k-1]` (which is `a[0...k-1]`). The 2s come from `b[k...n-1]`.\n    The count of 1s is `P1[k]`. The count of 2s is `S2[k]`.\n    So, for `k <= l`, the contribution is `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n2.  **`k > r`**: The split point is after the reversed segment.\n    The 1s come from `b[0...k-1]`. The 2s come from `b[k...n-1]` (which is `a[k...n-1]`).\n    The count of 1s is `P1[k]`. The count of 2s is `S2[k]`.\n    So, for `k > r`, the contribution is `P1[k] + S2[k]`.\n3.  **`l < k <= r+1`**: The split point is within or immediately after the reversed segment.\n    The 1s come from `b[0...l-1]` (which is `a[0...l-1]`) and `b[l...k-1]`.\n    The 2s come from `b[k...r]` and `b[r+1...n-1]` (which is `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n    *   Count of 1s from `a[0...l-1]` is `P1[l]`.\n    *   Count of 2s from `a[r+1...n-1]` is `S2[r+1]`.\n    *   `b[l...k-1]` corresponds to `a[l+r-(k-1) ... r]` (original indices). The count of 1s in this part is `P1[r+1] - P1[l+r-(k-1)]`.\n    *   `b[k...r]` corresponds to `a[l ... l+r-k]` (original indices). The count of 2s in this part is `S2[l] - S2[l+r-k+1]`.\n\n    Let `j = l+r-k+1`. As `k` goes from `l+1` to `r+1`, `j` goes from `r` down to `l`.\n    The contribution from the middle segment (reversed) for a split point `k` (or `j`) is:\n    `(count of 1s in a[j+1...r]) + (count of 2s in a[l...j])`\n    This can be expressed using prefix/suffix sums: `(P1[r+1] - P1[j+1]) + (S2[l] - S2[j+1])`.\n    So for `l < k <= r+1`, the LNDS length is `P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[j+1]) + (S2[l] - S2[j+1]) + S2[r+1]`.\n    We want to maximize this over `j` from `l` to `r`.\n    This simplifies to `P1[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + S2[l] - (P1[j+1] + S2[j+1])`.\n    To maximize this, we need to minimize `(P1[j+1] + S2[j+1])` for `j` from `l` to `r`.\n    Let `val[x] = P1[x] + S2[x]`. We need `min_{l+1 <= x <= r+1} val[x]`.\n\n**Optimized Calculation:**\nThe overall maximum LNDS for a given `(l, r)` is:\n`max( max_{0 <= k <= l} (P1[k] + S2[k]),`\n`     max_{r+1 <= k <= n} (P1[k] + S2[k]),`\n`     P1[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + S2[l] - min_{l+1 <= x <= r+1} (P1[x] + S2[x]) )`\n\nTo speed this up:\n*   `max_{0 <= k <= l} (P1[k] + S2[k])` can be precomputed as `max_lnds_prefix[l]`.\n*   `max_{r+1 <= k <= n} (P1[k] + S2[k])` can be precomputed as `max_lnds_suffix[r+1]`.\n*   `min_{l+1 <= x <= r+1} (P1[x] + S2[x])` is a Range Minimum Query (RMQ) on the array `val[x] = P1[x] + S2[x]`. This can be done in O(1) time after O(N log N) or O(N) preprocessing using a Sparse Table or Segment Tree. For N=2000, a Sparse Table is efficient enough.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and array `a`.\n2.  Compute `P1` and `S2` arrays (size `n+1`).\n3.  Compute `val[i] = P1[i] + S2[i]` for `i=0...n`.\n4.  Compute `max_lnds_prefix[i] = max_{0 <= k <= i} val[k]` for `i=0...n`.\n5.  Compute `max_lnds_suffix[i] = max_{i <= k <= n} val[k]` for `i=0...n`.\n6.  Build a Sparse Table for RMQ on the `val` array. This takes `O(N log N)`.\n7.  Initialize `max_overall_lnds = max_lnds_prefix[n]` (LNDS of the original array).\n8.  Iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n9.      Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n            a.  `current_lnds = 0`\n            b.  If `l > 0`, `current_lnds = max(current_lnds, max_lnds_prefix[l-1])`.\n            c.  If `r < n-1`, `current_lnds = max(current_lnds, max_lnds_suffix[r+1])`.\n            d.  If `l <= r`:\n                `min_val_in_middle = RMQ(l+1, r+1)` on `val` array.\n                `contribution_middle = P1[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + S2[l] - min_val_in_middle`.\n                `current_lnds = max(current_lnds, contribution_middle)`.\n            e.  `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_lnds)`.\n10. Print `max_overall_lnds`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Precomputation (P1, S2, val, max_lnds_prefix, max_lnds_suffix): O(N)\n*   Sparse Table construction: O(N log N)\n*   Main loops (`l`, `r`): O(N^2) iterations.\n*   Inside loop (RMQ query): O(1)\n*   Total time complexity: O(N^2 + N log N) = O(N^2).\n*   Space complexity: O(N log N) for Sparse Table.\n\nFor N=2000, N^2 = 4 * 10^6, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # P1[i]: count of 1s in a[0...i-1]\n    # S2[i]: count of 2s in a[i...n-1]\n    P1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    S2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        P1[i+1] = P1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        S2[i] = S2[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    # val[i]: P1[i] + S2[i], represents LNDS if split point is i\n    val = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        val[i] = P1[i] + S2[i]\n\n    # max_lnds_prefix[i]: max(val[0]...val[i])\n    max_lnds_prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    max_lnds_prefix[0] = val[0]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        max_lnds_prefix[i] = max(max_lnds_prefix[i-1], val[i])\n\n    # max_lnds_suffix[i]: max(val[i]...val[n])\n    max_lnds_suffix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    max_lnds_suffix[n] = val[n]\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        max_lnds_suffix[i] = max(max_lnds_suffix[i+1], val[i])\n\n    # Build Sparse Table for Range Minimum Query on val array\n    # ST[k][i] stores the minimum value in val[i...i + 2^k - 1]\n    LOGN = (n + 1).bit_length()\n    ST = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(LOGN)]\n    \n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        ST[0][i] = val[i]\n\n    for k in range(1, LOGN):\n        for i in range(n + 1 - (1 << k)):\n            ST[k][i] = min(ST[k-1][i], ST[k-1][i + (1 << (k-1))])\n\n    # Helper function for RMQ\n    def query_min(L, R): # inclusive range [L, R]\n        if L > R: return float('inf') # Should not happen with correct bounds\n        k = (R - L + 1).bit_length() - 1\n        return min(ST[k][L], ST[k][R - (1 << k) + 1])\n\n    max_overall_lnds = max_lnds_prefix[n] # Initial LNDS (no reversal)\n\n    for l in range(n): # 0-indexed start of reversal\n        for r in range(l, n): # 0-indexed end of reversal\n            current_lnds = 0\n\n            # Case 1: Split point k <= l\n            if l > 0:\n                current_lnds = max(current_lnds, max_lnds_prefix[l])\n            else: # If l=0, max_lnds_prefix[l-1] is not valid.
