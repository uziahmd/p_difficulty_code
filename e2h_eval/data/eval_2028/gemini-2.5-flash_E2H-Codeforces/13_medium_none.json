For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this musical puzzle.** I've been tasked with writing a Python script to classify a three-note chord (a \"triad\") as either major, minor, or something \"strange.\" My thought process is to take this step by step, which looks pretty straightforward, actually.\n\nFirst things first, I need to represent the notes numerically.  There are 12 notes in the standard chromatic scale (C, C#, D... to H), and I'll map them to integers from 0 to 11.  A dictionary is the perfect way to do this mapping. Then, I need to figure out how to calculate the distance between any two notes in semitones (the base unit). This is simple enough – I can just subtract the numerical values, making sure to handle the cyclical nature of notes using the modulo operator (%).\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the *structure* of major and minor triads. A major triad has a specific pattern: it can be rearranged so that the interval between the root and the third note is 4 semitones, and between the third and the fifth, it's 3 semitones. That means the interval between the root and the fifth will be 7. For a minor triad, it's the same, but the interval between the root and third is 3 semitones, and the interval between third and fifth is 4.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through each of the notes, assuming each one to be the *root* of the chord, and calculating the intervals to the other two notes. Since the order matters for chord definition, I will sort these two distances and compare the sorted values to my target intervals to determine the correct chord type.\n\nAfter some experimentation and careful consideration, I have realized the code needs the following process for `is_major` and `is_minor`:\n1.  Assume a note to be the root.\n2.  Calculate the intervals from this root.\n3.  Sort these intervals.\n4.  Check if these intervals match the standard for a major or minor chord ((4,7) or (3,7) respectively)\n\nI'll build these steps into a function called `check_chord_type` that checks for both. The main part of the program will then simply read the input notes, call `check_chord_type`, and print the appropriate result.\n\nThe problem states that each triad is either major, minor, or strange. So if it's not one, it has to be the other, and that will make the code easier.\n\nThe approach seems pretty efficient; I'm using constant-time dictionary lookups and arithmetic operations.  The sorting is O(1) in this case since there are only 2 intervals.  I've double-checked my calculations, and I've tested it against the examples provided, and it's all working. It seems I am all set to submit the program.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given 12 notes in a cyclic order, and distances are measured in semitones.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the approach:\n\n1.  **Note to Integer Mapping:** To easily calculate distances, we first map each of the 12 notes to an integer from 0 to 11.\n    *   C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5,\n    *   F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11\n    This mapping allows us to treat notes as numerical values.\n\n2.  **Semitone Distance Calculation:** The distance from note `n1` to `n2` (upwards, cyclically) can be calculated as `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. For example, from C (0) to E (4) is `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4` semitones. From E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8` semitones.\n\n3.  **Chord Definition:**\n    *   A **major triad** (X, Y, Z) can be ordered such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. This implies the distance from X to Z is 7 semitones (4+3). So, from the root (X), the other two notes are at 4 and 7 semitones.\n    *   A **minor triad** (X, Y, Z) can be ordered such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones, and from Y to Z is 4 semitones. This implies the distance from X to Z is 7 semitones (3+4). So, from the root (X), the other two notes are at 3 and 7 semitones.\n\n4.  **Classification Algorithm:**\n    Given three notes, `N1, N2, N3`:\n    *   Convert `N1, N2, N3` to their integer representations.\n    *   For each of the three notes, assume it is the \"root\" of the chord.\n    *   If `Ni` is the root, calculate the upward semitone distances from `Ni` to the other two notes. Let these distances be `d1` and `d2`.\n    *   Sort these two distances: `min_d, max_d`.\n    *   If `(min_d, max_d)` is `(4, 7)`, the chord is major.\n    *   If `(min_d, max_d)` is `(3, 7)`, the chord is minor.\n    *   If, after checking all three possible roots, neither condition is met, the chord is \"strange\".\n    The problem guarantees that a chord will not be both major and minor simultaneously, so the order of checking (major then minor) doesn't matter for correctness.\n\n**Example: \"C E G\"**\n*   C=0, E=4, G=7\n*   **Assume C (0) is root:**\n    *   Distance C to E = `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   Distance C to G = `(7 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 7`\n    *   Sorted distances: `(4, 7)`. This matches the major triad definition. Output: \"major\".\n\n**Example: \"C# B F\"**\n*   C#=1, B=10, F=5\n*   **Check for Major:**\n    *   **Assume C# (1) is root:** Distances to B (10) and F (5) are `(10-1+12)%12 = 9` and `(5-1+12)%12 = 4`. Sorted: `(4, 9)`. Not major.\n    *   **Assume B (10) is root:** Distances to C# (1) and F (5) are `(1-10+12)%12 = 3` and `(5-10+12)%12 = 7`. Sorted: `(3, 7)`. Not major.\n    *   **Assume F (5) is root:** Distances to C# (1) and B (10) are `(1-5+12)%12 = 8` and `(10-5+12)%12 = 5`. Sorted: `(5, 8)`. Not major.\n    *   Not major.\n*   **Check for Minor:**\n    *   **Assume C# (1) is root:** Distances `(4, 9)`. Not minor.\n    *   **Assume B (10) is root:** Distances `(3, 7)`. This matches the minor triad definition. Output: \"minor\".\n\nThis approach covers all possibilities for the root and correctly identifies the chord type.\n\n```python\n# Map notes to integer values (0-11) for easier distance calculation.\n# C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5,\n# F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11\nnote_to_int = {\n    \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n    \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n}\n\ndef check_chord_type(notes_int_list, target_intervals):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given triad (represented by integer note values) matches\n    a specific chord type based on its intervals from a root.\n\n    Args:\n        notes_int_list: A list of three integer note values.\n        target_intervals: A tuple (e.g., (4, 7) for major, (3, 7) for minor)\n                          representing the sorted intervals from the root to\n                          the other two notes.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the chord matches the target_intervals, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Try each of the three notes as the potential root of the chord\n    for i in range(3):\n        root = notes_int_list[i]\n        \n        # Collect the other two notes\n        other_notes = []\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i != j:\n                other_notes.append(notes_int_list[j])\n        \n        # Calculate the distance (in semitones, upwards) from the root\n        # to each of the other two notes.\n        # (note - root + 12) % 12 handles cyclic nature and ensures a positive result.\n        interval1 = (other_notes[0] - root + 12) % 12\n        interval2 = (other_notes[1] - root + 12) % 12\n        \n        # Sort the calculated intervals to compare with the target_intervals,\n        # which are also sorted (e.g., (3, 7) not (7, 3)).\n        current_intervals = tuple(sorted([interval1, interval2]))\n        \n        # If the current intervals match the target for the chord type,\n        # then we found a match.\n        if current_intervals == target_intervals:\n            return True\n            \n    # If no root combination resulted in the target intervals,\n    # this chord is not of the specified type.\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three space-separated notes from standard input\n    notes_str = input().split()\n    \n    # Convert string notes to their integer representations\n    notes_int = [note_to_int[n] for n in notes_str]\n\n    # Check if it's a major chord (intervals from root are 4 and 7 semitones)\n    if check_chord_type(notes_int, (4, 7)):\n        print(\"major\")\n    # Else, check if it's a minor chord (intervals from root are 3 and 7 semitones)\n    elif check_chord_type(notes_int, (3, 7)):\n        print(\"minor\")\n    # If neither, it's a strange chord\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
