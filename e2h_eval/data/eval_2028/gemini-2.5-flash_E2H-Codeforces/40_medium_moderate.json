    "thought": "**Understanding and Tackling the \"Abnormal Permutation Pairs (Hard Version)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this challenging problem. The core task is to count pairs of permutations (p, q) of the numbers 1 to n, where p is lexicographically smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is strictly greater than the number of inversions in q.  The wrinkle? We need to do this modulo some given number (mod), and n can be as large as 500.\n\nFirst, I recognized the straightforward but inefficient way to calculate it:  Consider all possible permutation pairs and count those that meet the requirements. It is a no go due to the time complexity. Let's call the total number of such pairs our target.  A vital starting point is that, by symmetry, the number of permutation pairs where the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q is equal to the number of pairs where the number of inversions in p is smaller than the number of inversions in q.  This leads to a key equation: 2X + Y = (n!)^2, where X is our target count, and Y is the number of pairs with an equal number of inversions.\n\nWe can analyze the solution space as combinations of:\n*   Lexicographical order (p < q, p = q, p > q)\n*   Inversion counts (inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) = inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q))\n\nSince it is easy to count all permutation pairs where p < q, and since the number of inversions can be calculated for each permutation, our target, X can be expressed in terms of other combinations. So, the number of permutation pairs (p,q) where `p < q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`  is A_gt.\nThe total number of pairs `(n!)^2 = A_gt + A_lt + A_eq + B_gt + B_lt + B_eq + n!`\nBy comparing the lexicographical order and the inversion relationship, we can determine the solution.\n\nCalculating Y (pairs with equal inversion counts) seems pivotal. We can use dynamic programming (DP) to find the number of permutations with a given number of inversions.  The core DP recurrence is `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] - dp[i-1][j-i]` with adjustments for the specific modulus. With this we can determine Y, and by symmetry, we can relate this to finding X and A_gt.\n\nNext, it is necessary to consider the cases where the lexicographic order holds.  Let's define key variables for pairs.\n*   A_gt : `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`\n*   A_eq : `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)`\n*   A_lt : `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) < inv(q)`\n\nThen, `A_gt + A_eq + A_lt = (n!)^2 / 2 - n! / 2 = ((n!)^2 - n!) / 2`.\nOur goal is to find A_gt.\nWe know that the total number of permutations whose inversions are equal, we can use the formula we saw with Y. So, we'll try to find an explicit way to compute Y = sum N_inv[k]^2, and try to find A_eq = (Y - n!)/2.\n\nNow, let's explore dynamic programming to directly calculate the number of pairs (p, q) with equal inversions and p < q.  This requires careful consideration of the first differing position between p and q, and carefully accounting for inversions introduced at each step. This also needs to be calculated in modulo arithmetic with possible consideration to double modulo space to correctly compute the required results.  We would have to work on computing these intermediate steps, and then use them to determine the final number.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, \\ldots, n` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` and the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`. We need to output the answer modulo `mod`. `n` is up to 500.\n\nLet `inv(x)` denote the number of inversions in a permutation `x`.\nLet `N_inv(k)` be the number of permutations of `1, \\ldots, n` with exactly `k` inversions.\nThe maximum number of inversions for a permutation of `n` elements is `MAX_INV = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n\nLet's categorize all `(n!)^2` pairs `(p, q)` based on lexicographical order and inversion counts:\n1. `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)` (our target, let this count be `A_gt`)\n2. `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) < inv(q)` (let this count be `A_lt`)\n3. `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)` (let this count be `A_eq`)\n4. `p >_lex q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)` (let this count be `B_gt`)\n5. `p >_lex q` and `inv(p) < inv(q)` (let this count be `B_lt`)\n6. `p >_lex q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)` (let this count be `B_eq`)\n7. `p = q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)` (this count is `n!`, since `inv(p) = inv(q)` is always true if `p=q`)\n\nBy symmetry:\n- If `p <_lex q`, then `q >_lex p`. If `inv(p) > inv(q)`, then `inv(q) < inv(p)`. So `A_gt = B_lt`.\n- Similarly, `A_lt = B_gt` and `A_eq = B_eq`.\n\nWe have the following sums:\n- Total pairs: `(n!)^2 = A_gt + A_lt + A_eq + B_gt + B_lt + B_eq + n! = 2(A_gt + A_lt + A_eq) + n!`.\n  This implies `A_gt + A_lt + A_eq = ((n!)^2 - n!) / 2`. (Equation 1)\n- Total pairs with `inv(p) > inv(q)`: `sum_{p,q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = A_gt + B_gt`.\n  By symmetry `sum_{p,q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p,q} [inv(p) < inv(q)]`.\n  Let `Y = sum_{k=0}^{MAX_INV} N_inv(k)^2` be the count of pairs `(p,q)` where `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\n  Then `2 * sum_{p,q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] + Y = (n!)^2`.\n  So `A_gt + B_gt = ((n!)^2 - Y) / 2`.\n  Using `B_gt = A_lt`, we get `A_gt + A_lt = ((n!)^2 - Y) / 2`. (Equation 2)\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n`A_eq = ((n!)^2 - n!) / 2 - ((n!)^2 - Y) / 2 = (Y - n!) / 2`.\n\nOur goal is to find `A_gt`. From Equation 2, `A_gt = ((n!)^2 - Y) / 2 - A_lt`.\nThis doesn't directly simplify.\n\nLet's try a different approach. We are interested in `A_gt`.\n`A_gt = sum_{p,q} [p <_lex q \\land inv(p) > inv(q)]`.\nConsider the sum `S = sum_{p,q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`.\n`S = sum_p sum_q inv(p) - sum_p sum_q inv(q)`.\n`sum_p inv(p) = sum_{k=0}^{MAX_INV} k \\cdot N_inv(k)`.\nSo `S = n! \\cdot sum_k k \\cdot N_inv(k) - n! \\cdot sum_k k \\cdot N_inv(k) = 0`.\n\nNow consider `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`.\nLet `D = inv(p) - inv(q)`.\n`sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} D = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, D > 0} D + sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, D < 0} D + sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, D = 0} D`.\nLet `S_pos = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, D > 0} D`.\nLet `S_neg = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, D < 0} D`.\nLet `S_zero = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, D = 0} D`.\n\nThe total sum `sum_{p,q} (inv(p) - inv(q)) = 0`.\nThis sum can be split into three parts:\n`sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`\n`+ sum_{p,q, p >_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`\n`+ sum_{p,q, p = q} (inv(p) - inv(q))` (this part is 0, as `inv(p)-inv(q)=0` if `p=q`)\n\nBy symmetry (swapping `p` and `q`):\n`sum_{p,q, p >_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q)) = sum_{q,p, q <_lex p} (inv(q) - inv(p)) = - sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`.\nSo `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q)) = 0`.\nThis means `S_pos + S_neg + S_zero = 0`.\n\nThis approach provides a way to calculate `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} (inv(p) - inv(q))` and `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) < inv(q)} (inv(p) - inv(q))`. But we need counts, not sums of differences.\n\nThis problem is a known type and often solved by calculating `A_eq` (pairs `p <_lex q` with `inv(p) = inv(q)`) and using the symmetry property.\nThe final answer `A_gt` is given by:\n`A_gt = ( ( (n!)^2 - n! )/2 - A_eq ) / 2`.\nThis formula is derived from:\n`A_gt + A_lt + A_eq = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2` (total `p <_lex q` pairs)\nAnd `A_gt = A_lt` (by symmetry of `inv(p)` and `inv(q)` when `p <_lex q`).\nIf `A_gt = A_lt`, then `2 A_gt + A_eq = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2`.\nSo `A_gt = (((n!)^2 - n!)/2 - A_eq) / 2`.\nThis formula is valid if `mod` is odd. If `mod` is even, we must be careful with division by 2.\nAll values `(n!)^2 - n!` and `Y - n!` are even for `n \\ge 2`. For `n=1`, they are 0. So divisions by 2 are always exact.\nWe can perform all calculations modulo `2 * mod`, then divide by 2, then take modulo `mod`.\nLet `MOD_DOUBLE = 2 * mod`.\n\nThe strategy:\n1. Compute `dp_inv[i][j]`: number of permutations of `i` distinct elements with `j` inversions.\n   `dp_inv[i][j] = (dp_inv[i][j-1] + dp_inv[i-1][j] - dp_inv[i-1][j-i] + MOD_DOUBLE) % MOD_DOUBLE`.\n   Base case `dp_inv[0][0] = 1`.\n   `MAX_INV_n = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n   The `dp_inv[n][j]` values are `N_inv(j)`.\n2. Compute `n_fact = n! % MOD_DOUBLE`.\n3. Compute `Y = sum_{j=0}^{MAX_INV_n} (dp_inv[n][j])^2 % MOD_DOUBLE`.\n4. Compute `A_eq = (Y - n_fact + MOD_DOUBLE) % MOD_DOUBLE`. Then `A_eq = (A_eq // 2) % mod`. (This is the number of pairs `(p,q)` with `p <_lex q` and `inv(p)=inv(q)`)\n5. Compute `total_p_lt_q = (pow(n_fact, 2, MOD_DOUBLE) - n_fact + MOD_DOUBLE) % MOD_DOUBLE`. Then `total_p_lt_q = (total_p_lt_q // 2) % mod`. (This is the number of pairs `(p,q)` with `p <_lex q`)\n6. Finally, `A_gt = (total_p_lt_q - A_eq + mod) % mod`. Then `A_gt = (A_gt * pow(2, -1, mod)) % mod` if `mod` is odd.\n   If `mod` is even: `A_gt = ((total_p_lt_q - A_eq + MOD_DOUBLE) % MOD_DOUBLE // 2) % mod`.\n\nLet's re-verify the formula for `A_gt`.\n`A_gt + A_lt + A_eq = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2`\nWe also know that `sum_{p,q, inv(p)>inv(q)} 1 = sum_{p,q, inv(p)<inv(q)} 1`.\nThis implies `A_gt + B_gt = A_lt + B_lt`.\nSince `A_lt = B_gt` and `A_gt = B_lt`, this equation becomes `A_gt + A_lt = A_lt + A_gt`, which is an identity and doesn't help.\n\nThe symmetry `A_gt = A_lt` is specific to the constraint `p <_lex q`. It means that the number of pairs `(p, q)` with `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)` is equal to the number of pairs `(p, q)` with `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) < inv(q)`. This symmetry holds because for any given `p, q` such that `p <_lex q`, if we consider `p'` and `q'` such that `p' <_lex q'` and `inv(p') - inv(q') = -(inv(p) - inv(q))`, there is a bijection.\nConsider the permutation `rev(x)` which is `x` read backwards, or `complement(x)` where `x_i -> n+1-x_i`.\nThe transformation `p_i -> n+1-p_i` changes the number of inversions `k` to `MAX_INV - k`.\nIf `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`, it's not guaranteed that `complement(p)` is lexicographically smaller than `complement(q)`.\n\nLet `Inv(P)` be the set of inversions in `P`.\n`A_gt = sum_{p <_lex q} [inv(p) > inv(q)]`.\n`A_lt = sum_{p <_lex q} [inv(p) < inv(q)]`.\nIt is NOT generally true that `A_gt = A_lt`. The example `n=4` shows `A_gt = 17`.\nIf `A_gt = A_lt`, then `2*A_gt + A_eq = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2`.\nFor `n=4`, `n!=24`. `MAX_INV = 6`.\n`dp_inv[4][0]=1, dp_inv[4][1]=3, dp_inv[4][2]=5, dp_inv[4][3]=6, dp_inv[4][4]=5, dp_inv[4][5]=3, dp_inv[4][6]=1`.\n`Y = 1^2+3^2+5^2+6^2+5^2+3^2+1^2 = 1+9+25+36+25+9+1 = 106`.\n`n_fact = 24`.\n`A_eq = (Y - n_fact)/2 = (106 - 24)/2 = 82/2 = 41`.\n`total_p_lt_q = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2 = (24^2 - 24)/2 = (576 - 24)/2 = 552/2 = 276`.\nIf `A_gt = A_lt`, then `2*A_gt + A_eq = 276`. `2*A_gt + 41 = 276`. `2*A_gt = 235`. This is not an integer.\nSo `A_gt` is NOT equal to `A_lt`. The formula `A_gt = (((n!)^2 - n!)/2 - A_eq) / 2` is incorrect.\n\nThe problem requires direct calculation of `A_gt`.\nLet `dp[i][j][k]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `i` elements such that `inv(p') = j` and `inv(q') = k`. This is simply `dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][k]`.\nLet `dp_sum_diff[i][d]` be the sum of `dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][k]` such that `j-k = d`.\n`dp_sum_diff[i][d] = sum_j (dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][j-d])`.\nThis is also not directly helpful for lexicographical order.\n\nThe structure of the problem is similar to \"sum of inversions over all permutations\".\nLet `f[i][inv_p][inv_q]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p_1...p_i, q_1...q_i)` of `i` elements such that `p_1...p_i <_lex q_1...q_i`, `inv(p_1...p_i) = inv_p` and `inv(q_1...q_i) = inv_q`.\nThis state is too large. `i` up to 500, `inv_p, inv_q` up to 125000.\n\nLet's track `dp[i][j]` as the number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions. (This is `dp_inv` from before).\nLet `total_inv[i]` be the sum of inversions over all `i!` permutations of `i` elements.\n`total_inv[i] = sum_{j=0}^{MAX_INV_i} j * dp[i][j]`.\n`total_inv[i] = i * (i-1) / 2 * i! / 2`. No, this is `i! * (i*(i-1)/4)`.\nThe average number of inversions is `i*(i-1)/4`. So `total_inv[i] = i! * i*(i-1)/4`.\n\nConsider the `k`-th position where `p` and `q` first differ: `p_1=q_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}=q_{k-1}` and `p_k < q_k`.\nLet `prefix = p_1 \\ldots p_{k-1}`. Let `inv_prefix` be the inversions in `prefix`.\nLet `S_used = \\{p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}\\}`.\nLet `S_rem = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus S_used`.\nFor each choice of `prefix` (which is a permutation of `k-1` elements), and for each choice of `p_k=x, q_k=y` from `S_rem` with `x < y`:\n  `inv(p) = inv_prefix + count(s \\in S_used : s > x) + inv(x \\text{ with } p_{k+1} \\ldots p_n) + inv(p_{k+1} \\ldots p_n)`.\n  `inv(q) = inv_prefix + count(s \\in S_used : s > y) + inv(y \\text{ with } q_{k+1} \\ldots q_n) + inv(q_{k+1} \\ldots q_n)`.\nThis seems to be the correct decomposition.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions.\nLet `f[i][j]` be the sum of inversions of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions. No, this is not good.\n\nLet `dp[i][j][k]` be the total count of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `i` *remaining* elements, where `inv(p) = j` and `inv(q) = k`. This is `dp[i][j] * dp[i][k]`.\nThis is `dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][k]`.\nLet `dp_pairs_inv_diff[i][diff]` be the sum of `dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][k]` over all `j, k` such that `j-k = diff`.\n`dp_pairs_inv_diff[i][diff] = sum_{j=0}^{MAX_INV_i} dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][j-diff]`.\nThis can be computed using FFT/NTT (convolution), or directly by iterating `j`.\nThe range of `diff` is `[-MAX_INV_i, MAX_INV_i]`. Offset by `MAX_INV_i`.\n`MAX_INV_n = n*(n-1)/2`. Max `2*MAX_INV_n` states.\n`dp_pairs_inv_diff[i]` can be computed from `dp_inv[i]`.\nThe `dp_pairs_inv_diff` table will be `n` rows, `2 * MAX_INV_n` columns.\n`dp_pairs_inv_diff[i][offset + diff]`.\n`offset = MAX_INV_n`.\n\nLet `total_ans = 0`.\nIterate `k` from `1` to `n` (position of first difference).\nIterate `inv_pref` from `0` to `MAX_INV_{k-1}` (inversions in prefix `p_1...p_{k-1}`).\n  Iterate `count_pref` (number of such prefixes `p_1...p_{k-1}` with `inv_pref` inversions).\n  `count_pref = dp_inv[k-1][inv_pref]`.\n  Iterate `x` from `1` to `n` (value of `p_k`).\n    Iterate `y` from `x+1` to `n` (value of `q_k`).\n      We need to ensure `x, y` are not in `S_used`. And `S_used` is not explicitly tracked.\n\nThis means we need to sum over all possible prefixes `P = (p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1})`.\nA different DP state: `dp[k][inv_p_curr][inv_q_curr]`\n`dp[k][inv_p_curr][inv_q_curr]` = number of pairs of partial permutations `(p_1...p_k, q_1...q_k)`\n  such that `p_1...p_k <_lex q_1...q_k`, `inv(p_1...p_k) = inv_p_curr`, `inv(q_1...q_k) = inv_q_curr`.\nThis is still too complicated.\n\nLet's use the standard DP for counting `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`.\n`dp[i][j]` = sum of `inv(p) - inv(q)` over all pairs of permutations `(p,q)` of `i` elements using values `1..i`, such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`j` ranges from `-MAX_INV_i` to `MAX_INV_i`.\nThis DP state is `dp[i][j]` where `j` is the difference `inv(p)-inv(q)`.\n`dp[i][diff_idx]` is a dictionary or map, where `diff_idx = diff + MAX_INV_i`.\n`dp[i][d]` = `(count, sum_inv_p, sum_inv_q)` for `p <_lex q` with `inv(p) - inv(q) = d`.\nStill too complicated.\n\nLet's use the solution from a similar problem (e.g. AtCoder ABC224G - Cycle of Inversions) or standard competitive programming techniques for this kind of problem.\nThe problem is asking for a count, not a sum of differences.\nThe most common approach for `N` up to 500 in such permutation counting problems is DP on `i` (length of permutation) and `j` (number of inversions).\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions.\nLet `total_ans = 0`.\nLet `current_pairs[diff]` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `i` elements (from `1..i`), `p <_lex q`, `inv(p) - inv(q) = diff`.\nInitialize `current_pairs[0] = 0` for `i=0`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  Create `next_pairs[diff]`.\n  For each `prev_diff` in `current_pairs`:\n    For each `p_i` from `1` to `i`:\n      For each `q_i` from `1` to `i`:\n        // This is not how it works.

The argument that `A_gt = A_lt` is based on a specific transformation.\nLet `P = [p_1, \\ldots, p_n]` and `Q = [q_1, \\ldots, q_n]`.\nConsider the transformation `f(x) = (n+1-x_1, \\ldots, n+1-x_n)`.\nIf `P <_lex Q`, then `f(P)` is not necessarily `<_lex f(Q)`.\nFor example, `n=3`. `P=[1,2,3], Q=[1,3,2]`. `P <_lex Q`. `inv(P)=0, inv(Q)=1`.\n`f(P)=[3,2,1], f(Q)=[3,1,2]`. `f(Q) <_lex f(P)`. `inv(f(P))=3, inv(f(Q))=2`.\nThis transformation reverses lexicographical order.\nThe transformation `g(x) = (x_n, \\ldots, x_1)` reverses inversions AND lexicographical order.\n\nThe correct derivation for `A_gt`:\nLet `X_gt = sum_{p,q} [inv(p) > inv(q)]`.\nLet `X_lt = sum_{p,q} [inv(p) < inv(q)]`.\nLet `X_eq = sum_{p,q} [inv(p) = inv(q)]`.\nWe know `X_gt = X_lt = ((n!)^2 - X_eq) / 2`.\nAnd `X_eq = Y = sum_k N_inv(k)^2`.\n\nLet `L_gt = sum_{p,q} [p <_lex q]`.\n`L_gt = ((n!)^2 - n!) / 2`.\n\nWe want to calculate `A_gt = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nLet `S_total = (n!)^2`.\n`S_total = sum_{p,q} 1`.\nConsider the sum `sum_{p,q} (inv(p) - inv(q))`. This is 0.\nThis implies `sum_{p,q, inv(p) > inv(q)} (inv(p) - inv(q)) = sum_{p,q, inv(p) < inv(q)} (inv(q) - inv(p))`.\n\nThe total number of pairs `(p,q)` is `(n!)^2`.\nLet `N_0 = sum_{p,q : inv(p) = inv(q)} 1 = Y`.\nLet `N_1 = sum_{p,q : inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 = ((n!)^2 - Y)/2`.\nLet `N_2 = sum_{p,q : inv(p) < inv(q)} 1 = ((n!)^2 - Y)/2`.\n\nLet `M_0 = sum_{p,q : p = q} 1 = n!`.\nLet `M_1 = sum_{p,q : p <_lex q} 1 = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2`.\nLet `M_2 = sum_{p,q : p >_lex q} 1 = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2`.\n\nWe want `Ans = sum_{p,q : p <_lex q \\land inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nBy symmetry, `sum_{p,q : p >_lex q \\land inv(p) < inv(q)} 1 = Ans`.\nLet `A = sum_{p,q : p <_lex q \\land inv(p) = inv(q)} 1`.\nLet `B = sum_{p,q : p <_lex q \\land inv(p) < inv(q)} 1`.\nThen `Ans + A + B = M_1`.\n\nAlso, `N_1 = sum_{p,q : p <_lex q \\land inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 + sum_{p,q : p >_lex q \\land inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\n`N_1 = Ans + sum_{p,q : p >_lex q \\land inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nBy symmetry (swapping `p` and `q` and changing `_lex` order), `sum_{p,q : p >_lex q \\land inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 = B`.\nSo `N_1 = Ans + B`.\n\nWe have two equations:\n1. `Ans + A + B = M_1`\n2. `Ans + B = N_1`\n\nSubtracting (2) from (1): `A = M_1 - N_1`.\nSubstituting `M_1` and `N_1`:\n`A = (((n!)^2 - n!) / 2) - (((n!)^2 - Y) / 2) = (Y - n!) / 2`.\nThis is `A_eq` from earlier. This value can be calculated.\n\nNow, from (2), `Ans = N_1 - B`.\nFrom (1), `B = M_1 - Ans - A`.\nSubstitute `B` into `Ans = N_1 - B`:\n`Ans = N_1 - (M_1 - Ans - A) = N_1 - M_1 + Ans + A`.\nThis implies `0 = N_1 - M_1 + A`.\n`M_1 - N_1 = A`. This is the same as the equation for `A`. This doesn't directly give `Ans`.\n\nThe crucial symmetry is that `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) < inv(q)} 1` is NOT true.\nHowever, `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 + sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) < inv(q)} 1 = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 + sum_{p,q, p >_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nThis is `Ans + B = N_1`. This is correct.\n\nThe trick is from the property that `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} (inv(p) - inv(q)) = 0`.\nLet `f(p,q) = inv(p) - inv(q)`.\n`sum_{p,q, p <_lex q} f(p,q) = 0`.\nThis means `sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} (inv(p) - inv(q)) = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) < inv(q)} (inv(q) - inv(p))`.\nLet `S_diff_pos = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} (inv(p) - inv(q))`.\nLet `S_diff_neg = sum_{p,q, p <_lex q, inv(p) < inv(q)} (inv(q) - inv(p))`.\nSo `S_diff_pos = S_diff_neg`.\n\nLet `dp_inv[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` items with `j` inversions.\nLet `dp_inv_sum[i][j]` be `sum_{k=0}^j dp_inv[i][k]`.\nLet `dp_inv_weighted_sum[i][j]` be `sum_{k=0}^j k * dp_inv[i][k]`.\n\nLet `dp[k][inv_p_sum][inv_q_sum]` be the number of pairs of sequences `(p_1 \\ldots p_k, q_1 \\ldots q_k)` using `k` distinct values, such that `p_1 \\ldots p_k <_lex q_1 \\ldots q_k`, and `inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) = inv_p_sum`, `inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k) = inv_q_sum`. This is still too large.\n\nThe only way `N=500` is feasible is if the DP state depends only on `i` (number of elements remaining) and `diff` (difference in inversions).\nLet `dp[i][diff]` be the count of permutations of `i` elements with `inv(p) - inv(q) = diff`.\nActually, `dp[i][diff]` is `sum_{p,q \\text{ of } i \\text{ elements}} [inv(p) - inv(q) = diff]`.\n`dp[i][diff] = sum_{j} dp_inv[i][j] * dp_inv[i][j-diff]`.\nThis `dp` can be computed. `MAX_DIFF = MAX_INV_N`.\n`dp[i][diff_idx]` has `2 * MAX_INV_i + 1` states.\n`dp[i][diff_idx]` computed in `O(MAX_INV_i)`. Total `O(N * MAX_INV_N)`.\n\nWe need to compute `A_gt = sum_{p,q : p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nLet `dp_lex[k][diff]` be the number of pairs `(p', q')` of permutations of `k` elements, such that `p' <_lex q'` and `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff`.\n`k` from `0` to `n`. `diff` from `-MAX_INV_k` to `MAX_INV_k`.\n`dp_lex[0][0] = 1`. All other `dp_lex[0][diff] = 0`.\nTo calculate `dp_lex[k][diff]` from `dp_lex[k-1]`:\nIterate over `p_1, q_1`.\nCase 1: `p_1 = q_1 = x`.\n  For each `x \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}`:\n    `new_diff = old_diff`.\n    `dp_lex[k][new_diff] += dp_lex[k-1][old_diff]`.\n    This is not correct because the values change.\n    When `x` is chosen, it contributes `x-1` inversions.\n    The remaining elements `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{x\\}` are mapped to `\\{1, \\ldots, k-1\\}`.\n    `dp_lex[k][diff + (x-1) - (x-1)] += dp_lex[k-1][diff]`.\n    This implies `dp_lex[k][diff] = k * dp_lex[k-1][diff]`.\n\nCase 2: `p_1 < q_1`. Let `p_1 = x, q_1 = y`.\n  `x, y \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}`.\n  `inv(p) = (x-1) + inv(p')`. `inv(q) = (y-1) + inv(q')`.\n  `inv(p) - inv(q) = (x-1) - (y-1) + inv(p') - inv(q') = x-y + inv(p') - inv(q')`.\n  So `old_diff = diff - (x-y)`.\n  The permutations `p', q'` are of `k-1` elements from `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{x,y\\}`.\n  This means `dp_inv[k-1]` is not directly applicable.\n\nThe values `x` and `y` are from `1..k`.\nLet `dp_inv_count[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` distinct elements with `j` inversions.\nLet `dp_ans[i][j]` be the sum of `count` for `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\nThis `j` is relative to the remaining elements.\n`dp_ans[i][j]` is the number of pairs of permutations of `i` elements, `p <_lex q`, `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`dp_ans[0][0] = 1`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  For `j` from `-MAX_INV_i` to `MAX_INV_i`:\n    If `dp_ans[i][j] == 0`, continue.\n    // Case 1: `p_1 = q_1 = x`.\n    // The number of choices for `x` is `i+1`.\n    // `x` contributes `x-1` inversions to `p` and `q`.\n    // The remaining `i` elements are `\\{1..i+1\\} \\setminus \\{x\\}`.\n    // The relative order of these `i` elements is preserved.\n    // `new_j = j + (x-1) - (x-1) = j`.\n    `dp_ans[i+1][j] += dp_ans[i][j] * (i+1)`. (This is incorrect. It's not `i+1` choices for `x` for the next step, it's `i+1` total values available for the `k`-th position.)\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p_suffix, q_suffix)` of permutations of `i` elements, where `inv(p_suffix) - inv(q_suffix) = j`.\nThis is exactly `sum_{x} dp_inv[i][x] * dp_inv[i][x-j]`.\n`dp[i][j]` is `diff_counts[i][j + MAX_INV_i]`.\nThe total answer is `sum_{k=1}^n sum_{p_1..p_{k-1}} sum_{x<y \\text{ not in } p_1..p_{k-1}} sum_{diff>0} dp[n-k][diff + (x-1) - (y-1) + inv_x_prefix - inv_y_prefix]`.\nThis is the standard approach for this problem for `N=500`.\n\nLet `dp[i][diff]` be the count of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `i` elements such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = diff`.\n`dp[i][diff]` is calculated as: `sum_{inv_p} dp_inv[i][inv_p] * dp_inv[i][inv_p - diff]`.\n`dp[0][0] = 1`.\n`dp_inv[i]` is computed using prefix sums for `O(N * MAX_INV_N)`.\n`dp[i]` is computed using convolution for `O(N * MAX_INV_N)`.\nThis is `diff_counts` from earlier.\n\nLet `f[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`f[0][0] = 0` (no elements, no pairs).\n`f[i][j]` is sum of `f[i-1][j']` where `j'` is `j` minus contribution from `i`-th element.\nThis is difficult because of `p_k < q_k`.\n\nThe solution for this problem usually involves a DP state `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the length of the prefix already processed, and `j` is the difference `inv(p_prefix) - inv(q_prefix)`.\n`dp[i][j]` stores the sum over all choices of `p_1 \\ldots p_i` and `q_1 \\ldots q_i` (where `p_1 \\ldots p_i <_lex q_1 \\ldots q_i`) of `dp_inv[n-i][inv_p_suffix - inv_q_suffix]`.\nLet `ans[i][diff]` be the number of pairs `(p_1 \\ldots p_i, q_1 \\ldots q_i)` of permutations of `i` elements, such that `p_1 \\ldots p_i <_lex q_1 \\ldots q_i` and `inv(p_1 \\ldots p_i) - inv(q_1 \\ldots q_i) = diff`.\nThis is `O(N * MAX_INV_N^2)` which is too slow.\n\nThe actual solution for this problem is `O(N^4)` or `O(N^3)`.\n`N=500` means `O(N^3)` is likely.\nLet `dp_inv[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions.\nLet `dp_total[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `i` elements such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`dp_total[i][j] = sum_{x} (dp_inv[i][x] * dp_inv[i][x-j])`.\nThis is a `O(N * MAX_INV_N)` calculation.\n\nLet `ans = 0`.\n`prefix_dp[j]` stores `(count, sum_inv_p, sum_inv_q)` for prefixes.\nThis is too complex.\n\nFinal strategy:\n1. Compute `dp_inv[i][j]` = number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions.
