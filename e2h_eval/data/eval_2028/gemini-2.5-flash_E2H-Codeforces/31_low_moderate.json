Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Approach for Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem.  The core of it is pretty straightforward: Vanya's got some cards, each with a number between `-x` and `x`. He wants the total sum of all cards to be zero. He can *get* more cards, and he's after the *minimum* number of extra cards he needs to achieve this zero-sum goal.\n\nFirst, I need to get the \"lay of the land.\" I need to find the sum of the cards Vanya *already* has. That's my `current_sum`. Then, the difference from zero is the negative of that, meaning the amount he *needs* to find in additional cards. I'm going to store the absolute value of that needed sum as `needed_sum`, for simplicity.\n\nThe logic here is all about minimizing the cards. So, I need to use cards with the largest possible absolute values, which is `x`. I know that because it's the maximum value allowed on a single card. I'll need to calculate how many cards with value `x` I need. If the `needed_sum` is perfectly divisible by `x`, then it's a simple division. If it's not, I'll need one more card to cover the remainder.\n\nSo, the plan is: calculate the sum of the existing cards, figure out the absolute difference from zero, and then divide that by `x`, rounding up if there's a remainder. That gives me the answer. Simple, efficient, and direct. Let's get coding!\n",
