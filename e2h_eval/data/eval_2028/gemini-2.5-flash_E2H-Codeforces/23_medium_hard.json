            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tokitsukaze's Tile-Drawing Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the fewest extra tiles I need to draw to get a \"mentsu\" (that's either three matching tiles – a koutsu – or three sequential tiles of the same suit – a shuntsu). I start with just three tiles, and I can draw whatever I want, whenever I want.  \n\nMy first thought is, the answer will *never* be more than two draws. If I already have a mentsu (0 draws), that's easy. If one draw is enough, great. If not, two draws will *always* work - I can just match my existing tile with two new ones or complete a sequence.\n\nThe key is to represent these tiles in a structured way. I'll use tuples: `(number, suit)` like `(1, 's')` for \"1s\". Now, with three tiles, `t1, t2, t3`, I check three cases:\n\nFirst, zero draws: Can I make a mentsu with what I have? Check if they are all identical (koutsu). If not, are they sequential numbers of the same suit (shuntsu)? If yes, I'm done.\n\nIf zero draws fails, can I make it with one draw? This means I need to find a single tile, let's call it `t_draw`, such that adding it to my hand of initial tiles, I *can* make a mentsu (0 draws).  I need to check if there are two tiles in my *initial* hand that I can combine with one draw to make a mentsu.  I can draw this to be a koutsu with any other combination if a tile is the same as another; or a shuntsu if there are two tiles.\n\nIf this fails, the answer is two draws. I have to create all possible pairs among my original tiles: `(t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)`.\nFor each pair, if they have the same suit and the numbers are close (differ by 0, 1, or 2), one more draw is enough for the shuntsu!\n\nTo be efficient, I'll sort my initial tiles first. This will make checking for sequential numbers (shuntsu) super easy. Then, go through all possible pairs of those three sorted tiles, and test the situations to minimize my tile draws!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one \"mentsu\" (meld). A mentsu can be either a \"koutsu\" (triplet of three identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nThe minimum number of draws can be 0, 1, or 2. It cannot be more than 2, because with any single tile she possesses (e.g., \"1m\"), she can always draw two more tiles to form a mentsu (e.g., draw \"1m\", \"1m\" for a koutsu, or draw \"2m\", \"3m\" for a shuntsu).\n\nWe can solve this by checking possibilities in increasing order of draws:\n\n1.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    *   Can the initial three tiles form a koutsu? This means all three tiles must be identical.\n    *   Can the initial three tiles form a shuntsu? This means all three tiles must be of the same suit and their numbers must be consecutive (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n    *   If either condition is met, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    *   If 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if one additional tile can complete a mentsu. This implies that two of her existing tiles, plus one drawn tile, can form a mentsu.\n    *   **Koutsu potential:** If she has two identical tiles (e.g., \"1m\", \"1m\"), she can draw a third \"1m\" to form a koutsu. So, if any two of her initial three tiles are identical, the answer is 1.\n    *   **Shuntsu potential:** If she has two tiles of the same suit, say `(N, S)` and `(M, S)`:\n        *   If their numbers are consecutive (e.g., \"2m\", \"3m\"), she can draw `(N-1, S)` (if `N > 1`) or `(M+1, S)` (if `M < 9`) to form a shuntsu (e.g., draw \"1m\" or \"4m\").\n        *   If their numbers differ by 2 (e.g., \"2m\", \"4m\"), she can draw `(N+1, S)` (e.g., draw \"3m\") to form a shuntsu.\n        *   In general, if two tiles are of the same suit and their numbers differ by 0, 1, or 2, she can form a mentsu with one draw. (Difference 0 is covered by koutsu potential).\n    *   If any of these conditions are met, the answer is 1.\n\n3.  **Default to 2 draws:**\n    *   If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then by elimination, the answer must be 2. As explained, it's always possible to form a mentsu with 2 draws.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Represent tiles as tuples `(number, suit_character)`, e.g., \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`.\n*   Sort the initial three tiles. This makes checking for shuntsu easier, as we can assume `t1.number <= t2.number <= t3.number`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (3p 9m 2p):**\n1.  **Parse and sort:**\n    *   Initial tiles: `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')`.\n    *   Sorted hand: `h1=(2, 'p'), h2=(3, 'p'), h3=(9, 'm')`.\n\n2.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    *   **Koutsu:** `h1 == h2` is `(2, 'p') == (3, 'p')` which is false. Not a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Suits are 'p', 'p', 'm'. Not all same suit. Not a shuntsu.\n    *   Result: 0 draws not possible.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    *   **Koutsu potential:** Are any two tiles identical?\n        *   `h1 == h2`: `(2, 'p') == (3, 'p')` is false.\n        *   `h1 == h3`: `(2, 'p') == (9, 'm')` is false.\n        *   `h2 == h3`: `(3, 'p') == (9, 'm')` is false.\n        *   Result: Cannot form a koutsu with 1 draw from existing pair.\n    *   **Shuntsu potential:** Check pairs for same suit and number difference <= 2.\n        *   Pair `(h1, h2)`: `((2, 'p'), (3, 'p'))`.\n            *   Same suit ('p').\n            *   Number difference `abs(2 - 3) = 1`. This is `<= 2`.\n            *   Result: Yes, this pair can form a shuntsu with one draw (e.g., draw '1p' or '4p').\n    *   Since a shuntsu can be formed with 1 draw, the answer is 1.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper function to parse a tile string\n# A tile is represented as a tuple (number, suit_char)\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    number = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    return (number, suit)\n\n# Helper function to check if three tiles form a koutsu (triplet)\n# t1, t2, t3 are assumed to be tile tuples (number, suit)\ndef is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\n# Helper function to check if three tiles form a shuntsu (sequence)\n# t1, t2, t3 are assumed to be tile tuples (number, suit)\n# It's important that these three tiles are already sorted by number, then suit\n# for this function to correctly check for a sequence.\ndef is_shuntsu_sorted(t1, t2, t3):\n    n1, s1 = t1\n    n2, s2 = t2\n    n3, s3 = t3\n\n    # All must be of the same suit\n    if not (s1 == s2 and s2 == s3):\n        return False\n    \n    # Numbers must be sequential\n    return n1 + 1 == n2 and n2 + 1 == n3\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    tile_strings = line.split()\n\n    # Parse tiles and store them in a list\n    hand = [parse_tile(s) for s in tile_strings]\n    \n    # Sort the hand.
