Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to find the longest repeated substring within a given string. The string's length is limited to 100, composed of lowercase letters, and occurrences can overlap. This immediately suggests a brute-force approach might be feasible, given the length constraint. We'll need to generate and compare substrings. Let's break this down: iterate through all possible substrings, count their occurrences, and keep track of the maximum length of a substring seen at least twice.\n\n**Substrings & Overlapping Occurrences**\n\nA string of length *N* has *N*(N+1)/2 substrings. For N=100, that's only 5050 - not too computationally expensive. The key is correctly counting overlapping occurrences; standard `count()` isn't suitable. We'll need a custom function that uses `find()` to handle this overlap, ensuring an accurate count.\n\n**Initial Algorithm and Edge Cases**\n\nThe initial idea is: Loop through possible substring lengths (from 1 to *N*), for each length iterate through the string to extract substrings, for each extracted substring, count the overlapping occurrences and if we find a repeated substring, return its length.\n\nThinking about edge cases: An empty string is not valid, and strings with only a unique character must return 0. The case where every char is unique must return 0 too.\n\n**Complexity Analysis & Optimization**\n\nNow, the initial approach would lead to O(N^4) (N^2 generation * N counting + N for overall iteration). That's a little worrisome for N=100. We can optimize.  The trick is to iterate backward in substring length. As soon as we find a repeated substring of some length, we immediately return that length because there can't exist a larger length that is repeated. That changes the inner loop to a single visit from N^2 * N to N^2 (substring length) to O(N^3) total and O(N) for string search and counting. The use of a `set` to store substrings significantly speeds up duplicate checking, reducing that complexity.\n\n**The Optimized Solution**\n\nHere's the refined strategy:\n1.  Iterate `length` from *N*-1 down to 1 (longest to shortest).\n2.  For each `length`: iterate through every substring of that `length`\n3.  Store each found substring in a set.\n4.  If a substring is already in the set, we've found a repeat; return the `length`.\n5.  If we finish the outer loop without finding a duplicate, the answer is 0.\n\n**Implementation Details and Verification**\n\nThe solution will read the input string using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for clean input. I'll need to use nested loops to generate substrings and a `set` to efficiently check for repetitions. Let's do a few test cases on paper, just to make sure.  I'll test:\n-   `abcd` (should return 0)\n-   `zzz` (should return 2)\n-   `a` (returns 0)\n-   `aa` (returns 1)\n-   `ababab` (returns 4, overlapping `\"abab\"`).\nAll the tests pass.\n\nThe complexity is now O(N^3), perfect. This seems correct and efficient. Now to write and submit.\n",
