    "thought": "**Finding the Maximum of f(x) within a Range**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a function `f(x)` and the task is to maximize it within a specified range.  Let's break this down.  `f(x)` is defined in a bitwise way: it's the sum of certain `a_i` values.  Specifically, we include `a_i` in the sum only if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1. That much is straightforward.\n\nThe crucial constraint is the upper bound of the range.  We're dealing with `0 <= x <= m`, where `m` is given as a binary string `s0s1...sn-1`.  Initially, the indexing seemed a little tricky, but I've got it now. The string represents `m` in big-endian format, with `s0` corresponding to the most significant bit and `sn-1` the least significant. What threw me off slightly was the phrasing in the problem about how the string represented `m` – the formula `m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))` was a bit clunky.\n\nI've clarified the indexing of the array `a`: `a_i` corresponds to the bit `2^i`.  This is important. The string `s`, which defines `m`, is the representation of `m` in binary. If we consider `S[j]` to be the `j`-th bit of `m`, then `S[j] = s_{n-1-j}`.  This ensures the correct mapping between the binary string and the corresponding powers of two in the number `m`.\n\nSo, the objective is now clear: I need to craft an `x` within the range [0, m] that maximizes the sum of associated `a_i` values, determined by which bits in `x` are set, compared to the upper bound `m`. This suggests a dynamic programming or greedy approach might be viable. I'll need to explore how the binary representation of `x` interacts with the bits of `m` to find that optimal `x`. The core challenge is maximizing the sum while staying within the constraint imposed by the binary representation of `m`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum value of a function `f(x)` for `0 <= x <= m`. The function `f(x)` is defined as the sum of `a_i` for all `i` where the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1. The number `m` is given as a binary string `s0s1...sn-1`, where `s0` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `sn-1` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nLet's denote `S[i]` as the `i`-th bit of `m` (coefficient of `2^i`). So, `S[i]` corresponds to `s_{n-1-i}` from the input string `s`. `a_i` is associated with the `i`-th bit (position `2^i`).\n\nWe want to maximize `f(x) = sum(a_i)` for selected `i`s, such that the resulting `x` is less than or equal to `m`. This is a classic digit DP or greedy approach problem. We process the bits from most significant to least significant (from `n-1` down to `0`).\n\nLet `max_val` be the maximum `f(x)` found so far. Initialize `max_val = 0`.\nLet `current_sum` be the sum of `a_i` for bits that we have decided to set to 1 in `x` so far, such that `x` remains less than or equal to `m`. Initialize `current_sum = 0`.\n\nWe iterate from the most significant bit `i = n-1` down to the least significant bit `i = 0`.\n\nFor each bit position `i`:\n1.  **Consider setting the `i`-th bit of `x` to 0**: If we set the `i`-th bit of `x` to 0, `x` will definitely be less than or equal to `m` if all higher bits were set to 0. If `S[i]` is 1, and we set the `i`-th bit of `x` to 0, then `x` becomes strictly less than `m` at this position. This means all subsequent (less significant) bits of `x` (from `i-1` down to `0`) can be chosen freely to maximize `f(x)`, i.e., we can set them to 1 if `a_j > 0`. The maximum sum we can get from these remaining bits is `sum(a_j for j < i if a_j > 0)`. We update `max_val` with `current_sum + sum(a_j for j < i if a_j > 0)`.\n\n2.  **Consider setting the `i`-th bit of `x` to 1**: This is only possible if `S[i]` is 1 (i.e., the `i`-th bit of `m` is 1). If `S[i]` is 0, we cannot set the `i`-th bit of `x` to 1, because `x` would then exceed `m`.\n    If `S[i]` is 1, we can set the `i`-th bit of `x` to 1. In this case, we add `a_i` to `current_sum`. We continue to the next less significant bit (`i-1`), maintaining the constraint that `x` must match `m`'s prefix so far.\n\nAfter iterating through all bits from `n-1` down to `0`, the `current_sum` will hold the `f(x)` value for `x=m`. We should update `max_val` with this `current_sum` as well.\n\nTo efficiently calculate `sum(a_j for j < i if a_j > 0)`, we can precompute prefix sums of positive `a_j` values, or simply sort `a_j` values for `j < i` and take the largest ones. A simpler approach is to maintain a running sum of all positive `a_j` values.\nLet `suffix_max_a_sum[k]` be the sum of all `a_j` for `j < k` where `a_j > 0`. This can be precomputed.\n`suffix_max_a_sum[0] = 0`\n`suffix_max_a_sum[k] = suffix_max_a_sum[k-1] + a_{k-1}` if `a_{k-1} > 0`, else `suffix_max_a_sum[k-1]`.\n\nLet's refine the precomputation:\n`positive_a_sum[k]` will store `sum(a_j for j < k and a_j > 0)`.\nThis can be computed as:\n`positive_a_sum = [0] * (n + 1)`\n`for i in range(n):`\n`    positive_a_sum[i+1] = positive_a_sum[i]`\n`    if a[i] > 0:`\n`        positive_a_sum[i+1] += a[i]`\n\nNow, `sum(a_j for j < i if a_j > 0)` is simply `positive_a_sum[i]`.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1.  Read `n`, array `a`, and binary string `s`.\n2.  Precompute `positive_a_sum`:\n    `positive_a_sum = [0] * (n + 1)`\n    `for i in range(n):`\n    `    positive_a_sum[i+1] = positive_a_sum[i]`\n    `    if a[i] > 0:`\n    `        positive_a_sum[i+1] += a[i]`\n3.  Initialize `max_val = 0`, `current_sum = 0`.\n4.  Iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `0`:\n    a.  If `s[n-1-i]` (which is `S[i]`) is '1':\n        i.   This means `m` has its `i`-th bit set. We have two choices for `x`'s `i`-th bit:\n            *   Set `x`'s `i`-th bit to 0: In this case, `x` becomes strictly less than `m` at this position. We can then maximize the remaining sum by taking all positive `a_j` for `j < i`. The total sum would be `current_sum + positive_a_sum[i]`. Update `max_val = max(max_val, current_sum + positive_a_sum[i])`.\n            *   Set `x`'s `i`-th bit to 1: We add `a[i]` to `current_sum`. We must continue matching `m`'s prefix for subsequent bits.\n    b.  If `s[n-1-i]` (which is `S[i]`) is '0':\n        i.   We *must* set `x`'s `i`-th bit to 0, otherwise `x` would exceed `m`. There's no choice here to make `x` strictly less than `m` at this bit position by setting `x`'s `i`-th bit to 0. We simply continue to the next bit. (No `a[i]` is added to `current_sum` for this bit.)\n5.  After the loop finishes, `current_sum` will contain `f(m)`. Update `max_val = max(max_val, current_sum)`.\n6.  Print `max_val`.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `n=5`, `a=[17, 0, 10, 2, 1]`, `s=\"11010\"`\n`m` in binary is `11010`.\n`S[0]=0, S[1]=1, S[2]=0, S[3]=1, S[4]=1`.\n\n`positive_a_sum`:\n`positive_a_sum[0] = 0`\n`a[0]=17 > 0`: `positive_a_sum[1] = 17`\n`a[1]=0`: `positive_a_sum[2] = 17`\n`a[2]=10 > 0`: `positive_a_sum[3] = 17 + 10 = 27`\n`a[3]=2 > 0`: `positive_a_sum[4] = 27 + 2 = 29`\n`a[4]=1 > 0`: `positive_a_sum[5] = 29 + 1 = 30`\nSo, `positive_a_sum = [0, 17, 17, 27, 29, 30]`\n\n`max_val = 0`, `current_sum = 0`\n\n`i = 4` (`s[0]` is '1', `S[4]` is '1'):\n    *   Option 1: Set `x`'s 4th bit to 0. `x` becomes < `m`.

What is wrong?\n\nThe example output `27` for `m=11010_2` (`26` decimal) is `f(5) = f(00101_2) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27`.\nMy `positive_a_sum` is `[0, 17, 17, 27, 29, 30]`.\n`positive_a_sum[k]` is `sum(a_j for j < k if a_j > 0)`.\n`positive_a_sum[0]` means sum of `a_j` for `j < 0`, which is 0.\n`positive_a_sum[1]` means sum of `a_j` for `j < 1` (i.e. `a[0]`) if `a[0] > 0`. `a[0]=17`, so `positive_a_sum[1]=17`.\n`positive_a_sum[2]` means sum of `a_j` for `j < 2` (i.e. `a[0], a[1]`) if `a_j > 0`. `a[0]=17, a[1]=0`. So `positive_a_sum[2]=17`.\n`positive_a_sum[3]` means sum of `a_j` for `j < 3` (i.e. `a[0], a[1], a[2]`) if `a_j > 0`. `a[0]=17, a[1]=0, a[2]=10`. So `positive_a_sum[3]=17+10=27`. This is correct.\n\nLet's trace again for `f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27`.\n`x = 00101_2`.\n`m = 11010_2`.\n\n`i = 4`: `S[4]` is '1'.\n    *   Set `x`'s 4th bit to 0. `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` is 0.\n        `max_val = max(0, 0 + positive_a_sum[4]) = max(0, 29) = 29`.\n        This path leads to `x < m` at `i=4`. The remaining bits `0,1,2,3` can be chosen greedily. Max sum from `a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3` with positive values is `a_0 + a_2 + a_3 = 17 + 10 + 2 = 29`. This is `f(01101_2) = f(13)`. This `x=13` is indeed `<= m=26`. So `max_val=29` is a valid candidate.\n\n    *   Wait, the example says `f(5)=27`. This means `29` is not the answer. Why?\n    The problem is that my greedy choice of `positive_a_sum[i]` for `j < i` is always valid if `x` is already strictly less than `m`.\n    `f(5) = a_0 + a_2 = 17 + 10 = 27`.\n    `x = 00101_2`.\n    `m = 11010_2`.\n    The error must be in the problem statement's example output or my understanding of it.\n    \"In the second sample m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\"\n    The input `s` is `11010`.\n    This `s` string represents `m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0`.\n    For `n=5`, `s=\"11010\"`:\n    `m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0`\n    `m = 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 26`.\n    The example note says `m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11`.\n    This means the example note's `m` value is derived from a different binary string than `11010`.\n    If `m = 11`, its binary representation for `n=5` would be `01011`.\n    Let's re-run with `s = \"01011\"` (for `m=11`):\n    `S[0]=1, S[1]=1, S[2]=0, S[3]=1, S[4]=0`.\n\n    `max_val = 0`, `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 0`\n\n    `i = 4` (`S[4]` is '0'):\n        *   Must set `x`'s 4th bit to 0. `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` remains 0.\n\n    `i = 3` (`S[3]` is '1'):\n        *   Option 1 (x's 3rd bit is 0, x < m): `max_val = max(0, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[3]) = max(0, 0 + 27) = 27`.\n        *   Option 2 (x's 3rd bit is 1, continue matching m): `current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[3]` (2). `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 2`.\n\n    `i = 2` (`S[2]` is '0'):\n        *   Must set `x`'s 2nd bit to 0. `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` remains 2.\n\n    `i = 1` (`S[1]` is '1'):\n        *   Option 1 (x's 1st bit is 0, x < m): `max_val = max(27, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[1]) = max(27, 2 + 17) = 27`.\n        *   Option 2 (x's 1st bit is 1, continue matching m): `current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[1]` (0). `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 2 + 0 = 2`.\n\n    `i = 0` (`S[0]` is '1'):\n        *   Option 1 (x's 0th bit is 0, x < m): `max_val = max(27, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[0]) = max(27, 2 + 0) = 27`.\n        *   Option 2 (x's 0th bit is 1, continue matching m): `current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[0]` (17). `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 2 + 17 = 19`.\n\n    Loop ends.\n    `max_val = max(max_val, current_sum_for_matching_prefix) = max(27, 19) = 27`.\n\nThis matches the example output! The crucial part was to correctly interpret the example's `m` value, which indicates that the input `s` string is `m`'s binary representation, but the example note might have used a different interpretation or just provided `m` in a way that confused me. The problem statement clearly says `m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))`. So `s0` is `2^(n-1)` coefficient, `s1` is `2^(n-2)` coefficient, ..., `sn-1` is `2^0` coefficient. This is standard big-endian representation.\n\nMy initial interpretation of `s=\"11010\"` meaning `m=26` was correct based on the problem statement. The example note has `m=11` but provides `s=\"11010\"`. This implies `s=\"11010\"` *actually means* `01011` for `m=11` (reversed or something). Or the example note is just confusing. Given the problem statement `m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))`, `s=\"11010\"` for `n=5` means `m=26`.\nIf `m=26`, then `f(13) = a_0+a_2+a_3 = 17+10+2 = 29` is a valid answer.\n`13 = 01101_2`, `26 = 11010_2`. `13 <= 26`.\n\nLet's assume the example note is simply wrong about the value of `m` for the given input `s=\"11010\"`, and the input `s` should be interpreted strictly as `m = s0*2^(n-1) + ...`.\nIn this case, for `n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], s=\"11010\"`, the correct `m` is `26`.\nThe maximum `f(x)` for `x <= 26` is `29` (for `x=13`).\nIf the example output `27` is correct, then `m` must have been `11`.\nIf `m=11`, then `s` should have been `01011` (for `n=5`).\n\nThis is a common source of confusion in competitive programming: example outputs not matching strict interpretation of problem statement. Given that the problem states `s0s1...sn-1` is the binary representation of `m`, and `m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))`, this is standard big-endian. The example note's `m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 11` is inconsistent with `s=\"11010\"`. I will stick to the strict interpretation of the problem statement.\n\nThus, for `n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], s=\"11010\"`, `m=26`. The maximum should be `29`.\nThe example output `27` suggests that `m` was `01011_2` (decimal 11). This binary string is `s0=0, s1=1, s2=0, s3=1, s4=1`. This corresponds to `s` being `01011`.\nSo, if `s = \"11010\"` in the input means `m=11`, then it means the input string `s` is given *reversed* or `s_i` actually corresponds to `2^i`.\nLet's check the first example: `n=2, a=[3,8], s=\"10\"`.\nIf `s` is `s0s1...sn-1` and `m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))`:\n`m = s0*2^1 + s1*2^0 = 1*2 + 0*1 = 2`.\n`x <= 2`. `f(0)=0`, `f(1)=a0=3`, `f(2)=a1=8`. Max is `8`.\nOutput is `3`. This means `m` was `1`.\nIf `m=1`, then `s` should be `01` for `n=2`.\nThis suggests that `s_i` in the input string `s0s1...sn-1` corresponds to the `i`-th bit (coefficient of `2^i`), not `2^(n-1-i)`.\nSo `s0` is `2^0`, `s1` is `2^1`, etc.\nLet's re-read carefully: \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i)).\"\nThis is a contradiction.\n\"s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\" -> This usually means `s0` is MSB, `sn-1` is LSB.\n\"Number m equals sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i)).\" -> This explicitly states `s0` is coefficient of `2^(n-1)`, `s1` is coefficient of `2^(n-2)`, ..., `sn-1` is coefficient of `2^0`. This is consistent with `s0` being MSB.\n\nSo my interpretation `m=26` for `s=\"11010\"` is correct.\nWhy is the example output `3` for `s=\"10\"`?\n`n=2, a=[3,8], s=\"10\"`.\n`m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2`.\n`f(0)=0`, `f(1)=a0=3`, `f(2)=a1=8`. Max is `8`.\nThe output `3` means `m=1`.\nIf `m=1`, its binary representation is `01` for `n=2`.\nSo `s0=0, s1=1`.\nThis implies that `s0s1...sn-1` is meant to be `s_{n-1} s_{n-2} ... s_0` where `s_i` is the `i`-th bit.\nOr, `s_i` in the input string is the `i`-th bit of `m`, and `m = sum(s_i * 2^i)`.\nIf `s_i` in the input string is the `i`-th bit of `m` (coefficient of `2^i`), then for `s=\"10\"`:\n`s0='1'`, `s1='0'`.\n`m = s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 = 1*1 + 0*2 = 1`.\nThis matches the example output `3` (max `f(x)` for `x <= 1` is `f(1)=a0=3`).\n\nLet's check the second example with this interpretation: `s=\"11010\"`.\n`s0='1', s1='1', s2='0', s3='1', s4='0'`.\n`m = s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 + s2*2^2 + s3*2^3 + s4*2^4`\n`m = 1*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 + 1*8 + 0*16 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 11`.\nThis matches the example note `m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 11`.\nSo the problem statement `m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))` is misleading or incorrect. The input string `s0s1...sn-1` gives `s_i` as the `i`-th bit (coefficient of `2^i`).\n\nSo the correct interpretation of the input string `s` is: `s[j]` is the `j`-th bit of `m` (coefficient of `2^j`).\nThis means `S[j]` (the `j`-th bit of `m`) is `s[j]`.\nThe algorithm should be:\n1.  Read `n`, array `a`, and binary string `s`.\n2.  Precompute `positive_a_sum`:\n    `positive_a_sum = [0] * (n + 1)`\n    `for i in range(n):`\n    `    positive_a_sum[i+1] = positive_a_sum[i]`\n    `    if a[i] > 0:`\n    `        positive_a_sum[i+1] += a[i]`\n3.  Initialize `max_val = 0`, `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 0`.\n4.  Iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `0`:\n    a.  If `s[i]` is '1':\n        i.   This means `m` has its `i`-th bit set. We have two choices for `x`'s `i`-th bit:\n            *   Set `x`'s `i`-th bit to 0: In this case, `x` becomes strictly less than `m` at this position. The total sum would be `current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[i]`. Update `max_val = max(max_val, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[i])`.\n            *   Set `x`'s `i`-th bit to 1: We add `a[i]` to `current_sum_for_matching_prefix`. We must continue matching `m`'s prefix for subsequent bits.\n    b.  If `s[i]` is '0':\n        i.   We *must* set `x`'s `i`-th bit to 0, otherwise `x` would exceed `m`. `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` remains unchanged.\n5.  After the loop finishes, `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` will contain `f(m)`. Update `max_val = max(max_val, current_sum_for_matching_prefix)`.\n6.  Print `max_val`.\n\nThis revised algorithm matches the example outputs.\n\nLet's re-trace the second example with this final understanding:\n`n=5`, `a=[17, 0, 10, 2, 1]`, `s=\"11010\"`\n`m` is `01011_2` (decimal 11).\n`s[0]=1, s[1]=1, s[2]=0, s[3]=1, s[4]=0`.\n\n`positive_a_sum = [0, 17, 17, 27, 29, 30]` (same as before)\n\n`max_val = 0`, `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 0`\n\n`i = 4` (`s[4]` is '0'):\n    *   Must set `x`'s 4th bit to 0. `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` remains 0.\n\n`i = 3` (`s[3]` is '1'):\n    *   Option 1 (x's 3rd bit to 0, x < m): `max_val = max(0, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[3]) = max(0, 0 + 27) = 27`.\n    *   Option 2 (x's 3rd bit to 1, continue matching m): `current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[3]` (2). `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 2`.\n\n`i = 2` (`s[2]` is '0'):\n    *   Must set `x`'s 2nd bit to 0. `current_sum_for_matching_prefix` remains 2.\n\n`i = 1` (`s[1]` is '1'):\n    *   Option 1 (x's 1st bit to 0, x < m): `max_val = max(27, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[1]) = max(27, 2 + 17) = 27`.\n    *   Option 2 (x's 1st bit to 1, continue matching m): `current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[1]` (0). `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 2 + 0 = 2`.\n\n`i = 0` (`s[0]` is '1'):\n    *   Option 1 (x's 0th bit to 0, x < m): `max_val = max(27, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[0]) = max(27, 2 + 0) = 27`.\n    *   Option 2 (x's 0th bit to 1, continue matching m): `current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[0]` (17). `current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 2 + 17 = 19`.\n\nLoop ends.\n`max_val = max(max_val, current_sum_for_matching_prefix) = max(27, 19) = 27`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\nComplexity:\nTime:\n- Reading input: O(N)\n- Precomputing `positive_a_sum`: O(N)\n- Loop from `n-1` down to `0`: O(N) iterations, each O(1).\nTotal time complexity: O(N).\nSpace:\n- Storing `a`: O(N)\n- Storing `s`: O(N)\n- Storing `positive_a_sum`: O(N)\nTotal space complexity: O(N).\nGiven `N <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # positive_a_sum[k] will store sum(a_j for j < k if a_j > 0)\n    # This helps to quickly calculate the maximum possible sum from lower bits\n    # when x becomes strictly less than m.\n    positive_a_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        positive_a_sum[i+1] = positive_a_sum[i]\n        if a[i] > 0:\n            positive_a_sum[i+1] += a[i]\n\n    max_val = 0\n    # current_sum_for_matching_prefix stores the sum of a_j for bits j >= i\n    # that are set to 1 in x, where x's prefix matches m's prefix.\n    current_sum_for_matching_prefix = 0\n\n    # Iterate from most significant bit (n-1) down to least significant bit (0)\n    # The problem statement's example outputs imply that s[i] is the coefficient of 2^i.\n    # So s[n-1] is the most significant bit, s[0] is the least significant bit.\n    # This is contrary to the text \"m = sum(s_i * 2^(n-1-i))\" but consistent with examples.\n    # We use s[i] directly for the i-th bit.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # Case 1: The i-th bit of m is 1.\n            # Option A: Set the i-th bit of x to 0.\n            # This makes x strictly less than m at this bit position.\n            # For all subsequent bits (j < i), we can choose to set them to 1\n            # if a[j] > 0 to maximize the sum.\n            # The sum from these lower bits is positive_a_sum[i].\n            max_val = max(max_val, current_sum_for_matching_prefix + positive_a_sum[i])\n            \n            # Option B: Set the i-th bit of x to 1.\n            # We must continue to match m's prefix for lower bits.\n            # Add a[i] to current_sum_for_matching_prefix.\n            current_sum_for_matching_prefix += a[i]\n        else: # s[i] == '0'\n            # Case 2: The i-th bit of m is 0.\n            # We must set the i-th bit of x to 0, otherwise x would exceed m.\n            # current_sum_for_matching_prefix remains unchanged for this bit.\n            # No new option to make x strictly less than m at this bit position.\n            pass\n    \n    # After the loop, current_sum_for_matching_prefix holds f(m).\n    # This is the last possible value of x (x=m).\n    max_val = max(max_val, current_sum_for_matching_prefix)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_val) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
