He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. First, I need to figure out how to efficiently count those zeroes.  It's all about prime factorization, specifically the factors of 5.  The number of 5s in the prime factorization of `n!` determines the number of trailing zeroes, because there are always more 2s than 5s.\n\nI'll use Legendre's formula to calculate `Z(n)`, the number of trailing zeroes: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` This keeps going as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, let's look at how `Z(n)` behaves. It's non-decreasing; it either stays the same or goes up as `n` increases.  It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.  And the increase isn't always by 1. For example, when `n` hits 25, it jumps because of the `25/25` part in Legendre's formula. This means `Z(n)` doesn't necessarily take on every integer value.  There might be some `m` values that just don't have any corresponding `n`.\n\nCrucially, when `Z(n) = m` for some `n`, the following four values of Z will also equal m unless there is a multiple of 5. For example if `Z(5) = 1`, then `Z(6) = 1, Z(7) = 1, Z(8) = 1, Z(9) = 1`. This is important for the final output.  If I find one `n` that works, I know the next few (or all) numbers within a \"block of 5\" will, too, as `Z(n)` remains constant until the next multiple of 5. So, I will need to iterate and consider this pattern to output correctly.\n",
