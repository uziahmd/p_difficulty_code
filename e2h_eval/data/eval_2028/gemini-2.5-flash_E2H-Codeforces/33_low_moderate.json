You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Replacing Digits\" in Python**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem to tackle, and it's sounding like a classic optimization problem.  I need to take a number, represented as a string `a`, and a sequence of digits, also as a string `s`, and maximize the value of `a` by replacing digits in `a` with digits from `s`.  Each digit in `s` can only be used once, and each position in `a` can only be replaced once (makes sense - we only replace if it's an improvement).\n\n**The Core Strategy**\n\nMy instinct is to go greedy on this.  To make the number as large as possible, I need to maximize the most significant digits first.  So, I should iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right.  For each digit, I'll look for the *largest* digit in `s` that's greater than the current digit in `a`. If I find one, I replace it.  That's the core idea: go greedy, from the most to least significant digit.\n\n**Let's Outline the Steps**\n\n1.  **Input:** I'll read `a` and `s` as strings.\n2.  **Organize `s`:**  I need a way to efficiently check which digits from `s` are available and in what quantity. Sorting `s` in descending order *could* work, but a frequency map seems more versatile, allowing me to track counts.  A list `s_counts` of size 10 (one for each digit 0-9) seems ideal. I'll initialize it to zeros and then increment the count for each digit in `s`.\n3.  **Replacement Loop:** I'll convert `a` to a mutable list (because strings are immutable) `a_list`.  Then, I'll iterate through `a_list` from left to right.\n    *   For each digit `a_list[i]`, convert it to an integer `current_digit_a`.\n    *   I'll then search for a replacement digit `d` from `9` down to `current_digit_a + 1` (since I'm looking for a *larger* digit).\n    *   If `s_counts[d] > 0`, that means I have a `d` from `s` available to use. I'll replace `a_list[i]` with `str(d)`, decrement `s_counts[d]`, and `break` out of the inner loop to move to the next digit in `a`.\n4.  **Output:** Finally, I'll join `a_list` back into a string and print it.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Just to solidify the idea)**\n\nLet's say `a = \"1024\"` and `s = \"010\"`.\n\n*   I'd start with `a_list = ['1', '0', '2', '4']`.\n*   My frequency map `s_counts` would become `[2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. (two 0s, and a 1).\n*   For the first digit '1' at index 0, I'd check for digits greater than 1 from `s`. I'd find '1' exists. So no swap.\n*   For index 1 ('0'), I'd check for digits > 0.  I'd find '1' in `s` is available.  So I'd swap the '0' with '1'. Now `a_list` is `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. I'd decrement `s_counts[1]`.\n*   For index 2 ('2'), I can't find anything greater from the remainder of s.\n*   For index 3 ('4'), I can't find anything greater.\n*   The final result would be \"1124\"\n\nAlright, I think I've got a solid plan.  Time to code this up!\n",
