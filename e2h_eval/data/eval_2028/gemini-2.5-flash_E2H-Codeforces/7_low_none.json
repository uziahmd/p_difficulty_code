Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Snowflake - A Deep Dive into Vertex Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Rudolf and Snowflakes (hard version)\" problem. My immediate goal is to generate a Python script to solve it.  Let's start by dissecting the construction rules and figuring out the underlying formula for the number of vertices.\n\nFirst, we begin with a single central vertex – that's our base. Then, we introduce `k` new vertices, all linked directly to this center. This gives us `1 + k` vertices. These new vertices are currently \"leaf\" nodes.\n\nThe crux of the construction lies in this repeating step: any vertex that is only connected to one other vertex gets connected to `k` more vertices. We need to repeat this step at least once.\n\nLet's trace this process step-by-step:\n\n*   **Step 0:** One center vertex.\n*   **Step 1:** The center vertex gets connected to `k` new vertices, totaling `1 + k`. The `k` new vertices are leaves.\n*   **Step 2:** Each of the initial `k` leaf vertices connects to `k` more vertices, giving us `k * k = k^2` new vertices.  This means we now have `1 + k + k^2` vertices. The initial `k` are no longer leaves as they have been connected to `1 + k` vertices.\n*   **Step 3:** The new `k^2` vertices each connect to `k` more vertices, yielding `k^2 * k = k^3` new vertices. The total is now `1 + k + k^2 + k^3` vertices.\n\nThis continues – it's an iterative process. Let's call the number of times we apply that third rule (adding new vertices to existing leaves) `d`. The problem tells us that `d >= 1`.  \n\nWe can clearly see that if we apply the repeating rule `m - 1` times, the total number of vertices `n` will be the sum of a geometric series: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`.  Therefore, any valid number of vertices must have this form where `k` must be greater than 1, and `m` is at least 2. (This `m` essentially represents the \"depth\" of the snowflake.)  This is the key insight I need to encode in my script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a \"snowflake\" graph. A snowflake is constructed with a parameter `k > 1` and a depth `m >= 2`. The number of vertices `n` in such a snowflake is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`\n\nThis sum can be expressed as `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\nWe are given `n` (up to `10^18`) and need to find if there exist integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2` that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on `k` and `m`:\n\n**Case 1: `m = 2`**\nIf `m = 2`, then `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\nThis is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nWe can solve for `k` using the quadratic formula: `k = (-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4(1)(1 - n))) / 2`\n`k = (-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 + 4n)) / 2`\n`k = (-1 ± sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`\nFor `k` to be a positive integer, `4n - 3` must be a perfect square, say `s^2`, and `(-1 + s)` must be an even positive integer.\nSince `k > 1`, we need `(-1 + s) / 2 > 1`, which means `-1 + s > 2`, so `s > 3`.\nThe smallest `n` for `m=2` is when `k=2`, `n = 1+2+4 = 7`. `4*7-3 = 25 = 5^2`. `k = (-1+5)/2 = 2`.\nThis case can be checked efficiently. We calculate `s = sqrt(4n - 3)`. If `s` is an integer and `s > 3` and `(s - 1)` is even, then `k = (s - 1) / 2` is a valid `k`.\n\n**Case 2: `m >= 3`**\nWhen `m` is larger, `k` must be smaller for `n` to remain within `10^18`.\nFor a fixed `m`, `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m`.\nWe can approximate `n` as `k^m`. So `k` is roughly `n^(1/m)`.\nSince `k > 1`, the smallest `k` is `2`.\nIf `k = 2`, `n = 1 + 2 + ... + 2^m = 2^(m+1) - 1`.\nIf `n = 10^18`, then `2^(m+1) - 1 <= 10^18`, so `2^(m+1) <= 10^18 + 1`.\n`m+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1) approx log2(10^18) = 18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.32 = 59.79`.\nSo `m+1` can be at most `59`, which means `m` can be at most `58`.\nThis implies that `m` only needs to be checked up to around `58`.\n\nFor each `m` from `3` to `58` (or `59`), we need to find if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `1 + k + ... + k^m = n`.\nThis is equivalent to finding an integer `k > 1` such that `k^0 + k^1 + ... + k^m - n = 0`.\nWe can use binary search to find `k` for a fixed `m`.\nThe range for `k` is `[2, N_max^(1/m)]`.\nFor `m=3`, `k <= (10^18)^(1/3) = (10^6)`.\nFor `m=58`, `k <= (10^18)^(1/58) approx 2`. So `k` can only be `2`.\n\nThe binary search for `k` would work as follows:\nFor a fixed `m` (from `3` to `58`):\n  Set `low = 2`, `high = ceil(n^(1/m)) + 2`. (Adding 2 for safety, `n^(1/m)` might be slightly off due to floating point precision). A tighter upper bound for `k` is `min(2*10^9, (int(n**(1/m))) + 3)` to avoid overflow for `k^m` if `k` is too large.\n  While `low <= high`:\n    `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n    Calculate `current_sum = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^m`.\n    Be careful to check for `current_sum` overflow if `mid` is large. If `mid^m` or any intermediate term exceeds `n`, `current_sum` will definitely exceed `n`.\n    If `current_sum == n`, we found a solution. Return \"YES\".\n    If `current_sum < n`, `mid` is too small. `low = mid + 1`.\n    If `current_sum > n`, `mid` is too large. `high = mid - 1`.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n\n1.  **Handle `n < 7`:** For `n=1,2,3,4,5,6`, no such snowflake exists. The smallest snowflake has `n=7` (for `k=2, m=2`). So for `n < 7`, output \"NO\".\n\n2.  **Check `m = 2`:**\n    *   Calculate `val = 4 * n - 3`.\n    *   Calculate `s = int(val**0.5)`.\n    *   If `s * s == val` (meaning `val` is a perfect square) AND `s > 3` AND `(s - 1) % 2 == 0` (meaning `s-1` is even, so `k` is an integer), then `k = (s - 1) // 2` is a valid `k > 1`. Output \"YES\".\n\n3.  **Check `m >= 3`:**\n    *   Iterate `m` from `3` up to `59`. (A slightly larger upper bound like `60` or `64` is also fine, as `k` will quickly become 1 for larger `m`).\n    *   For each `m`, perform a binary search for `k` in the range `[2, 2 * 10^9]`. (Upper bound `2*10^9` is safe because `(2*10^9)^3` already exceeds `10^18`).\n        *   `low = 2`, `high = 2 * 10^9`.\n        *   Inside the binary search loop:\n            *   `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n            *   Calculate `current_sum = 0`.\n            *   `term = 1`.\n            *   For `i` from `0` to `m`:\n                *   Add `term` to `current_sum`.\n                *   Check for overflow: if `current_sum > n`, break the inner loop (sum is too large).\n                *   If `i < m`, calculate next `term = term * mid`. Check for overflow: if `term` would exceed `n` (e.g., `term > n / mid` if `mid > 0`), break.\n            *   If `current_sum == n`, we found a solution. Output \"YES\" and terminate for this test case.\n            *   If `current_sum < n`, `low = mid + 1`.\n            *   If `current_sum > n`, `high = mid - 1`.\n\n4.  **If no solution found after all checks:** Output \"NO\".\n\n**Example walkthrough for `n=13`:**\n1. `n=13 >= 7`.\n2. Check `m=2`:\n   `val = 4 * 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49`.\n   `s = int(49**0.5) = 7`.\n   `s * s == 49` is true. `s > 3` is true. `(s - 1) % 2 == 0` (i.e., `6 % 2 == 0`) is true.\n   `k = (7 - 1) // 2 = 3`.\n   A snowflake with `k=3, m=2` has `1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13` vertices.\n   Output \"YES\".\n\n**Example walkthrough for `n=10^18`:**\n1. `n=10^18 >= 7`.\n2. Check `m=2`:\n   `val = 4 * 10^18 - 3`.\n   `s = int((4 * 10^18 - 3)**0.5)`. This is `int(sqrt(4 * 10^18)) = int(2 * 10^9)`.\n   Let `s_exact = 2 * 10^9`. Then `s_exact^2 = 4 * 10^18`.\n   `val = 4 * 10^18 - 3`. This is not a perfect square. So `m=2` fails.\n3. Check `m >= 3`:\n   Iterate `m` from `3` to `59`.\n   For `m=3`: binary search for `k`. `k^3 approx 10^18`, so `k approx 10^6`.\n     If `k=100000`, `1+k+k^2+k^3 = 1+10^5+10^{10}+10^{15}` (too small)\n     If `k=1000000`, `1+k+k^2+k^3 = 1+10^6+10^{12}+10^{18}`. This sum is `10^18 + 10^{12} + 10^6 + 1`. This is `1000001000001000001` which is greater than `10^18`.\n     So for `k=10^6`, the sum is greater than `n`. The binary search would try smaller `k`.\n     It will be found that no integer `k` works for `m=3`.\n   ... and so on for other `m` values.\n   Eventually, no `k` will be found for any `m`. Output \"NO\".\n\nThe maximum value of `k` to check in binary search for `m=3` is `10^6`. For larger `m`, `k` becomes smaller.\nThe maximum value of `m` is `59`.\nThe binary search for `k` takes `log(2*10^9)` steps, which is about `31` steps.\nInside the binary search, calculating `current_sum` takes `m` steps.\nTotal time complexity: `T * (log(N) + M_max * log(K_max) * M_max)`.\n`T` test cases, `log(N)` for `m=2` check (sqrt operation), `M_max` for loop over `m`, `log(K_max)` for binary search, `M_max` for sum calculation.\n`10^4 * (1 + 60 * 31 * 60)` operations is roughly `10^4 * 10^5 = 10^9`, which might be too slow.\nThe `current_sum` calculation inside the binary search can be optimized. `term` can be `mid**i`.\nThe overflow check for `term = term * mid` needs to be `if term > n // mid`. This is critical.\nThe actual `current_sum` calculation is `O(m)`.\n`M_max` is about `60`. So `60` iterations for `m`.\n`log(K_max)` is about `31` for `k` binary search.\n`M_max` for calculating `current_sum` is `60`.\nTotal operations per test case: `~ 60 * 31 * 60 = 111600`.\n`10^4 * 111600 = 1.1 * 10^9`. This is too slow.\n\nWait, `current_sum` calculation:\n`term = 1`\n`current_sum = 0`\n`for i in range(m + 1):`\n  `current_sum += term`\n  `if current_sum > n:` (overflow check 1)\n    `current_sum = n + 1` (mark as overflowed)\n    `break`\n  `if i < m:`\n    `if mid > n // term:` (overflow check 2 for `term * mid`)\n      `term = n + 1` (mark as overflowed)\n      `break`\n    `term *= mid`\nThis is `O(m)` operations for `current_sum`.\n\nThe maximum `k` for `m=3` is `10^6`. `log(10^6) approx 20`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=4` is `10^(18/4) = 10^4.5 approx 31622`. `log(31622) approx 15`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=5` is `10^(18/5) = 10^3.6 approx 3981`. `log(3981) approx 12`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=6` is `10^(18/6) = 10^3 = 1000`. `log(1000) approx 10`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=7` is `10^(18/7) approx 500`. `log(500) approx 9`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=8` is `10^(18/8) approx 177`. `log(177) approx 8`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=9` is `10^(18/9) = 100`. `log(100) approx 7`.\nThe maximum `k` for `m=10` is `10^(18/10) approx 63`. `log(63) approx 6`.\nFor `m >= 60`, `k` must be `2` (or `1`, which is not allowed).\nSo the `high` bound for binary search should be `min(2 * 10^9, int(n**(1.0/m)) + 2)`.\nThis makes the `log(K_max)` much smaller for larger `m`.\nThe `K_max` for `m=3` is `10^6`. `log(10^6)` is about `20`.\nSo, `60 * 20 * 60 = 72000`.\n`10^4 * 72000 = 7.2 * 10^8`. This is still borderline for 1-2 seconds.\nHowever, `current_sum` calculation is `m` iterations, but `term` can overflow quickly. If `mid` is large, `term` will exceed `n` very fast.\nFor example, if `m=30`, `mid=3`. `term` will reach `3^30` quickly. `3^30` is `2 * 10^14`.\nThe `m` iterations inside `current_sum` calculation will often break early due to `term` or `current_sum` exceeding `n`.\nThe actual complexity of `current_sum` for a given `mid` will be `min(m, log_mid(n))`.\nIn the worst case, `m` is `60`, `mid` is `2`. `log_2(10^18)` is `60`. So it's still `60`.\nSo the `M_max` for sum calculation is `log_2(N_max)`.\nThe actual complexity is `T * (M_max * log(K_max) * log_2(N_max))`.\n`10^4 * 60 * 20 * 60 = 7.2 * 10^8`. This should pass within 2 seconds. Python is slower, so it might be tight.\nLet's make sure the bounds are correct.\nFor `m=3`, `k_max = (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`. `log2(10^6) approx 19.9`. So binary search is `~20` iterations.\nFor `m=59`, `k_max = (10^18)^(1/59) approx 2.01`. So `k` can only be `2`. Binary search is `~1` iteration.\nThe `M_max` for the sum calculation is `m+1`. Max `60`.\nSo the sum is `sum(m_i * log(K_i) * m_i)` over `m_i`.\nThis suggests the total operations are less than `M_max * log(K_max) * M_max`.\n\nLet's check the Python `pow` function or `**` operator. `pow(mid, i)` is `O(log i)`.\nIf we calculate `current_sum` as `sum(mid**i for i in range(m+1))`, it's `O(m log m)`.\nSo `M_max * log(K_max) * M_max * log(M_max)`. This is definitely too slow.\nThe iterative calculation of `term` (`term *= mid`) is `O(1)` per term, making the sum `O(m)`. This is the correct way.\n\nFinal check on bounds and edge cases:\n`n=1,2,3,4,5,6`: NO.\n`n=7`: YES (k=2, m=2)\n`n=13`: YES (k=3, m=2)\n`n=15`: YES (k=2, m=3) `1+2+4+8 = 15`.\n`n=255`: YES (k=2, m=7) `2^8 - 1 = 255`.\n`n=10101`: YES (k=10, m=3) `1+10+100+1000 = 1111` (No)\n`10101 = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3`.

So `k=2`.\n`k=2`. `1+2+...+2^9 = 2^10-1 = 1023` (too small)\n`k=3`. `1+3+...+3^9 = (3^10-1)/2 = (59049-1)/2 = 29524` (too large)\nSo `m=9` fails.\n`m=10`. `k^10 approx 10101`. `k approx (10101)^(1/10) approx 2.5`. So `k=2`.\n`k=2`. `1+2+...+2^10 = 2^11-1 = 2047` (too small)\n`k=3`. `1+3+...+3^10 = (3^11-1)/2 = (177147-1)/2 = 88573` (too large)\nSo `m=10` fails.\n... This is getting tedious. The example output says `10101` is YES.\nIs there an error in my `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)` formula or `m >= 2` condition?\n\"This step should be done at least once.\"\nInitial: 1 vertex.\nConnect center to `k` new vertices. Total `1+k`. These `k` vertices are leaves.\nApply rule: each of these `k` leaves connects to `k` new vertices. Total `1+k+k^2`. This is `m=2`.\nIf this step is done exactly once, `m=2`.\nIf this step is done twice, `1+k+k^2+k^3`. This is `m=3`.\nSo `m` is the number of layers *after* the center. The center is layer 0. The `k` branches are layer 1. The `k^2` branches are layer 2.\nSo `m` is the maximum depth of a branch from the center.\nThe problem states \"This step should be done at least once.\" This means `m` must be at least `2`.\nMy interpretation of `m >= 2` is correct.\n\nLet's recheck `n=10101` in the example. The example output is `YES`.\nThis means there must be some `k, m` for `10101`.\nMy manual check above for small `m` didn't find it.\nLet's try the `m=2` case for `10101`:\n`4 * 10101 - 3 = 40404 - 3 = 40401`.\n`sqrt(40401) = 201`.\n`s = 201`. `s * s = 40401`.\n`s > 3` is true. `(s - 1) % 2 == 0` is true (`200 % 2 == 0`).\n`k = (201 - 1) // 2 = 100`.\nSo for `k=100`, `m=2`, `n = 1 + 100 + 100^2 = 1 + 100 + 10000 = 10101`.\nAha! `n=10101` is indeed a snowflake for `k=100, m=2`.\nMy manual checks were only for `m >= 3`. The `m=2` case is handled by the quadratic formula.\n\nThe algorithm seems robust. The time complexity `7.2 * 10^8` might be acceptable for Python if the constant factor is small.\nPython's arbitrary precision integers handle large numbers automatically, so no explicit overflow checks are needed for `term * mid` or `current_sum += term` as long as `n` fits in memory. However, comparing `current_sum` to `n` and `term` to `n / mid` is still important to avoid computing excessively large numbers that are clearly greater than `n`.\nFor example, `mid**(m+1)` could be `(2*10^9)^60` which is extremely large. Python would compute it, but it would be very slow.\nSo, the overflow checks `if current_sum > n: break` and `if mid > n // term: break` are absolutely necessary for performance.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n < 7: # Smallest snowflake is 1+2+4=7 (k=2, m=2)\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Check m = 2 case: n = 1 + k + k^2\n    # k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(1 - 4(1)(1-n))) / 2\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2\n    discriminant = 4 * n - 3\n    s = int(math.isqrt(discriminant)) # integer square root\n\n    if s * s == discriminant: # Check if discriminant is a perfect square\n        # k = (-1 + s) / 2\n        # For k to be an integer, (-1 + s) must be even, so s must be odd.\n        # For k > 1, (-1 + s) / 2 > 1 => -1 + s > 2 => s > 3.\n        if (s - 1) % 2 == 0 and s > 3:\n            # k = (s - 1) // 2\n            # We don't need to actually calculate k, just know it exists.\n            print(\"YES\")\n            return\n\n    # Check m >= 3 cases: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n    # Max m is around 59-60 for k=2 and n=10^18 (2^60-1 approx 10^18)\n    # Min k is 2.\n    for m in range(3, 61): # Iterate m from 3 up to 60 (inclusive)\n        # For a fixed m, we need to find k.\n        # k^m < n < (k+1)^m (roughly)\n        # So k is roughly n^(1/m)\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        # Upper bound for k: if k^m > n, then k is too large.\n        # Since n <= 10^18, and m >= 3, k <= (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6.\n        # For larger m, k is even smaller.\n        # A safe upper bound for k is 2 * 10^9, as k^3 would exceed 10^18.\n        # For m=3, k approx 10^6.
