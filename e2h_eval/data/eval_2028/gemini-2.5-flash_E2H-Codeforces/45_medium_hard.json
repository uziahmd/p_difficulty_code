There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Tennis Tournament Games**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. We're looking at a knockout tennis tournament with a specific rule: players can only compete if their prior game counts differ by at most one. The goal is to maximize the number of games the *winner* plays.\n\nFirst, I realized that a player who has played 'k' games must have *won* all 'k' games. This means to maximize the winner's games, we need to carefully \"construct\" the tournament. The tournament naturally forms a binary tree structure. Each node is a game, and the winner is at the root.\n\nI introduced this function: `f(k)`, which is the minimum number of players needed to produce a winner who has played 'k' games.  `f(0)` isn't really useful because the winner must play *at least* one game. `f(1)` is straightforward (2 players), and `f(2)` is the first interesting case.  Building up these cases helped me to see a pattern.\n\nI realized that this problem is best tackled as a dynamic programming (DP) problem. I defined `dp[k]` as the minimum number of players needed for a winner to have played 'k' games. It turned out that `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`. This is because to get a winner at game 'k', you need either two players at `k-1` games or a player at `k-1` and a player at `k-2` games. Since we seek the minimum number of players, `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` is always optimal.\nInterestingly, that recurrence relationship is *the Fibonacci sequence* (shifted a bit, starting from 2,3,5,...).\n\nEssentially, `dp[k]` is the *(k+2)th* Fibonacci number.  We have 'n' players and need to find the largest 'k' for which `dp[k] <= n`. Finding this k reduces to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to 'n'.\n\nSince 'n' can be large (up to 10^18), I need an efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers, which I can do iteratively. The final solution becomes finding `k` (games played) such that `F_{k+2}` (F being the Fibonacci Sequence) does not exceed the number of initial players and returns `k`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. All players must win all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games. We want to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\n\nLet's establish the base cases for `dp[k]`:\n- To have a player who has played 0 games, we just need that player. So, `dp[0] = 1`. (This represents a player who hasn't played yet, but could potentially become the winner.)\n- To have a winner who has played 1 game: This player (P) must have played 0 games, and beaten an opponent (O) who also played 0 games. The rule `|0 - 0| <= 1` is satisfied. This requires P and O, so 2 players in total. Thus, `dp[1] = 2`.\n\nNow let's derive the recurrence for `dp[k]` for `k >= 2`.\nSuppose a player (let's call them W for \"winner-to-be\") has already played `k-1` games and won all of them. To play their `k`-th game, W needs an opponent (O).\nW has played `k-1` games. Let O have played `k_O` games. According to the rule, `|(k-1) - k_O| <= 1`. This means `k_O` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nHowever, since O is about to lose to W, O cannot have played more games than W (i.e., `k_O` cannot be `k`). If O had played `k` games, O would have won `k` games, while W has only won `k-1` games. If W then beats O, it would mean W (with `k-1` wins) beats O (with `k` wins), which is contradictory to O having won `k` games.\nSo, O must have played either `k-2` or `k-1` games.\n\nThere are two ways W can play its `k`-th game:\n1.  W (who has played `k-1` games) plays against O (who has played `k-1` games).\n    -   This scenario requires `dp[k-1]` players to produce W, and `dp[k-1]` players to produce O.\n    -   Total players needed: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1] = 2 * dp[k-1]`.\n    -   The rule `|(k-1) - (k-1)| <= 1` (i.e., `0 <= 1`) is satisfied.\n\n2.  W (who has played `k-1` games) plays against O (who has played `k-2` games).\n    -   This scenario requires `dp[k-1]` players to produce W, and `dp[k-2]` players to produce O.\n    -   Total players needed: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n    -   The rule `|(k-1) - (k-2)| <= 1` (i.e., `|1| <= 1`) is satisfied.\n\nSince we want the *minimum* number of players required for `dp[k]`, we take the minimum of these two options:\n`dp[k] = min(2 * dp[k-1], dp[k-1] + dp[k-2])`.\nGiven that `dp` values are non-decreasing (`dp[k-2] <= dp[k-1]`), it's clear that `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` will always be less than or equal to `2 * dp[k-1]`.\nTherefore, the recurrence relation simplifies to `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence! Let's map our `dp` values to the standard Fibonacci sequence `F_i` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`:\n-   `dp[0] = 1` (which is `F_2`)\n-   `dp[1] = 2` (which is `F_3`)\n-   `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3` (which is `F_4`)\n-   `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5` (which is `F_5`)\nIn general, `dp[k] = F_{k+2}`.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nWe can find this `k` by iteratively calculating Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to use an iterative approach (Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large numbers automatically). Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the number of iterations will be small (around 90 for `10^18`).\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `f0 = 1` (representing `dp[0] = F_2`).\n2. Initialize `f1 = 2` (representing `dp[1] = F_3`).\n3. Initialize `games = 1` (this is the `k` value corresponding to `f1`).\n4. Loop while `f1 <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `next_f = f0 + f1`.\n   b. Update `f0` to `f1`.\n   c. Update `f1` to `next_f`.\n   d. Increment `games` by 1.\n5. When the loop terminates, `f1` is the first Fibonacci number (`dp[games]`) that is greater than `n`. The previous value of `games` (which was `games - 1`) corresponds to the largest `k` for which `dp[k] <= n`. So, the result is `games - 1`.\n\nExample with `n=10`:\n- Initial: `f0=1, f1=2, games=1`.\n- Iteration 1: `f1=2 <= 10` (True). `next_f = 1+2=3`. `f0=2, f1=3, games=2`. (`dp[2]=3` players for 2 games)\n- Iteration 2: `f1=3 <= 10` (True). `next_f = 2+3=5`. `f0=3, f1=5, games=3`. (`dp[3]=5` players for 3 games)\n- Iteration 3: `f1=5 <= 10` (True). `next_f = 3+5=8`. `f0=5, f1=8, games=4`. (`dp[4]=8` players for 4 games)\n- Iteration 4: `f1=8 <= 10` (True). `next_f = 5+8=13`. `f0=8, f1=13, games=5`. (`dp[5]=13` players for 5 games)\n- Iteration 5: `f1=13 <= 10` (False). Loop terminates.\n- Result: `games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example outputs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for dp[k]: minimum players for winner to play k games\n    # dp[0] = 1 (F_2)\n    # dp[1] = 2 (F_3)\n    \n    # f0 will store dp[k-1] (or F_{k+1})\n    # f1 will store dp[k] (or F_{k+2})\n    # games_played will store k\n    \n    # Initialize for k=1 games played\n    f0 = 1  # Represents dp[0] (F_2)\n    f1 = 2  # Represents dp[1] (F_3)\n    games_played = 1 # The number of games corresponding to f1 (dp[1])\n\n    # Iterate to find the largest k such that dp[k] <= n\n    while f1 <= n:\n        # Calculate dp[k+1] = dp[k] + dp[k-1]\n        next_f = f0 + f1\n        f0 = f1\n        f1 = next_f\n        games_played += 1\n    \n    # When the loop exits, f1 is the first dp value that is > n.\n    # The previous games_played value (games_played - 1) is the maximum k\n    # for which dp[k] <= n.\n    print(games_played - 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
