Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so here's the deal. I'm tackling this competitive programming problem called \"Feed the Golorp.\" The goal is to figure out the lexicographically smallest sequence of numbers that satisfy a program defining the Golorp's diet. The input looks like a strange string with variables and constraints, like a bizarre Prolog statement.\n\nFirst things first, I needed to understand the \"Golorp's name\" language. I started dissecting the sample inputs and outputs. It became clear that the variables are represented by underscores (`_`) and that the length of these underscore sequences somehow defines their meaning. This seemed to be the key to unlocking the problem. After a bit of head-scratching, I formulated a hypothesis. It looks like each sequence of underscores (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) in the *expression* part of the Golorp's name maps to a specific variable. However, crucially, and this was the tricky part, variables of the same length must always share the same value! The output should give you the values for variables, or variable types, which have lengths corresponding to each unique underscore group in the expression, presented in the original order that they appear. The constraints then restrict these assigned values.\n\nI then realized I needed to check this theory against sample inputs. The samples had these weird expressions, like arithmetic problems. I suspected the operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) would be handled with normal precedence. So, I figured the program evaluates this expression *given* a set of variable values, then *checks* the constraints and confirms its solution.\n\nThe key is in finding the *correct interpretation* of constraints. If a constraint is like `___ > __`, it essentially restricts the *values* assigned to variables of length 3 to be greater than variables of length 2, but only when both variables exist within the *expression* and there is at least one constraint with each of those respective lengths. This is a very interesting constraint, and a potential \"red flag.\" It implies that all underscores of length 3 share the same value, and all underscores of length 2 also share a single value. So, there is effectively a limited number of \"independent\" variables to brute force.\n\nThe expression must also be valid! No division by zero is allowed. I would need to find the lexicographically *smallest* valid assignment of values. This screamed \"backtracking\" to me, but I needed to minimize the \"brute-force\" search.\n\nThe strategy is to parse the input string into expression and constraints, identify the distinct lengths of underscore sequences in the expression, and then iterate through the variables that appear in order, starting each variable's potential value from `0`. Constraints help me determine the valid combinations.\n\nThe most difficult part is parsing the expression and constraints. I would need to tokenize the expressions, identify the variables, and store them correctly, which would be the tricky part. For each potential value, I'll need to check the constraints and re-evaluate the expression. This should be manageable with some careful coding and some recursion, and pruning.\n\nSo, in the end, it's about making sure I have a correct and efficient parsing, and that I'm correctly matching the variables to their correct values by finding the correct underscore length.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that satisfy a given Golorp's \"name\" (a program). The name consists of an arithmetic expression and a set of constraints.\n\nLet's break down the interpretation of the Golorp's name based on the problem description and examples:\n\n1.  **Structure of the Name:** The name is `?(EXPRESSION):-CONSTRAINTS.`.\n    *   `EXPRESSION`: An arithmetic expression involving variables and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).\n    *   `CONSTRAINTS`: A comma-separated list of comparison constraints.\n\n2.  **Variables (Jaws):**\n    *   Each sequence of underscores `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part represents a distinct input variable. Let's call them `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{N-1}` in order of their appearance in the expression. `N` is the total number of such underscore sequences in the expression.\n    *   The output sequence will be `v_0v_1...v_{N-1}`. Each `v_i` takes a value from 0 to 9.\n\n3.  **Variable Values and Constraints:**\n    *   A crucial detail: If `v_i` and `v_j` are two variables (underscore sequences) of the *same length*, they must take the *same value*. This means that variables are effectively identified by their underscore length.\n    *   Let `x_L` denote the value assigned to any variable of length `L`.\n    *   The `CONSTRAINTS` part uses underscore sequences (e.g., `___ > __`). These constraints apply to the `x_L` values. For example, `___ > __` means `x_3 > x_2`.\n    *   The values `x_L` must be between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\n4.  **Expression Evaluation:**\n    *   The `EXPRESSION` must be valid. Specifically, division by zero is not allowed.\n    *   Standard operator precedence applies: `*`, `/` before `+`, `-`. Operators of the same precedence are evaluated left-to-right.\n    *   The problem does not state that the expression must evaluate to a specific value (e.g., 0). It only implies that the expression must be *evaluable* (no division by zero).\n\n5.  **Goal:** Find the lexicographically smallest sequence `v_0v_1...v_{N-1}`. This means we should try to make `v_0` as small as possible, then `v_1`, and so on. Since `v_i = x_{length(v_i)}`, this translates to finding the `x_L` values in an order that prioritizes the `v_i` that appear earliest in the output sequence.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse the Input:**\n    *   Use regular expressions to split the input string into `EXPRESSION` and `CONSTRAINTS` parts.\n    *   **Tokenize `EXPRESSION`:** Iterate through the `EXPRESSION` string. Identify underscore sequences (variables) and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).\n        *   Store the list of variables `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. For each `v_i`, record its length.\n        *   Also, create a list of `expression_tokens` which will contain `(type, value)` tuples, e.g., `('var', length)` or `('op', operator_char)`.\n    *   **Identify Distinct Lengths:** From all variables `v_i` in the expression, collect all *unique* underscore lengths. Store them in a list `distinct_lengths_to_assign` in the order of their *first appearance* in the `EXPRESSION`. This order is crucial for the backtracking search.\n    *   **Parse `CONSTRAINTS`:** Split the `CONSTRAINTS` string by commas. For each individual constraint (e.g., `___>__`):\n        *   Extract the two underscore sequences (e.g., `___` and `__`) and the operator (e.g., `>`).\n        *   Record the lengths of the underscore sequences (e.g., `3` and `2`).\n        *   Store the constraint as a tuple `(length1, operator, length2)`.\n\n2.  **Backtracking Search:**\n    *   We need to assign values `x_L` (0-9) for each `L` in `distinct_lengths_to_assign`.\n    *   Use a recursive backtracking function, say `solve(k)`, where `k` is the index into `distinct_lengths_to_assign`.\n    *   `assigned_values = {}` will store `L -> x_L` mappings.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k` equals the number of distinct lengths (`M`):\n        *   All `x_L` values have been assigned.\n        *   **Check all constraints:** Iterate through the parsed constraints. For each `(len1, op, len2)`, check if `assigned_values[len1] op assigned_values[len2]` is true. If any constraint fails, return `False`.\n        *   **Evaluate Expression:** Parse the `expression_tokens` and evaluate the arithmetic expression using the `assigned_values`.\n            *   During evaluation, check for division by zero. If `x_L = 0` and it's used as a divisor, return `False`.\n            *   Use a stack-based approach for infix to postfix conversion or direct evaluation with operator precedence.\n        *   If all constraints pass and the expression is valid, construct the result string `v_0v_1...v_{N-1}` by mapping each `v_i` (which has length `L_i`) to `str(assigned_values[L_i])`. Return this string.\n    *   **Recursive Step:**\n        *   Let `current_length = distinct_lengths_to_assign[k]`.\n        *   Iterate `val` from 0 to 9:\n            *   `assigned_values[current_length] = val`.\n            *   **Pruning (Optimization):** Before recursing, check if any *already-assignable* constraints are violated. A constraint `(len1, op, len2)` is \"assignable\" if both `len1` and `len2` are among the lengths whose values have already been set (i.e., `len1` and `len2` are in `distinct_lengths_to_assign[0...k]`). If any such constraint fails, this `val` is invalid, so `continue` to the next `val`.\n            *   If `solve(k+1)` returns a valid string, immediately return that string (because we are trying values `0-9` in order, the first valid string found will be the lexicographically smallest).\n    *   If no `val` leads to a solution, return `False`.\n\n3.  **Expression Evaluation Logic (Shunting-yard or direct evaluation):**\n    For direct evaluation with precedence:\n    *   Maintain a list of numbers and a list of operators.\n    *   When an operator is encountered:\n        *   If it has higher or equal precedence than the top operator on the stack, push it.\n        *   If lower, pop operators from stack, apply them to numbers, until a lower precedence operator is found or stack is empty. Then push the current operator.\n    *   After parsing all tokens, apply remaining operators from stack.\n    *   Remember to handle division by zero (`x_L == 0` when `x_L` is a divisor).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 1): `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n\n1.  **Parsing:**\n    *   `EXPRESSION`: `_-_/___*__`\n    *   `CONSTRAINTS`: `___>__`\n    *   **Variables:**\n        `v0`: `_` (len 1)\n        `v1`: `_` (len 1)\n        `v2`: `___` (len 3)\n        `v3`: `__` (len 2)\n        Output length `N=4`.\n    *   **Expression Tokens:** `[('var', 1), ('op', '-'), ('var', 1), ('op', '/'), ('var', 3), ('op', '*'), ('var', 2)]`\n    *   **Distinct Lengths (ordered by first appearance in expression):** `distinct_lengths_to_assign = [1, 3, 2]` (`M=3`)\n    *   **Constraints:** `[(3, '>', 2)]`\n\n2.  **Backtracking `solve(k)`:**\n    *   `assigned_values = {}`\n\n    *   `solve(0)` for `current_length = 1`:\n        *   `val = 0`: `assigned_values[1] = 0`\n            *   `solve(1)` for `current_length = 3`:\n                *   `val = 0`: `assigned_values[3] = 0`\n                    *   `solve(2)` for `current_length = 2`:\n                        *   `val = 0`: `assigned_values[2] = 0`\n                            *   `solve(3)` (Base Case): All lengths assigned (`x_1=0, x_3=0, x_2=0`).\n                                *   **Check Constraints:** `(3, '>', 2)` -> `x_3 > x_2` -> `0 > 0` is `False`.
