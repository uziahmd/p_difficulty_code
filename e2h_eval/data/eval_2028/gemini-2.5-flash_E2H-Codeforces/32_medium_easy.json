    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the \"Array Stabilization\" problem, which boils down to finding the minimum instability achievable by removing a single element from an array. Instability is defined as the range (max - min) of the remaining elements. I need to handle arrays with up to 10^5 elements, all within a value range of 1 to 10^5. The core challenge is figuring out which element to remove for minimal impact on the range.\n\n**Key Insight: Focusing on Max and Min**\n\nThe key here is that to minimize the range, I need to make the new maximum as small as possible and the new minimum as large as possible. This realization immediately points me toward considering the smallest and largest elements in the array. Since the array is given, sorting becomes an important and fast first step.\n\n**Hypothesis: Remove Min or Max**\n\nMy intuition tells me that the optimal strategy is to remove either the smallest or the largest element. If I remove any other element, the current max or min will be retained, possibly leading to a larger difference. To confirm, I can derive the math: if I remove neither min or max, the instability will always be greater. Let's say, after sorting, `a_sorted = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]`. The original instability is `s_n - s_1`. Removing any `s_k` where `1 < k < n` will leave `s_1` and `s_n` and the instability will be `s_n - s_1` which is greater.\n\n**Algorithm and Code**\n\nWith that in mind, my algorithm is straightforward:\n1.  Read the array, and read n.\n2.  Sort the array.\n3.  Calculate the instability if I remove the smallest element.\n4.  Calculate the instability if I remove the largest element.\n5.  Return the minimum of the two calculated instabilities.\n\n**Implementation Details and Edge Cases**\n\nI can use Python's built-in `sort` function for easy sorting. Accessing the min and max elements is trivial after sorting. I have to handle the edge case of n = 2; here removing either element results in an instability of 0. Checking the code for this edge case: the calculations of s_1 and s_n and so on handles this case.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    instability_remove_min = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    instability_remove_max = a[n-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(instability_remove_min, instability_remove_max))\nsolve()\n```\nThe comments are only for thought process, I will remove them for the final solution. The problem's constraints are such that the program will run correctly and the problem complexity can be solved with O(n log n).\nThe code above can be submitted. The code solves the problem.\n",
