They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mushroom Strife Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this \"Mushroom Strife\" challenge. The goal is to figure out the number of mushrooms on each lawn, given the connections (roads) between them and the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts for each connection.  I need to output the mushroom counts or determine if a solution is impossible. Mushroom counts are bounded between 1 and 10^6.\n\nFirst, let's break down the core math.  The crucial property is that the product of two numbers (`a` and `b`) is equal to the product of their GCD and LCM: `a * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)`.  Knowing this, I can start forming relationships.\n\nLet's say a road connects lawns `u` and `v`, with `g` being the GCD and `l` the LCM. We have `val_u * val_v = g * l`. We also know that `val_u` and `val_v` must both be multiples of `g`.  Let `val_u = g * x` and `val_v = g * y`. The key is that `x` and `y` must be coprime (their GCD is 1).\n\nSubstituting gives me: `(g * x) * (g * y) = g * l`, which simplifies to `g * x * y = l` or `x * y = l / g`. Therefore, the ratio of the LCM to the GCD, `l/g`, is the key, and this requires `g` to divide `l` exactly.\n\nThis means that  `x` must be a divisor of `l / g` and `y = (l / g) / x`, where `GCD(x,y) = 1`. In other words,  `x` and `y` must be formed by distributing the prime factors of `l / g` between them - ensuring that if a prime appears in `x`, it does not appear in `y`.  This lets me build potential mushroom counts using combinations of prime factors.\n\nNow, the trick is how to apply this to the graph structure. I need an algorithm to propagate these relationships across the connected lawns. I'll probably use a disjoint-set data structure to efficiently check connectivity, and then Depth-First Search (DFS) to find potential solutions starting from one node and see if a consistent solution can be found. The constraint on the range of mushroom counts (1 to 10^6) will guide me in discarding invalid combinations of `x` and `y`. Time to get coding!\n",
