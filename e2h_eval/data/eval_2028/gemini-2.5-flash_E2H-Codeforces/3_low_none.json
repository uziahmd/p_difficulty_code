Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya and Lanterns: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem, and my first thought is, this seems straightforward enough to tackle with a Python script. Let's break it down. We've got a street of length `l`, and `n` lanterns scattered along it at positions `a_i`. Each lantern has a light radius, say `d`, and the goal is to find the *minimum* `d` that ensures the entire street is lit.\n\nThe inputs are pretty clear: `n`, `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a_i`. And the output? Just that minimum `d` value, with a decent level of precision, of course.\n\nMy strategy? Well, sorting the lantern positions is the obvious first move. Makes everything much easier to reason about. Let's assume the sorted positions are `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\n\nNow, the core of the problem lies in analyzing the gaps.  We have to account for these gaps, specifically:\n\n*   **The internal gaps:** Between any two lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, there's a space that needs to be lit. The worst-case scenario is the midpoint between them. The distance to this point,  `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`, dictates the required `d`. We need to maximize this value to ensure all gaps are covered. Let's call this `max_internal_d`.\n*   **The starting edge:** The first lantern, `a_1`, needs to cover the segment from 0 up to its position. This means `d` has to be at least `a_1`.\n*   **The ending edge:** Similarly, the last lantern, `a_n`, needs to light up the segment from its position to the end of the street `l`. That requires `d` to be at least `l - a_n`.\n\nSo, the critical bit: we need a `d` value that satisfies *all* these conditions. The final solution is then the maximum among `a_1`, `l - a_n`, and `max_internal_d`.\n\nTo illustrate, let's look at that example, the second one in the problem statement. Here, `n = 2, l = 5`, and `a = [2, 5]`. No sorting is needed, and you can see how each lantern and edge coverage dictates the final `d`. This will be easy to translate into code.\n",
