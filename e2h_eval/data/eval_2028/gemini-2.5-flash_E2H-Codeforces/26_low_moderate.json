    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Triangle Counting Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out how many non-degenerate triangles I can form using integer side lengths *x*, *y*, and *z*, given some constraints on their ranges: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the triangle inequality theorem. For a triangle to be valid, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. In this case, that means:\n1.  `x + y > z`\n2.  `x + z > y`\n3.  `y + z > x`\n\nSince we know `x <= y <= z`, the last two conditions, `x + z > y` and `y + z > x`, are always automatically satisfied! This simplifies things significantly. So, the only critical condition is `x + y > z`.\n\nNow, I'm looking at how to efficiently count these valid triangles. A naive triple loop would be `(B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)` which quickly gets out of hand. For example, if `A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5` this is `5e5 * 1 * 1`. But if `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=5e5`, it's `1 * 1 * 5e5`. But if `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=2.5e5, D=5e5`, it would become `2.5e5 * 1 * 2.5e5` or `6.25e10` which is too slow.\n\nSo, I need a better strategy. Let's try fixing *x* and *y* and then count the valid values of *z*. I know that:\n*   `A <= x <= B`\n*   `B <= y <= C`\n*   `C <= z <= D`\n*   `x + y > z`\n\nThis means for a given *x* and *y*, I need to find the range of valid *z* values. *z* must be within `[C, D]` and also less than `x + y`. So the valid *z* values will be between `max(C, 1)` and `min(D, x + y - 1)`. Let's call these limits `L_z` and `R_z` respectively. The number of possible *z* is `max(0, R_z - L_z + 1)`.\n\nThis approach should be much more efficient. I'm going to iterate through the possible *x* and *y* values within their respective ranges and then calculate the number of valid *z* values for each pair. This is the way to go!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, these are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nWe are given the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\nFrom `x <= B <= y <= C <= z`, it directly follows that `x <= y <= z`.\nGiven `x, y, z` are positive integers:\n- Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= x + y > y`. So `x + z > y` is always true.\n- Since `z >= x` and `y >= B >= A >= 1`, we have `y + z >= y + x > x`. So `y + z > x` is always true.\n\nTherefore, for `x <= y <= z`, the only condition we need to check for a non-degenerate triangle is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo we need to count triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (or equivalently, `z < x + y`)\n\nThe maximum value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`. A direct triple loop over `x, y, z` would be too slow, as it could be up to `5 * 10^5` cubed in the worst case, or `(B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)`.\n\nLet's iterate over `x` and `y`, and for each pair, count valid `z`.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`:\nThe valid range for `z` is `max(C, 1) <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nLet `L_z = max(C, 1)` and `R_z = min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of valid `z` for a given `x, y` is `max(0, R_z - L_z + 1)`.\nSince `C >= B >= A >= 1`, `L_z` will always be `C`. So, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of valid `z` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet's iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `s = x + y` ranges from `A + B` (minimum `x` and minimum `y`) to `B + C` (maximum `x` and maximum `y`).\nThe maximum possible value for `s` is `B + C`. Given `B, C <= 5 * 10^5`, `B + C` can be up to `10^6`.\n\nFor a fixed `x` and `y`, the number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `k = x + y`. The number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `count_z(k)` be `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nNotice that `count_z(k)` is a non-decreasing function of `k`.\n- If `k - 1 < C`, then `min(D, k - 1) = k - 1`. `count_z(k) = max(0, k - 1 - C + 1) = max(0, k - C)`. If `k <= C`, this is 0. If `k = C+1`, this is 1.\n- If `k - 1 >= C` and `k - 1 <= D`, then `min(D, k - 1) = k - 1`. `count_z(k) = k - 1 - C + 1 = k - C`.\n- If `k - 1 > D`, then `min(D, k - 1) = D`. `count_z(k) = D - C + 1`. This is the maximum possible number of `z` values.\n\nThe total count is `sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} count_z(x + y)`.\n\nWe can optimize this by precalculating the counts of `y` values for each `x + y` sum.\nLet `freq_sum[s]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = s`.\nThe minimum sum `s_min = A + B`. The maximum sum `s_max = B + C`.\n`s` can go up to `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\nWe can compute `freq_sum[s]` efficiently using a prefix sum-like approach or by iterating over `x` and using a frequency array for `y`.\n\nLet's fix `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `s = x + y` ranges from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nWe can build an array `y_counts` where `y_counts[s]` stores the number of `y` values such that `B <= y <= C` and `y = s - x`.\nThis is equivalent to `freq_y[y]` = 1 for `B <= y <= C`, and then `freq_sum[s]` is a convolution.\nA simpler way:\nInitialize `freq_sum` array of size `B + C + 1` to zeros.\nFor `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  For `y` from `B` to `C`:\n    `freq_sum[x + y] += 1`.\nThis is `(B-A+1) * (C-B+1)` operations, which can be up to `5 \\cdot 10^5 * 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{11}` in the worst case (e.g., `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=5e5`). This is too slow.\n\nWe need a faster way to compute `sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} count_z(x + y)`.\nLet's iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor a fixed `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `s = x + y` ranges from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nFor a fixed `x`, we need to compute `sum_{y=B}^{C} count_z(x + y)`.\nThis is `sum_{s=x+B}^{x+C} count_z(s)`.\nLet `S_z(k) = sum_{i=s_min}^{k} count_z(i)`.\nThen `sum_{s=x+B}^{x+C} count_z(s) = S_z(x+C) - S_z(x+B-1)`.\nThis approach still requires `(B-A+1)` iterations, and in each iteration, computing `S_z` might be `O(1)` if `S_z` is precomputed.\nThe maximum value of `s` is `B + C`, which is `10^6`.\nWe can precompute `count_z(s)` for all `s` from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nThen precompute `prefix_sum_z[s] = sum_{i=A+B}^{s} count_z(i)`.\nThe total count would be `sum_{x=A}^{B} (prefix_sum_z[x+C] - prefix_sum_z[x+B-1])`.\nThis is `O(B-A+1 + B+C)` operations.\n`B-A+1` can be up to `5 \\cdot 10^5`. `B+C` can be up to `10^6`.\nSo this approach is `O(D)` or `O(B+C)`, which is `O(5 \\cdot 10^5)` or `O(10^6)`. This is efficient enough.\n\nLet's define `count_z(k)` more precisely.\n`count_z(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThe range for `k` (which is `x+y`) is from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nLet `max_sum = B + C`. We need an array `possible_z_counts` of size `max_sum + 1`.\n`possible_z_counts[k]` will store `count_z(k)`.\nInitialize `possible_z_counts` to all zeros.\nFor `k` from `A+B` to `max_sum`:\n  `possible_z_counts[k] = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`\n\nNow, calculate prefix sums for `possible_z_counts`:\n`prefix_sum_z_counts[k] = sum_{i=A+B}^{k} possible_z_counts[i]`.\nInitialize `prefix_sum_z_counts` of size `max_sum + 1` to zeros.\n`prefix_sum_z_counts[A+B-1] = 0` (base case for range sum calculation).\nFor `k` from `A+B` to `max_sum`:\n  `prefix_sum_z_counts[k] = prefix_sum_z_counts[k-1] + possible_z_counts[k]`\n\nFinally, calculate the total number of triangles:\n`total_triangles = 0`\nFor `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `lower_sum_bound = x + B`\n  `upper_sum_bound = x + C`\n  `total_triangles += prefix_sum_z_counts[upper_sum_bound] - prefix_sum_z_counts[lower_sum_bound - 1]`\n\nExample Walkthrough: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`max_sum = B + C = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n`possible_z_counts` array will be size `6` (indices 0 to 5).\n`k` ranges from `A+B = 1+2=3` to `B+C=5`.\n\n`possible_z_counts[k] = max(0, min(D, k-1) - C + 1)`\n`D=4, C=3`.\n- `k = 3`: `possible_z_counts[3] = max(0, min(4, 3-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 2) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n- `k = 4`: `possible_z_counts[4] = max(0, min(4, 4-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 3) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n- `k = 5`: `possible_z_counts[5] = max(0, min(4, 5-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 4) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 4 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2) = 2`.\n\n`possible_z_counts` array (relevant part): `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]` for indices `0` to `5`.\n`prefix_sum_z_counts` array (relevant part, starting from index 2 for `A+B-1`):\n`prefix_sum_z_counts[2] = 0`\n`prefix_sum_z_counts[3] = prefix_sum_z_counts[2] + possible_z_counts[3] = 0 + 0 = 0`\n`prefix_sum_z_counts[4] = prefix_sum_z_counts[3] + possible_z_counts[4] = 0 + 1 = 1`\n`prefix_sum_z_counts[5] = prefix_sum_z_counts[4] + possible_z_counts[5] = 1 + 2 = 3`\n\n`prefix_sum_z_counts` array (relevant part): `[..., 0, 0, 1, 3]` for indices `2, 3, 4, 5`.\n\nTotal triangles:\n`total_triangles = 0`\n`x` from `A=1` to `B=2`:\n- `x = 1`:\n  `lower_sum_bound = 1 + B = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `upper_sum_bound = 1 + C = 1 + 3 = 4`\n  `total_triangles += prefix_sum_z_counts[4] - prefix_sum_z_counts[3-1] = prefix_sum_z_counts[4] - prefix_sum_z_counts[2]`\n  `total_triangles += 1 - 0 = 1`.\n  (For `x=1`, `y` can be `B=2` or `C=3`.\n  If `y=2`, `s=3`. `count_z(3)=0`.\n  If `y=3`, `s=4`. `count_z(4)=1`.
