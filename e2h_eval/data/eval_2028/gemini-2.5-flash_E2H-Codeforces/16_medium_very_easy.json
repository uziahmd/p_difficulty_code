Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution Recap**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and after some thought, the solution boils down to this: Count the number of roads that *separate* the home and the university. Each step across a road is essential, so the minimum steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nHere's how I got there:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The input gives me home and university coordinates and the equations of a bunch of roads. I need to find the shortest path from home to university, and a \"step\" means crossing a road.\n2.  **The Key Insight:** I realized that if the home and university are on *opposite* sides of a road, I *have* to cross that road. If they're on the *same* side, I can avoid it.\n3.  **Sign Matters:** I use the equation of the road (`ax + by + c = 0`) to determine which side of the road a point is on. If `ax + by + c` is positive for a point, it's on one side; negative, the other. If the signs are different for home and university, that road is a \"separator.\"\n4.  **Counting Separators:** So, my solution is to loop through each road, calculate the value of `ax + by + c` for both the home and university, and if the signs are opposite, I increment my step count.\n5.  **Robust Logic:** The constraints and the definition of a step make this simple logic valid. A straight line path from home to university will cross the minimum number of separating lines.\n6.  **Efficiency and edge case:** After a detailed double-check I found this is very efficient. No issues with coordinates. This means the code should work great.\n7.  **Python Script:** The Python code is straightforward: read inputs, calculate `ax + by + c` for each point and road, and increment the step count when there's a sign change.\n\nThe core idea is the geometric intuition: The minimum steps are exactly those roads that form a barrier between home and university. It's elegant in its simplicity.\n",
