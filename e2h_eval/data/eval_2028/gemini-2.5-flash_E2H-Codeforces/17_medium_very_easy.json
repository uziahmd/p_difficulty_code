He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Prefixes and Suffixes: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. The core of it is reconstructing a hidden string, `s`, of length `n` from a jumbled list of its prefixes and suffixes, specifically `2n-2` of them.  There's a neat guarantee: for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we'll see exactly two strings, one that's a prefix and one that's a suffix.  My brain immediately latches onto the lengths, focusing on those two crucial strings of length `n-1`.\n\nHere's my plan: I'll identify the two strings of length `n-1` right off the bat. One *has* to be the prefix of length `n-1` (the string's first `n-1` characters) and the other is the suffix of length `n-1` (the string's last `n-1` characters).  Let's call these strings `s1` and `s2`.\n\nNow, comes the crucial part.  I'll try two possibilities: either `s1` is the prefix and `s2` is the suffix, or vice versa.  For each possibility, I'll essentially build a candidate string `s_candidate` by combining the prefix and the last character of the suffix, forming a full string of length `n`. Then, I have to check this candidate.\n\nMy check works like this:\n\n1. **Consistency Check:**  Does the substring of  `s_candidate`  from index 1 to the end match the supposed suffix (which is either `s2` or `s1`)?\n2. **Full Verification:** To ensure this constructed string works, I'll create a list of all its prefixes and suffixes. I'll compare it with the original input list to ensure it has all the original elements and no extra. Duplicate strings of the same length are possible. The  `Counter`  data structure becomes my best friend here.\n\nIf any candidate String Passes all of these, that will have to be the solution, and I'll generate a final list of 'P's and 'S's to indicate whether each of the original input strings is a prefix or a suffix of the solution.\n\nI'm thinking I'll use a `Counter` to track the expected prefixes and suffixes of the solution because it'll help me handle those duplicates that are guaranteed by the problem constraints. I should keep track of the original index of all strings, too.\n\nUltimately, by systematically constructing and validating candidate strings, and carefully tracking all prefixes and suffixes, I'm confident I can crack this problem and produce the correct output.",
    "response": "The solution works by first identifying the two strings of length `n-1` from the input, as these are crucial for reconstructing the original string `s`. Let these two strings be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n\nThere are two possibilities for how `str_A` and `str_B` relate to the actual string `s`:\n1.  `str_A` is the prefix of `s` of length `n-1`, and `str_B` is the suffix of `s` of length `n-1`.\n2.  `str_B` is the prefix of `s` of length `n-1`, and `str_A` is the suffix of `s` of length `n-1`.\n\nFor each possibility, we perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Reconstruct Candidate `s`**:\n    *   If `P_{n-1} = str_A` and `S_{n-1} = str_B`, then `s` must be `str_A` followed by the last character of `str_B`. Let this be `candidate_s`.\n    *   Similarly for the second possibility.\n\n2.  **Verify Candidate `s`**:\n    *   **Initial Check**: The reconstructed `candidate_s` must be consistent with the assumed `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`. Specifically, if `candidate_s` was formed from `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`, then `candidate_s[1:]` (the suffix of `candidate_s` of length `n-1`) must be equal to `S_{n-1}`. If not, this candidate `s` is invalid.\n    *   **Full Consistency Check**: If the initial check passes, we generate all `n-1` prefixes and `n-1` suffixes of `candidate_s`. We then count the occurrences of each generated prefix and suffix using `collections.Counter`. This gives us `all_expected_counts`. We also count the occurrences of each string in the original input, resulting in `input_counts`. If `all_expected_counts` is equal to `input_counts`, then `candidate_s` is a valid original string.\n\n3.  **Output Assignment**:\n    *   Since the problem guarantees that at least one consistent string `s` exists, one of the two possibilities will yield a valid `candidate_s`.\n    *   Once a valid `candidate_s` is found, we iterate through the original input strings (maintaining their original indices).\n    *   For each input string `s_val` at `original_idx`:\n        *   We check if `s_val` can be a prefix of `candidate_s` (i.e., if `s_val` matches `candidate_s[0:len(s_val)]` and we still have an \"unassigned\" prefix instance of `s_val` in our `current_prefix_counts`). If so, we assign 'P' to `result[original_idx]` and decrement the count for `s_val` in `current_prefix_counts`.\n        *   Otherwise (it must be a suffix, and we check similarly with `current_suffix_counts`), we assign 'S' to `result[original_idx]` and decrement the count in `current_suffix_counts`.\n    *   This assignment strategy correctly handles cases where a string (e.g., \"a\" for \"aaa\") can be both a prefix and a suffix of the same length, ensuring one gets 'P' and the other 'S'.\n\nFinally, the `result` list is joined into a single string and printed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    input_strings_with_indices = []\n    strings_of_n_minus_1_len = []\n    \n    # Read all input strings and store them with their original indices\n    # Also, identify the two strings of length n-1\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_with_indices.append((s, i))\n        if len(s) == n - 1:\n            strings_of_n_minus_1_len.append(s)\n\n    # The two strings of length n-1\n    s_n_minus_1_a = strings_of_n_minus_1_len[0]\n    s_n_minus_1_b = strings_of_n_minus_1_len[1]\n\n    valid_candidate_s = None\n    current_prefix_counts = None\n    current_suffix_counts = None\n\n    # Helper function to check a candidate string\n    def check_candidate(prefix_n_minus_1, suffix_n_minus_1):\n        candidate_s = prefix_n_minus_1 + suffix_n_minus_1[-1]\n        \n        # Initial consistency check: the suffix part of candidate_s must match the given suffix_n_minus_1\n        if candidate_s[1:] != suffix_n_minus_1:\n            return None, None, None\n\n        # Generate expected prefixes and suffixes for this candidate_s\n        expected_prefix_counts = Counter()\n        expected_suffix_counts = Counter()\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            expected_prefix_counts[candidate_s[0:k]] += 1\n            expected_suffix_counts[candidate_s[n-k:n]] += 1\n        \n        # Combine expected counts for all 2n-2 strings\n        all_expected_counts = expected_prefix_counts + expected_suffix_counts\n        \n        # Create a Counter for the actual input strings\n        input_counts = Counter(item[0] for item in input_strings_with_indices)\n\n        # If the counts match, this is a valid candidate\n        if all_expected_counts == input_counts:\n            return candidate_s, expected_prefix_counts, expected_suffix_counts\n        else:\n            return None, None, None\n\n    # Attempt 1: s_n_minus_1_a is P_{n-1}, s_n_minus_1_b is S_{n-1}\n    valid_candidate_s, current_prefix_counts, current_suffix_counts = \\\n        check_candidate(s_n_minus_1_a, s_n_minus_1_b)\n    \n    # If Attempt 1 failed, try Attempt 2\n    if valid_candidate_s is None:\n        # Attempt 2: s_n_minus_1_b is P_{n-1}, s_n_minus_1_a is S_{n-1}\n        valid_candidate_s, current_prefix_counts, current_suffix_counts = \\\n            check_candidate(s_n_minus_1_b, s_n_minus_1_a)\n\n    # The problem guarantees that a valid string exists, so valid_candidate_s will not be None here.\n    \n    # Construct the result string ('P' or 'S' for each input string)\n    result = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n    \n    for s_val, original_idx in input_strings_with_indices:\n        # If this string can be a prefix and we haven't assigned all its prefix instances yet\n        if current_prefix_counts[s_val] > 0:\n            result[original_idx] = 'P'\n            current_prefix_counts[s_val] -= 1\n        # Otherwise, it must be a suffix (due to problem guarantees and previous checks)\n        # And we check if we haven't assigned all its suffix instances yet\n        elif current_suffix_counts[s_val] > 0: \n            result[original_idx] = 'S'\n            current_suffix_counts[s_val] -= 1\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
