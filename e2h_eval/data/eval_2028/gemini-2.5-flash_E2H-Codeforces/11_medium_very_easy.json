A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The \"Soft Drinking\" Problem Solution**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Soft Drinking.\" The core of it is figuring out how many toasts each friend can make, given a limited amount of drinks, limes, and salt, and the constraints of the problem.\n\nMy initial approach was to calculate the total resources: total drink, lime slices, and salt. I determined the maximum number of toasts that could be made, in total, for each resource, assuming everyone drinks the same amount. The problem is about ensuring everyone drinks the *same* amount, so the key is to determine the limiting resource for the entire group.\n\nI've got the formula now. I had to go through a process of re-evaluation, to identify how much each resource gives each friend when shared equally. So I worked through the number of toasts each resource allows and calculated `toasts_from_drink` as `(k * l) // nl // n`,  `toasts_from_lime` as `(c * d) // n`, and `toasts_from_salt` as `p // np // n`.\n\nMy solution takes the minimum of these values to get the number of toasts each friend can make. This makes sure we don't end up giving someone more toast portions than the others. I checked the example input values.\n\nI'm confident the logic is good. I wrote the code in Python with `sys.stdin.readline()` for input. The solution addresses potential edge cases and aligns with the problem description. All divisions are integer divisions, which is what the problem calls for. The problem wording is clear and the solution should be valid.\n",
