Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Strategy Unfolds**\n\nAlright, so I'm looking at this \"TV Game\" problem, and my gut tells me dynamic programming is the way to go.  The core idea is to maximize the sum of two numbers, `S1` and `S2`, formed by concatenating digits from a given number `A`. The tricky part is that each player (Homer and Marge) must take exactly `n` digits. And, these numbers can get huge, so regular integers won't cut it.  Strings will be the most practical.\n\nThe key insight?  The order in which digits are taken determines their place value. The first digit taken becomes the most significant digit (MSD) for that player. The `k`-th digit taken goes in the `k`-th place.  So, I need a way to track which player takes which digit.\n\nMy initial thought was to use `dp[k][h_moves][m_moves]` where `k` is the current digit's index, and `h_moves` and `m_moves` are the number of moves each player has *made*. But, I realized it's better to think about the *remaining* moves.  This way, the state transitions are cleaner.\n\nSo, I'm thinking:  `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]`.  This represents the maximum sum from digits `A[k:]` given that Homer has `h_rem` moves left, and Marge has `m_rem` moves left.  I'll store the choices as well so I can reconstruct the optimal sequence later.\n\nThe base case is when all digits are processed (`k == 2n`). If both players have made exactly `n` moves, the result is 0. Otherwise, it is an invalid state, represented by `-infinity`. I'll also have a check for invalid states where number of moves are greater than n.\n\nThe recursion will go like this:\nFrom a state `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]`, Homer can take the digit `A[k]` (if `h_rem > 0`). In this case, I add `A[k] * 10^(h_rem - 1)` to the current subtotal and move to state `dp[k+1][h_rem-1][m_rem]`.\nMarge can also take `A[k]` (if `m_rem > 0`) contributing `A[k] * 10^(m_rem - 1)` and transition to `dp[k+1][h_rem][m_rem-1]`.\n\nThe memoization will handle overlapping subproblems. `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]` will be the maximum of both Homer's and Marge's choices. I'll store the choice ('H' or 'M') to reconstruct the optimal sequence.\n\nThe dimensions are manageable.  `k` goes from `0` to `2n-1`, and both `h_rem` and `m_rem` range from `0` to `n`. That gives `2n * (n+1) * (n+1)` states.  That's reasonable for n up to 18.  And using Python's arbitrary-precision integers will handle the large sums.\n\nI'm thinking I'll start the dynamic programming computation from the end of `A` and work backwards. That allows me to calculate the subproblems from small, easily to compute sub-problems to larger ones.\n\nAfter calculating `dp[0][0][0]`, which stores the optimal sum, I can backtrack through the choices to reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge to maximize their total prize (S1 + S2). Each player must make exactly `n` moves, taking digits from a 2n-digit number `A` from left to right. Digits are appended to their respective numbers S1 and S2.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\n\n**Understanding the Contribution of Each Digit:**\n\nLet `A = a_0 a_1 ... a_{2n-1}` be the given 2n-digit number.\nWhen a player takes a digit `a_k`, its contribution to their final number (S1 or S2) depends on how many digits that player has already taken.\nIf `a_k` is the `j`-th digit taken by a player, it will be placed at the `j`-th position from the left in their `n`-digit number. This means it contributes `a_k * 10^(n-j)` to the value of their number. For example, if `n=2` and a player takes '1' then '2', their number is \"12\". '1' is the 1st digit, contributing `1 * 10^(2-1) = 10`. '2' is the 2nd digit, contributing `2 * 10^(2-2) = 2`. Total `12`.\n\n**Dynamic Programming State:**\n\nWe define a recursive function `solve(idx, h_taken, m_taken)`:\n*   `idx`: The index of the current digit being considered from `A` (from 0 to `2n-1`).\n*   `h_taken`: The number of digits Homer has already taken.\n*   `m_taken`: The number of digits Marge has already taken.\n\nThe function `solve(idx, h_taken, m_taken)` returns the maximum possible sum of `S1 + S2` that can be achieved using the remaining digits `A[idx:]`, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits.\n\n**Base Cases:**\n\n1.  If `h_taken > n` or `m_taken > n`: This is an invalid state (a player took more than `n` digits). Return a very small negative number (e.g., `-1`) to indicate this path is invalid.\n2.  If `idx == 2n`: All digits from `A` have been processed.\n    *   If `h_taken == n` and `m_taken == n`: Both players have taken exactly `n` digits. This is a valid completion. Return `0` (no more digits to contribute).\n    *   Else: One or both players did not take exactly `n` digits. This is an invalid completion. Return `-1`.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\n\nFor a given state `(idx, h_taken, m_taken)`:\n\n1.  **Homer's Move:**\n    If `h_taken < n` (Homer can still take digits):\n    *   The current digit `a_idx` (which is `int(A[idx])`) will be Homer's `(h_taken + 1)`-th digit.\n    *   Its contribution to `S1` will be `int(A[idx]) * (10**(n - (h_taken + 1)))`.\n    *   Recursively call `solve(idx + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)` to get the maximum sum from the remaining digits.\n    *   Homer's path total: `current_digit_contribution_H + solve(idx + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)`.\n\n2.  **Marge's Move:**\n    If `m_taken < n` (Marge can still take digits):\n    *   The current digit `a_idx` will be Marge's `(m_taken + 1)`-th digit.\n    *   Its contribution to `S2` will be `int(A[idx]) * (10**(n - (m_taken + 1)))`.\n    *   Recursively call `solve(idx + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)` to get the maximum sum from the remaining digits.\n    *   Marge's path total: `current_digit_contribution_M + solve(idx + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)`.\n\n`dp[idx][h_taken][m_taken]` will store the maximum of these two path totals. We also need to store which choice ('H' or 'M') led to this maximum in a separate `choices` dictionary/array to reconstruct the path later. If both paths yield the same maximum, either choice is fine (the problem allows any valid solution).\n\n**Memoization:**\n\nA dictionary `memo = {}` will store the results of `solve(idx, h_taken, m_taken)` to avoid redundant computations.\nA dictionary `choices = {}` will store the optimal move ('H' or 'M') for each state.\n\n**Reconstructing the Path:**\n\nAfter the initial call `solve(0, 0, 0)` completes, we traverse the `choices` dictionary from the initial state `(0, 0, 0)` to `(2n, n, n)` to build the sequence of moves.\n\n**Complexity:**\n\n*   **States:** `idx` can go from `0` to `2n`. `h_taken` and `m_taken` can go from `0` to `n`. So, roughly `2n * (n+1) * (n+1)` states.\n    For `n=18`, this is `36 * 19 * 19 = 12996` states.\n*   **Transitions:** Each state computation involves at most two recursive calls.\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)`.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(n^3)` for `memo` and `choices` dictionaries.\n\nGiven `n <= 18`, `n^3` is well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems. Python's arbitrary precision integers handle the large sums `S1 + S2` automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set recursion limit for deep recursion\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Memoization dictionaries\nmemo = {}\nchoices = {}\nN_GLOBAL = 0 # Will store n\nA_GLOBAL = \"\" # Will store A as a string\n\n# A very small number to represent invalid paths\nINVALID_PATH = -1 \n\ndef solve(idx, h_taken, m_taken):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible sum of S1 + S2 from digits A[idx:]\n    given h_taken moves by Homer and m_taken moves by Marge so far.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check for invalid states (player took more than n moves)\n    if h_taken > N_GLOBAL or m_taken > N_GLOBAL:\n        return INVALID_PATH\n\n    # Base case: All digits processed\n    if idx == 2 * N_GLOBAL:\n        # If both players made exactly n moves, this is a valid completion\n        if h_taken == N_GLOBAL and m_taken == N_GLOBAL:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, invalid completion\n            return INVALID_PATH\n\n    # Check memoization table\n    state = (idx, h_taken, m_taken)\n    if state in memo:\n        return memo[state]\n\n    current_digit = int(A_GLOBAL[idx])\n    \n    res_H = INVALID_PATH\n    if h_taken < N_GLOBAL:\n        # Homer takes the current digit\n        # It's Homer's (h_taken + 1)-th digit, so its place value is 10^(n - (h_taken + 1))\n        val_H = current_digit * (10**(N_GLOBAL - (h_taken + 1)))\n        \n        # Recursively solve for the next state\n        next_res_H = solve(idx + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)\n        \n        # If the next path is valid, add current digit's contribution\n        if next_res_H != INVALID_PATH:\n            res_H = val_H + next_res_H\n\n    res_M = INVALID_PATH\n    if m_taken < N_GLOBAL:\n        # Marge takes the current digit\n        # It's Marge's (m_taken + 1)-th digit, so its place value is 10^(n - (m_taken + 1))\n        val_M = current_digit * (10**(N_GLOBAL - (m_taken + 1)))\n        \n        # Recursively solve for the next state\n        next_res_M = solve(idx + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)\n        \n        # If the next path is valid, add current digit's contribution\n        if next_res_M != INVALID_PATH:\n            res_M = val_M + next_res_M\n\n    # Store the maximum result and the choice that led to it\n    if res_H >= res_M: # Prioritize Homer in case of a tie, as per example output\n        memo[state] = res_H\n        choices[state] = 'H'\n    else:\n        memo[state] = res_M\n        choices[state] = 'M'\n        \n    return memo[state]\n\ndef main():\n    global N_GLOBAL, A_GLOBAL\n\n    N_GLOBAL = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_GLOBAL = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Start the dynamic programming\n    solve(0, 0, 0)\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result_sequence = []\n    current_idx = 0\n    current_h_taken = 0\n    current_m_taken = 0\n\n    while current_idx < 2 * N_GLOBAL:\n        state = (current_idx, current_h_taken, current_m_taken)\n        \n        # This state should always be in choices if solve(0,0,0) found a path\n        choice = choices[state]\n        result_sequence.append(choice)\n\n        if choice == 'H':\n            current_h_taken += 1\n        else: # choice == 'M'\n            current_m_taken += 1\n        \n        current_idx += 1\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_sequence) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```",
