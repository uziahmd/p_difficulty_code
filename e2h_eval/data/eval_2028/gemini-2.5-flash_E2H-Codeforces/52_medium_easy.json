Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Candlelight Conundrum: A Code-Based Reflection**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a Python script to tackle the \"New Year Candles\" problem. The core of it boils down to optimizing the total burn time of candles, given some initial candles and a rule for crafting new ones from the burnt-out remains.\n\nI'm approaching this strategically. Since each candle burns for a single hour, my instinct is to utilize every candle I can get my hands on. This means burning them immediately, then recycling the leftovers as efficiently as possible. I'm visualizing this as a continuous cycle: burn, collect, craft, burn.\n\nTo translate this into code, I'm thinking of a simulation approach. I'll need some variables: `total_hours` to keep track of the cumulative burn time, `current_new_candles` for candles ready to burn, and `burnt_out_candles` to store the remnants for crafting.\n\nInitially, `total_hours` is zero, and `current_new_candles` is equal to the input value 'a'.  `burnt_out_candles` starts at zero.\n\nThe main loop is pretty straightforward: it runs as long as there are candles to burn. Inside the loop, I'll execute the following steps. I burn all the `current_new_candles`, adding their burn time to the `total_hours`, and moving them to the `burnt_out_candles` pile. The count of `current_new_candles` now resets to 0.\n\nNow, I calculate how many new candles I can make from the accumulated `burnt_out_candles`. I'll divide the number of `burnt_out_candles` by 'b' (the crafting rate) to get the number of new candles. The remainder becomes the new value of the `burnt_out_candles`. We will now add the number of new candles to the `current_new_candles`.\n\nThis loop keeps going until no more candles can be produced. It should terminate quickly due to the decreasing quantity of candle-units with each cycle (except for the unlikely case when b=1).\n\nTo validate the logic, I walked through a couple of examples with a = 4, b = 2, and a = 6, b = 3. The outputs for each test case align with the expected results. The algorithm should be robust for any input within the given constraints (a and b are at least 1 and 2, respectively, and are at most 1000).\n\nThe problem description presented the input in an unusual format that implied a list of inputs. A closer look made me realize that only a single line with `a` and `b` is used, so the Python code reflects this.\n\nThe code itself is clean and concise, and the comments are now removed.\n\nIt is now ready for submission.\n",
