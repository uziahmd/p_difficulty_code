For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My thinking on this competitive programming problem:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a tricky combinatorics problem involving binary strings and constraints on their prefixes. The goal is to count the ways to choose capacities (`c_s`) for prefixes of binary strings such that the maximum size of a \"beautiful\" multiset is exactly `f`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines the maximum multiset size given the `c_s` values. This reminds me of prefix constraints and tries. I visualize building a binary trie, where each node represents a prefix, and the `c_s` values are capacities on these nodes.  The number of strings with a given prefix must not exceed its `c_s` value.  This feels a bit like a flow problem, but I don't think that's the intended route.\n\nThinking more about the prefix constraints, it seems like the key is this: for any node (prefix) `s`, the sum of counts of strings with that prefix cannot exceed `c_s`.  The strings in the multiset will be of length `n`, i.e. leaves of the trie. Let `N(s)` be the count of strings with prefix `s` (sum of counts of the leaf descendants).  My task is to maximize the count of strings in the entire multiset (root node), subject to the constraint that for any internal node `N(s) <= c_s`. The `c_s` applies to all strings of length 1 to n. The empty string is not part of the `c_s` but is key for the maximum multiset size.\n\nI'm starting to see a recursive structure here. For a node `s`, `N(s)` is the sum of `N(s0)` and `N(s1)` (where `s0` and `s1` are its children) when `s` has length less than `n`. The maximum possible value for a node `s` is the minimum of `c_s` and `N(s0)+N(s1)`. This is beginning to look like a dynamic programming problem on the trie.\n\nThe core of the problem then boils down to finding the number of ways to pick these capacities `c_s`, for each string `s` up to length n, such that the maximum count of leaf nodes at level `n` is exactly `f`.  The capacity isn't for the strings in the multiset directly, but prefixes that can occur. So, for a string of length n, the `c_s` value will be just the string value. I can see the structure and recurrence but the details of the count need to be ironed out. `n` is up to 15, and `k` and `f` are around 200,000, so I think a DP approach is the only way to go.  Because `n` is small, the trie is manageable. The key is in choosing the correct DP state.\n\nIt makes sense to define a DP array `dp[d][x]`, where `d` is the depth in the trie (the length of the prefix) and `x` is the maximum value we can reach at that level. We can't really track that information for all nodes at depth d with a single value `x` because of `c_s` for the different levels. So, I will define `dp[d]` as a 1D array where `dp[d][x]` is the number of ways to pick the capacities for a level d trie so the max total value is `x`.\n\nNow I need to refine the recursion.  For a leaf `s` at depth `n`, `max_val(s) = c_s`.  For a node at depth `d < n`, `max_val(s) = min(c_s, max_val(s0) + max_val(s1))`. The total max will be the root.  My base case is depth `n`, where `dp[n][x] = 1` if `0 <= x <= k` otherwise 0.\n\nTo solve the subproblems at levels above the leaves, I'm thinking about a bottom-up DP.  The tricky part is relating `dp[d]` to `dp[d+1]`.  The `max_val(s)` depends on the values of `s0` and `s1` as well as its own `c_s`. I need to figure out how the choices of `c_s` affect the result and I want to avoid having a 3D DP state. I'll need a way to combine the counts from the children's subtrees and the constraint for a node, to create the counts for the subtrees above.\n\nIf",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign values $c_s$ (from $0$ to $k$) to all binary strings $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length $n$ is exactly $f$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of $c_s$ values.\nLet $x_s$ be the count of string $s$ (of length $n$) in the multiset. We want to maximize $\\sum_{s \\text{ of length } n} x_s$.\nFor any binary string $p$ of length $1 \\le \\text{len}(p) \\le n$, the constraint is that the number of strings in the multiset having $p$ as a prefix must not exceed $c_p$. Let this count be $N(p)$. So $N(p) \\le c_p$.\n\nThe structure of prefixes forms a binary trie. A string $p$ is a prefix of $s$ if $s$ is a descendant of $p$ in the trie.\nFor a leaf node $s$ (length $n$), $N(s) = x_s$. So $x_s \\le c_s$. To maximize, we would set $x_s = c_s$.\nFor an internal node $p$ (length $d < n$), $N(p) = N(p0) + N(p1)$, where $p0$ and $p1$ are its children.\nTo maximize $N(p)$, we must satisfy $N(p) \\le c_p$ and $N(p) = N(p0) + N(p1)$.\nThus, the maximum possible value for $N(p)$, let's call it $\\text{max\\_val}(p)$, is:\n- If $\\text{len}(p) = n$: $\\text{max\\_val}(p) = c_p$.\n- If $\\text{len}(p) < n$: $\\text{max\\_val}(p) = \\min(c_p, \\text{max\\_val}(p0) + \\text{max\\_val}(p1))$.\n\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $\\text{max\\_val}(\\text{root})$, where \"root\" represents the empty string `\"\"`.\nHowever, the problem states that $c_s$ is chosen for strings $s$ of length $1$ to $n$. There is no $c_{\"\"}$.\nSo, $\\text{max\\_val}(\\text{\"\"}) = \\text{max\\_val}(\\text{\"0\"}) + \\text{max\\_val}(\\text{\"1\"})$.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming on the depth of the trie, from leaves up to the root.\nLet `dp[d][val]` be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s'$ that are descendants of a node $s$ at depth $d$ (including $s$ itself if $1 \\le \\text{len}(s) \\le n$), such that $\\text{max\\_val}(s)$ equals `val`.\nSince all nodes at the same depth are symmetric, we only need to store one `dp` array for each depth. Let `dp` denote the array for the current depth being processed.\n\n**Base Case:** For depth $n$ (leaf nodes).\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $\\text{max\\_val}(s) = c_s$. $c_s$ can be any integer from $0$ to $k$.\nTo achieve $\\text{max\\_val}(s) = x$, we must choose $c_s = x$. There is exactly one way to do this.\nSo, `dp[x] = 1` for $0 \\le x \\le k$. (This `dp` array has length $k+1$).\n\n**Recursive Step:** For depth $d$ from $n-1$ down to $1$.\nSuppose we have computed the `dp` array for depth $d+1$ (let's call it `dp_next`). This `dp_next[x]` gives the number of ways to achieve $\\text{max\\_val}(s') = x$ for a node $s'$ at depth $d+1$.\nFor a node $s$ at depth $d$, its children $s0$ and $s1$ are at depth $d+1$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $\\text{max\\_val}(s0) = x_0$ is `dp_next[x_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve $\\text{max\\_val}(s1) = x_1$ is `dp_next[x_1]`.\nThe choices for $s0$ and $s1$ are independent.\nSo, the number of ways to achieve $\\text{max\\_val}(s0) + \\text{max\\_val}(s1) = X_{\\text{children}}$ is given by the convolution of `dp_next` with itself:\n`conv_arr[X_children] = sum_{x_0 + x_1 = X_children} (dp_next[x_0] * dp_next[x_1])`.\nThe maximum possible value for $X_{\\text{children}}$ is $2k$. So `conv_arr` will have length $2k+1$.\nThis convolution can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\n\nNow, we need to compute `new_dp[val]` for the current depth $d$.\n$\\text{max\\_val}(s) = \\min(c_s, X_{\\text{children}})$. We need this to be `val`.\nThis can happen in two ways:\n1. $c_s = \\text{val}$ and $X_{\\text{children}} \\ge \\text{val}$. The number of ways for this is `(sum_{X_children = val to 2k} conv_arr[X_children]) * 1` (since there's 1 way to choose $c_s = \\text{val}$).\n2. $c_s > \\text{val}$ and $X_{\\text{children}} = \\text{val}$. The number of ways for this is `conv_arr[val] * (k - val)` (since there are $k - \\text{val}$ choices for $c_s$: $\\text{val}+1, \\dots, k$).\n\nLet $S[j] = \\sum_{X_{\\text{children}}=j}^{2k} \\text{conv\\_arr}[X_{\\text{children}}]$ be the suffix sum of `conv_arr`.\nThen, `new_dp[val] = (S[val] + conv_arr[val] * (k - val)) % MOD`.\nWe update `dp = new_dp`.\n\n**Final Step:** After the loop (which runs for $d$ from $n-1$ down to $1$), `dp` will contain the counts for nodes at depth $1$ (i.e., for strings \"0\" and \"1\"). Let this be `dp_len1`.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $\\text{max\\_val}(\\text{\"\"}) = \\text{max\\_val}(\\text{\"0\"}) + \\text{max\\_val}(\\text{\"1\"})$.\nWe need this sum to be exactly $f$.\nThe number of ways to achieve this is the convolution of `dp_len1` with itself, evaluated at index $f$:\n`final_ans = (dp_len1 * dp_len1)[f]`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The `dp` array has size $k+1$. `conv_arr` has size $2k+1$.\n- Each step involves a convolution, which takes $O(K \\log K)$ time using NTT, where $K$ is the smallest power of 2 greater than $2k$.\n- There are $n-1$ such steps (for depths $n-1$ down to $1$).\n- The final convolution also takes $O(K \\log K)$.\n- Total time complexity: $O(n \\cdot K \\log K)$.\nGiven $n \\le 15$ and $k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $K$ would be $2^{19} = 524288$.\n$15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot \\log(524288) \\approx 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.4 \\cdot 10^8$, which is acceptable within typical time limits for competitive programming.\nMemory complexity: $O(K)$ for NTT arrays.\n\n**NTT Parameters:**\n- Modulo `MOD = 998244353`.\n- Primitive root `PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3`.\n- `MOD - 1 = 998244352 = 119 \\cdot 2^{23}$. This allows NTT up to length $2^{23}$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Modular exponentiation (a^b % MOD)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Modular inverse (a^(MOD-2) % MOD)\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\n# a: list of coefficients\n# invert: True for inverse NTT, False for forward NTT\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative butterfly operations\n    # length: current size of subproblems (2, 4, 8, ..., n)\n    length = 2\n    while length <= n:\n        # wlen: primitive root of unity for current length\n        wlen = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = inv(wlen)\n        \n        # Iterate through segments of current length\n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1 # current root of unity for this segment\n            # Iterate through first half of segment\n            for j in range(length // 2):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + length // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + length // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD # Ensure positive result\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        length <<= 1\n    \n    # If inverse NTT, divide by n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Determine the required length for NTT (smallest power of 2 >= len_a + len_b - 1)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad input arrays to length n\n    A = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    B = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n    \n    # Perform forward NTT\n    ntt(A, False)\n    ntt(B, False)\n    \n    # Point-wise multiplication\n    C = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        C[i] = (A[i] * B[i]) % MOD\n        \n    # Perform inverse NTT\n    ntt(C, True)\n    \n    # Return the result up to the actual polynomial degree\n    return C[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[x] stores the number of ways to achieve max_val(s) = x for a single node s\n    # at the current depth.\n    # Base case: depth n (leaves).
