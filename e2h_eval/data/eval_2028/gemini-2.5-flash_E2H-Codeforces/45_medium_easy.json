There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Tennis Tournament Games**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm trying to figure out how many games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given this weird rule: you can only play someone if your previous game counts differ by at most one. The goal is to make the winner play as many matches as possible.\n\nI started thinking about this in terms of the number of players still in the tournament after someone has won a certain number of games, let's call that `k`.  I need to find the minimum number of total players to get a winner to play `k` games. Let's call this minimum number `N(k)`.\n\nClearly, to get a winner who hasn't played, we start with 1 player. To get a winner who plays 1 game, you need two, a winner and a loser.\n\nThen I realized a pattern. Each game the winner needs an opponent.  The opponent's previous games count must be close to the winner's.  Let's consider these building blocks of player counts. I noticed this resembles the Fibonacci sequence, but it is a shifted version. The minimum number of players needed to get a winner to play k games `N(k)` turns out to be equal to `F_{k+2}` where `F` is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWith `n` players, to maximize the number of games, I need to figure out the largest `k` where `N(k)` is less than or equal to `n`.  So I will start with Fibonnaci and keep adding fibonacci numbers to see how many players I will need to get a winner to play more games. \nI can just iterate using the Fibonacci relation until I find the largest k that fits. Using a simple loop, given `n`, I can efficiently determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games the winner plays. To maximize `k`, the winner must win every game. Let's denote the winner as `W`.\n\nConsider the state of players by the number of games they have won. Initially, all `n` players have won 0 games.\n\nLet `N(k)` be the minimum total number of players required for a tournament winner to play `k` games.\n\n*   **`k = 0`**: A player who hasn't played any games. This requires 1 player. So, `N(0) = 1`. (This isn't a tournament winner, but it's a base case for building up the sequence).\n\n*   **`k = 1`**: The winner `W` plays 1 game. `W` (0 games won) plays an opponent `O` (0 games won). `abs(0 - 0) = 0 <= 1`, so this is a valid match. `W` wins. `W` has now played 1 game. This requires 2 players in total. So, `N(1) = 2`.\n\n*   **`k = 2`**: The winner `W` needs to play a second game. Before this game, `W` has already won 1 game. Let `W_1` denote `W` having won 1 game. `W_1` needs to play an opponent `O_j` who has won `j` games. The rule `abs(1 - j) <= 1` means `j` can be 0, 1, or 2.\n    *   `j = 0`: `W_1` plays `O_0`. `W` wins. `W` has 2 games. To produce `W_1` we need `N(1)` players. To produce `O_0` we need `N(0)` players. Total players: `N(1) + N(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    *   `j = 1`: `W_1` plays `O_1`. `W` wins. `W` has 2 games. To produce `W_1` we need `N(1)` players. To produce `O_1` we need `N(1)` players. Total players: `N(1) + N(1) = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n    *   `j = 2`: `W_1` cannot play `O_2`, because if `O` had already won 2 games, and `W` won this match, `W` would have 3 games, not 2.\n    \n    To find the *minimum* number of players `N(2)`, we choose the option that requires fewer players: `N(2) = 3`.\n\n*   **`k = 3`**: The winner `W` needs to play a third game. Before this game, `W` has already won 2 games (`W_2`). `W_2` needs to play an opponent `O_j` who has won `j` games. The rule `abs(2 - j) <= 1` means `j` can be 1, 2, or 3.\n    *   `j = 1`: `W_2` plays `O_1`. `W` wins. `W` has 3 games. Total players: `N(2) + N(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n    *   `j = 2`: `W_2` plays `O_2`. `W` wins. `W` has 3 games. Total players: `N(2) + N(2) = 3 + 3 = 6`.\n    *   `j = 3`: `W_2` cannot play `O_3` (similar reason as above).\n    \n    To find the *minimum* number of players `N(3)`, we choose the option that requires fewer players: `N(3) = 5`.\n\nWe observe a pattern: to get a winner who has played `k` games, the winner must have played `k-1` games and then played one more. For this last game, the winner (`W_{k-1}`) needs an opponent (`O_j`). The rule `abs((k-1) - j) <= 1` implies `j` can be `k-2` or `k-1`. (It cannot be `k` because then `W` would have `k+1` wins).\n\nTo minimize `N(k)`, we should choose the opponent configuration that requires fewer players:\n`N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence! Let's map it to the standard Fibonacci sequence `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`\n*   `N(0) = 1 = F_2`\n*   `N(1) = 2 = F_3`\n*   `N(2) = 3 = F_4`\n*   `N(3) = 5 = F_5`\n*   `N(k) = F_{k+2}`\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` (number of games) such that `N(k) <= n`. We need to find the largest `k` for which `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nWe can iterate through Fibonacci numbers until we find one that exceeds `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `a = 1` (representing `N(0)` or `F_2`).\n2.  Initialize `b = 2` (representing `N(1)` or `F_3`).\n3.  Initialize `games = 1` (this variable will track `k` for `N(k)=b`).\n    *   When `b=N(1)=2`, `games=1`.\n    *   When `b=N(2)=3`, `games=2`.\n    *   When `b=N(k)`, `games=k`.\n4.  Loop while `b <= n`:\n    *   Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `temp = b`, `b = a + b`, `a = temp`.\n    *   Increment `games`: `games = games + 1`.\n5.  When the loop terminates, `b` is the first Fibonacci number `N(k_{current})` that is greater than `n`.\n    The `games` variable would have been incremented to `k_{current}`.\n    The maximum `k` for which `N(k) <= n` was the previous `k` value, which is `k_{current} - 1`.\n    So, the result is `games - 1`.\n\n**Example for n = 10:**\n*   Initial: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `games = 1`\n*   Loop 1: `b=2 <= 10` is True. `temp=2`, `b=1+2=3`, `a=2`, `games=2`. (`N(2)=3`, winner plays 2 games)\n*   Loop 2: `b=3 <= 10` is True. `temp=3`, `b=2+3=5`, `a=3`, `games=3`. (`N(3)=5`, winner plays 3 games)\n*   Loop 3: `b=5 <= 10` is True. `temp=5`, `b=3+5=8`, `a=5`, `games=4`. (`N(4)=8`, winner plays 4 games)\n*   Loop 4: `b=8 <= 10` is True. `temp=8`, `b=5+8=13`, `a=8`, `games=5`. (`N(5)=13`, winner plays 5 games)\n*   Loop 5: `b=13 <= 10` is False. Loop terminates.\n*   Result: `games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will be relatively small (for `n=10^18`, `k` is around 80-90). Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large `n` values automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # N(k) is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n    # N(0) = 1 (a player who hasn't played)\n    # N(1) = 2 (winner plays 1 game, needs 2 players: W(0) vs O(0))\n    # For k >= 2, N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)\n    # This sequence corresponds to Fibonacci numbers F_{k+2} where F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n\n    # We want to find the largest k such that N(k) <= n.\n\n    # 'a' will store N(k-1)\n    # 'b' will store N(k)\n    # 'games' will store the current number of games (k) for which 'b' is N(k)\n\n    # Initial values:\n    # For k=0, N(0)=1.
