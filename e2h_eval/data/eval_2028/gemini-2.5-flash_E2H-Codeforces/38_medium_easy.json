    "thought": "**Solving a Competitive Programming Problem: Minimizing Nodes and Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this graph theory problem. My goal is to figure out two things: first, what's the smallest number of nodes (`n`) I need to build a directed graph where exactly `p` pairs of nodes are mutually reachable (meaning there's a path both ways between them, and the first node is less than the second)? Second, given that minimum `n`, what's the most number of unidirectional pairs I can possibly have in such a graph?\n\nFirst, I need to understand reachability. Nodes are \"mutually reachable\" if there's a path from `u` to `v` and from `v` to `u`. This forms a \"Strongly Connected Component\" (SCC). If I have an SCC with `k` nodes, I can get `k * (k - 1) / 2` mutually reachable pairs. To minimize the number of nodes `n`, I should try to make one large SCC.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest `k` (the number of nodes) where `k * (k - 1) / 2 >= p`. I can then start with this size `k`, and it's the minimal one. If it generates too many pairs (`> p`), I have extra nodes I can re-arrange. If the number of pairs exceeds the required number (`p`), I need to separate the SCC and make some of the nodes isolated (or part of other SCCs of size 2, since each size 2 SCC generates only one new pair).\n\nIf that's the minimal number of nodes for one large SCC, let's call it `N_min`. My next step is to maximize the unidirectional pairs.  Remember that these are pairs `(u, v)` where `u` can reach `v`, but `v` cannot reach `u`. These have to exist in different SCCs. I have to create SCCs such that I obtain the target number `p` of mutually reachable pairs using the minimal number of nodes `N_min`. In order to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, I want to minimize the number of \"internal\" pairs within each SCC, and maximize the number of \"external\" paths between SCCs.\n\nI figure I'll have the biggest SCC, of size `k_0`. Then I'll have some \"2-node SCCs\" to generate the remaining pairs. All of the unidirectional pairs will be created between distinct SCCs. The graph can be arranged as a chain of SCCs. To calculate the maximum, all I need to do is sum the product of sizes of distinct SCCs: `( (n^2 - sum (|S_i|^2)) / 2)`.\n\nSo, the game plan is: find `k_0` (largest `k` with `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`).  Use that to get `n` and unidirectional pairs. This logic seems correct and efficient. I have a working implementation in mind.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a directed graph that contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes `n`, the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there's a path from `u` to `v`, and no path from `v` to `u`.\n\nLet's break down the concepts:\n\n**Mutually Reachable Pairs:**\nTwo nodes `u` and `v` are mutually reachable if there's a path from `u` to `v` and a path from `v` to `u`. This means `u` and `v` belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes within this SCC are mutually reachable. The number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` from an SCC of size `k` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\n**Minimizing Nodes `n` for `p`-reachable graph:**\nTo achieve exactly `p` mutually reachable pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` using the minimum total number of nodes `n`, we should use a strategy that is node-efficient. The function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` (number of pairs from `k` nodes in one SCC) is convex. This implies that to generate a certain number of pairs, it's generally more node-efficient to put nodes into larger SCCs rather than many small ones.\nSpecifically, `f(k_1 + k_2) = f(k_1) + f(k_2) + k_1 * k_2`. Since `k_1, k_2 > 0`, `k_1 * k_2 > 0`, so `f(k_1 + k_2) > f(k_1) + f(k_2)`. This means combining nodes into a single larger SCC yields more pairs for the same total number of nodes compared to splitting them into smaller SCCs.\n\nThe optimal strategy to achieve `p` pairs with minimum nodes `n` is as follows:\n1. Find the largest integer `k_0` such that an SCC of size `k_0` generates `k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2` pairs, and this value is less than or equal to `p`.\n2. Let `P_0 = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2`. This is the number of pairs generated by the main SCC of size `k_0`.\n3. The remaining pairs needed are `p_rem = p - P_0`.\n4. Each additional pair must come from a new SCC. The smallest SCC that generates pairs is an SCC of size 2, which produces `2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1` pair.\n5. So, to get `p_rem` additional pairs, we need `p_rem` separate SCCs, each of size 2. These `p_rem` SCCs will use `2 * p_rem` nodes.\n6. The total minimum number of nodes `n` is `k_0 + 2 * p_rem`. These nodes are distinct and form `1 + p_rem` SCCs (one of size `k_0`, and `p_rem` of size 2).\n\n**Special Case `p = 0`:**\nIf `p = 0`, no `(u, v)` pairs with `u < v` should be mutually reachable. The minimum number of nodes for this is `0` (an empty graph). If `n=1` is used, `k_0=1`, `P_0=0`, `p_rem=0`, `n=1`. But `n=0` is possible. The example output for `p=0` is `0 0`, confirming `n=0` is the minimum.\n\n**Finding `k_0`:**\nSince `p <= 2 * 10^5`, `k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2 <= 2 * 10^5` implies `k_0^2` is approximately `4 * 10^5`, so `k_0` is at most around `sqrt(4 * 10^5) \\approx 632`. We can find `k_0` by iterating `k` starting from 1 until `k * (k - 1) / 2` exceeds `p`. The last `k` for which `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p` is our `k_0`.\n\n**Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs:**\nA pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u` can reach `v` but `v` cannot reach `u`. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `SCC(u)` to `SCC(v)` in the condensation graph (the DAG of SCCs).\nTo maximize such pairs for a fixed set of `n` nodes and fixed SCC sizes, we should arrange the SCCs in a linear chain. If we have `m` SCCs `C_1, C_2, ..., C_m` with sizes `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m`, we can add edges such that `C_1` can reach `C_2`, `C_2` can reach `C_3`, and so on, up to `C_m`. This ensures that `C_i` can reach `C_j` for all `i < j`.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs will be the sum of products of sizes of all distinct pairs of SCCs: `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} s_i * s_j`.\nThis sum can be computed using the identity: `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} s_i * s_j = ( (sum_{i=1 to m} s_i)^2 - sum_{i=1 to m} (s_i^2) ) / 2`.\nHere, `sum s_i` is the total number of nodes `n`.\nThe SCCs we formed are one SCC of size `k_0` and `p_rem` SCCs of size 2.\nSo, `sum (s_i^2) = k_0^2 + p_rem * (2^2) = k_0^2 + 4 * p_rem`.\nThus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs `U` is `(n^2 - (k_0^2 + 4 * p_rem)) / 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`p=4`):**\n1. `p = 4`. It's not 0.\n2. Find `k_0`:\n   - `k=1`: `1*(0)/2 = 0 <= 4`. `k_0 = 1`.\n   - `k=2`: `2*(1)/2 = 1 <= 4`. `k_0 = 2`.\n   - `k=3`: `3*(2)/2 = 3 <= 4`. `k_0 = 3`.\n   - `k=4`: `4*(3)/2 = 6 > 4`. Stop.\n   So, `k_0 = 3`.\n3. `P_0 = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3`.\n4. `p_rem = p - P_0 = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n5. Minimum nodes `n = k_0 + 2 * p_rem = 3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.\n6. Calculate `U`:\n   - `sum_sq_scc_sizes = k_0^2 + p_rem * 4 = 3^2 + 1 * 4 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n   - `U = (n^2 - sum_sq_scc_sizes) / 2 = (5^2 - 13) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`. This matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Find k_0, the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p\n    # Iterate k starting from 1.\n    # The loop finds the largest k such that k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2 <= p.\n    # `k_0_val` stores the current largest k that satisfies the condition.\n    k_0_val = 0\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        current_pairs = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if current_pairs <= p:\n            k_0_val = k\n            k += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate P_0 (pairs from the main SCC) and p_rem (remaining pairs needed)\n    P_0 = k_0_val * (k_0_val - 1) // 2\n    p_rem = p - P_0\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of nodes n\n    # k_0_val nodes for the main SCC\n    # 2 * p_rem nodes for p_rem SCCs of size 2 (each providing 1 pair)\n    n = k_0_val + 2 * p_rem\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs U\n    # The SCCs are: one of size k_0_val, and p_rem SCCs each of size 2.\n    # Sum of squares of SCC sizes: k_0_val^2 + p_rem * (2^2)\n    sum_sq_scc_sizes = k_0_val**2 + p_rem * 4\n    \n    # Total unidirectional pairs U = (n^2 - sum_sq_scc_sizes) / 2\n    # This formula comes from arranging all SCCs in a chain (a line in the condensation graph).\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is sum_{i<j} |Si|*|Sj|\n    # which is ( (sum |Si|)^2 - sum (|Si|^2) ) / 2\n    # sum |Si| is the total number of nodes n.\n    U = (n**2 - sum_sq_scc_sizes) // 2\n    \n    print(n, U)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
