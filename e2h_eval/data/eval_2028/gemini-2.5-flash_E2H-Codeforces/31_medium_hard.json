Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya's Card Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. I need a Python script to figure out the minimum cards Vanya needs to reach a zero sum. Okay, the inputs are the number of cards, `n`, and the maximum card value, `x`. The goal is to reach a sum of zero. I need to figure out how many additional cards I need, given that I have infinite cards within the range of `-x` to `x`.\n\nFirst, I calculate the current sum, `S`, of the existing cards. Then, I figure out what the target sum needs to be, which is simply `-S`. To minimize the number of new cards, I'll try to have each new card contribute as much as possible towards the target sum. If `-S` is positive, new cards will have value `x`. If `-S` is negative, the new cards will be `-x`. If `S` is zero already, no new cards are needed. That's easy.\n\nNow, if `S` isn't zero, I need to know how many cards, `k`, I need to sum to `-S`.  This means I need `k * x >= abs(S)`. To get the *minimum* `k`, I need to use the smallest number of cards. This requires dividing the absolute sum by the absolute value of each card:  `k = ceil(abs(S) / x)`.  The ceiling operation here is essential, as I can't have fractional cards. If `abs(S) % x == 0`, then integer division is sufficient, otherwise, I need to add an extra card.\n\nI can make this a little bit faster by checking `abs(S) != 0` first. Then I calculate the result using the clever formula `(abs(S) + x - 1) // x`. This works because it effectively handles the `ceil` operation using integer division, as long as `x` and `abs(S)` are positive. If `abs(S)` is zero, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, in the Python code: I read `n`, `x`, the card values. Calculate `current_sum`. If the `current_sum` is zero, I print `0`. Otherwise, I calculate the minimum cards using the equation above. Finally, I print the minimum number of cards I need! That should do the trick. Now to write the script and run it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find such that the sum of all cards (found cards + new cards) equals zero. Vanya can find infinitely many cards, and each card can have any integer value `v` such that `|v| <= x`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the current sum:** First, sum all the numbers on the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `S`.\n\n2.  **Determine the target sum for new cards:** Vanya wants the total sum to be zero. If the current sum is `S`, then the sum of the new cards he finds, let's call it `S_new`, must satisfy `S + S_new = 0`. This means `S_new = -S`.\n\n3.  **Handle the base case:** If the `current_sum` `S` is already `0`, then Vanya doesn't need to find any new cards. The answer is `0`.\n\n4.  **Minimize the number of new cards:** If `S` is not `0`, Vanya needs to find cards whose sum is `-S`. To minimize the *number* of cards, he should make each new card contribute as much as possible towards the target sum `-S`.\n    *   The maximum absolute value a single card can have is `x`.\n    *   Therefore, to cover an absolute sum of `abs(S_new)` (which is `abs(-S)` or simply `abs(S)`) with the fewest cards, each card should have an absolute value of `x`.\n    *   For example, if `S` is positive, say `S=5`, he needs new cards that sum to `-5`. He can pick cards with value `-x`.\n    *   If `S` is negative, say `S=-5`, he needs new cards that sum to `5`. He can pick cards with value `x`.\n    *   In either case, the total absolute value he needs to cover is `abs(S)`. If each card contributes `x` to this absolute value, the number of cards needed would be `abs(S) / x`.\n    *   Since he can only find whole cards, he needs to take the ceiling of this division.\n    *   So, the minimum number of cards `k` is `ceil(abs(S) / x)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate ceiling:** For positive integers `a` and `b`, `ceil(a / b)` can be calculated using integer division as `(a + b - 1) // b`. In our case, `a` is `abs(S)` and `b` is `x`. Both will be positive if `S != 0` and `x >= 1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n`3 2`\n`-1 1 2`\n1. `n = 3`, `x = 2`. Cards: `-1, 1, 2`.\n2. `current_sum = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\n3. `current_sum` is not `0`.\n4. `required_abs_sum = abs(2) = 2`.\n5. `min_cards = ceil(2 / 2) = ceil(1) = 1`.\nOutput: `1` (Vanya can find one card with value `-2`).\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n`2 3`\n`-2 -2`\n1. `n = 2`, `x = 3`. Cards: `-2, -2`.\n2. `current_sum = -2 + -2 = -4`.\n3. `current_sum` is not `0`.\n4. `required_abs_sum = abs(-4) = 4`.\n5. `min_cards = ceil(4 / 3) = ceil(1.33...) = 2`.\nOutput: `2` (Vanya can find two cards, for example, two cards with value `2` each, as `|2| <= 3`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and x from the first line of input\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the n card values from the second line of input\n    cards = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the numbers on the found cards\n    current_sum = sum(cards)\n\n    # If the current sum is already zero, Vanya needs to find 0 additional cards.\n    if current_sum == 0:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n        return\n\n    # Vanya wants the total sum to be zero.\n    # This means the sum of the new cards he finds must be -current_sum.\n    # To minimize the number of new cards, each new card should contribute\n    # the maximum possible absolute value, which is x.\n    # So, we need to cover an absolute sum of abs(current_sum).\n    required_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)\n\n    # The minimum number of cards is ceil(required_abs_sum / x).\n    # We can use math.ceil for this.\n    min_cards = math.ceil(required_abs_sum / x)\n\n    # Print the result (convert float from math.ceil to int)\n    sys.stdout.write(str(int(min_cards)) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
