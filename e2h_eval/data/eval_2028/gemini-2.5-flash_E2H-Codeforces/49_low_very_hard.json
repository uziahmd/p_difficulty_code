They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Diving into Mushroom Strife: A Graph-Based Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem. We're given a graph where vertices are lawns and edges represent roads with GCD and LCM constraints on mushroom counts. The goal is to find a valid assignment of mushrooms to each lawn, or determine that none exists.\n\nMy first thought is that this screams \"graph theory.\" I can represent the problem as a graph where each node needs to be assigned a value. Now, each edge introduces a constraint: the GCD and LCM of the values at its endpoints must match the given values.\n\nLet's break down the constraints. If two lawns, *u* and *v*, are connected by an edge with GCD *g* and LCM *l*, a few things are immediately clear. First, *l* absolutely has to be divisible by *g* - fundamental property of GCD and LCM. If it isn't, there's no solution, we can stop right there.\n\nNow, if we set *v<sub>u</sub>* and *v<sub>v</sub>* as mushroom counts on lawns *u* and *v*, we know that the product of *v<sub>u</sub>* and *v<sub>v</sub>* has to be *g* * *l*. Let me express *v<sub>u</sub>* and *v<sub>v</sub>* in terms of *g*. Suppose *v<sub>u</sub>* = *g* * *x* and *v<sub>v</sub>* = *g* * *y*.\n\nFrom the GCD and LCM relationships, *x* and *y* have to be coprime. Substituting the expressions for *v<sub>u</sub>* and *v<sub>v</sub>* into the product equation gives *g* * *l* = *g*<sup>2</sup> * *x* * *y*. Dividing both sides by *g* gives the critical relation *l* / *g* = *x* * *y*.\n\nSo for a valid edge, we now know that *l* / *g* should be equal to the product of two coprime numbers. This insight will be useful for a constructive algorithm, where for each edge, I need to figure out these factors *x* and *y* in an efficient way to check for all edge constraints. I'm going to focus on finding a suitable prime factorization of *l* / *g*, as it is the key. Since the prime factor decomposition is unique, the potential sets of *x* and *y* will be limited. My attention should next center on exploring the implications for the graph as a whole.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to assign a number of mushrooms (between 1 and 10^6) to each of `n` lawns. We are given `m` roads, each connecting two lawns, along with the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts on those two lawns. We need to find any valid assignment or report that none exists.\n\nLet `v_u` and `v_v` be the number of mushrooms on lawns `u` and `v` respectively, connected by an edge with given `GCD = g` and `LCM = l`.\nThe fundamental properties of GCD and LCM are:\n1. `v_u` and `v_v` must both be multiples of `g`.\n2. `v_u` and `v_v` must both be divisors of `l`.\n3. `v_u * v_v = g * l`.\n4. `l` must be divisible by `g`. If `l % g != 0` for any edge, no solution exists.\n\nLet `v_u = g * x` and `v_v = g * y`. From property 3, `(g * x) * (g * y) = g * l`, which simplifies to `g * x * y = l`, or `x * y = l / g`. Also, `GCD(x, y)` must be 1.\n\nThis means for each edge `(u, v)` with `(g, l)`:\n- `v_u` must be a multiple of `g`.\n- `v_v` must be a multiple of `g`.\n- `v_u / g` and `v_v / g` must be coprime factors of `l / g`.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as a graph problem. Each lawn is a vertex. For each vertex `u`, we need to determine `v_u`.\nThe constraints on `v_u` are of two types:\n1. **Divisibility:** For each edge `(u, v)` with `GCD = g`, `v_u` must be a multiple of `g`. If `u` is part of multiple edges `(u, v_1)` with `g_1`, `(u, v_2)` with `g_2`, etc., then `v_u` must be a multiple of `LCM(g_1, g_2, ...)`. Let's call this `min_mult[u]`.\n2. **Factorization:** For each edge `(u, v)` with `(g, l)`, `v_u / g` must be a factor of `l / g`. This implies `v_u` must be a factor of `l`. If `u` is part of multiple edges `(u, v_1)` with `l_1`, `(u, v_2)` with `l_2`, etc., then `v_u` must be a divisor of `GCD(l_1, l_2, ...)`. Let's call this `max_div[u]`.\n\nCombining these, for each vertex `u`, `v_u` must be a multiple of `min_mult[u]` and a divisor of `max_div[u]`. If `max_div[u] % min_mult[u] != 0`, or `min_mult[u] > max_div[u]`, then no solution exists.\n\nA key observation: if we fix `v_u` for some `u`, then for any neighbor `v` connected by an edge `(u, v)` with `(g, l)`, `v_v` is uniquely determined by `v_v = (g * l) / v_u`. We can then check if this `v_v` satisfies all constraints for `v`.\n\nThis suggests a strategy:\n1. **Preprocessing:**\n   - Initialize `ans[u] = 0` for all `u`.\n   - For each `u`, calculate `current_min_mult[u]` (initially 1) and `current_max_div[u]` (initially 10^6 + 7, a value larger than 10^6).\n   - For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n     - Check `l % g != 0`. If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n     - Update `current_min_mult[u] = LCM(current_min_mult[u], g)`.\n     - Update `current_min_mult[v] = LCM(current_min_mult[v], g)`.\n     - Update `current_max_div[u] = GCD(current_max_div[u], l)`.\n     - Update `current_max_div[v] = GCD(current_max_div[v], l)`.\n     - Store edges in an adjacency list `adj[u] = [(v, g, l), ...]`.\n\n2. **Initial Check and Queue Setup:**\n   - For each `u`:\n     - If `current_max_div[u] % current_min_mult[u] != 0`, print \"NO\" and exit.\n     - If `current_min_mult[u] == current_max_div[u]`, then `v_u` is uniquely determined as `current_min_mult[u]`. Set `ans[u] = current_min_mult[u]` and add `u` to a queue for processing.\n     - Otherwise, `v_u` is not uniquely determined yet.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Propagation:**\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue `u`.\n     - For each neighbor `v` of `u` with edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n       - If `ans[v]` is already determined, skip (already processed or fixed).\n       - Calculate `expected_v_v = (g * l) // ans[u]`.\n       - Check if `expected_v_v` is valid:\n         - `1 <= expected_v_v <= 10^6`.\n         - `expected_v_v` must be a multiple of `g`.\n         - `expected_v_v` must be a multiple of `current_min_mult[v]`.\n         - `expected_v_v` must be a divisor of `l`.\n         - `expected_v_v` must be a divisor of `current_max_div[v]`.\n         - `GCD(ans[u], expected_v_v)` must be `g`.\n         - `LCM(ans[u], expected_v_v)` must be `l`.\n       - If any check fails, print \"NO\" and exit.\n       - If all checks pass, set `ans[v] = expected_v_v` and enqueue `v`.\n\n4. **Handling Undetermined Vertices (Connected Components):**\n   - After the BFS, some `ans[u]` might still be 0 (undetermined). This happens if the graph is disconnected or if a component has no uniquely determined starting point.\n   - For each `u` where `ans[u] == 0`:\n     - We need to pick an arbitrary valid value for `v_u` and propagate. The simplest valid value for `v_u` is `current_min_mult[u]`.\n     - Set `ans[u] = current_min_mult[u]` and enqueue `u`.\n     - Run another BFS starting from this `u` to propagate values within its component.\n     - If any conflict arises during this propagation, print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n5. **Final Output:**\n   - If all steps complete without \"NO\", print \"YES\" and then `ans[1] ... ans[n]`.\n\n**Helper Functions:**\n- `gcd(a, b)`: Standard greatest common divisor.\n- `lcm(a, b)`: `(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. Need to handle potential overflow if `a*b` exceeds typical integer limits, but here `a, b <= 10^6`, so `a*b <= 10^12`, which fits in 64-bit integers (Python handles large integers automatically).\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- `n=1, m=0`: Output \"YES\\n1\". (My code initializes `ans` to 1 for `m=0` for nodes not part of any edge, which is fine).\n- Disconnected graphs: Handled by the second BFS pass.\n- `min_mult[u]` and `max_div[u]` can be 1 or 10^6.\n- The `current_max_div` initialization should be a value guaranteed to be greater than any possible `l`. 10^6 + 7 is a safe choice.\n- `LCM` of multiple numbers can grow very quickly. `LCM(a, b, c) = LCM(LCM(a, b), c)`. Since `g` values are up to 10^6, `LCM` of two `g`s can exceed 10^6. This is fine as `current_min_mult[u]` can exceed 10^6. However, `v_u` itself must be `<= 10^6`. If `current_min_mult[u] > 10^6`, then no `v_u` exists, so print \"NO\". This check is implicitly done when `current_min_mult[u] > current_max_div[u]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nInput:\n3 2\n3 2 1 2\n3 1 1 10\n\n1. **Preprocessing:**\n   `adj = {1: [], 2: [], 3: []}`\n   `ans = [0, 0, 0]`\n   `min_mult = [1, 1, 1]`\n   `max_div = [10^6+7, 10^6+7, 10^6+7]`\n\n   Edge (3, 2, 1, 2):\n     `l % g == 2 % 1 == 0`.
