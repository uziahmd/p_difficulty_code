Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Efficient Triangle Counting**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of counting non-degenerate triangles with integer sides, given these bounds: A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D. My goal is a Python script, of course.\n\nFirst, I clarified the non-degeneracy conditions.  Standard stuff: `x + y > z`, `x + z > y`, and `y + z > x`.  However, because of the constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z` (specifically `x <= y <= z`), the latter two inequalities are automatically satisfied.  So, I only need to ensure `x + y > z`. That simplifies things.\n\nNow, a brute-force approach with nested loops for `x`, `y`, and `z` would be too slow, computationally speaking, given the potential size of D.  My thoughts immediately jump to optimizing. I thought iterating through `x` and `y` and then calculating the *valid* range for `z` would be faster.\n\nFor a fixed `x` and `y`, the conditions on `z` are:  `C <= z <= D` *and* `z < x + y`. So, `z` lies within the interval `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.  The number of valid `z` values is then `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThis leads me to a double loop iterating over `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C`.  Inside the loops, I calculate the `lower_bound_z` (which is `C`) and the `upper_bound_z` (which is `min(D, x + y - 1)`). Then, if `upper_bound_z` is greater than or equal to `lower_bound_z`, I add the count (`upper_bound_z - lower_bound_z + 1`) to the `total_triangles`.\n\nThe outer loops are still a potential bottleneck though, as this could lead to O(D^2) complexity. And with D potentially being up to 500,000, that could take far too long. I have to find something faster, perhaps employing some clever math or pre-computation to avoid this quadratic complexity... Time to brainstorm.\n",
