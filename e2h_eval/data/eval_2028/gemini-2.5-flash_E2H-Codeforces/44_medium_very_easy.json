He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Maximizing Profit in Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've been working on this competitive programming problem, and here's my thought process. The core idea is to find the optimal way to distribute problems over days to maximize profit.\n\nThe problem gives us `n` problems, `k` days, and an array `a` of difficulties. The goal is to divide the `n` problems into `k` contiguous segments, where the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty within that day's problems. The overall profit is the sum of these daily maximums.\n\nTo maximize this sum, I realized that we need to select the `k` largest values from the input array `a` to become the maximums for each of the `k` days.  The trick is to figure out the distribution of problems such that we can *guarantee* that these `k` largest values are indeed the maximum for their respective days.\n\nI started by thinking about dynamic programming, but the naive approach with O(n^3) complexity quickly became apparent as too slow. So, I switched gears and started looking for a structure in the optimal solution. I realized that to get the maximum sum of `k` values, you *must* select the `k` largest values from the array. The challenge is in the distribution of the problems.\n\nMy key insight was this: if you sort the array by value and then select the `k` largest, the profit would be the sum of those `k` values, as long as we can divide the days accordingly. Each of the chosen maximum values gets a day and each selected maximum *must* be the maximum of its segment.\n\nHere's how I plan to implement it:\n\n1.  **Find the `k` largest values:**  I'll start by creating an array of value-index pairs and sort it in descending order of value.\n2.  **Determine the split points:** The indices of these `k` values are critical. I'll sort them to get `p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k`. These will guide the splits.\n3.  **Calculate the Daily Problem Count:**\n    *   Day 1: ends at `p_1`, so `t_1 = p_1 + 1` problems.\n    *   Day 2: starts at `p_1 + 1` and ends at `p_2`, `t_2 = p_2 - p_1` problems.\n    *   Continue this pattern for the remaining days.\n    *   The last day ends at the end, at `n-1`, therefore the last day has `n-p_{k-1}` problems.\n4.  **Calculate Total Profit:** Simply sum up the `k` largest values that we initially identified.\n\nThis way, I know each day will contain one of the `k` selected maximum values and, most importantly, *only* one.  Thus, the sum of those `k` values is the maximum achievable profit. I'm pretty confident this is a correct and efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to distribute `n` problems, with given difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous sequences (days). Each day, Polycarp solves at least one problem. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of daily profits, and output this maximum profit along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Part 1: Maximizing Total Profit**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, we should aim to make each daily maximum as large as possible. The largest possible values for these maximums come from the `k` largest problem difficulties in the entire list `a`.\n\nLet `M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k` be the `k` largest difficulties present in the list `a`. If there are duplicate difficulties, they are counted separately (e.g., if `a = [1, 2000, 2000, 2]` and `k=2`, the two largest are `2000` and `2000`).\nThe maximum total profit will be `M_1 + M_2 + \\dots + M_k`.\n\nWhy is this true?\nEach of the `k` days must have a maximum difficulty. If we choose any `k` problems `p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k` to be the daily maximums, their sum will be `\\sum_{i=1}^k a_{p_i}`. To maximize this sum, we should select the `k` problems with the highest difficulties from the entire list `a`. It is always possible to assign each of these `k` largest problems to a different day such that it becomes the maximum for that day's segment.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the `k` largest difficulties in `a` and sum them up.\n\n**Part 2: Determining Problem Distribution (`t_j` values)**\n\nOnce we have identified the `k` largest difficulties, let's say they are `a_{idx_1}, a_{idx_2}, \\dots, a_{idx_k}`, where `idx_j` are their original 0-based indices in the list `a`. To construct a valid distribution, we need to ensure two things:\n1.  Each of these `k` problems `a_{idx_j}` becomes the maximum for one of the `k` days.\n2.  All `n` problems are covered, and each day solves a contiguous sequence of problems.\n\nA simple strategy to achieve this is as follows:\n1.  Get the original indices of the `k` largest problems. Let these be `p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k`.\n2.  Sort these `k` indices in ascending order: `p_1 < p_2 < \\dots < p_k`.\n3.  These sorted indices will serve as \"markers\" for where the days end. Specifically, we will make `k-1` cuts.\n    *   The first day will cover problems from index `0` up to `p_1`.\n    *   The second day will cover problems from index `p_1+1` up to `p_2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   The `j`-th day (for `j < k`) will cover problems from index `p_{j-1}+1` up to `p_j`.\n    *   The `k`-th (last) day will cover problems from index `p_{k-1}+1` up to `n-1`.\n\nLet's verify this strategy:\n*   **Contiguity and Coverage**: By defining segments this way, all problems from `0` to `n-1` are covered exactly once, and each day's problems form a contiguous sequence.\n*   **Each `a_{p_j}` is a daily maximum**: Consider the `j`-th day, covering problems `a[p_{j-1}+1 \\dots p_j]` (or `a[0 \\dots p_1]` for `j=1`). This segment includes `a[p_j]`. Could there be another problem `a_x` in this segment such that `a_x > a[p_j]`? If `a_x > a[p_j]`, then `a_x` must also be one of the `k` largest values. However, `p_j` is the largest index among the `k` chosen indices that falls within or ends the current segment. Any other `a_x` that is one of the `k` largest values must have an index `x` that is either `p_j` itself, or `x < p_j` (which would mean `x` is `p_m` for `m < j`, and `a[p_m]` would be in an earlier day), or `x > p_j` (which would mean `a[p_x]` is in a later day). Therefore, `a[p_j]` must be the maximum in its assigned segment. The same logic applies to the last day, where `a[p_k]` is the maximum.\n*   **At least one problem per day**: Since `p_j` are distinct and sorted, `p_j - p_{j-1} \\ge 1` (with `p_0 = -1`). So each segment has at least one problem.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Indexed problems**: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  **Sort by value (descending)**: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  **Top `k=3` elements**: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`\n4.  **Total profit**: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n5.  **Original indices of top `k` elements**: `[6, 3, 0]`\n6.  **Sort indices (ascending)**: `p_1=0, p_2=3, p_3=6`\n7.  **Calculate `t_j` values**:\n    *   `t_1`: Problems from index `0` to `p_1=0`. Length `p_1 - (-1) = 0 - (-1) = 1`.\n        Problems: `[a[0]] = [5]`. Max `5`.\n    *   `t_2`: Problems from index `p_1+1=1` to `p_2=3`. Length `p_2 - p_1 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n        Problems: `[a[1], a[2], a[3]] = [4, 2, 6]`. Max `6`.\n    *   `t_3`: Problems from index `p_2+1=4` to `n-1=7`. Length `(n-1) - (p_2+1) + 1 = n - p_2 = 8 - 3 = 5`.\n        Problems: `[a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]] = [5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max `9`.\n8.  **Resulting `t` values**: `[1, 3, 5]`\n\nThis gives a total profit of `20` and distribution `1 3 5`. The example output was `3 2 3`. Both are valid and yield the maximum profit. The problem allows any valid answer.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the array `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each element in `a`.\n4.  Sort this list in descending order based on `value`.\n5.  Sum the `value`s of the first `k` elements to get the `total_profit`.\n6.  Extract the `index`es of these `k` elements.\n7.  Sort these `k` indices in ascending order.\n8.  Calculate the `t_j` values:\n    *   Initialize `t_values = []`.\n    *   `current_idx = -1` (represents the end of the previous segment).\n    *   Iterate through the sorted `k` indices `p_j` for `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        *   The length of day `j+1` is `p_j - current_idx`.\n        *   Add this length to `t_values`.\n        *   Update `current_idx = p_j`.\n    *   The length of the last day (`k`-th day) is `n - 1 - current_idx`.\n    *   Add this length to `t_values`.\n9.  Print `total_profit`.\n10. Print `t_values` separated by spaces.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create (value, original_index) pairs\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by value in descending order\n    indexed_a.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Take the top k elements\n    top_k_elements = indexed_a[:k]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate total profit\n    total_profit = sum(x[0] for x in top_k_elements)\n\n    # Step 5: Extract original indices and sort them\n    split_indices = [x[1] for x in top_k_elements]\n    split_indices.sort()\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate lengths of segments (t_j values)\n    t_values = []\n    current_start_idx = 0\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The i-th split_index (0-indexed) marks the end of day (i+1)'s problems.\n        # So day (i+1) covers problems from current_start_idx to split_indices[i].\n        length = split_indices[i] - current_start_idx + 1\n        t_values.append(length)\n        current_start_idx = split_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last day covers problems from current_start_idx to n-1\n    length_last_day = n - current_start_idx\n    t_values.append(length_last_day)\n\n    # Output results\n    print(total_profit)\n    print(*(t_values))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
