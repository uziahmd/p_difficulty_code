Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Knapsack Conundrum: A Weighty Decision**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got this classic knapsack problem, but with a twist - the weights are tiny (1, 2, or 3). The usual dynamic programming approach (O(n*m)) is a no-go with these massive inputs (n and m up to 100,000 and 300,000 respectively). The core challenge is leveraging this \"small weights\" constraint effectively.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize the items: weight 1, weight 2, and weight 3. We'd sort each category by cost (descending) - greedy for each individual weight. However, a purely greedy approach won't work due to the 0/1 nature. \n\nSo, let's explore dynamic programming to combine small weights. We'll precompute the prefix sums of costs for each weight category. My first thought is fixing the number of weight-3 items, and then use DP to get the max cost using remaining weight for weight-1 and weight-2 items.\n\nIt's clear that simple iterations over numbers of weight 2 and 3 items result in a terrible O(m^2) solution, which is still too slow.\n\nIt looks like the key to efficiency lies in how we iterate and combine the small weights. The brute-force nature of iterating through all combinations seems computationally prohibitive.\n\nThe optimal solution probably involves some clever interplay between fixed values, prefix sums, and iteration. We need to smartly limit the state space. But it's not clear which state to fix. If we fix one of the k1, k2, k3 values, we still end up with expensive inner loops.\n\nIt feels like this must be solvable in something better than O(m^2). Perhaps looking at the weights modulo something could reveal a pattern.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs with maximum total cost, such that their total weight does not exceed `m`. We are given `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `wi` and cost `ci`. The key constraints are:\n*   `n` is up to 100,000\n*   `m` is up to 300,000\n*   `wi` can only be 1, 2, or 3\n\nA standard 0/1 knapsack DP solution would be `O(n*m)`, which is too slow given `n` and `m` values. The small range of weights (`wi <= 3`) is the critical observation.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Categorize and Sort:** First, separate the souvenirs into three lists based on their weights: `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`. To maximize cost, we should always pick the most expensive items first for each weight category. So, sort each of these lists in descending order of cost.\n\n2.  **Precompute Prefix Sums:** Calculate prefix sums for each sorted list.\n    *   `P1[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 1.\n    *   `P2[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 2.\n    *   `P3[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 3.\n    These arrays will have a dummy `0` at index 0 for convenience (representing 0 items, 0 cost).\n\n3.  **Dynamic Programming for Weights 1 and 2:**\n    The core idea is to build a DP table for items of weight 1 and 2. Let `dp12[w]` be the maximum cost achievable using only items of weight 1 and 2, with a total weight of exactly `w`.\n    This `dp12` table can be constructed efficiently. We can iterate through all possible numbers of weight-2 items (`k2`) and then fill the remaining capacity with weight-1 items greedily.\n    `dp12 = [-1] * (m + 1)` (initialize with -1 to indicate unreachable states, except `dp12[0]=0`)\n    `dp12[0] = 0`\n    `for k2 from 0 to len(items_w2):`\n        `current_w2_cost = P2[k2]`\n        `weight_used_by_w2 = 2 * k2`\n        `if weight_used_by_w2 > m: break`\n        `remaining_capacity_for_w1 = m - weight_used_by_w2`\n        `for k1 from 0 to min(len(items_w1), remaining_capacity_for_w1):`\n            `current_w1_cost = P1[k1]`\n            `total_weight = weight_used_by_w2 + k1`\n            `if total_weight <= m:`\n                `dp12[total_weight] = max(dp12[total_weight], current_w2_cost + current_w1_cost)`\n    This nested loop is too slow (`O(m^2)` in worst case).\n\n    A more efficient way to compute `dp12`:\n    `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `ptr1 = 0` (pointer to the next available weight-1 item)\n    `ptr2 = 0` (pointer to the next available weight-2 item)\n    `current_cost1 = 0`\n    `current_cost2 = 0`\n\n    `for w in range(1, m + 1):`\n        `val1 = -1`\n        `if w - 1 >= 0 and ptr1 < len(items_w1):`\n            `val1 = dp12[w-1] + items_w1[ptr1]` (hypothetically take a weight-1 item)\n        \n        `val2 = -1`\n        `if w - 2 >= 0 and ptr2 < len(items_w2):`\n            `val2 = dp12[w-2] + items_w2[ptr2]` (hypothetically take a weight-2 item)\n        \n        `if val1 == -1 and val2 == -1:`\n            `dp12[w] = dp12[w-1]` (if no items can be added, current max is previous max)\n        `elif val1 >= val2:`\n            `dp12[w] = val1`\n            `ptr1 += 1`\n        `else:`\n            `dp12[w] = val2`\n            `ptr2 += 1`\n    This approach is incorrect for 0/1 knapsack because `dp12[w-1]` might have already used the `ptr1`-th item.\n\n    The correct way to compute `dp12[w]` is:\n    For each possible total weight `w` from `0` to `m`:\n    `dp12[w]` stores the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n    We can iterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items_w2)`. For each `k2`, we use `2*k2` weight and `P2[k2]` cost. The remaining weight `w - 2*k2` must be filled by weight-1 items. We take `min(len(items_w1), w - 2*k2)` weight-1 items.\n    `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `for w in range(m + 1):`\n        `max_cost_for_w = 0`\n        `for k2 in range(len(P2)):`\n            `weight_from_w2 = 2 * k2`\n            `if weight_from_w2 > w: break`\n            `cost_from_w2 = P2[k2]`\n            `remaining_w = w - weight_from_w2`\n            `cost_from_w1 = P1[min(len(P1) - 1, remaining_w)]`\n            `max_cost_for_w = max(max_cost_for_w, cost_from_w2 + cost_from_w1)`\n        `dp12[w] = max_cost_for_w`\n    This is `O(m * len(items_w2))`, which is `O(m^2)` in the worst case, still too slow.\n\n    **The correct and efficient DP for weights 1 and 2:**\n    We can compute `dp12[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m` in `O(m + len(items_w1) + len(items_w2))` time.\n    Let `f[w]` be the maximum value for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n    Initialize `f[0] = 0`, all other `f[w] = -infinity`.\n    Iterate through items of weight 1:\n        `for w from m down to 1:`\n            `f[w] = max(f[w], f[w-1] + cost_of_next_w1_item)`\n    Iterate through items of weight 2:\n        `for w from m down to 2:`\n            `f[w] = max(f[w], f[w-2] + cost_of_next_w2_item)`\n    This is `O(N*M)` if `N` is number of items.\n\n    Since we have *multiple* items of the same weight, we can use a slightly different DP.\n    `dp12[w]` = maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n    Initialize `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\n    For each item `c` in `items_w1` (sorted descending):\n        For `w` from `m` down to `1`:\n            `dp12[w] = max(dp12[w], dp12[w-1] + c)`\n    For each item `c` in `items_w2` (sorted descending):\n        For `w` from `m` down to `2`:\n            `dp12[w] = max(dp12[w], dp12[w-2] + c)`\n    This is `O(N * M)`.\n\n    The key insight for small weights is that we can combine the `dp12` table with iterating over `k3`.\n    The `dp12` table can be computed using a slightly different approach:\n    `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `current_w1_cost = 0`\n    `w1_idx = 0`\n    `for w in range(m + 1):`\n        `if w1_idx < len(items_w1):`\n            `current_w1_cost += items_w1[w1_idx]`\n            `w1_idx += 1`\n        `dp12[w] = current_w1_cost` (This is the max cost if we only use weight-1 items up to capacity `w`)\n\n    Now, we iterate through the `items_w2` and update `dp12`.\n    For each `c2` in `items_w2`:\n        `for w from m down to 2:`\n            `dp12[w] = max(dp12[w], dp12[w-2] + c2)`\n    This still takes `O(len(items_w2) * m)` time.\n\n    **The correct approach for `dp12`:**\n    The `dp12[w]` table should represent the maximum value for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n    We can iterate through possible counts of weight-2 items, `k2`, from `0` to `len(items_w2)`. For each `k2`, we calculate the cost from `k2` items of weight 2 (`P2[k2]`) and the weight used (`2*k2`). The remaining weight `w - 2*k2` is filled greedily with weight-1 items (`P1[min(len(items_w1), w - 2*k2)]`).\n    This is the `O(m * len(items_w2))` approach.\n\n    **The actual optimal approach for `dp12` (or any two types):**\n    For items of weight 1 and 2, the values `dp12[w]` can be computed in `O(m)` total time.\n    `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `current_w1_cost = 0`\n    `w1_ptr = 0`\n    `for w in range(m + 1):`\n        `if w1_ptr < len(items_w1):`\n            `current_w1_cost += items_w1[w1_ptr]`\n            `w1_ptr += 1`\n        `dp12[w] = current_w1_cost`\n    This `dp12` array is wrong. It only considers weight 1 items.\n\n    The actual `dp12` computation is as follows:\n    `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `for k2 in range(len(P2)):`\n        `weight_from_w2 = 2 * k2`\n        `cost_from_w2 = P2[k2]`\n        `if weight_from_w2 > m: break`\n        `for w_rem in range(m - weight_from_w2 + 1):`\n            `cost_from_w1 = P1[min(len(P1) - 1, w_rem)]`\n            `dp12[weight_from_w2 + w_rem] = max(dp12[weight_from_w2 + w_rem], cost_from_w2 + cost_from_w1)`\n    This is `O(m * len(items_w2))`, still too slow.\n\n    Let's re-think the `dp12` table.\n    We have `k1` items of weight 1 and `k2` items of weight 2.\n    The maximum `k2` is `min(len(items_w2), m/2)`. This can be up to `1.5 * 10^5`.\n    For each `k2`, we use `2*k2` weight and `P2[k2]` cost.\n    The remaining capacity is `m - 2*k2`. We fill it with `P1[min(len(items_w1), m - 2*k2)]` cost.\n    The overall maximum cost is `max_{k2} (P2[k2] + P1[min(len(items_w1), m - 2*k2)])`.\n    This calculation is `O(m)` and gives us the maximum cost using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n    Let's call this `max_cost_w1_w2[capacity]`.\n    `max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `for w in range(m + 1):`\n        `max_val_for_w = 0`\n        `for k2 in range(len(P2)):`\n            `weight_used = 2 * k2`\n            `if weight_used > w: break`\n            `cost_k2 = P2[k2]`\n            `remaining_w = w - weight_used`\n            `cost_k1 = P1[min(len(P1) - 1, remaining_w)]`\n            `max_val_for_w = max(max_val_for_w, cost_k2 + cost_k1)`\n        `max_cost_w1_w2[w] = max_val_for_w`\n\n    This `max_cost_w1_w2` array can be computed in `O(m * N_w2)` where `N_w2` is `len(items_w2)`. Still `O(m*N)`.\n\n    **The actual breakthrough comes from observing the small number of distinct weights and the relative sizes of `m` and `n`.**\n    We can iterate over the number of items of weight 3 (`k3`).\n    For each `k3` from `0` to `min(len(items_w3), m // 3)`:\n        `current_cost = P3[k3]`\n        `remaining_m = m - 3 * k3`\n        Now we need to fill `remaining_m` with items of weight 1 and 2.\n        This subproblem is equivalent to finding `max_{k1, k2} (P1[k1] + P2[k2])` such that `k1 + 2*k2 <= remaining_m`.\n        This subproblem can be solved in `O(remaining_m)` time.\n        So, the total time would be `sum_{k3=0}^{m/3} O(m - 3*k3) = O(m^2)`. This is still too slow.\n\n    **The final optimized approach:**\n    The crucial observation is that `m` is large, but `wi` is very small.\n    The total number of items is `N`.\n    The maximum weight `m` is `3 * 10^5`.\n    Consider the number of weight-3 items, `k3`. This can go up to `m/3` (approx `10^5`).\n    Consider the number of weight-2 items, `k2`.
