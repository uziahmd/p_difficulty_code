    "thought": "**Deconstructing a Tricky Graph Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my immediate goal is to figure out the bare minimum and maximum for these \"p-reachable\" graphs. First things first, I need to understand what \"p-reachable\" even *means*. It's all about reachability – the ability to get from one node to another – but with a twist. It's not just about any path; it specifically wants to count ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is less than `v` and they're mutually reachable.  This mutual reachability screams \"strongly connected components\" (SCCs) to me, because within an SCC, everyone can reach everyone else.\n\nThe core of the problem then boils down to SCCs. If I have an SCC with `k` nodes, I'm essentially generating `k * (k - 1) / 2` of these directed, ordered pairs. The key here is the `u < v` constraint. This tells me I'm effectively counting the undirected connections *within* an SCC, but with a specific ordering.\n\nSo, the first challenge is finding the minimum number of nodes `n` needed to create a graph with *exactly* `p` reachable pairs. To keep `n` as small as possible, I need to be efficient with how I use the nodes.  Since each SCC contributes some pairs based on its size, and the `k*(k-1)/2` pairs increase quicker than the number of nodes `k` with increasing `k` means I should look for the largest SCCs possible.  I'm thinking I should start by iteratively subtracting the largest possible SCC pair counts from `p` and see how to get the minimized sum of SCC sizes which is the minimimum number of nodes.\n\nThe second part is to maximize the number of *unidirectional* pairs. This feels related to the structure of the graph overall, not just the individual SCCs. My initial thought is that the *unidirectional* pairs are the ones *between* SCCs.  To maximize this I must understand how the nodes and edges are added.  This part is more elusive, but first things first, minimizing `n`. Let me start playing with how to find `n`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all `p`-reachable graphs with `n` nodes.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u ≠ v`, there's a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n- A directed graph is **`p`-reachable** if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n\nThe condition \"reachable from each other\" means `u` and `v` must belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC). If an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are mutually reachable. The number of unordered pairs `{u, v}` (or ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v`) within an SCC of size `k` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`. This function gives the number of `p`-reachable pairs contributed by an SCC of size `k`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nWe need to find `n = sum(k_i)` such that `sum(f(k_i)) = p` and `n` is minimized.\nThe function `f(k)` is convex for `k >= 1`. This means that to achieve a sum `p` using `f(k_i)` values, it's always optimal to use as few SCCs as possible, and specifically, to use larger SCCs rather than breaking them into smaller ones. For example, `f(4) = 6` uses 4 nodes. `f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 1 = 4` uses 5 nodes. `f(2) + f(2) + f(2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` uses 6 nodes. This confirms that larger `k` values are more \"node-efficient\" for generating `p`-reachable pairs.\n\nSo, to minimize `n`, we should try to represent `p` as a sum of `f(k_i)` values by prioritizing larger `k_i`. This is a variation of the change-making problem. We can precompute `f(k)` for `k` up to a certain limit. Since `p <= 2 * 10^5`, `f(k)` can be at most `2 * 10^5`.\n`k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 2 * 10^5` implies `k^2 approx 4 * 10^5`, so `k approx sqrt(4 * 10^5) = 2 * 10^2 = 200 * sqrt(10) approx 632`.\nLet's precompute `f(k)` for `k` from `1` to `633` (since `f(633) = 633 * 632 / 2 = 200028`).\n\nWe can use a greedy approach:\nIterate `k` downwards from `633` (or the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`). For each `k`, take as many SCCs of size `k` as possible without exceeding `p`.\nSpecifically:\nInitialize `min_nodes = 0`.\nFor `k` from `633` down to `2`:\n  While `p >= f(k)`:\n    `p -= f(k)`\n    `min_nodes += k`\nIf `p` becomes `0`, we have found the minimum number of nodes.\n\nExample: `p = 3`\n- `k = 633` down to `4`: `f(k) > 3`.\n- `k = 3`: `f(3) = 3`. `p >= f(3)` is true.\n  - `p = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n  - `min_nodes = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n- `p` is now `0`, so we stop. Minimum nodes = `3`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n- `k = 633` down to `4`: `f(k) > 4`.\n- `k = 3`: `f(3) = 3`. `p >= f(3)` is true.\n  - `p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n  - `min_nodes = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n- `k = 2`: `f(2) = 1`. `p >= f(2)` is true.\n  - `p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n  - `min_nodes = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n- `p` is now `0`, so we stop. Minimum nodes = `5`.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because `f(k)` is convex and we are trying to minimize the sum of `k_i`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nLet `n_min` be the minimum number of nodes found in Part 1. We need to construct a graph with `n_min` nodes and the SCC structure determined by the greedy algorithm, such that it maximizes unidirectional pairs.\n\nUnidirectional pairs `(u, v)` exist if there is a path `u -> v` but no path `v -> u`. This happens when `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC in the condensation graph (graph of SCCs), but no path in the reverse direction.\n\nConsider the SCCs found: `C_1, C_2, ..., C_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `n_min = sum(k_i)`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange these SCCs in a chain: `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_m`.\nThis means we add edges from every node in `C_i` to every node in `C_{i+1}` (or just one edge from `C_i` to `C_{i+1}` and ensure connectivity within SCCs). A simpler way is to connect the \"last\" node of `C_i` to the \"first\" node of `C_{i+1}`.\nLet's label the nodes `1, ..., n_min`. We can assign nodes `1, ..., k_1` to `C_1`, `k_1+1, ..., k_1+k_2` to `C_2`, and so on.\nIf we add an edge from node `k_1` (in `C_1`) to node `k_1+1` (in `C_2`), and similarly from the last node of `C_i` to the first node of `C_{i+1}` for all `i`, then:\n- For any `u` in `C_i` and `v` in `C_j` with `i < j`, there is a path `u -> v`.\n- For any `u` in `C_i` and `v` in `C_j` with `i > j`, there is NO path `u -> v`.\n\nThe number of unidirectional pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is in `C_i` and `v` is in `C_j` (`i < j`) is `k_i * k_j`.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs in this chain structure is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`.\n\nThis sum can be computed efficiently:\n`(sum(k_i))^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nSo, `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j) = ((sum(k_i))^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nSince `sum(k_i) = n_min`, the number of unidirectional pairs is `(n_min^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\nThis construction maximizes unidirectional pairs because:\n1. All `p`-reachable pairs are preserved within their SCCs.\n2. All pairs `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are in different SCCs `C_i, C_j` are either unidirectional or not connected. The chain structure maximizes the connections in one direction without creating cycles between SCCs. If `u` is in `C_i` and `v` is in `C_j` with `i < j`, `u` can reach `v`. If `i > j`, `u` cannot reach `v`. This creates `k_i * k_j` unidirectional pairs for each such pair of SCCs.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the greedy algorithm for `min_nodes`. The list of `k_i` values is generated by taking `count` SCCs of size `k`, then `count'` SCCs of size `k'`, etc. We can store these `k_i` values in a list.\n\nAlgorithm for `n_min` and `max_unidirectional`:\n\n1.  **Precompute `f(k)` values:**\n    `f_values = [0] * 634`\n    `for k in range(1, 634):`\n    `    f_values[k] = k * (k - 1) // 2`\n\n2.  **Calculate `n_min` and collect `k_i` values:**\n    `p_remaining = p`\n    `min_nodes = 0`\n    `scc_sizes = []`\n    `for k in range(633, 1, -1):`\n    `    while p_remaining >= f_values[k]:`\n    `        p_remaining -= f_values[k]`\n    `        min_nodes += k`\n    `        scc_sizes.append(k)`\n    `if p_remaining > 0:`\n    `    # This should not happen if p is reachable, as f(2)=1 covers all remaining 1s.`\n    `    # But if p=0, scc_sizes will be empty and min_nodes=0.`\n\n3.  **Calculate `max_unidirectional`:**\n    `sum_k_squared = 0`\n    `for k_val in scc_sizes:`\n    `    sum_k_squared += k_val * k_val`\n    `max_unidirectional = (min_nodes * min_nodes - sum_k_squared) // 2`\n\n4.  **Handle edge case `p = 0`:**\n    If `p = 0`, `min_nodes` will be `0` (no SCCs of size >= 2 needed). `scc_sizes` will be empty.\n    `sum_k_squared` will be `0`.\n    `max_unidirectional = (0 * 0 - 0) // 2 = 0`.\n    This is correct. A graph with 0 nodes has 0 `p`-reachable pairs and 0 unidirectional pairs.\n    However, the problem implies `u < v`, so nodes must be labelled. If we have 0 nodes, `n=0`. If we have 1 node, `n=1`, `p=0`, `max_unidirectional=0`.\n    The greedy algorithm for `p=0` gives `min_nodes=0`. If we interpret \"minimum number of nodes required\" as `n >= 1` if a graph is needed, then for `p=0`, `n=1` is the smallest graph. A single node has no `p`-reachable pairs and no unidirectional pairs. So `n=1, max_unidirectional=0` for `p=0`.\n    Let's check the example: `p=0` -> `0 0`. This implies `n=0` is allowed. The current algorithm correctly produces `0 0`.\n\nLet's trace `p=3`:\n1. `f_values` up to `f(633)`.\n2. `p_remaining = 3`, `min_nodes = 0`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n   `k = 633` down to `4`: `p_remaining < f_values[k]`.\n   `k = 3`: `f_values[3] = 3`. `p_remaining = 3 >= 3`.\n     `p_remaining = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n     `min_nodes = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n     `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n   `p_remaining` is now `0`, loop terminates.\n   `min_nodes = 3`.\n3. `sum_k_squared = 3 * 3 = 9`.\n   `max_unidirectional = (3 * 3 - 9) // 2 = (9 - 9) // 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\nLet's trace `p=4`:\n1. `f_values` up to `f(633)`.\n2. `p_remaining = 4`, `min_nodes = 0`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n   `k = 633` down to `4`: `p_remaining < f_values[k]`.\n   `k = 3`: `f_values[3] = 3`. `p_remaining = 4 >= 3`.\n     `p_remaining = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n     `min_nodes = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n     `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n   `k = 2`: `f_values[2] = 1`. `p_remaining = 1 >= 1`.\n     `p_remaining = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n     `min_nodes = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n     `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`.\n   `p_remaining` is now `0`, loop terminates.\n   `min_nodes = 5`.\n3. `sum_k_squared = 3 * 3 + 2 * 2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n   `max_unidirectional = (5 * 5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`.
