For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Road to Counting Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan: I'm trying to figure out how many ways I can select values (let's call them *c*) to make a special kind of multiset – a \"beautiful\" one – reach a specific size, *f*.\n\nFirst, let's understand the \"beautiful\" part. It's all about prefixes: for every string *s* of length 1 up to *n*, the number of strings in my multiset that start with *s* can't be more than the *c* value associated with *s*.\n\nThe maximum size of this beautiful multiset is the target. Initially, it seemed like max-flow would be a good approach, but it turned out to be too complex.  I've decided to think about this in a structured, tree-like fashion.\n\nImagine a binary tree where each node represents a binary string. The constraints (*c* values) are on these nodes.  Each leaf of the tree represents a string of length *n*.  A multiset is represented by how many times each leaf appears – these are the *x* values.  My goal is to maximize the sum of these *x* values while respecting the constraints. This is now equivalent to maximizing the sum of all strings, which is given by finding the empty string (root) value of the total maximum sum in the multiset.\n\nThis looks like a dynamic programming (DP) problem in disguise.\n\nI'm starting to think about my DP states.  Let's have `dp[len][val]` represent the number of ways to assign *c* values to all strings from a certain length down to *n* (a subtree), such that the *maximum* number of strings having a specific prefix (of length `len-1`, from where the current subtree begins) is `val`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** When I hit the leaves (strings of length *n*), the *M* (maximum number of strings starting with the string) value is simply the *c* value of that leaf. So `dp[n][val]` is 1 for every `val` from 0 to `k` (the maximum allowed *c* value), since there's one way to choose *c* to achieve that *M* value.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For any string of length less than *n*, its *M* value is determined by the *c* value of itself, and the *M* values of its two children.  I want to calculate the number of ways I can do this such that this prefix value is fixed.\n\nNow, a string's *M* value is the minimum of its *c* value and the sum of its children's *M* values. The actual value is at most `k`\n\nTo count the ways, for a node at length `len`, consider its *M* value (`val`), and its child strings `s0` and `s1`. I loop over all possible *c* values (from 0 to `k`) and the *M* values for the child substrings, and check if these combinations yield my target *M* value for the parent node.\n\nThis step involves a clever trick: I don't calculate everything independently. The DP formulation is such that the `dp[len]` will calculate `val`, which depends on `s_sum`, where `s_sum = M(s0) + M(s1)`. This becomes a convolution, which means I can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) to speed things up.\n\nThe final answer is `dp[1][f]` where the prefix length is 1 and the target multiset size `f` is given.\n\nNow, let's execute the code for the NTT calculation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined. A multiset `M` of binary strings of length `n` is beautiful if for every string `s` of length `1` to `n`, the number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\n\nLet `M_val(s)` be the maximum possible number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nIf `s` is a binary string of length `n` (a leaf in the conceptual binary tree of strings), then `M_val(s)` is simply `c_s`, because `s` itself is a string of length `n`, and it has no further prefixes.\nIf `s` is a binary string of length `L < n` (an internal node), it has two children: `s0` and `s1`. Any string in `M` that has `s` as a prefix must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, the total count for `s` is the sum of counts for `s0` and `s1`. The constraint `c_s` applies to this sum. So, `M_val(s) = min(c_s, M_val(s0) + M_val(s1))`.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is the sum `M_val(0) + M_val(1)`, where `0` and `1` are the binary strings of length 1. This sum is the maximum number of strings in `M` that have `0` as a prefix plus the maximum number of strings that have `1` as a prefix.\n\nNotice that `M_val(s)` can never exceed `k`, because `c_s` is at most `k`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for convolutions.\nLet `dp[len][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_x` values for all strings `x` that are descendants of a specific string `s_0` of length `len` (including `s_0` itself), such that `M_val(s_0)` evaluates to `val`.\nThe maximum value `val` can take is `k`. So, `dp[len]` will be an array of size `k+1`.\n\n**Base Case:** `len = n`\nIf `len = n`, `s_0` is a leaf. `M_val(s_0) = c_{s_0}`. Since `c_{s_0}` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is exactly one way to choose `c_{s_0}` such that `M_val(s_0)` becomes `val`.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`.\n\n**Recursive Step:** `len < n`\nFor a string `s_0` of length `len`, `M_val(s_0) = min(c_{s_0}, M_val(s_00) + M_val(s_01))`.\nThe value `c_{s_0}` can be chosen from `0` to `k`.\nThe values `M_val(s_00)` and `M_val(s_01)` are determined by choices in their respective subtrees. Due to symmetry, the number of ways to obtain `M_val(s_00) = val_0` is `dp[len+1][val_0]`, and similarly for `M_val(s_01) = val_1` it is `dp[len+1][val_1]`. These choices are independent.\n\nTo compute `dp[len][val]`:\nWe iterate over all possible `val_0` (from `0` to `k`) and `val_1` (from `0` to `k`).\nLet `s_sum = val_0 + val_1`.\nLet `W[s_sum]` be the number of ways to choose `c_x` values for the subtrees of `s_00` and `s_01` such that `M_val(s_00) + M_val(s_01) = s_sum`.\n`W[s_sum] = sum_{val_0+val_1=s_sum} (dp[len+1][val_0] * dp[len+1][val_1])`.\nThis `W` array is the convolution of `dp[len+1]` with itself: `W = dp[len+1] * dp[len+1]`. It can be computed efficiently using NTT. The maximum `s_sum` is `2k`.\n\nNow, for a fixed `val` (the target `M_val(s_0)`), we need to sum over all possible `s_sum` and `c_{s_0}`:\n`dp[len][val] = sum_{s_sum=0..2k} W[s_sum] * (count of c_{s_0} such that min(c_{s_0}, s_sum) == val)`.\n\nLet's analyze `(count of c_{s_0} such that min(c_{s_0}, s_sum) == val)`:\n1. If `val < s_sum`: For `min(c_{s_0}, s_sum)` to be `val`, we must have `c_{s_0} = val`. There is only `1` such `c_{s_0}`. This is valid if `val <= k`.\n2. If `val = s_sum`: For `min(c_{s_0}, s_sum)` to be `s_sum`, we must have `c_{s_0} >= s_sum`. The possible values for `c_{s_0}` are `s_sum, s_sum+1, ..., k`. There are `k - s_sum + 1` such values. This is valid if `s_sum <= k`.\n3. If `val > s_sum`: This case is impossible, as `min(A, B)` cannot be greater than `B`.\n\nCombining these, for `0 <= val <= k`:\n`dp[len][val] = W[val] * (k - val + 1) + sum_{s_sum=val+1..2k} W[s_sum]`.\nLet `SuffW[x] = sum_{i=x..2k} W[i]`. This is a suffix sum array for `W`.\nThen, `dp[len][val] = (W[val] * (k - val + 1) + SuffW[val+1]) % MOD`.\nFor `val > k`, `dp[len][val] = 0`.\n\nWe compute `dp[n]`, then `dp[n-1]`, ..., down to `dp[1]`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe problem asks for the number of ways such that `M_val(0) + M_val(1) = f`.\nLet `val_0 = M_val(0)` and `val_1 = M_val(1)`.\nThe number of ways to get `M_val(0) = val_0` is `dp[1][val_0]`.\nThe number of ways to get `M_val(1) = val_1` is `dp[1][val_1]`.\nThe total answer is `sum_{val_0+val_1=f} (dp[1][val_0] * dp[1][val_1])`.\nThis is again the `f`-th coefficient of the convolution `dp[1] * dp[1]`. We compute `FinalW = dp[1] * dp[1]` using NTT and return `FinalW[f]`. If `f` is greater than `2k`, the result is `0`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- `n` iterations for `len` from `n-1` down to `1`.\n- In each iteration:\n    - NTT convolution: `O(K log K)` where `K` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `2k`.\n    - Suffix sums and `dp` calculation: `O(k)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n * k log k)`.\nGiven `n=15` and `k=2*10^5`, `log(2k)` is about 19. `15 * 2*10^5 * 19` is approximately `5.7 * 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(k)` for storing `dp` arrays and NTT intermediate results.\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\n- Modulo `MOD = 998244353` (a prime number).\n- Primitive root `G = 3`.\n- `power(a, b)` calculates `a^b % MOD`.\n- `inverse(n)` calculates modular multiplicative inverse `n^(MOD-2) % MOD`.\n- `ntt(a, invert)` performs NTT or inverse NTT.\n- `multiply(a, b)` performs polynomial multiplication using NTT.
