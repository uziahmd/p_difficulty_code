There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving with Tournament Rules**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this competitive programming problem, and it's all about maximizing the games played by the winner of a knockout tournament. The twist? Two players can only face each other if their number of games played differs by at most one.  I need to figure out the largest possible number of games a tournament winner can play, given this rule and a starting number of players.\n\nLet's call the number of games played by a player 'k'.  If player A has played 'k_A' games, and player B has played 'k_B' games, they can play *only if*  |k_A - k_B| <= 1.  The key is to maximize the winner's games.\n\nImagine the winner. If they win 'X' games, how does that work out? In their first game, they might face someone who has played zero games. That's fine (|0 - 0| = 0 <= 1).  The winner has one game.  Now, the rule restricts who they can play next. That's the core of the problem.\n\nIntuitively, to maximize the winner's games, I want the winner to advance as far as possible, meaning they should play against opponents who have played a similar number of games. That's the heart of the problem - creating a match structure, while respecting this game-play rule.\n\nLet's consider the number of players required for a winner to play 'k' games. I'll define this as 'f(k)'. I need to find the *minimum* number of players required for a winner to have played 'k' games.\n\nThe base cases are clear. To have a winner play one game, I need two players ('f(1) = 2').  To have a winner play two games, I could have three players. I need to get as much gameplay in each round as possible.\n\nThe tricky part is, how to minimize the total number of players for a given 'k'. Here I need a smart way to generate the game structure.  I need a structure like a tournament bracket but one that respects this new game-played differential rule. This leads to the insight: always pair the winner with an opponent who has played *almost* as many games as possible.\n\nThis leads me to the idea of a recurrence. I need a function that defines the minimum number of players needed to get a winner playing 'k' games: let's call it 'N(k)'.  'N(k)' should depend on the previous values.\n\nIf I want the winner to play 'k' games, the last game, the winner 'W' who has played 'k-1' games must play an opponent 'O' who has 'k_O' games played such that |(k-1) - k_O| <= 1. So 'k_O' can be k-2, k-1, or k, although the opponent cannot have played more games than the current winner.\n\nSo, for game 'k':\nWinner has 'k-1' wins. The rule gives the opponent (0 to 1 fewer games). I need to *minimize* the number of total players.\nThis means I must try all combinations and pick the smallest. To minimize total players 'N(k)': I take the winner of 'k-1' (who needs 'N(k-1)' players) and another winner who can reach k-2 wins (needing 'N(k-2)' players), with a pairing that also satisfies the rule.\n\nSo, I end up with the recurrence relation:  N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2).  That's a Fibonacci sequence! The smallest number of players to have a winner with k games is the Fibonacci number. I re-index it - that sequence starts with N(0)=1, N(1)=2.\n\nGiven n, which is the total players, I need to figure out what is the largest k for N(k) <= n.\n\nNow, it's just a matter of efficiently calculating Fibonacci numbers until I find the largest one that's less than or equal to the number of players, n.  It's just applying the Fibonacci series to find 'k' so the result is just the k-th game. The trick is to have the correct initial values and the condition for when to stop. Once I have `k`, I just output `k-1` since `N(0)` doesn't count.\n\nAnd that's the solution. Now, I need to code it up.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games the winner plays. We want to maximize `k`.\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. To maximize `k` for a given `n`, we should use the tournament structure that requires the fewest players for each `k`.\n\nLet's analyze the rule `|games_A - games_B| <= 1`.\n\nBase cases:\n- To have a player who has played 0 games (i.e., a participant who hasn't played yet), we need 1 player. So, `F(0) = 1`.\n- To have a winner who has played 1 game: This winner (W) must play their first game. W has played 0 games. Their opponent (O) must also have played 0 games. `|0 - 0| = 0 <= 1`, which is valid. W wins.\n  This requires W and O, so 2 players. Thus, `F(1) = 2`.\n\nNow, consider the winner (W) playing their `k`-th game. Before this game, W has already played and won `k-1` games.\nW's opponent (O) must have played `j` games, such that `| (k-1) - j | <= 1`.\nPossible values for `j`:\n1. `j = k-1`: W (k-1 games) plays O (k-1 games). `| (k-1) - (k-1) | = 0 <= 1`. This is valid.\n   In this case, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)`.\n2. `j = k-2`: W (k-1 games) plays O (k-2 games). `| (k-1) - (k-2) | = 1 <= 1`. This is valid.\n   In this case, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n3. `j = k`: This is not possible. If O had played `k` games, O would have won `k` games, meaning O is further along than W (who has only won `k-1` games).\n\nTo minimize `F(k)` (the total number of players), we should choose the option that requires fewer players. Since `F(x)` is an increasing function (more games generally require more players), `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` will always be less than or equal to `2 * F(k-1)` (because `F(k-2) <= F(k-1)` for `k >= 2`).\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for the minimum number of players is `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the sequence `F(k)`:\n- `F(0) = 1`\n- `F(1) = 2`\n- `F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n- `F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n- `F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\nThis sequence is a shifted Fibonacci sequence. If we define the standard Fibonacci sequence `fib_std(0)=0, fib_std(1)=1, fib_std(2)=1, fib_std(3)=2, fib_std(4)=3, fib_std(5)=5, fib_std(6)=8, fib_std(7)=13, ...`, then `F(k) = fib_std(k+2)`.\n\nWe are given `n` players and need to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until `F(k)` exceeds `n`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will be relatively small (around 90 for `10^18`). We can compute this iteratively.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F(0)`), `b = 2` (representing `F(1)`).\n2. Initialize `k = 1` (representing the number of games for `b` players).\n3. The problem states `n >= 2`. If `n=2`, the winner plays 1 game. Our initial `k=1` handles this.\n4. Iterate while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence: `next_fib = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a` to `b` (the previous `F(k)`).\n   c. Update `b` to `next_fib` (the new `F(k+1)`).\n   d. Increment `k` by 1.\n5. When the loop terminates, `b` is the first `F(k)` value that is greater than `n`. This means the maximum number of games the winner could play was for the previous `k` value. So, the answer is `k-1`.\n\nLet's trace with `n=10`:\n- Initial: `a=1`, `b=2`, `k=1`.\n- `b=2 <= 10`:\n  `next_fib = 1+2 = 3`. `a=2`, `b=3`, `k=2`. (`F(2)=3` players for 2 games)\n- `b=3 <= 10`:\n  `next_fib = 2+3 = 5`. `a=3`, `b=5`, `k=3`. (`F(3)=5` players for 3 games)\n- `b=5 <= 10`:\n  `next_fib = 3+5 = 8`. `a=5`, `b=8`, `k=4`. (`F(4)=8` players for 4 games)\n- `b=8 <= 10`:\n  `next_fib = 5+8 = 13`. `a=8`, `b=13`, `k=5`. (`F(5)=13` players for 5 games)\n- `b=13 > 10`. Loop terminates.\n- Result: `k-1 = 5-1 = 4`. This matches the example output for `n=10`.\n\nThe Python `int` type handles arbitrary-precision integers, so there's no risk of overflow for `n` up to `10^18`. The number of iterations will be small, making the solution very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # F(k) represents the minimum number of players required for the winner\n    # to play k games.\n    # F(0) = 1 (a player who hasn't played yet)\n    # F(1) = 2 (winner plays 1 game against an opponent who also played 0 games)\n    # For k >= 2, F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2).\n    # This recurrence minimizes players because the winner (who played k-1 games)\n    # plays against an opponent who played k-2 games.\n    # The rule |(k-1) - (k-2)| = 1 is satisfied.\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n    # Initialize a and b to F(0) and F(1) respectively.\n    # 'games_count' tracks the number of games for the winner associated with 'b'.\n    a = 1  # Represents F(0)\n    b = 2  # Represents F(1)\n    games_count = 1 # Winner plays 1 game if there are F(1)=2 players\n\n    # The problem states n >= 2.\n    # If n=2, the loop condition 'b <= n' (2 <= 2) is true.\n    # Inside the loop: next_fib = 1+2 = 3. a=2, b=3, games_count=2.\n    # Then 'b <= n' (3 <= 2) is false.
