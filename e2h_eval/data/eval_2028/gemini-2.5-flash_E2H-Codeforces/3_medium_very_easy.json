Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution Plan for Vanya and Lanterns**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The Vanya and Lanterns problem seems straightforward enough. It's all about finding the minimal radius, `d`, to light up a street of length `l` given the positions of `n` lanterns.\n\n**Core Idea:** The trick is realizing that sorting the lantern positions is key. Once they're sorted, I can look at the gaps between the lanterns, the gap at the start of the street (from 0 to the first lantern), and the gap at the end (from the last lantern to the end of the street, `l`). I need to make sure that each of these segments is lit.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Input:** I'll read in `n`, `l`, and the positions `a_i` for each lantern.\n\n2.  **Sort:** Sort the lantern positions `a`.\n\n3.  **Identify Gaps:**\n    *   **Start Gap:** The start of the street, position 0, has to be covered by the first lantern's light, which is located at `a[0]`. Thus, d needs to be at least `a[0]`.\n    *   **End Gap:** The end of the street, position `l`, needs to be covered by the last lantern. If the last lantern is at `a[n-1]`, then `d` has to be at least `l - a[n-1]`.\n    *   **Intermediate Gaps:** For any two adjacent lanterns, I need to make sure the light from both lanterns covers the segment between them. So, the distance between them, divided by two, gives the `d` needed to cover that specific gap. I’ll keep track of the largest `d` value needed for any intermediate gap.\n\n4.  **Combine the Requirements:** The minimum `d` I need is the *maximum* value I've found in all these gap calculations. This ensures that every segment of the street is lit.\n\n5.  **Calculate & Output:** I calculate `max(a[0], l - a[n-1], max_of_all_intermediate_gaps)` to obtain the minimal radius. The output has to be in high-precision, so using the proper format with `f-string` is necessary.\n\n**Potential Edge Cases:** I'll have to consider some edge cases. If `n = 1`, there's only one lantern. In this case `d` has to be the largest between `a[0]` and `l-a[0]`. Also, when lanterns are at the endpoints (0 and `l`) or bunched up at the same point, my calculations should handle it correctly by returning the appropriate minimum `d`.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n*   I'm confident that a Python script should work perfectly.\n*   I can use the Python built-in `sort()` function to sort the lantern positions.\n*   I'll initialize `max_d_needed` to 0.0 to track the required `d`.\n*   I can iterate through the sorted lantern array to calculate the gap between adjacent lanterns, taking their half.\n*   The final step is to print `max_d_needed`, properly formatted to meet the required high precision.\n*   I can perform some final checks on these examples to make sure the logic is right, then submit the code.\n",
