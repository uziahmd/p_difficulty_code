His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "**The Quest for Minimal LCM**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem where I need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. The input is two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and the challenge is to find that elusive `k`. If there are ties, I should choose the smaller `k`.\n\nMy first instinct is to let `x = a + k` and `y = b + k` and find an LCM of `x` and `y`. And of course I know that `LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)`. So it's the greatest common divisor that's really key here.\n\nLet's call `g` as the greatest common divisor `GCD(a+k, b+k)`. Knowing this, I see that this `g` divides `a+k` and also `b+k`, therefore it should divide the difference.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume `a <= b`. So the difference is `b-a`, and let's call it `d`. It's clear that `g` has to divide `d`, or `GCD(a+k,b+k)` is a divisor of `b-a`.\n\nSo for each divisor `g` of `d`, I want to figure out a `k` to satisfy `GCD(a+k, b+k) = g`. Now I need to see what `k` needs to be to make sure the greatest common divisor is at least `g`. This means that `a+k` must be a multiple of `g`, so the smallest non-negative `k` will be the remainder, which leads to `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n\nNow I can iterate through all divisors of `d` and calculate `k` this way. Then, for each `g` with its corresponding `k`, I can calculate the LCM using the formula. And of course, if I get a new smallest LCM, I keep track of that `k`. If I encounter the same smallest `lcm`, I'll make sure to pick the smallest `k`.\n\nThe key is that for a specific `g`, I'm figuring out the smallest `k` where `a+k` is a multiple of that `g`. My algorithm checks every possible greatest common divisor and its corresponding `k`.\n\nAlso, I have to handle the case where `a=b`. If that's true, the answer is just `0`.\n\nEssentially, I am trying to minimize the LCM by finding the right common divisor which would make `a+k` and `b+k` share that common divisor. It's a systematic search for the sweet spot of this `k` with respect to all the divisors of `d`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of the greatest common divisor is `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`.\nApplying this, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nLet `d = |b-a|`. So, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, d)`.\nThis implies that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `d`.\n\nTherefore, we can iterate through all possible values for `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Each such `g` must be a divisor of `d`.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1. Handle the special case `a = b`. If `a = b`, then `d = 0`. `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k` for `k >= 0`, we choose `k=0`. So, if `a=b`, the answer is `0`.\n2. Without loss of generality, assume `a < b`. If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b`. This simplifies calculations as `d = b-a` will be positive.\n3. Calculate `d = b-a`.\n4. Find all divisors of `d`. Let these be `g_1, g_2, ..., g_m`.\n5. Initialize `min_lcm` to a very large value (e.g., `float('inf')`) and `min_k` to `0`.\n6. For each divisor `g` of `d`:\n   a. We need to find `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this condition is `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n      * If `a % g == 0`, then `k = 0`.\n      * Otherwise, `k = g - (a % g)`.\n   b. Calculate `val_a = a+k` and `val_b = b+k`.\n   c. Calculate the current LCM: `current_lcm = (val_a * val_b) // math.gcd(val_a, val_b)`.\n   d. Compare `current_lcm` with `min_lcm`:\n      * If `current_lcm < min_lcm`: Update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `min_k = k`.\n      * If `current_lcm == min_lcm`: Update `min_k = min(min_k, k)` to satisfy the requirement of choosing the smallest `k` in case of ties.\n7. After checking all divisors, `min_k` will hold the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes `lcm(a+k, b+k)`. Print `min_k`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (a=6, b=10):**\n1. `a=6, b=10`. Not equal.\n2. `a=6, b=10` (already `a < b`).\n3. `d = b-a = 10-6 = 4`.\n4. Divisors of `d=4` are `1, 2, 4`.\n5. `min_lcm = inf`, `min_k = 0`.\n\nLoop through divisors:\n- **`g = 1`**:\n  - `k = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = (1 - 0) % 1 = 0`.\n  - `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n  - `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // gcd(6, 10) = 60 // 2 = 30`.\n  - `min_lcm = 30`, `min_k = 0`.\n\n- **`g = 2`**:\n  - `k = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = (2 - 0) % 2 = 0`.\n  - `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n  - `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // gcd(6, 10) = 60 // 2 = 30`.\n  - `current_lcm == min_lcm`. `min_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n- **`g = 4`**:\n  - `k = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2`.\n  - `val_a = 6+2 = 8`, `val_b = 10+2 = 12`.\n  - `current_lcm = (8 * 12) // gcd(8, 12) = 96 // 4 = 24`.\n  - `current_lcm < min_lcm`. `min_lcm = 24`, `min_k = 2`.\n\n6. All divisors processed.\n7. Print `min_k = 2`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n- `a, b <= 10^9`. `d = |b-a|` can be up to `10^9`.\n- Finding divisors: `get_divisors(d)` takes `O(sqrt(d))` time. For `d=10^9`, `sqrt(d) approx 31622`.\n- Number of divisors: A number up to `10^9` has at most `1344` divisors (for `735134400`).\n- For each divisor:\n    - Arithmetic operations are constant time.\n    - `math.gcd(val_a, val_b)` takes `O(log(max(val_a, val_b)))` time. `max(val_a, val_b)` can be up to `2*10^9`, so `log` is about `31`.\n- Total time complexity: `O(sqrt(d) + num_divisors(d) * log(max(a,b)))`. This is roughly `31622 + 1344 * 31`, which is well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems.\n- Python's arbitrary precision integers handle large LCM values (`val_a * val_b` can be `4 * 10^18`).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all divisors of a positive integer n.\n    Returns a list of divisors.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    # Iterate up to sqrt(n)\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return list(divs)\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Handle the special case where a and b are equal\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b for consistent d = b-a\n    # This simplifies calculations and ensures d is non-negative\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    d = b - a\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    min_k = 0  # Initialize min_k to 0, as k=0 is always a candidate\n\n    # Get all divisors of d\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    # Iterate through each divisor 'g' of d\n    for g in divisors:\n        # Calculate the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) is a multiple of g.\n        # This is equivalent to (a+k) % g == 0.\n        # If a % g == 0, then k = 0.\n        # Otherwise, k = g - (a % g).\n        k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        \n        val_a = a + k\n        val_b = b + k\n        \n        # Calculate LCM using the formula: lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (val_a * val_b) // math.gcd(val_a, val_b)\n        \n        # Update min_lcm and min_k based on the current LCM\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            min_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            # If LCMs are equal, choose the smallest k\n            min_k = min(min_k, k)\n\n    print(min_k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
