They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Mushroom Strife: A Python Script Odyssey**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem, and my mind is racing. It's all about assigning mushroom values (`x_i`) to lawns connected by roads, with constraints on the GCD and LCM of mushrooms on those connected lawns.  My initial reaction is, \"This screams graph problem!\"  We've got vertices (lawns), edges (roads), and these GCD/LCM constraints acting as the relationship glue.\n\nThe first thing I'm doing is a deep dive into the problem's core: the relationship between GCD and LCM. I immediately recall that `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`, which is key.  It means the product of the mushroom values on a connected road must equal the product of the given GCD and LCM for that road.  Also, the GCD has to *divide* both `x_u` and `x_v`, and they both must *divide* the LCM. That feels like a solid foundation.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Let's break this down.\"  If I fix one `x_u`, can I determine its neighbor's (`x_v`) mushroom value?  Sure, if I know the GCD and LCM. The equation is straightforward. But the catch is: that initial `x_u` value isn't magically given, and it depends on all its connected roads and their GCD/LCM values.\n\nMy mind then wanders towards prime factorization. We can use the prime factorization of GCD and LCM to represent these relations and use this representation to establish the constraints for each prime.  I'm focusing on the exponents of each prime and their minimum and maximum for `g` and `l`. This representation will make things easier to build.\n\nHere, I'm getting a little clever.  I'm realizing that the exponent of each prime in the mushroom values must either be the exponent in the GCD or the exponent in the LCM, for each edge. I am now thinking \"2-coloring problem\" or maybe \"bipartite matching\"? Each prime's power can be seen as either a \"red\" or \"blue\" value for a node in a component, connected using that prime factor.\n\nHowever, the \"2-coloring\" gets a little tricky when `g_p` is equal to `l_p`. I realize this constraint is an \"equality\" constraint. But it's simple enough to process it separately. I'm going to set these cases during an initial pass through the graph.\n\nI've got a roadmap now:\n\n1.  **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** This is essential to generate the smallest prime factor for each number. This will allow for efficient prime factorization.\n2.  **Initial Check and Setup:** I'm storing the edges, initialize mushroom values to 1, and set up exponent tracking (`v_p_val`). I'm also going to check for the impossible cases where `l % g != 0`.\n3.  **Process `g_p == l_p` Cases:** If any GCD equals LCM (prime power-wise), there's a strict equality. Process that first to set values.\n4.  **2-Coloring/Graph Traversal:** Process the remaining edges for each prime. BFS/DFS to propagate and assign exponents for each prime while maintaining the condition that exponents of the connected nodes must match up with the exponents from their connected GCD and LCM values.\n5.  **Final Construction and Verification:** Compute the `x_i` values and verify using `GCD` and `LCM` functions.\n\nMy intuition is this is solvable. I'm going to start coding! I think the key is this fine-grained, prime-by-prime approach. I just need to get the implementation right, but I'm confident I've got a solid strategy to crack this Mushroom Strife.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to assign a positive integer `x_i` to each lawn `i` (from 1 to `n`) such that for every given road between lawns `u` and `v`, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x_u` and `x_v` is `g`, and their least common multiple (LCM) is `l`. We are guaranteed that `1 <= x_i, g, l <= 10^6`.\n\n**Key Properties of GCD and LCM:**\n1.  For any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.\n2.  For any prime `p`, let `v_p(k)` be the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `k`. Then:\n    *   `v_p(GCD(a, b)) = min(v_p(a), v_p(b))`\n    *   `v_p(LCM(a, b)) = max(v_p(a), v_p(b))`\n\nFrom these properties, for an edge `(u, v)` with given `g` and `l`:\n*   `x_u * x_v = g * l`.\n*   For any prime `p`, `min(v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v)) = v_p(g)` and `max(v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v)) = v_p(l)`.\n    This implies that for each prime `p`, the set `{v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v)}` must be equal to the set `{v_p(g), v_p(l)}`.\n    A necessary condition for this is `v_p(g) <= v_p(l)` for all `p`, which means `g` must divide `l`. If `l % g != 0` for any edge, no solution exists.\n\n**Problem Decomposition by Prime Factors:**\nThe problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems for each prime `p`. For a fixed prime `p`, we need to assign an exponent `e_i(p) = v_p(x_i)` to each lawn `i`.\nFor each edge `(u, v)` with `g, l`:\nLet `g_p = v_p(g)` and `l_p = v_p(l)`.\nWe must have `{e_u(p), e_v(p)} = \\{g_p, l_p\\}$.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Precompute Smallest Prime Factors (SPF):** Use a sieve to find the smallest prime factor for all numbers up to `10^6`. This allows efficient prime factorization of `g` and `l` values.\n    `spf[k]` stores the smallest prime factor of `k`.\n    `get_prime_factors(k)` function returns a dictionary mapping prime `p` to its exponent `v_p(k)`.\n\n2.  **Initialize Data Structures:**\n    *   `adj[u]`: Adjacency list storing `(v, g, l)` for edges.\n    *   `v_p_val[i][p]`: A dictionary (or map) for each lawn `i`, storing `p -> v_p(x_i)`. Initialize all to -1 (undetermined).\n    *   `is_fixed[i][p]`: A dictionary (or map) for each lawn `i`, storing `p -> boolean`. `True` if `v_p(x_i)` is definitively determined and cannot change. Initialize all to `False`.\n    *   `all_primes`: A set to collect all unique prime factors encountered across all `g, l` values.\n\n3.  **First Pass: Handle `g % l != 0` and `g_p == l_p` constraints:**\n    For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n    *   If `l % g != 0`, print \"NO\" and exit.\n    *   Get prime factorizations `factors_g` and `factors_l` for `g` and `l`.\n    *   For each prime `p` that divides `g` or `l`:\n        *   `g_p = factors_g.get(p, 0)`\n        *   `l_p = factors_l.get(p, 0)`\n        *   If `g_p == l_p`: This means `e_u(p)` and `e_v(p)` must both be `g_p`.\n            *   Check for conflicts: If `v_p_val[u][p]` is already set and not equal to `g_p`, or `v_p_val[v][p]` is set and not equal to `g_p`, print \"NO\" and exit.\n            *   Set `v_p_val[u][p] = g_p`, `v_p_val[v][p] = g_p`.\n            *   Set `is_fixed[u][p] = True`, `is_fixed[v][p] = True`.\n        *   Add `p` to `all_primes`.\n\n4.  **Second Pass: Propagate `g_p < l_p` constraints using BFS:**\n    For each prime `p` in `all_primes`:\n        For each lawn `i` from `1` to `n`:\n            If `is_fixed[i][p]` is `True`, or `v_p_val[i][p]` is already determined (not -1), continue.\n            Otherwise, `i` is an unvisited node for this prime `p` in a component where exponents are not yet fixed. Start a BFS:\n                *   Initialize a queue `q`.\n                *   Determine an initial value for `v_p_val[i][p]`:\n                    *   Find any incident edge `(i, j, g_edge, l_edge)` where `v_p(g_edge) < v_p(l_edge)`. Assign `v_p_val[i][p] = v_p(g_edge)` (the smaller exponent).\n                    *   If no such edge exists, it means `i` is isolated or only connected by `g_p == l_p` edges (which were handled in step 3), or connected by edges where `p` is not a factor. In such cases, `v_p(x_i)` can be 0. Assign `v_p_val[i][p] = 0`.\n                *   Add `i` to `q`.\n                *   While `q` is not empty:\n                    *   `curr_u = q.popleft()`, `curr_exp = v_p_val[curr_u][p]`.\n                    *   For each neighbor `(v_neighbor, g_edge, l_edge)` of `curr_u`:\n                        *   `gp_edge = get_prime_factors(g_edge).get(p, 0)`\n                        *   `lp_edge = get_prime_factors(l_edge).get(p, 0)`\n                        *   If `gp_edge == lp_edge`: (This case should ideally be fully handled in step 3, but we re-verify for robustness)\n                            *   If `curr_exp != gp_edge`, print \"NO\" and exit.\n                            *   If `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] != -1` and `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] != gp_edge`, print \"NO\" and exit.\n                            *   If `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] == -1` and not `is_fixed[v_neighbor][p]`:\n                                *   `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] = gp_edge`\n                                *   `q.append(v_neighbor)`\n                        *   Else (`gp_edge < lp_edge`):\n                            *   Determine `expected_v_exp`: If `curr_exp == gp_edge`, then `expected_v_exp = lp_edge`.

Otherwise, `curr_exp` is inconsistent with this edge's requirement, print \"NO\" and exit.\n                            *   If `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] != -1`:\n                                *   If `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] != expected_v_exp`, print \"NO\" and exit.\n                            *   Else (not visited and not fixed):\n                                *   `v_p_val[v_neighbor][p] = expected_v_exp`\n                                *   `q.append(v_neighbor)`\n\n5.  **Construct Final `x_i` values and Final Verification:**\n    *   Initialize `ans[i] = 1` for all `i`.\n    *   For each lawn `i` from `1` to `n`:\n        *   For each prime `p` in `all_primes`:\n            *   If `v_p_val[i][p]` is still -1 (meaning `p` was not a factor of any `g, l` for this component, or `i` was isolated): set `v_p_val[i][p] = 0`.\n            *   Multiply `ans[i]` by `p ** v_p_val[i][p]`.\n            *   If `ans[i]` exceeds `10^6` at any point, print \"NO\" and exit.\n    *   After computing all `ans[i]`:\n        *   For each original edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n            *   Verify `GCD(ans[u], ans[v]) == g` and `LCM(ans[u], ans[v]) == l`. If not, print \"NO\" and exit. (Note: `LCM(a,b) = (a*b) / GCD(a,b)`. So we only need to check `GCD` and `a*b == g*l`).\n\n6.  **Output:** If all checks pass, print \"YES\" and then the `ans` array.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Conceptual):**\nEdge (1, 2, g=1, l=3)\nPrimes involved: 3.\nv_3(g)=0, v_3(l)=1.\nSo {e_1(3), e_2(3)} must be {0, 1}.\nWe start BFS from 1.

This is consistent with e_2(2)=0, e_3(2)=1.\nFor prime 5: e_1(5)=0, e_3(5)=1 (arbitrary initial choice).\nFinal x_i values:\nx_1 = 3^0 * 2^0 * 5^0 = 1\nx_2 = 3^1 * 2^0 * 5^0 = 3\nx_3 = 3^0 * 2^1 * 5^1 = 10\nResult: 1, 3, 10.
