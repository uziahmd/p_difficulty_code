Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Golorp Feeding Frenzy - Parsing Puzzles and Lexicographic Leastness**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and it's got me thinking. The goal is clear: whip up a Python script to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that satisfies a Golorp's dietary needs. Easy, right? Wrong. This thing's a parsing puzzle disguised as a math problem.\n\n**Initial Impressions - The Jaws and the Stomach**\n\nThe Golorp is described with a name string which comprises two parts: the \"jaws\" (an expression using `_`s, operators, and parentheses) and the \"stomach\" (conditions involving the results). The variables can take values from 0 to 9, and the output is the lexicographically smallest sequence that feeds the creature or \"false\" if it cannot be fed. The 'jaws' shape is the number of input variables and the conditions are applied to the result of an expression evaluated with those variables.\n\n**Initial Challenges - The _ Conundrum**\n\nHere's where the head-scratching begins. I initially thought that the number of `_` characters in the 'jaws' directly equated to the number of input variables we'd need. I realized I was wrong because the examples showed a disconnect in the number of `_`s and number of digits in the lexicographical output string. Also, the fact that we can have `__`, `___` in both jaws and stomach seemed to confuse the meaning of these underscores.\n\n**Re-evaluating the `_` Interpretation - Beyond Simple Counting**\n\nBased on the samples and the problem statement, I had to completely re-think what those underscores mean. The problem statement says the 'shape' of the jaws defines how many variables are needed, which is the key. The samples seem to strongly suggest there's some implicit *numbering system*, *concatenation*, or special meaning assigned to multiple consecutive underscores. This is where I start thinking of a string-based or arithmetic interpretation.\n\n**A Befunge Hint - Leading to a Critical Insight**\n\nWhen I read the question statement, it mentions a Befunge-like structure, so I started suspecting that a sequence of underscores may mean more than the variable. Befunge often uses string manipulation and number representation, which lead me to think about `_`, `__`, and `___` in terms of digit concatenation. However, this lead to some problems that I resolved.\n\n**The Crucial Insight - Placeholders, Not Variables**\n\nI'm now focusing on a critical concept: maybe the `_` characters in the jaws expression are *placeholders*, each representing a digit from a sequence. Sequences of underscores could mean two-digit and three-digit numbers, which fits the pattern of the sample outputs. This understanding changed the game. Instead of simply counting variables, I have to *re-interpret* the jaws expression based on digit sequence interpretation.\n\n**The Parsing Algorithm - Digit Extraction and Expression Evaluation**\n\nMy new plan is to write a script that does the following:\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp Name:** Extract the jaws expression and the conditions.\n2.  **Number of Input Variables:** The number of input variables is now given by the length of output numbers (i.e. if the output is `0010`, we expect 4 variables).\n3.  **Evaluate Expression:**\n    *   Iterate through the `jaws_expr_str` expression.\n    *   For each underscore in the string, replace it with `x[i]`, or create a special format. Example: if we encounter `___` we translate it into an expression ( `100 * x[i] + 10 * x[i+1] + x[i+2]`). If we encounter `__`, we translate it to an expression of the same type.\n4.  **Digit Sequence Generation and Verification:** Use a brute-force approach to find the lexicographically smallest satisfying digit sequence. Generate all digit sequences with the correct number of input digits and test them:\n    *   Convert digits into actual numbers for calculation.\n    *   Check for invalid calculations and invalid numbers.\n    *   Evaluate the `jaws_eval_str`.\n    *   Make sure conditions are true.\n\nThis revised interpretation feels right, finally. Now it's just a matter of coding this parser up and testing it rigorously. Hopefully, this approach will crack the Golorp's dietary code and help me find that lexicographically smallest sequence.\n",
    "response": "The core challenge of this problem lies in correctly interpreting the \"jaws\" expression and the \"stomach\" conditions, specifically how sequences of `_` characters are handled. The example outputs provide crucial clues: the number of digits in the output sequence does not match the total count of `_` characters in the jaws expression.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the golorp's name and the examples to deduce the rules:\n\n1.  **Overall Structure:** `?(<jaws_expression>):-<conditions>.`\n2.  **Variables (Digits):** Input variables are single digits from 0 to 9. The output is the lexicographically smallest sequence of these digits.\n3.  **Jaws Expression Interpretation:**\n    *   The `_` character represents a **single, distinct variable** from the input sequence.\n    *   Crucially, `__` (two underscores) represents the **square** of the *next available variable*.\n    *   Similarly, `___` (three underscores) represents the **cube** of the *next available variable*.\n    *   In general, `k` underscores (`_` repeated `k` times) represents the `k`-th power of the *next available variable*.\n    *   This means that `_`, `__`, `___`, etc., all consume *one* variable from the input sequence, but are evaluated as that variable raised to the power of the number of underscores.\n    *   Example: `_-_/___*__`\n        *   The first `_` consumes `x0`, evaluates to `x0^1`.\n        *   The second `_` consumes `x1`, evaluates to `x1^1`.\n        *   The `___` consumes `x2`, evaluates to `x2^3`.\n        *   The `__` consumes `x3`, evaluates to `x3^2`.\n        *   The expression becomes `x0 - x1 / (x2^3) * (x3^2)`.\n        *   This expression uses 4 variables (`x0, x1, x2, x3`), which matches the length of the example output `0010`.\n    *   This interpretation resolves the variable count mismatch observed in the examples.\n\n4.  **Conditions Interpretation:**\n    *   The `_` character in the conditions refers to the **result (E)** of the jaws expression.\n    *   Similar to the jaws, `k` underscores (`_` repeated `k` times) represents `E` raised to the `k`-th power.\n    *   Example: `___>__`\n        *   `___` means `E^3`.\n        *   `__` means `E^2`.\n        *   The condition is `E^3 > E^2`.\n    *   Conditions are separated by commas `,`. All conditions must be true.\n\n5.  **Evaluation Details:**\n    *   Standard operator precedence applies (`*`, `/` before `+`, `-`). Parentheses override.\n    *   **Division:** If division by zero occurs, or if the result of a division is not an integer, the entire sequence of variables is invalid. The problem implies integer arithmetic for intermediate and final results since variables are integers and comparisons are exact. Python's `//` operator should be used for integer division. If `a % b != 0` for `a // b`, it's an invalid state.\n    *   The problem states \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\". This implies the *input* variables are digits. The *result* `E` and intermediate calculations must also be integers for consistent comparison with `E^k`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:**\n    *   Extract the `jaws_expression_string` and `conditions_string`.\n    *   **Process Jaws Expression:**\n        *   Iterate through `jaws_expression_string`.\n        *   When an `_` is encountered, count consecutive `_`s (`k`).\n        *   This sequence `_..._` (k times) corresponds to the *next available variable* raised to the power `k`.\n        *   Replace `k` underscores with `(x[idx]**k)`. `idx` is a counter for the current variable. Increment `idx` by 1.\n        *   Keep track of the total number of variables needed (`N`).\n        *   Append other characters (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`) directly.\n        *   Construct `jaws_eval_string`.\n    *   **Process Conditions:**\n        *   Split `conditions_string` by `,`.\n        *   For each condition `term1 op term2`:\n            *   Count underscores in `term1` (`k1`) and `term2` (`k2`).\n            *   Store `(k1, op, k2)`.\n\n2.  **Brute-Force Search (Lexicographical Order):**\n    *   Use `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=N)` to generate all possible sequences of `N` digits from `0` to `9` in lexicographical order.\n    *   For each `current_x_values` (a tuple of `N` digits):\n        a.  **Evaluate Jaws Expression:**\n            *   Create a dictionary `x` where `x[i] = current_x_values[i]` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n            *   Use `eval()` to calculate `E = eval(jaws_eval_string, {\"x\": x})`.\n            *   **Error Handling:**\n                *   Wrap `eval()` in a `try-except` block to catch `ZeroDivisionError`. If caught, this sequence is invalid; continue to the next.\n                *   If any intermediate division `a / b` results in a non-integer, the sequence is invalid. This needs custom division logic or careful `eval` handling. A simple way: check if `a % b != 0` before `a // b`.\n                    *   To handle this with `eval`, we can replace `/` with a custom function `div(a, b)` that raises an error if `b==0` or `a % b != 0`, otherwise returns `a // b`.\n                    *   We need to define `div` in the `eval` scope.\n            *   If `E` is not an integer (e.g., if we allowed float division, and it produced a float), this sequence is invalid.\n\n        b.  **Check Conditions:**\n            *   For each condition `(k1, op, k2)`:\n                *   Calculate `term1_val = E**k1` and `term2_val = E**k2`.\n                *   Perform the comparison based on `op` (`>`, `<`, `=`).\n                *   If any condition is false, this sequence is invalid; break and continue to the next `current_x_values`.\n\n        c.  **Found Solution:**\n            *   If all conditions are true, this `current_x_values` is the lexicographically smallest valid sequence. Convert it to a string and print it. Then exit.\n\n3.  **No Solution:** If the loop finishes without finding a valid sequence, print \"false\".\n\n**Refined `jaws_eval_string` construction and `eval` context:**\n\nTo handle integer division and non-integer results, we can define a custom `div` function.\n\n```python\ndef safe_div(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Division by zero\")\n    if a % b != 0:\n        # This implies non-integer result, invalid for this problem\n        raise ValueError(\"Non-integer division result\")\n    return a // b\n\n# When constructing jaws_eval_string:\n# Replace '/' with 'safe_div(' and append ')' after the divisor.\n# This requires careful parsing to identify the divisor.\n# A simpler approach for the given problem constraints and \"easy\" tag might be\n# to assume Python's default division behavior is sufficient IF the problem\n# *implicitly* guarantees integer results or allows floats.\n# Given \"variables take values from 0 to 9\", integer operations are most likely.\n\n# Let's stick to the simplest eval approach first and see if it passes examples.\n# Python 3 `/` is float division. If `E` must be integer, we need `//`.\n# If `/` is used, `E` might be float, and `E**k` might also be float.\n# Comparing floats can be tricky (e.g., `0.0 == 0`).\n# For an \"easy\" problem, it's more likely that all intermediate/final results are integers.\n# So, let's use `//` for division and ensure results are integers.\n```\n\n**Revised `jaws_eval_string` construction for integer division:**\n\nWe need to replace `/` with `//` and transform `_` sequences.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve():\n    s = input()\n    \n    # 1.
