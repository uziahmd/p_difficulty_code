    "thought": "**Understanding the \"Beautiful\" Multiset Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and it's asking me to count the number of ways to pick coefficients `c_s` for binary strings `s` of length 1 to `n`. The key is that the maximum size of this \"beautiful\" multiset has to be exactly `f`.  The `c_s` values are bounded between 0 and `k`.  This \"beautiful\" thing is defined by how many strings in the multiset have a given string `s` as a prefix.  That count can't exceed `c_s`.\n\nInitially, I thought about framing this as a maximum flow problem, but it feels too heavy-handed for just counting the ways things *can* be.  I'm thinking a trie, or prefix tree, is the way to go.  It's perfect for problems where prefixes matter.  We're basically dealing with a full binary tree up to depth `n`.  Each node represents a binary string.  The root is the empty string, but we're not actually using that since the strings are length 1 to `n`.\n\nSo, the `c_s` values sit at each node, except the root.  The multiset is just the leaves of the tree, strings of length `n`.  We can call `count(s)` the number of strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix. The condition is that `count(s) <= c_s` for *every* prefix string, including those of length `n`.\n\nNow, if `s` is a prefix that's *shorter* than `n`, its count is the sum of the counts of its children (`s0` and `s1`).  If it's of length `n`, then `count(s)` is simply the number of times that exact string appears.  This leads to a set of constraints:\n\n1.  `count(s) <= c_s` for prefixes shorter than `n`.\n2.  `count(s) <= c_s` for strings of length `n`.\n3.  `count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1)` for prefixes shorter than `n`.\n\nWe're trying to maximize the sum of all the `count(s)` values at the leaves (strings of length `n`).  This seems like a pretty standard setup.  It means the maximum size of the multiset is directly linked to the values of `c_s`.  For any node `s` in the trie, the most strings having `s` as a prefix is limited by `c_s`. Also, if `s` is not a leaf node, its count is the sum of its children's counts, which in itself is limited by the nodes' `c_s`. This means for any `s` that is a non-leaf: `count(s) <= min(c_s, count(s0) + count(s1))`.  Right, that seems to be the core idea. I think I'm on the right track now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of strings of length exactly $n$ is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the chosen $c_s$ values. Let $M(s)$ be the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nIf $s$ is a binary string of length $n$ (a leaf node in the binary trie of depth $n$), then $M(s)$ is simply $c_s$.\nIf $s$ is a binary string of length $L < n$ (an internal node), then $M(s)$ is limited by $c_s$, but also by the sum of what its children $s0$ and $s1$ can contribute. That is, $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nThe maximum total size of a beautiful multiset is $M(\\text{empty string})$, which we can define as $\\min(k, M(0) + M(1))$ if $n=0$, or just $M(0) + M(1)$ for $n \\ge 1$ (since $c_{\\text{empty string}}$ is not defined, we can assume it's infinite or $k$ if we consider the root as a prefix for all strings). The problem states $s$ has length from $1$ to $n$, so we are interested in $M(0) + M(1)$.\n\nLet's define $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ as the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$, starting from a specific string of length $L-1$, such that $M(s)$ for this string of length $L-1$ evaluates to $\\text{val}$.\nMore precisely, $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ will be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s'$ that are descendants of a string $s$ of length $L$ (including $s$ itself), such that $M(s)$ evaluates to $\\text{val}$. This is a bit confusing. Let's simplify.\n\nThe structure of the problem is a complete binary tree of depth $n$. All $2^n$ strings of length $n$ are leaves.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L, L+1, \\dots, n$ that are prefixes of some fixed string of length $L-1$ (i.e., $s'$ is a descendant of $s$), such that the maximum possible count for this fixed string $s$ (of length $L-1$) is $\\text{val}$.\nThe actual $c_s$ values are chosen for $s$ of length $1$ to $n$.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L, L+1, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of some string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that $M(s)$ becomes $\\text{val}$.\nThe base case is for $L=n$. For any string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. We need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, for each possible value $\\text{val} \\in [0, k]$, there is $1$ way to choose $c_s = \\text{val}$.\nThus, $dp[n][\\text{val}] = 1$ for $\\text{val} \\in [0, k]$.\n\nFor $L < n$:\nTo compute $dp[L][\\text{val}]$, we consider a string $s$ of length $L-1$. Its children are $s0$ and $s1$.\nWe need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nWe also need to choose $c_{s'}$ values for descendants of $s0$ and $s1$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for descendants of $s0$ such that $M(s0)$ evaluates to $v_0$ is $dp[L+1][v_0]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for descendants of $s1$ such that $M(s1)$ evaluates to $v_1$ is $dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nSo, for fixed $v_0, v_1$, there are $dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$ ways to choose $c_{s'}$ values for children's subtrees.\nThen $M(s) = \\min(c_s, v_0 + v_1)$.\nWe want $M(s) = \\text{val}$.\nThis means $c_s \\ge \\text{val}$ and $v_0 + v_1 \\ge \\text{val}$.\nAlso, at least one of these must be equal to $\\text{val}$.\nCase 1: $c_s = \\text{val}$. Then $v_0 + v_1 \\ge \\text{val}$.\nThere is 1 way to choose $c_s = \\text{val}$.\nThe number of pairs $(v_0, v_1)$ such that $v_0+v_1 \\ge \\text{val}$ is $\\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=\\max(0, \\text{val}-v_0)}^k dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nLet $S_L[X] = \\sum_{j=X}^k dp[L][j]$.\nThen $\\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=\\max(0, \\text{val}-v_0)}^k dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$ is the sum of $dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot S_{L+1}[\\max(0, \\text{val}-v_0)]$.\nThis sum is taken over $v_0 \\in [0, k]$.\nLet $F_L[\\text{sum_val}] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1 = \\text{sum_val}} dp[L][v_0] \\cdot dp[L][v_1]$. This is a convolution.\nLet $G_L[\\text{sum_val}] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1 \\ge \\text{sum_val}} dp[L][v_0] \\cdot dp[L][v_1]$. This is the suffix sum of $F_L$.\nThen for $c_s = \\text{val}$, there are $G_{L+1}[\\text{val}]$ ways. This is for $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\n\nCase 2: $v_0 + v_1 = \\text{val}$. Then $c_s > \\text{val}$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ is $k - \\text{val}$.\nThe number of pairs $(v_0, v_1)$ such that $v_0+v_1 = \\text{val}$ is $F_{L+1}[\\text{val}]$.\nSo, there are $(k-\\text{val}) \\cdot F_{L+1}[\\text{val}]$ ways.\n\nCombining these:\n$dp[L][\\text{val}] = (1 \\cdot G_{L+1}[\\text{val}]) + ((k-\\text{val}) \\cdot F_{L+1}[\\text{val}])$.\nThis formula counts for any particular string $s$ of length $L-1$.\nThe final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nThe maximum possible value for $\\text{val}$ is $k$.\nThe maximum possible value for $v_0+v_1$ is $2k$. So $F_L$ and $G_L$ arrays need to go up to $2k$.\nThe maximum $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. So $2k$ is $4 \\cdot 10^5$.\nComputing $F_L$ from $dp[L]$ is a convolution. This can be done using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) in $O(K \\log K)$ time.\n$dp[L]$ has $K+1$ values.\n$F_L$ has $2K+1$ values.\n$G_L$ can be computed from $F_L$ by suffix sums in $O(K)$ time.\nThe recursion depth is $n$.\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot K \\log K)$.\nGiven $n=15$, $K=2 \\cdot 10^5$, this is $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible.\n\nLet's refine the DP state and transitions.\n$MOD = 998244353$.\n$dp[L]$ is an array of size $2k+1$. $dp[L][x]$ stores the number of ways for $M(s)$ to be $x$ for a string $s$ of length $L$.\nBase case: $dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\nFor $L = n-1, \\dots, 0$:\n1. Calculate $F_{L+1}[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$ for $0 \\le x \\le 2k$. This is a convolution of $dp[L+1]$ with itself.\n2. Calculate $G_{L+1}[x] = \\sum_{j=x}^{2k} F_{L+1}[j]$ for $0 \\le x \\le 2k$. This is a suffix sum.\n3. Calculate $dp[L][x]$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$:\n   $dp[L][x] = (G_{L+1}[x] + (k-x) \\cdot F_{L+1}[x]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n   Note that $dp[L][x]$ is defined for $x \\in [0, k]$, because $M(s)$ is always $\\le c_s \\le k$.\n   So, $G_{L+1}[x]$ for $x > 2k$ or $F_{L+1}[x]$ for $x > 2k$ would be 0.\n   Also, if $x > k$, $dp[L][x]$ should be 0.\n   The maximum possible value for $M(s)$ is $k$. So $dp[L]$ array can be of size $k+1$.\n   The convolution $F_{L+1}$ will have values up to $2k$.\nLet $dp[L]$ be an array of size $k+1$.\n$dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$.\nFor $L = n-1, \\dots, 0$:\n  Let $P = dp[L+1]$.\n  Compute $F = P * P$ (convolution). $F$ will be an array of size $2k+1$.\n  Compute $G$ as suffix sums of $F$. $G[x] = \\sum_{j=x}^{2k} F[j]$.\n  For $x$ from $0$ to $k$:\n    $dp[L][x] = (G[x] + (k-x) \\cdot F[x]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n  For $x$ from $k+1$ to $2k$: $dp[L][x] = 0$. (This is implicit if we only calculate $dp[L]$ up to $k$).\n\nThe final answer is $dp[0][f]$.\n\nExample $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$dp[1][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le 42$.\n$L=0$:\n$P = dp[1]$.\n$F = P * P$.\n$F[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} P[v_0] P[v_1]$. Since $P[v]=1$ for $v \\in [0,k]$, $P[v]=0$ for $v>k$.\n$F[x]$ counts pairs $(v_0, v_1)$ s.t. $v_0+v_1=x$ and $0 \\le v_0, v_1 \\le k$.\nIf $0 \\le x \\le k$: $v_0$ can be $0, \\dots, x$. $v_1=x-v_0$. All are valid. So $x+1$ pairs. $F[x] = x+1$.\nIf $k < x \\le 2k$: $v_0$ can be $x-k, \\dots, k$. So $k - (x-k) + 1 = 2k-x+1$ pairs. $F[x] = 2k-x+1$.\n$G[x]$: suffix sums of $F$.\n$dp[0][x] = (G[x] + (k-x) \\cdot F[x]) \\pmod{MOD}$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$.\nWe need $dp[0][f]$. For $f=2$:\n$F[2] = 2+1 = 3$.\n$G[2] = \\sum_{j=2}^{2k} F[j]$.\n$G[2] = F[2] + F[3] + \\dots + F[k] + F[k+1] + \\dots + F[2k]$.\n$G[2] = \\sum_{j=2}^k (j+1) + \\sum_{j=k+1}^{2k} (2k-j+1)$.\n$\\sum_{j=2}^k (j+1) = \\sum_{i=3}^{k+1} i = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} - (1+2) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} - 3$.\n$\\sum_{j=k+1}^{2k} (2k-j+1) = \\sum_{i=1}^k i = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.\n$G[2] = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} - 3 + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{(k+1)(2k+2)}{2} - 3 = (k+1)^2 - 3$.\nFor $k=42$, $G[2] = (43)^2 - 3 = 1849 - 3 = 1846$.\n$dp[0][2] = (G[2] + (k-2) \\cdot F[2]) = (1846 + (42-2) \\cdot 3) = (1846 + 40 \\cdot 3) = 1846 + 120 = 1966$.\nThis is not 3. The example output is 3. What went wrong?\n\nThe problem states \"strings of length from 1 to n\".\nThe definition of $M(s)$ is $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$ if $s$ is not a leaf.\nIf $s$ is a leaf (length $n$), $M(s) = c_s$.\nThe total number of strings is $M(\\text{empty string})$. But $c_{\\text{empty string}}$ is not defined.\nThe total number of strings in the multiset is $\\sum_{s: \\text{len}(s)=n} \\text{count}(s)$.\nThis is $M(0) + M(1)$.\nSo we need to compute $M(0)$ and $M(1)$.\n$M(0)$ is computed from $c_0$ and $M(00), M(01), \\dots$.\n$M(1)$ is computed from $c_1$ and $M(10), M(11), \\dots$.\nThese two are independent.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of $0$ s.t. $M(0)=v_0$ is $dp[1][v_0]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of $1$ s.t. $M(1)=v_1$ is $dp[1][v_1]$.\nSo we need to find $\\sum_{v_0+v_1=f} dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\nThis is exactly $F_1[f]$, where $F_1$ is the convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself.\nSo the final answer is $F_1[f]$.\nLet's re-evaluate for $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$dp[1][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le 42$.\nThe answer is $F_1[f]$ where $F_1 = dp[1] * dp[1]$.\n$F_1[2]$ for $k=42$. $F_1[2] = 2+1 = 3$. This matches the example!\n\nSo the DP state is $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ = number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of *some fixed string $s$ of length $L-1$*, such that $M(s)=\\text{val}$.\nBase case: $dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$.\nFor $L = n-1, \\dots, 1$:\n  Let $P = dp[L+1]$.\n  Compute $F = P * P$. (Size $2k+1$)\n  Compute $G$ as suffix sums of $F$. (Size $2k+1$)\n  For $x$ from $0$ to $k$:\n    $dp[L][x] = (G[x] + (k-x) \\cdot F[x]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nThe final answer is $F_1[f]$, where $F_1 = dp[1] * dp[1]$.\n\nThe number of strings of length $L$ is $2^L$. All these strings are symmetric. So $M(s)$ for any string $s$ of length $L$ will be computed in the same way.\nThe $dp[L]$ array represents the possible values for $M(s)$ for any $s$ of length $L$.\nThe values $c_s$ are chosen for $s$ of length $1, \\dots, n$.\n$dp[n][x]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for a specific string $s$ of length $n$ such that $M(s)=x$. This is $1$ if $0 \\le x \\le k$.\n$dp[L][x]$ for $L < n$: $s$ is a specific string of length $L$. $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0)+M(s1))$.\n$c_s$ is chosen from $0 \\dots k$.\n$M(s0)$ can take value $v_0$ in $dp[L+1][v_0]$ ways.\n$M(s1)$ can take value $v_1$ in $dp[L+1][v_1]$ ways.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for descendants of $s0$ and $s1$ is $dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for $s$ itself is $k+1$.\nAll $c_s$ values are chosen independently.\nThe structure of the DP is correct.\n\nLet's check the constraints: $n \\le 15$, $k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$K_{max} = 2 \\cdot 10^5$. Max value for convolution is $2K_{max} = 4 \\cdot 10^5$.\nNumber of iterations for $L$ is $n$.\nEach iteration involves one convolution $P * P$.\nThe length of $P$ is $k+1$. The length of $F$ is $2k+1$.\nNTT requires array sizes to be powers of 2. Smallest power of 2 greater than $2K_{max}$ is $2^{19} = 524288$.\n$15 \\cdot (524288 \\log 524288)$ is $15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$. This might be slow.\n$MOD = 998244353$ is a prime with $998244353 - 1 = 2^{23} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 17$. So $2^{23}$ is a factor, which is good for NTT.\nThe maximum value for $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum value for $M(s)$ for any $s$ of length $L$ is $k$.\nSo $dp[L]$ arrays only need to store values up to $k$.\nThe convolution result $F$ can have values up to $2k$.\nSo $P$ has size $k+1$. $F$ has size $2k+1$.\nNTT needs length $N$ to be power of 2. $N \\ge (k+1) + (k+1) - 1 = 2k+1$.\nSo $N$ is smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to $2k+1$.\nFor $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k+1 = 400001$. Smallest power of 2 is $2^{19} = 524288$.\nTotal operations: $n \\times (\\text{NTT_length} \\times \\log(\\text{NTT_length}))$.\n$15 \\times (524288 \\times 19) \\approx 1.49 \\times 10^8$. This is on the edge for 1-2 seconds.\nPython's arbitrary precision integers and list operations could make this too slow.\nA custom NTT implementation in Python would be too slow. We need a fast language like C++.\nBut the problem asks for a Python script. This implies either there's a trick to optimize NTT or there's a simpler approach.\n\nLet $P_L(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^k dp[L][j] x^j$ be the generating function for $dp[L]$.\nThen $F_{L+1}(x)$ is related to $P_{L+1}(x)^2$.\n$G_{L+1}(x)$ is related to $F_{L+1}(x)$ by suffix sums.\n$dp[L][x] = (G_{L+1}[x] + (k-x) \\cdot F_{L+1}[x]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nThis is a standard DP with polynomial multiplication, usually solved with NTT.\n\nIs there any special property for $n=15$?\n$2^{15} = 32768$.\nThe number of strings is $2^1 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^n = 2(2^n-1)$.\nFor $n=15$, this is $2(2^{15}-1) = 2(32767) = 65534$.\nThis is not directly relevant.\n\nWhat if $f$ is very large? $f$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$M(s)$ for $s$ of length $L$ can be at most $k$.\nSo $dp[L][x]$ is 0 for $x > k$.\nThe final answer is $F_1[f]$. $F_1$ is convolution of $dp[1]$ with $dp[1]$.\n$dp[1]$ has values up to $k$. So $F_1$ has values up to $2k$.\nIf $f > 2k$, the answer is 0.\nThis is important. $f$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, $k$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nSo $f$ can be up to $2k$.\nExample 4: $n=6, k=153, f=23699$.\nHere $2k = 306$. $f=23699 > 306$. So the answer is 0. This matches the example.\nThis check is crucial.\n\nPython's `numpy.fft.fft` and `numpy.fft.ifft` can be used for polynomial multiplication, but they operate on floating point numbers, so they won't work for modular arithmetic directly. We need a custom NTT implementation.\nA Python NTT implementation might be too slow unless $N$ is small.\nThe problem statement is \"competitive programming problem\", implies standard libraries and algorithms.\nIt is possible that $N$ is not $2^{19}$ for all test cases.\nBut $k$ can be $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe only way this is feasible in Python is if the actual $N$ used in NTT is much smaller.\nThis would mean $k$ is small for most test cases or there is a different approach.\nHowever, $k$ is explicitly given as $2 \\cdot 10^5$ for the last example.\nThis strongly suggests that a fast NTT implementation is expected, or there's a trick.\n\nLet's consider the maximum possible value for $k$ that would be feasible for Python NTT.\nIf $N=2^{16}=65536$, then $15 \\cdot 65536 \\cdot 16 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^7$, which is borderline.\nIf $N=2^{17}=131072$, then $15 \\cdot 131072 \\cdot 17 \\approx 3.3 \\cdot 10^7$.\nIf $N=2^{18}=262144$, then $15 \\cdot 262144 \\cdot 18 \\approx 7 \\cdot 10^7$.\nIf $N=2^{19}=524288$, then $15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$.\n\nIt's possible that a standard Python NTT implementation will pass within typical time limits (2-3 seconds) for $1.5 \\times 10^8$ operations, if the constant factor is small. Many competitive programming platforms use PyPy for Python, which can be significantly faster.\n\nLet's write down the NTT implementation.\nThe modulus is $998244353$.
