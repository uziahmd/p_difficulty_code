His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Olympiad Ranking Scenarios**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a ranking problem for a competition, and I need to figure out Vasya's best and worst possible ranks. I'm given the total number of participants, the minimum score Vasya achieved, and the scores from the first and second rounds, but the catch is that I don't know the pairings between the round scores. This presents a combinatorial challenge.\n\nThe core of the issue is that the order of the scores in the lists is arbitrary, so I need to consider all possible pairings between the scores in the first and second rounds to determine the maximum and minimum ranks. I can't just pick the highest scores for Vasya and the lowest for the others, because the goal isn't just to maximize Vasya's score; it's to maximize his *rank*. The jury's ability to arbitrarily assign ranks in the case of ties adds another layer of complexity.\n\nTo find the best rank, I need to try to construct a scenario where Vasya's score is as high as possible and other participants' scores are as low as possible *relative* to his. Finding the absolute highest possible score for Vasya isn't enough, since I want to compare it to the scores of the rest.\n\nIf I give Vasya the largest score from the first round and pair that with the largest from the second round, I could maximize his score. However, giving him the top two scores could penalize him relative to everyone else. The challenge is in determining how this pairing affects the ability to get the best rank. I can assign him an arbitrary pair of scores whose sum is at least `x`. Then, the remaining `n-1` participants can take the remaining combinations. My approach for determining the best rank will have to be iterative.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given the scores from two tours for all participants and a minimum total score `x` for Vasya. The key challenge is that we don't know which first tour score `a_i` belongs to which second tour score `b_j`, or which pair belongs to Vasya. We are guaranteed that Vasya's total score is at least `x`.\n\n**1. Best Possible Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score while minimizing the scores of other participants.\nThe best possible score Vasya can achieve is by taking the highest score from `a` and the highest score from `b`. Let these be `max(a)` and `max(b)`. If `max(a) + max(b) < x`, it means Vasya cannot achieve this score, which contradicts the problem statement that Vasya's score is at least `x`. So, Vasya *could* achieve `max(a) + max(b)`.\n\nIf Vasya achieves `max(a) + max(b)`, then his score is `S_V = max(a) + max(b)`.\nThe remaining `n-1` participants must be assigned scores from the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores. To ensure Vasya gets rank 1, we want all other participants to have scores less than or equal to `S_V`. This is always possible if Vasya takes the highest scores.\nSince the jury can assign places arbitrarily in case of ties, if Vasya has the highest possible score, he can always be assigned rank 1.\nTherefore, Vasya's best possible rank is **1**.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we want to:\na. Minimize Vasya's score, but still keep it at least `x`.\nb. Maximize the scores of other participants, especially those who might score higher than Vasya.\nc. In case of ties, assume the jury assigns Vasya the worst possible rank among participants with the same score.\n\nLet's consider a fixed score `S` for Vasya, where `S >= x`.\nTo maximize the number of participants who score *strictly greater* than `S`, we should pair the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores in a way that maximizes their sums. This is achieved by sorting `a` in descending order and `b` in descending order, then pairing `a_i` with `b_i`. However, this is not how it works. We need to pair `n-1` `a`s and `n-1` `b`s optimally for *others*.\n\nThe most effective strategy to make Vasya's rank worse is to pair up all `a_i` and `b_j` values such that:\n1. Vasya gets a score `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\n2. As many other participants as possible get scores `S_P > S_V`.\n3. If `S_P = S_V`, as many other participants as possible get this score.\n\nConsider a participant `P`. If `P` gets `a_i` and `b_j`, their score is `a_i + b_j`.\nTo maximize the number of participants who score *at least* `S_V`, we can use a greedy approach.\nSort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nSort `b` in ascending order: `b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`.\n\nNow, imagine we are trying to find pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nFor a fixed `a_i`, any `b_j` such that `b_j >= x - a_i` would satisfy the condition for Vasya.\nTo make Vasya's score as low as possible (while still being `>= x`), and to maximize other participants' scores, we can try to pair the largest `a_i` with the smallest `b_j` that still makes `a_i + b_j >= x`. This isn't quite right.\n\nLet's rephrase: We want to find a permutation of `b` (let's call it `b'`) such that `a_i + b'_i` are the scores of the `n` participants. One of these `n` pairs belongs to Vasya. We want to choose this pair `(a_k, b'_k)` such that `a_k + b'_k >= x`, and then assign the remaining `n-1` pairs `(a_i, b'_i)` to other participants such that the number of participants with score `S_P >= a_k + b'_k` is maximized.\n\nThis is a matching problem. To maximize the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, we can use a two-pointer approach after sorting.\nSort `a` in ascending order. Sort `b` in descending order.\nLet `a_sorted` be `a` sorted ascendingly, and `b_sorted` be `b` sorted descendingly.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nInitialize two pointers: `ptr_a = 0` (for `a_sorted`) and `ptr_b = 0` (for `b_sorted`).\n`count = 0`\nWhile `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b < n`:\n  If `a_sorted[ptr_a] + b_sorted[ptr_b] >= x`:\n    This pair `(a_sorted[ptr_a], b_sorted[ptr_b])` can form a participant with score at least `x`. We \"use\" these two scores.\n    `count += 1`\n    `ptr_a += 1`\n    `ptr_b += 1`\n  Else (`a_sorted[ptr_a] + b_sorted[ptr_b] < x`):\n    Since `b_sorted` is descending, `b_sorted[ptr_b]` is the largest available `b` score for `a_sorted[ptr_a]`. If their sum is less than `x`, then `a_sorted[ptr_a]` cannot be paired with any remaining `b` to reach `x`. So, we discard `a_sorted[ptr_a]` and move to the next `a`.\n    `ptr_a += 1`\n\nThe `count` found by this algorithm represents the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who *could* achieve a total score of at least `x`.\nThis is because by pairing the smallest `a_i` with the largest `b_j` that satisfies the condition, we \"save\" larger `a_i` values for smaller `b_j` values, thus maximizing the total number of such pairs.\n\nLet `k` be this `count`.\nThis means there are `k` participants whose scores are at least `x`. The remaining `n-k` participants must have scores less than `x`.\nSince Vasya is guaranteed to have a score of at least `x`, Vasya must be one of these `k` participants.\nIn the worst-case scenario, Vasya is assigned the lowest rank among these `k` participants.\nHis rank would then be `k`.\n\nLet's trace this logic with an example:\n`n = 6, x = 7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\nSort `a` ascending: `a_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSort `b` descending: `b_sorted = [8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0]`\n\n`ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 0`, `count = 0`\n\n1. `a_sorted[0] = 3`, `b_sorted[0] = 8`. Sum = `3 + 8 = 11`. `11 >= 7`.\n   `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n2. `a_sorted[1] = 4`, `b_sorted[1] = 6`. Sum = `4 + 6 = 10`. `10 >= 7`.\n   `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n3. `a_sorted[2] = 4`, `b_sorted[2] = 4`. Sum = `4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`.\n   `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n4. `a_sorted[3] = 4`, `b_sorted[3] = 4`. Sum = `4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`.\n   `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 4`.\n5. `a_sorted[4] = 5`, `b_sorted[4] = 3`. Sum = `5 + 3 = 8`. `8 >= 7`.\n   `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = 5`.\n6. `a_sorted[5] = 6`, `b_sorted[5] = 0`. Sum = `6 + 0 = 6`. `6 < 7`.\n   `ptr_a = 6`. (Since `a_sorted[5]` cannot form >=x with `b_sorted[5]`, it cannot with any `b_sorted[>5]` either as they are smaller).\n   Loop ends because `ptr_a = 6`.\n\nThe `count` is 5.\nThis means there are 5 participants who can achieve a score of at least `x=7`.\nSince Vasya is one of them, and the jury can assign places arbitrarily among those with the same score, Vasya's worst rank among these 5 participants would be 5.\nThe remaining `n-k = 6-5 = 1` participant would have a score less than 7, so they would be ranked lower than Vasya.\nThus, Vasya's worst rank is 5.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `x`.\n2. Read list `a`.\n3. Read list `b`.\n4. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n5. Sort `b` in descending order.\n6. Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n7. Initialize `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n8. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b < n`:\n   If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n     `worst_rank += 1`\n     `ptr_a += 1`\n     `ptr_b += 1`\n   Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n     `ptr_a += 1` (This `a[ptr_a]` cannot form a sum `>= x` with any remaining `b` because `b[ptr_b]` is the largest available `b` for it. So we discard it and move to the next `a`.)\n9.
