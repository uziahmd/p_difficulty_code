            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Guard Duty (easy)\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and my initial thoughts are about how to tackle it computationally.  The problem gives us the locations of Rebel spaceships and bases, and we need to determine if we can connect each ship to a unique base without any of the connection lines intersecting.  The constraint of R and B being <= 10 is the key here - that tells me I can probably get away with a brute-force approach, maybe checking all permutations.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure R and B are equal, that's a quick check. If not, game over, we know the answer is \"No\".\n\nNext, I'll need to somehow represent the coordinates.  I can store them as tuples (x, y) or maybe create a simple Point class for clarity.  Then, I'll generate all the possible assignments – basically, all the permutations of the base indices.\n\nThe heart of the problem is the intersection check.  I remember that a common geometric concept for non-intersecting segments involves cross-products or the \"orientation\" of points.  If two segments intersect, it means one pair of endpoints is on opposite sides of the line defined by the other pair of endpoints. The orientation function will tell me if a point is to the left, right, or on the line relative to a segment.  I'll need to calculate this orientation for each combination of segments.\n\nSpecifically, two segments intersect if the orientations of the endpoints of one segment relative to the other segment are of opposite signs, and vice versa.  Because the problem states no three points are collinear, this will be straightforward.\n\nSo, for each permutation, I'll iterate through the assigned pairs (spaceship, base). For each pairing, I'll compare it against all other pairings. If any two pairings intersect, I discard that permutation. If I manage to check all pairings for all permutations and find a valid set of non-intersecting segments, then the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nI'll write this up in Python.  Given the size constraints, permutations should be quick enough. The main complexity will be the intersection checks, but even that should be acceptable within the time limits.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a perfect matching between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two connecting paths (straight line segments) intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching requires an equal number of elements in both sets. Therefore, if `R != B`, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, and we should output \"No\".\n\nGiven the small constraints (`R, B <= 10`), we can try all possible assignments. This means iterating through all permutations of bases for a fixed order of spaceships (or vice versa). For `N=10`, `N!` is `3,628,800`, which is small enough for modern CPUs.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Check `R == B`**: If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n2.  **Read Input**: Store Rebel spaceship coordinates in a list `rebels` and base coordinates in a list `bases`.\n3.  **Iterate Permutations**: Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible orderings of base indices `(0, 1, ..., B-1)`. Each permutation `p` represents an assignment: `rebels[i]` is assigned to `bases[p[i]]`.\n4.  **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation `p`:\n    a.  Assume `possible = True`.\n    b.  Iterate through all pairs of distinct assignments `(rebels[i], bases[p[i]])` and `(rebels[j], bases[p[j]])` where `i < j`.\n    c.  For each pair, check if the segment `(rebels[i], bases[p[i]])` intersects with `(rebels[j], bases[p[j]])`.\n    d.  If an intersection is found, set `possible = False` and break from the inner loops (no need to check further pairs for this permutation).\n    e.  If after checking all pairs, `possible` is still `True`, it means we found a valid non-intersecting matching. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n5.  **No Valid Matching**: If all permutations are checked and no valid matching is found, print \"No\".\n\n**Intersection Test (Orientation Method):**\nTwo line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line `p2q2`.\n2.  `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line `p1q1`.\n\nThis can be determined using the 2D cross product or orientation test. For three points `A(ax, ay)`, `B(bx, by)`, `C(cx, cy)`, the orientation of `C` with respect to vector `AB` is given by `(bx - ax)(cy - ay) - (by - ay)(cx - ax)`.\n*   If the result is `> 0`, `C` is to the left (counter-clockwise).\n*   If the result is `< 0`, `C` is to the right (clockwise).\n*   If the result is `= 0`, `C` is collinear with `A` and `B`.\n\nGiven the problem statement guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", we don't need to worry about collinearity cases (where an endpoint of one segment lies on the other segment).\n\nSo, two segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if:\n`orientation(p1, q1, p2)` and `orientation(p1, q1, q2)` have different signs (one positive, one negative), AND\n`orientation(p2, q2, p1)` and `orientation(p2, q2, q1)` have different signs.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\nR=3, B=3\nRebels: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\nBases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nLet's say we try the identity permutation `p = (0, 1, 2)`:\nAssignments:\n1. `(0,0)` to `(-2,1)`\n2. `(2,0)` to `(0,3)`\n3. `(3,1)` to `(2,2)`\n\nSegments:\nS1: ((0,0), (-2,1))\nS2: ((2,0), (0,3))\nS3: ((3,1), (2,2))\n\nCheck S1 and S2:\np1=(0,0), q1=(-2,1)\np2=(2,0), q2=(0,3)\nOrientation(p1, q1, p2) = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)) -> ((-2)-0)(0-0) - (1-0)(2-0) = 0 - 2 = -2 (right)\nOrientation(p1, q1, q2) = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)) -> ((-2)-0)(3-0) - (1-0)(0-0) = -6 - 0 = -6 (right)\nSigns are the same (-2 and -6).
