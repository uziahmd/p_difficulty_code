            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for the Tokitsukaze Mahjong Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of draws Tokitsukaze needs to complete at least one mentsu, given three initial tiles.  We're talking koutsu (triplets) or shuntsu (sequences). The key is the limited initial tiles, just three, which makes a brute-force approach feasible, at least on a small scale.\n\nFirst things first, I'm going to represent each tile as a tuple – a number and a suit – like `(1, 's')` for \"1s\". Makes it easier to handle and compare.  My initial thought is to decompose the problem into manageable steps:\n\n**Case 0 Draws:**  Can I form a mentsu *right now* with just those three tiles?  If all three are identical, it's a koutsu. Easy peasy. For a shuntsu, they have to be the same suit and the numbers sequential. I'll need to sort the numbers for the shuntsu check.  If either condition (koutsu or shuntsu) is true, the answer is zero draws, and I can return.\n\n**Case 1 Draw:** If zero draws isn't enough, can I get a mentsu with a single draw? This is where I start thinking about all the possibilities. We now have four tiles. We need to find *any* three of them that make a mentsu.  I see a shortcut: focus on pairs. If any pair of the initial tiles can form a mentsu with a single draw, we've got a solution. I'll need to consider adding a tile to each possible pair: `(t1,t2)`, `(t1,t3)`, and `(t2,t3)`. I'll also consider drawing a tile which, combined with the initial three tiles, forms a koutsu. The answer here will be one draw.\n\nI haven't even gotten to Case 2 yet, but I'm thinking about it: this would mean two draws. However, if Case 1 has passed, that is not required.\n\nIt's all about systematically checking combinations and using the problem's constraints to keep things efficient. This structure seems logical. I have to make sure to build the correct functions for koutsu and shuntsu, and then I can write the main logic. I think I'm ready to write some Python code to handle this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw (0, 1, or 2) to form at least one mentsu (a koutsu or a shuntsu). She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`, where `number` is an integer from 1 to 9 and `suit` is 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n\nThe strategy is to check for 0 draws, then 1 draw, then 2 draws, in that order. The first case that satisfies the condition gives the minimum number.\n\n**Helper Functions:**\n\n1.  **`is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3)`**: Checks if three tiles `t1, t2, t3` form a koutsu (triplet).\n    *   Returns `True` if `t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`. Otherwise, `False`.\n\n2.  **`is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)`**: Checks if three tiles `t1, t2, t3` form a shuntsu (sequence).\n    *   First, check if all three tiles have the same suit. If not, return `False`.\n    *   Then, extract the numbers `n1, n2, n3`. Sort them: `s_n1, s_n2, s_n3`.\n    *   Return `True` if `s_n2 == s_n1 + 1` and `s_n3 == s_n2 + 1`. Otherwise, `False`.\n\n3.  **`has_mentsu(tiles)`**: Checks if a list of three tiles forms a mentsu.\n    *   Returns `True` if `is_koutsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2])` or `is_shuntsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2])`. Otherwise, `False`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nLet the initial three tiles be `T = [t1, t2, t3]`.\n\n**0 Draws:**\n*   If `has_mentsu(T)` is `True`, then the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, we need to check if one draw can complete a mentsu.\nThis means we need to find a tile `t_new` such that `t_new` combined with two of the existing tiles `(ti, tj)` forms a mentsu.\nThere are three pairs from the initial tiles: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\nFor each pair `(ti, tj)`:\n    *   **To form a koutsu**: If `ti == tj`, we can draw `ti` (or `tj`) to form `[ti, tj, ti]`. This requires 1 draw.\n    *   **To form a shuntsu**:\n        *   If `ti` and `tj` have the same suit:\n            Let their numbers be `ni, nj`. Sort them: `s_ni, s_nj`.\n            *   If `s_nj == s_ni + 1` (e.g., 2m, 3m): We can draw `s_ni - 1` (if `s_ni > 1`) or `s_nj + 1` (if `s_nj < 9`). For example, with (2m, 3m), draw 1m or 4m. This requires 1 draw.\n            *   If `s_nj == s_ni + 2` (e.g., 2m, 4m): We can draw `s_ni + 1` (e.g., 3m). This requires 1 draw.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair `(ti, tj)`, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is enough, the answer must be 2.\nWe need to check if two draws can complete a mentsu.\nThis means we need to find two tiles `t_new1, t_new2` such that:\n    *   `t_new1` and `t_new2` form a mentsu with one of the existing tiles `tk`.\n    *   `t_new1` and `t_new2` themselves form a mentsu (this is always possible, e.g., draw 1m, 1m, 1m).\n\nLet's consider the initial tiles `t1, t2, t3`.\nFor each tile `tk` in `T`:\n    *   **To form a koutsu**: We can draw two `tk` tiles. For example, draw `t1, t1` to form `[t1, t1, t1]`. This requires 2 draws.\n    *   **To form a shuntsu**:\n        We can draw two tiles `t_a, t_b` of the same suit as `tk`, such that `tk, t_a, t_b` form a shuntsu.\n        For example, if `tk` is 5m, we can draw 4m and 6m. This requires 2 draws.\n        More generally, for any tile `tk = (num, suit)`:\n            *   If `num >= 3`: draw `(num-2, suit)` and `(num-1, suit)`.\n            *   If `num >= 2` and `num <= 8`: draw `(num-1, suit)` and `(num+1, suit)`.\n            *   If `num <= 7`: draw `(num+1, suit)` and `(num+2, suit)`.\n        Since we can draw *any* tiles, we can always form a shuntsu with 2 draws, e.g., draw \"1m\", \"2m\", \"3m\". Or, draw \"1m\", \"1m\", \"1m\".\n\nSince we can always form a mentsu by drawing two new tiles (e.g., draw `1m, 1m, 1m` or `1m, 2m, 3m`), the maximum number of draws needed is 2.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input**: Convert string tiles to `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  **Check for 0 draws**:\n    *   If `T` forms a koutsu or shuntsu, print 0.\n3.  **Check for 1 draw**:\n    *   Iterate through all unique pairs `(ti, tj)` from `T`.\n    *   If `ti == tj` (e.g., `1m, 1m`), we can draw one `ti` to make a koutsu.\n    *   If `ti.suit == tj.suit`:\n        *   If `|ti.num - tj.num| == 1` (e.g., `1m, 2m`), we can draw `ti.num-1` or `tj.num+1` (if valid) to make a shuntsu.\n        *   If `|ti.num - tj.num| == 2` (e.g., `1m, 3m`), we can draw `min(ti.num, tj.num)+1` to make a shuntsu.\n    *   If any of these conditions are met, print 1.\n4.  **Otherwise, print 2**.\n\nThis covers all cases and finds the minimum.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    \"\"\"Parses a tile string 'Ns' into (number, suit) tuple.\"\"\"\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ndef is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    \"\"\"Checks if three tiles form a koutsu (triplet).\"\"\"\n    return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\ndef is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    \"\"\"Checks if three tiles form a shuntsu (sequence).\"\"\"\n    # All must be of the same suit\n    if not (t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]):\n        return False\n\n    # Numbers must be sequential\n    nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]])\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a list of three tiles forms a mentsu.\"\"\"\n    if len(tiles) != 3:\n        return False\n    return is_koutsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]) or is_shuntsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2])\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    tiles_str = [parse_tile(s) for s in line]\n\n    # Sort tiles for easier processing later, especially for checking pairs\n    # Sorting by suit then number helps group identical tiles and same-suit tiles\n    tiles_str.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Case 0 draws: Check if the initial 3 tiles already form a mentsu\n    if has_mentsu(tiles_str):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 1 draw: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile\n    # We need to find a pair among the 3 initial tiles that can be completed\n    # into a mentsu with one extra draw.\n    \n    # Check for koutsu with 1 draw:\n    # If two tiles are identical, drawing a third identical tile makes a koutsu.\n    if tiles_str[0] == tiles_str[1] or \\\n       tiles_str[1] == tiles_str[2]:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Check for shuntsu with 1 draw:\n    # Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles\n    pairs_checked = set()\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n            t1 = tiles_str[i]\n            t2 = tiles_str[j]\n\n            # Ensure we don't process duplicate pairs if input had identical tiles\n            pair_key = tuple(sorted([t1, t2]))\n            if pair_key in pairs_checked:\n                continue\n            pairs_checked.add(pair_key)\n\n            # If same suit\n            if t1[1] == t2[1]:\n                n1, n2 = sorted([t1[0], t2[0]])\n                \n                # Case: N, N+1.
