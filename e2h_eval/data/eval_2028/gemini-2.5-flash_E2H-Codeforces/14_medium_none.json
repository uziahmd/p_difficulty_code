    "thought": "**Solving the Factorial Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to find all positive integers, 'n', whose factorial (n!) ends with exactly 'm' zeroes.  First, I've got to understand how to count those trailing zeroes.  It's all about factors of 10, which are pairs of 2 and 5.  In any factorial, there are always more 2s than 5s, so I just need to count the 5s.\n\nLegendre's formula comes in handy here.  I can use it to calculate the number of factors of 5 in n!. The formula gives us the number of trailing zeros as: `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. I noticed this function is non-decreasing. As 'n' increases, the number of zeroes either stays the same or goes up.  It only increases when 'n' is a multiple of 5, but even then, it can skip values. Like, you can't have exactly 5 trailing zeroes (skips from 4 to 6).\n\nThe goal is to find 'n' such that Z(n) = m. If the function Z(n) skips a value for a given 'm' there will be no solution. If it doesn't skip a value, and if `Z(n_0) = m`, and `Z(n_0-1) < m`, then 'n_0' is the first value in a block of 5 consecutive numbers. It’s always a block of five for each reachable 'm', and 'n' values for a specific count of trailing zeroes will form a contiguous block.  For a given 'm', I need to find these values.\n\nI'm thinking binary search will be my best friend here.  The value of 'n' that leads to m zeroes will be about 4 times 'm'. I need to find the smallest 'n_start' such that Z(n) = m. Using a function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` I can calculate the trailing zeroes. I'll search from 1 to 5 * m, binary style. I'll search for the *smallest* 'n' where the number of zeroes is >= m.  \n\nAfter the search, if count_trailing_zeroes(n) == m, I know I've found a valid starting 'n'. From that point I can find the 5 values and count them. If `n` is a multiple of 5 then my set will be `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. If not, it means I skipped value.  If count_trailing_zeroes(n) > m, then no valid 'n' exists. That means there's a skip, so the answer is zero. This algorithm seems like the most efficient way to tackle this problem, especially for the potentially large value of m (up to 100,000). I have a hunch it'll work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n` values, and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2 and 5. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes is simply the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\nLegendre's formula gives the number of factors of a prime `p` in `n!`:\n`Z(n, p) = floor(n/p) + floor(n/p^2) + floor(n/p^3) + ...`\n\nFor `p=5`, the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\n\nLet's define a function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` that implements this formula.\n\n**Properties of `Z(n)`**\n\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. For example, `Z(5)=1`, `Z(6)=1`, `Z(7)=1`, `Z(8)=1`, `Z(9)=1`, and `Z(10)=2`.\n3.  Because `Z(n)` is constant for `n` values between multiples of 5 (e.g., `Z(5k) = Z(5k+1) = Z(5k+2) = Z(5k+3) = Z(5k+4)`), if `Z(n_0) = m`, then `Z(n_0+1), Z(n_0+2), Z(n_0+3), Z(n_0+4)` might also be `m`.\n4.  `Z(n)` can \"skip\" values. For example, `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`. There is no `n` for which `Z(n)=5`.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nWe need to find all `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` is a monotonic function, we can use binary search to find an `n` that produces `m` zeroes.\n\n1.  **Binary Search for `n_candidate`**:\n    We perform a binary search to find the *smallest* positive integer `n_candidate` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n_candidate) >= m`.\n    *   The search range for `n` can be from `1` up to a reasonable upper bound. Since `Z(n)` grows roughly as `n/4`, `n` will be approximately `4m`. A safe upper bound for `n` is `5 * m + 5` (for `m=100000`, this is `500005`).\n    *   Initialize `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m + 5`.\n    *   Initialize `n_candidate = -1`.\n    *   In each step of the binary search:\n        *   Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`.\n        *   Calculate `current_zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)`.\n        *   If `current_zeroes >= m`: `mid` is a potential answer or too large. Store `mid` in `n_candidate` and try to find a smaller `n` by setting `high = mid - 1`.\n        *   If `current_zeroes < m`: `mid` is too small. We need more zeroes, so increase `n` by setting `low = mid + 1`.\n\n2.  **Check `n_candidate`**:\n    After the binary search, `n_candidate` will hold the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n    *   If `count_trailing_zeroes(n_candidate) == m`:\n        This means we found a starting `n` value that produces exactly `m` zeroes.\n        Due to the property that `Z(x)` is constant for `x` in `[5k, 5k+4]`, and `n_candidate` being the *smallest* `n` for which `Z(n)=m`, `n_candidate` must be a multiple of 5. (If `n_candidate` were `5k+j` for `j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}`, then `Z(5k)` would also be `m`, contradicting `n_candidate` being the smallest).\n        Therefore, the values of `n` that produce `m` zeroes will be `n_candidate`, `n_candidate+1`, `n_candidate+2`, `n_candidate+3`, and `n_candidate+4`. There are always 5 such values.\n        Print `5` (the count) and then these five integers separated by spaces.\n    *   If `count_trailing_zeroes(n_candidate) > m`:\n        This means `m` is a skipped value (e.g., `m=5` in the example `Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6`). There is no `n` that produces exactly `m` zeroes.\n        Print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1)**\n\n1.  `m = 1`.\n2.  Binary search for smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= 1`.\n    *   `low = 1`, `high = 5*1 + 5 = 10`. `n_candidate = -1`.\n    *   `mid = (1+10)//2 = 5`. `Z(5) = 1`. `1 >= 1` is true. `n_candidate = 5`, `high = 4`.\n    *   `low = 1`, `high = 4`.\n    *   `mid = (1+4)//2 = 2`. `Z(2) = 0`. `0 >= 1` is false. `low = 3`.\n    *   `low = 3`, `high = 4`.\n    *   `mid = (3+4)//2 = 3`. `Z(3) = 0`. `0 >= 1` is false. `low = 4`.\n    *   `low = 4`, `high = 4`.\n    *   `mid = (4+4)//2 = 4`. `Z(4) = 0`. `0 >= 1` is false. `low = 5`.\n    *   `low = 5`, `high = 4`. Loop terminates.\n3.  `n_candidate = 5`.\n4.  Check `count_trailing_zeroes(5) == 1`. This is true.\n5.  Print `5`.\n6.  Print `5 6 7 8 9`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity**\n\n*   `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`: The `while` loop runs `log5(n)` times. For `n` up to `500,000`, this is about 8-9 iterations.\n*   Binary Search: The search range is up to `5 * m`. For `m=100,000`, the range is `500,000`. Binary search takes `log(500,000)` iterations, which is about 19 iterations.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(log(m) * log5(m))`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0 # Factorial not defined for negative numbers, or 0 zeroes.\n    \n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    # Legendre's formula: count = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n    # The loop continues as long as n / i is greater than 0, meaning i is still a factor.\n    while n >= i:\n        count += n // i\n        # Multiply i by 5 for the next power of 5 (25, 125, etc.)\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n.
