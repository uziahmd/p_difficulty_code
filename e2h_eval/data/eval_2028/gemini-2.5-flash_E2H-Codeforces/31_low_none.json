Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Vanya's Card Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The goal is to figure out how many extra cards Vanya needs to get the sum of all his cards to zero. I need to write a Python script that takes input, processes it, and spits out the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem constraints. I see `n` is the initial number of cards, and `x` is the maximum absolute value allowed on any card. This also applies to the new cards. The numbers on the existing cards are within `[-x, x]`. Vanya starts with access to every integer between `-x` and `x`.\n\nLet's break it down: I need to start by calculating the `current_sum` of the existing cards. Then, I know the target sum is zero. That means the \"required change\" is `-current_sum`.  To minimize the number of cards, I need to use cards with the largest possible absolute values (either `x` or `-x`).\n\nIf `current_sum` is positive, I need to add negative numbers (value `-x`). If it's negative, I add positive numbers (value `x`). If it's zero, I don't need any extra cards. Simple enough.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n1.  Read `n` and `x`.\n2.  Calculate the `current_sum`.\n3.  Take the absolute value of the sum (`abs_sum`).\n4.  If `abs_sum` is zero, I'm done (answer is zero).\n5.  Otherwise, I need to add cards to cover `abs_sum`. The number of cards is `abs_sum / x`, rounded up. I can do this using integer division and some clever math. I can use `(abs_sum + x - 1) // x` or `math.ceil(abs_sum / x)` to get the rounded-up value.\n\nThat should do it. Now, let's write some code!\n",
