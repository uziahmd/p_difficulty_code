Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic Approach to the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I've got a pretty solid plan brewing in my head. The core of it seems simple enough: I'm given an initial number of candles, 'a', and the number of burnt-out candles, 'b', needed to make a new one. I need to figure out the total hours Vasily can light up the room, acting optimally, of course.\n\nMy first thought is to use a simulation loop. I'll need a few key variables: `total_hours` to keep track of the answer, `current_new_candles` for the candles Vasily currently has, and `burnt_out_candles` to tally the used ones.\n\nThe initial state is straightforward: `total_hours` starts at zero, `current_new_candles` is initialized with the input 'a', and `burnt_out_candles` is zero.\n\nNow, the loop. As long as Vasily has `current_new_candles` to light, the loop continues. Within each iteration, first I need to *use* the current candles. So I'll add `current_new_candles` to `total_hours`, because each one burns for an hour. All of the current candles become burnt-out, so I'll add `current_new_candles` to `burnt_out_candles`. And then `current_new_candles` resets to zero.\n\nNext, I need to see if I can make any new candles from the burnt ones. This is where integer division comes into play: `new_candles_from_burnt = burnt_out_candles // b`. I'll add this `new_candles_from_burnt` to `current_new_candles`. Any remaining burnt candles are kept, so `burnt_out_candles` becomes `burnt_out_candles % b`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `current_new_candles` hits zero, meaning I can't make or light any more candles. I think this strategy should provide an elegant and efficient solution.\n",
