Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The Competitive Programming Challenge: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down.  It's all about string manipulation and modular arithmetic.  The goal is to take an initial string of digits, apply a series of string replacement queries, and then compute the final numerical value of the resulting string, modulo 10^9 + 7.  The string replacement queries look like `di -> ti`, where all instances of digit `di` get replaced by the string `ti`.\n\nThe core of the issue is that the string `s` can explode in size with repeated replacements.  A simple brute-force approach, where I repeatedly substitute strings, would be computationally infeasible.  I need something clever.  Dynamic programming or working backwards seems promising, given the potential for overlapping subproblems and the need for efficiency.\n\nI need to break this down.  First, the constraints are key: string lengths, number of queries, and the sum of lengths for the replacement strings are all capped at 10^5, so I know I have to be careful with my algorithms.  The modulus is 10^9 + 7, a standard value, meaning I'll need to use modular arithmetic throughout.\n\nThe basic calculation of the value of a string is straightforward: it's a weighted sum of the digits, where the weights are powers of 10.  But, when these replacements come into play, things get complicated.  Applying `di -> ti` will not only replace the single digit but also modify the entire structure of the final output. The key lies in understanding how this `di -> ti` query affects not just the digit `di` itself, but the *positions* of all the digits following it.  Each character in the replaced string will shift the remaining string, significantly altering its numerical value.\n\nThinking about it, I'm leaning toward tracking the \"value\" and \"length\" that each initial digit transforms into throughout the sequence of replacements. I can initialize this by setting value to the digit itself and length to 1. Then I would update this value using the queries.  I will need to carefully consider the order of the queries and how each subsequent replacement affects values computed in earlier stages.\n\nLet me try to refine my approach... Instead of directly substituting the string, it might be more efficient to track the effect of each digit.  For each digit `d` (0-9), I'll maintain a `val[d]` (its eventual numerical value) and a `len[d]` (the length of the string it eventually becomes).  Initially, `val[d]` is just the integer value of `d`, and `len[d]` is 1.\n\nThen, when a query `di -> ti` is processed, I'll need to update `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the current values of other digits *that make up* `ti`. Each digit in `ti` will recursively contribute to the final value, weighted by its position in the overall string, and its length to the total. This recursive dependence seems like a natural fit for dynamic programming or, at the very least, memoization.  The example with `2 -> 00` and then `0 -> 7` clarifies the importance of capturing the state of each digit through the process.  The replacement of '2' by '00' needs to incorporate the current '0' value before applying the replacement `0->7`.\n\nAlright, I need to translate this into a Python implementation.  I'll define these `val` and `len` arrays, handle the initial string, process the queries one by one, and then finally compute the final value modulo 10^9 + 7, taking care of the exponential length expansion.  I think this'll be solvable!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate string replacements and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. A direct string replacement approach would be too slow and memory-intensive because the string length can grow exponentially. The key insight is to process the queries in reverse order.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nFor each digit `d` from '0' to '9', we need to keep track of two values:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that `d` eventually transforms into.\n2.  `pow10[d]`: The length (modulo `MOD-1` for exponent, or just the actual length) of the string that `d` eventually transforms into. More precisely, we need `10^L` where `L` is the length.\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself:\n*   `val[d] = d` (as an integer)\n*   `pow10[d] = 10^1 = 10`\n\nNow, consider processing the queries `di -> ti` in reverse order. This is crucial because when we process `di -> ti`, we need to know the final `val` and `pow10` for each digit within `ti`. By processing in reverse, when we handle `di -> ti`, all subsequent queries (which are earlier in the original input) have already been applied to the digits *within* `ti`, so their `val` and `pow10` are already the final ones.\n\nLet's say we are processing a query `di -> ti` (which is `k`-th query in reverse order).\nWe want to update `val[di]` and `pow10[di]` based on `ti`.\nThe new `val[di]` will be the numerical value of `ti` itself, where each character `c` in `ti` is replaced by its current `val[c]`.\nThe new `pow10[di]` will be `10` raised to the total length of `ti`, where each character `c` in `ti` contributes its current `pow10[c]`'s exponent.\n\nLet `current_val = 0` and `current_pow10 = 1` (representing `10^0`) for the new `di`.\nWe iterate through `ti` from right to left (because digits on the right contribute to lower powers of 10). For each character `c` in `ti`:\n1.  `current_val = (val[c] * current_pow10 + current_val) % MOD`\n2.  `current_pow10 = (pow10[c] * current_pow10) % MOD` (This is `10^(length_of_c) * 10^(current_total_length_so_far)` which equals `10^(length_of_c + current_total_length_so_far)`).\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`, `current_val` will be the new `val[di]`, and `current_pow10` will be the new `pow10[di]`.\nWe assign these to `val[di]` and `pow10[di]`.\n\n**Special case: Empty string `ti`**\nIf `ti` is empty, then `di` transforms into an empty string.\n`val[di]` should become `0`.\n`pow10[di]` should become `1` (because `10^0 = 1`).\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse order, we have the final `val[d]` and `pow10[d]` for each digit `d`.\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s`.\nSimilar to how we processed `ti`, we iterate through `s` from right to left.\nLet `final_ans = 0` and `multiplier = 1` (representing `10^0`).\nFor each character `c` in `s` (from right to left):\n1.  `final_ans = (val[c] * multiplier + final_ans) % MOD`\n2.  `multiplier = (pow10[c] * multiplier) % MOD`\n\nThe `final_ans` will be the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description): `222`, `2->0`, `0->7`**\n\nInitial state:\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`pow10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\nQueries (original order):\n1. `2 -> 0`\n2. `0 -> 7`\n\nQueries (reverse order):\n1. `0 -> 7`\n   *   `di = '0'`, `ti = '7'`\n   *   `current_val = 0`, `current_pow10 = 1`\n   *   Iterate `ti` (only '7'):\n      *   `c = '7'`: `val['7'] = 7`, `pow10['7'] = 10`\n      *   `current_val = (7 * 1 + 0) % MOD = 7`\n      *   `current_pow10 = (10 * 1) % MOD = 10`\n   *   Update `val['0'] = 7`, `pow10['0'] = 10`\n   *   State after this query:\n      `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n      `pow10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\n2. `2 -> 0`\n   *   `di = '2'`, `ti = '0'`\n   *   `current_val = 0`, `current_pow10 = 1`\n   *   Iterate `ti` (only '0'):\n      *   `c = '0'`: `val['0'] = 7`, `pow10['0'] = 10`\n      *   `current_val = (7 * 1 + 0) % MOD = 7`\n      *   `current_pow10 = (10 * 1) % MOD = 10`\n   *   Update `val['2'] = 7`, `pow10['2'] = 10`\n   *   State after this query:\n      `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n      `pow10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\nFinal calculation for `s = \"222\"`:\n`final_ans = 0`, `multiplier = 1`\n1.  `c = '2'` (rightmost): `val['2'] = 7`, `pow10['2'] = 10`\n    *   `final_ans = (7 * 1 + 0) % MOD = 7`\n    *   `multiplier = (10 * 1) % MOD = 10`\n2.  `c = '2'` (middle): `val['2'] = 7`, `pow10['2'] = 10`\n    *   `final_ans = (7 * 10 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n    *   `multiplier = (10 * 10) % MOD = 100`\n3.  `c = '2'` (leftmost): `val['2'] = 7`, `pow10['2'] = 10`\n    *   `final_ans = (7 * 100 + 77) % MOD = 777`\n    *   `multiplier = (10 * 100) % MOD = 1000`\n\nResult: `777`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the \"leading zeros\" note because the `val[d]` for '0' is `0` and `pow10[d]` for '0' is `10`. If '0' maps to \"00\", its `val` will be `0` and `pow10` will be `100`. The numerical value is correctly computed regardless of leading zeros in the intermediate strings. The final result will implicitly ignore leading zeros unless the entire string evaluates to 0 (e.g., \"0\", \"00\", \"007\" all evaluate to 0, 0, 7 respectively).\n\nThe maximum sum of lengths of `ti` is 10^5. The length of `s` is 10^5. Each character in `ti` and `s` is processed a constant number of times. This makes the total time complexity `O(|s| + sum(|ti|))`, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t_str = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # Initialize val[d] and pow10[d] for each digit d\n    # val[d]: the numerical value of the string that d transforms into\n    # pow10[d]: 10 raised to the power of the length of the string that d transforms into\n    # Both are modulo MOD\n    \n    # Use lists for digits 0-9 for easy indexing\n    # val_map[digit_int]\n    # pow10_map[digit_int]\n\n    val_map = [i for i in range(10)]  # Initial value of digit i is i\n    pow10_map = [10 for _ in range(10)] # Initial length of digit i is 1, so 10^1 = 10\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n\n        if not t_str: # If replacement string is empty\n            val_map[d_int] = 0\n            pow10_map[d_int] = 1 # 10^0 = 1 for empty string\n        else:\n            current_val = 0\n            current_pow10 = 1 # Represents 10^0 for the initial rightmost position\n\n            # Iterate through t_str from right to left\n            for char_t in reversed(t_str):\n                char_t_int = int(char_t)\n                \n                # Add the value of char_t's transformation, shifted by current_pow10\n                current_val = (val_map[char_t_int] * current_pow10 + current_val) % MOD\n                \n                # Update current_pow10 by multiplying with 10^(length of char_t's transformation)\n                current_pow10 = (pow10_map[char_t_int] * current_pow10) % MOD\n            \n            val_map[d_int] = current_val\n            pow10_map[d_int] = current_pow10\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    multiplier = 1 # Represents 10^0 for the initial rightmost position\n\n    # Iterate through the initial string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        char_s_int = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Add the value of char_s's transformation, shifted by multiplier\n        final_ans = (val_map[char_s_int] * multiplier + final_ans) % MOD\n        \n        # Update multiplier by multiplying with 10^(length of char_s's transformation)\n        multiplier = (pow10_map[char_s_int] * multiplier) % MOD\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
