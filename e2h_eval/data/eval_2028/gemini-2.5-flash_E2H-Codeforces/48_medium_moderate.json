            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Base Conversion Script: My Thinking Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to convert numbers from one base to another. The input will give me the source base (`a`), the target base (`b`), and the number to convert (`c`). The target base can be either an integer or the character 'R' for Roman numerals.\n\nLet's break this down into manageable chunks. First, I need to read the input - `a`, `b`, and `c`. The tricky part here is handling `b` because it could be a string or an integer. Then, the number `c` needs to be converted to decimal (base 10) from whatever base `a` is.  After that, I'll convert the decimal value to the target base `b`. If `b` is an integer, that’s standard base conversion. If `b` is 'R', I'll need a special Roman numeral conversion.\n\nConverting from any base to decimal is straightforward.  I can iterate through the input string `c`, and use the standard formula: `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit_value`. I'll need to write a helper function to convert the characters '0'–'9' and 'A'–'Z' to their corresponding integer values, keeping in mind that 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, and so on.\n\nConverting from decimal to an integer base is also standard. I’ll use repeated division and remainders.  The remainders will be the digits in the new base, but I need to convert those integer remainders back to characters. For digits 10 and above, 'A', 'B', etc. need to be used.\n\nThe Roman numeral conversion is a bit different. I'll need a lookup table (a dictionary or list of tuples) that maps Roman symbols to their values (e.g., 'M' to 1000, 'CM' to 900, 'D' to 500, etc.) in descending order. The iterative and subtractive principles are crucial, so the table needs to include the subtractive pairs (like 'IV', 'IX', 'XL', etc.) placed before their corresponding additive counterparts. To convert a decimal number to Roman numerals, I'll go through this lookup table and iteratively subtract the largest possible values until the number becomes zero.\n\nThere are some constraints. The length of the input string can be large, but the decimal value should not exceed 10^15 for integer bases and 3000 for Roman numerals. I'll make sure to account for that. Also, the base is up to 25.\nI’ll write helper functions to make the code cleaner. One to convert digit characters to integer values, one to convert integer values back to digit characters (handles 0-9 and A-Z), and the core base conversion functions. I need to make sure I'm handling all the corner cases properly.\n\nI'll start with the main logic, reading the input, calling the appropriate conversion functions, and then print the output. I'll test the code with the given examples and some edge cases, like the maximum possible input length, base 2, and the largest values, to make sure it's working correctly and efficiently. I will make sure the functions are well-commented for readability.\n\nOkay, I've got a solid plan and I'm ready to write the Python code. I am confident I'm covering all bases.\n",
