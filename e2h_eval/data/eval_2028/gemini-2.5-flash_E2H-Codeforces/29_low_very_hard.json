Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing a Tricky String Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face. It's about string manipulation, specifically replacing digits within a string, and then calculating a massive number modulo 10^9 + 7. The problem statement itself seems straightforward, but I can already feel the complexity lurking beneath the surface.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core mechanics. I start with an initial string `s` made up of digits. Then, I get a series of queries, each of the form \"di -> ti\". This means, in my original string, I replace every occurrence of the digit `di` with the string `ti`. Finally, I need to treat the resulting string as a decimal number, handle leading zeros, and compute its value modulo 10^9 + 7. Simple, right?\n\nBut then I glance at the constraints. The input string and the number of queries can be up to 10^5 in length. The total length of all the replacement strings can also go up to 10^5. That's when the alarm bells start ringing. If I'm not careful, my intermediate strings could explode in size.\n\nMy initial thought was to simply apply the queries sequentially, constructing the modified string at each step. But, I quickly realize that this approach is going to be incredibly inefficient. The string length can grow exponentially! So, storing the entire, potentially massive, string is completely out of the question. I need to find a more elegant solution.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the order in which the queries are applied. Each query's effect depends on the current state of the string `s`. This means I can't just process each digit independently.  That leads me to consider either working backwards, or maybe utilizing some form of dynamic programming to track the transformations. \n\nMy initial idea about directly transforming each digit with its query is incorrect. I must substitute each occurrence of `di` literally with the contents of `ti`, even if `ti` contains characters that will themselves be altered by later queries. This means I need to keep the literal replacement in mind at each step.\n\nOkay, I need to find a way to model the final number effectively without generating that monstrous final string. How do I represent these transformations? I'm thinking about how each digit ultimately transforms into some final \"string value\". I know I can't keep track of the entire string, so I need a way to encode the number in a way that allows me to compute modulo, and I'll need some kind of way to keep track of length. Since the problem requires me to calculate the value modulo `10^9 + 7`, I have to make sure to do so at each step. So I'm thinking `S_final = Sum(digit * 10^power)`. But how can I track that power? This feels tricky.\n\nI need to come back to this later. For now, the focus is on a clever way to handle the growing string and modular arithmetic. Maybe I need to look into matrix exponentiation. That thought gives me hope. Let's see...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the value of a string of digits, after several replacement operations, modulo 10^9 + 7. The string can become extremely long, so we cannot explicitly construct it.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the transformations:\n1.  Each digit `d` (0-9) in the original string `s` will eventually be replaced by some string `T_d`.\n2.  The value of a string `XYZ` (where X, Y, Z are digits) is `Value(X) * 10^2 + Value(Y) * 10^1 + Value(Z) * 10^0`.\n3.  If `X` is replaced by `T_X`, `Y` by `T_Y`, `Z` by `T_Z`, the new string is `T_X T_Y T_Z`. Its value is `Value(T_X) * 10^(len(T_Y) + len(T_Z)) + Value(T_Y) * 10^(len(T_Z)) + Value(T_Z)`.\n\nThis structure suggests that for each digit `d` (0-9), we need to track two things:\n*   `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n*   `length[d]`: The length of the string that `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD-1` (because lengths are used as exponents for powers of 10).\n\nThe queries are processed in order. If we process them from first to last, the `ti` in `di -> ti` refers to a literal string. For example, if `s = 123` and `2 -> 00`, `s` becomes `1003`. If then `0 -> 7`, `s` becomes `1773`. This means the `0`s that came from `2` are now affected. This is the standard interpretation of string replacement.\n\nHowever, since we cannot build the string explicitly, we need a different approach. Notice that the final value depends on the initial string `s` and the *final* transformation rules for each digit. If we know that digit `0` becomes `T_0`, `1` becomes `T_1`, ..., `9` becomes `T_9`, then we can compute the value of the initial string `s` by iterating through `s` from left to right, applying these final transformations.\n\nConsider working *backwards* through the queries.\nLet `val[d]` and `length[d]` be the current transformation for digit `d`.\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself. So:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\nNow, process the queries in reverse order. Suppose the current query is `di -> ti`. This query *precedes* all queries we have already processed (which were originally after it).\nWhen we encounter `di -> ti` in reverse:\nThis means that any `di` that existed *before* this query (and thus before all subsequent queries) will be replaced by `ti`. The string `ti` itself might contain digits `c` that would have been transformed by subsequent queries (which we have already processed in our reverse pass).\nSo, if `di` is replaced by `ti`, the new `val[di]` and `length[di]` should be calculated based on `ti` and the *current* `val[c]` and `length[c]` for each digit `c` in `ti`.\n\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_length_di = 0`.\nIterate through `char` in `ti` from left to right:\n*   `char_digit = int(char)`\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[char_digit], MOD) + val[char_digit]) % MOD`\n*   `new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[char_digit]) % (MOD - 1)` (Lengths are exponents, so modulo `MOD-1` by Fermat's Little Theorem)\n\nAfter calculating `new_val_di` and `new_length_di`, update `val[di]` and `length[di]` with these new values.\nNote that we only update `val[di]` and `length[di]`. The other `val[j]` and `length[j]` for `j != di` remain unchanged because this query `di -> ti` only affects occurrences of `di`.\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will represent the final transformation for each digit `d` from the original string `s`.\n\nFinally, calculate the value of the initial string `s` using these final `val` and `length` arrays:\n`final_ans = 0`\n`current_power_of_10_multiplier = 1` (This will be `10^(total_length_of_suffix_so_far)`)\n\nIterate through the initial string `s` from right to left (to correctly handle powers of 10):\n*   `digit = int(s[i])`\n*   `final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit] * current_power_of_10_multiplier) % MOD`\n*   `current_power_of_10_multiplier = (current_power_of_10_multiplier * pow(10, length[digit], MOD)) % MOD`\n\nEdge cases:\n*   Empty string `ti`: If `ti` is empty, `new_val_di` will be 0 and `new_length_di` will be 0. This is correct.\n*   Leading zeros: The problem states \"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\" Our approach naturally handles this by calculating the value based on the full expanded string. If `s` becomes \"007\", its value is 7. If `s` becomes \"0\", its value is 0. If `s` becomes empty, its value is 0. Our `val` and `length` calculations will correctly yield 0 for an empty string.\n\n**Example walkthrough (Sample 3):**\n`s = \"222\"`\n`n = 2`\nQueries:\n1. `2 -> 0`\n2. `0 -> 7`\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n`MOD_EXP = 1000000006`\n\nInitial state (before any queries):\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nProcess queries in reverse:\n\n**Query 2 (original order): `0 -> 7`**\nThis is the last query. `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`.\nCalculate `new_val_0` and `new_length_0` based on `ti = \"7\"` and current `val`, `length` states.\n`char = '7'`, `char_digit = 7`.\n`new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, length[7], MOD) + val[7]) % MOD = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n`new_length_0 = (0 + length[7]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\nUpdate `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\nCurrent state:\n`val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Query 1 (original order): `2 -> 0`**\nThis is the first query. `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`.\nCalculate `new_val_2` and `new_length_2` based on `ti = \"0\"` and current `val`, `length` states.\n`char = '0'`, `char_digit = 0`.\n`new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n`new_length_2 = (0 + length[0]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\nUpdate `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\nCurrent state (final transformations):\n`val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nNow, process initial string `s = \"222\"` from right to left.\n`final_ans = 0`\n`current_power_of_10_multiplier = 1`\n\n`i = 2 (s[2] = '2')`:\n`digit = 2`\n`final_ans = (0 + val[2] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n`current_power_of_10_multiplier = (1 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * 10^1) % MOD = 10`\n\n`i = 1 (s[1] = '2')`:\n`digit = 2`\n`final_ans = (7 + val[2] * 10) % MOD = (7 + 7 * 10) % MOD = (7 + 70) % MOD = 77`\n`current_power_of_10_multiplier = (10 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) % MOD = (10 * 10^1) % MOD = 100`\n\n`i = 0 (s[0] = '2')`:\n`digit = 2`\n`final_ans = (77 + val[2] * 100) % MOD = (77 + 7 * 100) % MOD = (77 + 700) % MOD = 777`\n`current_power_of_10_multiplier = (100 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) % MOD = (100 * 10^1) % MOD = 1000`\n\nFinal answer: `777`.
