    "thought": "**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:** I've got this \"Gluttony\" problem, and I need to write a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, I'm given an array 'a' of distinct integers, and I need to create a permutation 'b' of that array such that the sums of all non-empty, non-full subsets of 'a' are different from the sums of the corresponding subsets in 'b'. The constraints are pretty tight – the array size 'n' is up to 22, and the elements can be up to 10^9.\n\nThe core challenge, of course, is that condition. For any subset, the sum of values from 'a' must be different from the sum of the corresponding values in 'b'.  It's immediately clear that since 'b' is just a reordering of 'a', they contain the same values. I'm going to switch to 0-based indexing for coding.\n\nMy initial instinct is to consider a cyclic shift. Let's sort 'a' first – that usually helps with these kinds of problems. Now, the idea is to form 'b' by taking a cyclic shift of the sorted 'a'.  So, if I have 'a' sorted as `[a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`, then 'b' could be `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`. I think I'll try this as a potential solution.\n\nLet's test this with the simplest case. If `n=2` and I have `a = [a_0, a_1]` with `a_0 < a_1`, then my cyclic shift gives me `b = [a_1, a_0]`. For the subset {0}, a sum is a_0, b sum is a_1; for the subset {1}, the a sum is a_1, b sum is a_0. Both sums are distinct, which fits the problem's condition.\n\nThis cyclic shift seems promising.  I'll start coding a Python script to try this out. If it works, great! If not, I'll need to rethink my approach.  I'll also keep in mind that I might have to handle cases where no such 'b' exists and print \"-1.\"  Let's get started.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a_i` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b_i` for `i` in `S`. The size of the array `n` is small, up to 22.\n\nLet's denote the sum of elements at indices in `S` for array `x` as `sum(x, S)`. The condition is `sum(a, S) != sum(b, S)` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nConsider sorting the input array `a` first. Let the sorted array be `a'_0, a'_1, ..., a'_{n-1}`.\nA common strategy for problems involving permutations is to try a simple permutation, such as a cyclic shift.\nLet's try `b_i = a'_{(i+1) % n}`. This means `b` is `[a'_1, a'_2, ..., a'_{n-1}, a'_0]`.\n\nLet's analyze this choice for `b`.\nFor any subset `S`, `sum(b, S) = sum_{i in S} a'_{(i+1) % n}`.\n`sum(a', S) = sum_{i in S} a'_i`.\nWe need `sum_{i in S} a'_i != sum_{i in S} a'_{(i+1) % n}` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nLet `c_i = a'_i - a'_{(i+1) % n}`.\nThen `sum(a', S) - sum(b, S) = sum_{i in S} (a'_i - a'_{(i+1) % n}) = sum_{i in S} c_i`.\nThe condition `sum(a', S) != sum(b, S)` is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0`.\n\nThe values `c_i` are:\n`c_0 = a'_0 - a'_1`\n`c_1 = a'_1 - a'_2`\n...\n`c_{n-2} = a'_{n-2} - a'_{n-1}`\n`c_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} - a'_0`\n\nSince `a` contains distinct integers and we sorted it, `a'_0 < a'_1 < ... < a'_{n-1}`.\nThis implies:\n`c_0 < 0`\n`c_1 < 0`\n...\n`c_{n-2} < 0`\n`c_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} - a'_0 > 0`\n\nSo, `n-1` of the `c_i` values are negative, and one `c_i` (`c_{n-1}`) is positive.\nLet's check the sum of all `c_i`:\n`sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i = (a'_0 - a'_1) + (a'_1 - a'_2) + ... + (a'_{n-2} - a'_{n-1}) + (a'_{n-1} - a'_0) = 0`.\nThis is a telescoping sum.\n\nNow we need to ensure that `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for `0 < |S| < n`.\nConsider a subset `S`.\nIf `S` does not contain `n-1` (the index corresponding to `c_{n-1}`), then all `c_i` for `i in S` are negative. Since `c_i < 0` for `i < n-1`, `sum_{i in S} c_i` will be a sum of negative numbers, which must be negative and thus not zero.\nSo, if `n-1 not in S`, the condition holds.\n\nWhat if `n-1 in S`?\nLet `S_0 = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`.\nThen `sum_{i in S} c_i = c_{n-1} + sum_{i in S_0} c_i`.\nWe know `c_{n-1} > 0`.\nAnd `sum_{i in S_0} c_i` is a sum of zero or more negative numbers. So `sum_{i in S_0} c_i <= 0`.\nFor `sum_{i in S} c_i` to be zero, we would need `c_{n-1} = -sum_{i in S_0} c_i`.\nThis means `a'_{n-1} - a'_0 = sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{(i+1)%n} - a'_i)`.\nThis is a specific condition. Can it be zero?\n\nThe values `a_i` are distinct. If `n=1`, the problem states `0 < k < n`, so no subsets exist. The problem constraints are `1 <= n <= 22`. For `n=1`, there are no non-empty proper subsets, so any `b` (e.g., `a` itself) would be valid. The problem statement implies `n > 1` by `0 < k < n`. If `n=1`, the loop `for x in a_indexed` will not run, `b` will be empty, which is not correct. Let's assume `n > 1` for the logic. If `n=1`, the input `a` is `[a_0]`, output `[a_0]`.\n\nExample: `n=4`, `a = [1, 10, 100, 1000]` (already sorted).\n`a'_0=1, a'_1=10, a'_2=100, a'_3=1000`.\n`b = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\n`c_0 = 1 - 10 = -9`\n`c_1 = 10 - 100 = -90`\n`c_2 = 100 - 1000 = -900`\n`c_3 = 1000 - 1 = 999`\n`sum(c) = -9 - 90 - 900 + 999 = 0`.\n\nConsider `S = {0, 1, 2}`. `n-1 = 3` is not in `S`. `sum_{i in S} c_i = -9 - 90 - 900 = -999 != 0`.\nConsider `S = {3}`. `sum_{i in S} c_i = c_3 = 999 != 0`.\nConsider `S = {0, 3}`. `sum_{i in S} c_i = c_0 + c_3 = -9 + 999 = 990 != 0`.\nConsider `S = {0, 1, 3}`. `sum_{i in S} c_i = c_0 + c_1 + c_3 = -9 - 90 + 999 = 900 != 0`.\n\nIs it always true that `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for `0 < |S| < n`?\nThe problem is known as the \"Subset Sum Difference\" problem or a variation of it. The specific construction `b_i = a'_{(i+1)%n}` (a cyclic shift of the sorted array) is a standard solution for this type of problem.\nIt works because the `c_i` values are `n-1` negative values and one large positive value.\nFor `sum_{i in S} c_i = 0`, we need `c_{n-1} = -sum_{i in S_0} c_i`.\nSince `c_i` for `i < n-1` are `a'_i - a'_{i+1}`, they are all negative.\n`c_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} - a'_0`.\n`sum_{i in S_0} c_i = sum_{i in S_0} (a'_i - a'_{i+1})`.\nThe condition `c_{n-1} = -sum_{i in S_0} c_i` means `a'_{n-1} - a'_0 = sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)`.\nThe sum `sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)` is a sum of positive differences between adjacent elements in the sorted array.\n`a'_{i+1} - a'_i > 0` for all `i`.\nThis sum `sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)` is a \"gap sum\".\nThe total gap `a'_{n-1} - a'_0` is `sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)`.\nFor `sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)` to be equal to `a'_{n-1} - a'_0`, `S_0` must contain all indices from `0` to `n-2`.\nBut if `S_0 = \\{0, 1, ..., n-2\\}`, then `S = \\{0, 1, ..., n-2, n-1\\}`, which is the full set of indices. The problem statement excludes the full set of indices (`k < n`).\nSo, `sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)` can only be strictly less than `a'_{n-1} - a'_0` if `S_0` is a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nTherefore, `sum_{i in S_0} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)` can never be equal to `a'_{n-1} - a'_0` unless `S_0` contains all indices `0` to `n-2`.\nSince `S` is a proper subset (`|S| < n`), `S_0` cannot contain all indices `0` to `n-2` if `n-1 in S`.\nThis confirms that `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nThus, a cyclic shift of the sorted array `a` always works.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create pairs `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n   This is important because the output `b` must be a permutation of `a`, but `b_i` refers to the element that takes the place of `a_i` in the original array. The problem statement uses 1-based indices `x_i`, but let's stick to 0-based. If `a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`, we want `b = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]` where `b_i` is the value placed at index `i`.\n4. Sort these pairs based on `value`. Let the sorted pairs be `(a'_0, idx'_0), (a'_1, idx'_1), ..., (a'_{n-1}, idx'_{n-1})`.\n   Here, `a'_j` is the `j`-th smallest value, and `idx'_j` is its original index in `a`.\n5. Construct the `b` array. The value `a'_j` should be placed at the original index `idx'_{j-1}` (with `j-1` taken modulo `n`).\n   So, `b[idx'_j]` should be `a'_{(j+1)%n}`.\n   Initialize an array `b_result` of size `n`.\n   For `j` from `0` to `n-1`:\n     `original_index_of_a_prime_j = idx'_j`\n     `value_to_place_at_this_index = a'_{(j+1)%n}`\n     `b_result[original_index_of_a_prime_j] = value_to_place_at_this_index`\n6. Print the elements of `b_result` space-separated.\n\n**Edge Case `n=1`:**\nThe problem statement says `0 < k < n`. If `n=1`, there are no `k` satisfying this condition. So, any permutation works. The only permutation is `a` itself.\nMy logic `b_result[idx'_j] = a'_{(j+1)%n}` for `n=1`:\n`a = [a_0]`. Sorted `a_indexed = [(a_0, 0)]`.\n`j=0`: `idx'_0 = 0`, `a'_0 = a_0`.\n`b_result[idx'_0] = a'_{(0+1)%1} = a'_0`.\nSo `b_result[0] = a_0`. This correctly produces `[a_0]`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 2`\n`a = [1, 2]`\nPairs `(value, original_index)`: `[(1, 0), (2, 1)]`\nSorted pairs (already sorted): `[(1, 0), (2, 1)]`\n`a'_0 = 1, idx'_0 = 0`\n`a'_1 = 2, idx'_1 = 1`\n\nConstruct `b_result`:\n`j=0`: `original_index_of_a_prime_0 = idx'_0 = 0`.\n       `value_to_place = a'_{(0+1)%2} = a'_1 = 2`.\n       `b_result[0] = 2`.\n`j=1`: `original_index_of_a_prime_1 = idx'_1 = 1`.\n       `value_to_place = a'_{(1+1)%2} = a'_0 = 1`.\n       `b_result[1] = 1`.\n`b_result = [2, 1]`. Output: `2 1`. This matches the example.\n\n**Example 2:**\n`n = 4`\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\nPairs `(value, original_index)`: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\nSorted pairs: `[(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n`a'_0 = 1, idx'_0 = 3`\n`a'_1 = 10, idx'_1 = 2`\n`a'_2 = 100, idx'_2 = 1`\n`a'_3 = 1000, idx'_3 = 0`\n\nConstruct `b_result`:\n`j=0`: `idx'_0 = 3`. `value_to_place = a'_{(0+1)%4} = a'_1 = 10`. `b_result[3] = 10`.\n`j=1`: `idx'_1 = 2`. `value_to_place = a'_{(1+1)%4} = a'_2 = 100`. `b_result[2] = 100`.\n`j=2`: `idx'_2 = 1`. `value_to_place = a'_{(2+1)%4} = a'_3 = 1000`. `b_result[1] = 1000`.\n`j=3`: `idx'_3 = 0`. `value_to_place = a'_{(3+1)%4} = a'_0 = 1`. `b_result[0] = 1`.\n`b_result = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. Output: `1 1000 100 10`. This matches the example.\n\nThe solution seems robust. The time complexity will be dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 22`, this is extremely fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Create pairs of (value, original_index)\n    a_indexed = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        a_indexed.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort these pairs based on value\n    # a_indexed_sorted will be a list of (value, original_index) tuples,\n    # sorted by value.\n    # a_indexed_sorted[j][0] is a'_j (j-th smallest value)\n    # a_indexed_sorted[j][1] is idx'_j (original index of a'_j)\n    a_indexed_sorted = sorted(a_indexed)\n\n    # Initialize the result array b\n    b_result = [0] * n\n\n    # Construct b such that b[original_index_of_a'_j] = a'_{(j+1)%n}\n    # This means the element that was originally at index idx'_j (which had value a'_j)\n    # will now hold the value a'_{(j+1)%n} in the permutation b.\n    for j in range(n):\n        original_index_of_current_element = a_indexed_sorted[j][1]\n        \n        # The value to place at this original index is the (j+1)-th smallest value\n        # (cyclically shifted)\n        value_to_place = a_indexed_sorted[(j + 1) % n][0]\n        \n        b_result[original_index_of_current_element] = value_to_place\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(*(b_result))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
