            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tokitsukaze's Tile Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge is to figure out the fewest extra tiles I need to draw to get a winning hand – that is, to form a *mentsu*. A mentsu is either a *koutsu* (three identical tiles) or a *shuntsu* (three sequential tiles of the same suit). I start with three tiles and I have to decide if I need zero, one, or two more.\n\nFirst, I need a good way to represent these tiles. I'll use tuples: `(number, suit)`. So \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. Next, I'll parse the input, turning those strings into this tuple format.\n\nThe most straightforward way is to check the simplest case: can I make a mentsu with my starting three? I need a function that looks at three tiles. If the three tiles are identical, I've got a *koutsu*, so I'm done. Otherwise, are they the same suit and sequential? If yes, it's a *shuntsu*, and again, I'm done. I'll write that up as the `check_mentsu_list` function.\n\nIf I can't get a mentsu with my three original tiles, the next step is to consider drawing one extra tile. The key here is to find out if there's any way that I can draw *one* tile to make a mentsu with *two* of my existing tiles. This means examining all possible pairs of tiles from my initial set.\n\nIf any two of my starting tiles are identical, then drawing a tile that matches is an instant koutsu. So that's the first condition. If the two tiles have the same suit, I need to see if they're close enough to form a shuntsu. If their numbers differ by one, drawing the missing tile makes a shuntsu. If the numbers differ by two, I can draw the tile that falls between them.\n\nIf, even after checking all pairs with all of the drawing strategies, drawing one tile can't form a mentsu, then I *must* need to draw two extra tiles. I am confident that I can always make a mentsu if I draw two tiles. So, if the answer is not 0 or 1, then the minimum number of extra draws will always be 2.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles she wants, and the supply is infinite.\n\nWe need to determine if she can win with 0, 1, or 2 draws.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile is represented as a `(number, suit)` tuple (e.g., \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`).\n\n**1. Check for 0 Draws:**\nShe needs 0 draws if her initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\nTo check this, we define a helper function `check_mentsu_list(three_tiles)`:\n*   **Koutsu:** Check if all three tiles are identical (e.g., `t1 == t2 == t3`).\n*   **Shuntsu:** Check if all three tiles are of the same suit AND their numbers are sequential (e.g., `1s, 2s, 3s` or `5s, 6s, 7s`). To handle cases like `5s, 7s, 6s`, we sort the tiles by number within the same suit before checking for sequential order.\n\nIf `check_mentsu_list([t1, t2, t3])` returns `True`, then the answer is 0.\n\n**2. Check for 1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if she can form a mentsu by drawing one extra tile. This means she will have 4 tiles in total. We need to determine if any three tiles from this new set of 4 can form a mentsu.\nThis is equivalent to checking if any *two* of her initial tiles (`t_a`, `t_b`) can be combined with *one* drawn tile (`t_new`) to form a mentsu.\n\nWe iterate through all possible pairs of her initial tiles: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`. For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n*   **Koutsu possibility:** If `t_a` is identical to `t_b` (e.g., `2m, 2m`), she can draw another `t_a` (i.e., `2m`) to form a koutsu `[t_a, t_a, t_a]`. In this case, 1 draw is sufficient.\n*   **Shuntsu possibility:** If `t_a` and `t_b` are of the same suit (e.g., `2s, 3s` or `2s, 4s`):\n    *   Let their numbers be `n_a` and `n_b`.\n    *   If `abs(n_a - n_b) == 1` (e.g., `2s, 3s`): She needs to draw either `n_a-1` (e.g., `1s`) or `n_b+1` (e.g., `4s`). At least one of these is always possible since numbers are 1-9. (e.g., for `1s, 2s`, draw `3s`; for `8s, 9s`, draw `7s`).\n    *   If `abs(n_a - n_b) == 2` (e.g., `2s, 4s`): She needs to draw the middle number `min(n_a, n_b)+1` (e.g., `3s`). This is always possible.\n    *   Combining these, if `abs(n_a - n_b) <= 2` and they are of the same suit, she can form a shuntsu with 1 draw.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair of initial tiles, then the answer is 1.\n\n**3. Check for 2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws are always sufficient.\nWith 2 draws, she will have `3 + 2 = 5` tiles in her hand. Since she can draw any tiles she wants, she can always choose to draw two tiles identical to one of her existing tiles. For example, if she has `t1, t2, t3`, she can draw `t1` and `t1`. Her hand will then be `[t1, t2, t3, t1, t1]`, which contains the koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`. Thus, 2 draws are always enough.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n1.  Read the three tile strings.\n2.  Parse them into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples.\n3.  Call `check_mentsu_list` on the initial three tiles. If `True`, print `0` and exit.\n4.  Iterate through all three pairs of initial tiles. For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n    *   If `t_a == t_b`, print `1` and exit.\n    *   If `t_a[1] == t_b[1]` (same suit) and `abs(t_a[0] - t_b[0]) <= 2`, print `1` and exit.\n5.  If the program has not exited yet, it means 0 or 1 draw is not enough. Print `2`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s_tiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for s in s_tiles:\n        tiles.append((int(s[0]), s[1]))\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a mentsu\n    def check_mentsu_list(three_tiles):\n        # Sort to handle sequences like [5s, 7s, 6s] and ensure consistent order\n        # Sort by suit then by number\n        sorted_tiles = sorted(three_tiles, key=lambda t: (t[1], t[0]))\n        t1, t2, t3 = sorted_tiles\n\n        # Koutsu check: three identical tiles\n        if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n            return True\n\n        # Shuntsu check: three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit\n        if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]: # All same suit\n            if t1[0] + 1 == t2[0] and t2[0] + 1 == t3[0]: # Sequential numbers\n                return True\n        \n        return False\n\n    # --- 0 Draws ---\n    # Check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu\n    if check_mentsu_list(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- 1 Draw ---\n    # Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n    # This means two of the current tiles can form a pair that needs one more tile.\n    \n    found_1_draw = False\n    # Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the initial three\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n            t_a = tiles[i]\n            t_b = tiles[j]\n\n            # Koutsu possibility: if two tiles are identical, draw a third identical one\n            if t_a == t_b:\n                found_1_draw = True\n                break \n            \n            # Shuntsu possibility: if two tiles are of the same suit\n            if t_a[1] == t_b[1]: # Same suit\n                n_a = t_a[0]\n                n_b = t_b[0]\n                \n                # If numbers are 1 apart (e.g., 2s, 3s), need 1s or 4s.
