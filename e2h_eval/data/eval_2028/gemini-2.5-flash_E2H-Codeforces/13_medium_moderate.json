For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Refined Approach to Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with writing a Python script to classify musical triads as major, minor, or strange. After a good, thorough look at the problem, here's my plan:\n\nFirst, I need to map the musical notes (C, C#, D, etc.) to numerical values from 0 to 11. I'll use a dictionary for this, which will make the semitone calculations a lot easier.  I'll then read in the input, which is a single line with three space-separated notes, and convert these note strings to their numerical equivalents using the dictionary.\n\nNext, I'll need to calculate the semitone distances between the notes. The problem gives precise definitions for major and minor triads based on the distances between the notes when they are correctly ordered: 4 and 3 semitones for major, and 3 and 4 semitones for minor. To handle this, I'll sort the numerical values of the notes. Since the notes in a triad are unordered, I need to consider all possible arrangements of the notes to determine if *any* arrangement matches the major or minor triad definition.  Since the order matters when calculating distances, I'll consider three permutations.\n\nBecause the notes are defined as an unordered set, I'll calculate the distances for *all* cyclic permutations of the sorted notes. Then, I'll simply check to see if any of these orderings result in the correct semitone distances to be considered a major or minor triad.  If not, it's \"strange\".  I'll calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale (i.e., C to B is a 11-semitone distance, and the difference should be between 0 and 11, inclusive).\n\nThis approach should be efficient since it's a fixed number of notes and permutations. Let's make it happen.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given the 12 musical notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H) which repeat cyclically. The distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone.\n\nA **major triad** consists of three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones.\nA **minor triad** consists of three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 3 semitones, and the distance between Y and Z is 4 semitones.\nThe problem states that the notes are an *unordered set*, meaning we need to find if *any* ordering of the given three notes fits the major or minor pattern.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Integers**: Assign a unique integer from 0 to 11 to each note. This allows us to easily calculate distances using modulo arithmetic.\n    *   C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5, F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11.\n\n2.  **Convert Input to Numerical Values**: Read the three input notes and convert them to their corresponding integer values.\n\n3.  **Sort the Notes**: Sort the three numerical note values. Let these sorted notes be `n1, n2, n3`. Sorting helps in systematically checking all possible cyclic arrangements.\n\n4.  **Check Cyclic Permutations**: Since the notes form an unordered set, any of the three notes can be the \"root\" (X) of the chord. We need to check three cyclic permutations of the sorted notes to see if they fit the major or minor pattern:\n    *   **Permutation 1**: (X, Y, Z) = (`n1`, `n2`, `n3`).\n        *   Calculate `d1 = (n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` (distance from `n1` to `n2`).\n        *   Calculate `d2 = (n3 - n2 + 12) % 12` (distance from `n2` to `n3`).\n    *   **Permutation 2**: (X, Y, Z) = (`n2`, `n3`, `n1`). Here, `n1` is considered an octave higher than its base value.\n        *   Calculate `d1 = (n3 - n2 + 12) % 12` (distance from `n2` to `n3`).\n        *   Calculate `d2 = (n1 - n3 + 12) % 12` (distance from `n3` to `n1` cyclically).\n    *   **Permutation 3**: (X, Y, Z) = (`n3`, `n1`, `n2`). Here, `n1` and `n2` are considered an octave higher.\n        *   Calculate `d1 = (n1 - n3 + 12) % 12` (distance from `n3` to `n1` cyclically).\n        *   Calculate `d2 = (n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` (distance from `n1` to `n2` cyclically).\n\n5.  **Classify**: For each permutation, check the calculated `(d1, d2)` pair:\n    *   If `(d1, d2)` is `(4, 3)`, the chord is major.\n    *   If `(d1, d2)` is `(3, 4)`, the chord is minor.\n    The problem guarantees that the answer will be unambiguous, so a chord won't be both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n6.  **Output**: If any permutation matches a major pattern, print \"major\". If any matches a minor pattern (and not major), print \"minor\". Otherwise, print \"strange\".\n\nExample Walkthrough (C# B F):\n1.  **Map**: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n2.  **Input**: `[1, 10, 5]`.\n3.  **Sort**: `notes_val = [1, 5, 10]` (C#, F, B).\n4.  **Check Permutations**:\n    *   **Permutation 1 (C#, F, B)**: `X=1, Y=5, Z=10`\n        *   `d1 = (5 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n        *   `d2 = (10 - 5 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n        *   ` (4, 5)` is neither `(4, 3)` nor `(3, 4)`.\n    *   **Permutation 2 (F, B, C#)**: `X=5, Y=10, Z=1`\n        *   `d1 = (10 - 5 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n        *   `d2 = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n        *   ` (5, 3)` is neither `(4, 3)` nor `(3, 4)`.\n    *   **Permutation 3 (B, C#, F)**: `X=10, Y=1, Z=5`\n        *   `d1 = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n        *   `d2 = (5 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n        *   ` (3, 4)` matches a minor triad.\n5.  **Output**: \"minor\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Map notes to numerical values (0-11)\nnote_to_int = {\n    \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n    \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n}\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three notes from standard input\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\n    # Convert note strings to their integer representations\n    notes_val = []\n    for note in notes_str:\n        notes_val.append(note_to_int[note])\n\n    # Sort the numerical notes.
