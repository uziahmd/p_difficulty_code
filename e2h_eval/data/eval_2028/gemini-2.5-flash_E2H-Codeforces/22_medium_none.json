After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Marks Problem: Python Script Development**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with crafting a Python script to tackle the \"Marks\" competitive programming problem.  The core challenge is figuring out which students are \"successful,\" meaning they achieved the highest mark in at least one subject.  My initial approach is to break this problem down into manageable steps, focusing on efficiency given the constraints (N, M <= 100).\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. That means grabbing the values of `n` and `m` (number of students and subjects), followed by reading in the gradebook, which is an `n x m` matrix of marks.  I'll use a list of strings to represent this gradebook; it seems the most straightforward given that marks are single digits.\n\nNext, the critical step: finding the maximum mark for *each* subject.  I'll iterate through each subject (column in the matrix), and for each, I'll iterate through the students (rows) to find the highest mark achieved in that subject. I can store these maximum marks in a list called `max_marks_per_subject`.\n\nNow, with the maximum marks for each subject in hand, I can identify the \"best\" students.  For each subject, I'll compare each student's mark to the subject's maximum mark. If they match, that student is \"best\" at that subject.  I need a way to keep track of these successful students, and using a `set` is perfect here to ensure that a student is counted only once, even if they're the best at multiple subjects.\n\nFinally, the answer is simply the number of successful students. This is just the size, or the `len()`, of the set of successful students. I'll print this value.\n\nLet's quickly ensure this approach is within the expected time complexity (O(N*M)) for the small input sizes. Reading the input takes O(N*M). Finding the max marks also takes O(N*M). Identifying successful students is also O(N*M). So the whole process remains within O(N*M). I am going to write the code keeping this O(N*M) time complexity as the goal.\n\nBefore coding, I should think about data structures. The input `gradebook` will be a list of strings. Each entry in `gradebook` is the mark for one student across all subjects. For calculating max marks per subject, I'll have a list, `max_marks_per_subject`. For successful students, I'll use a `set`, called `successful_students_indices`. I will initialize `max_marks_per_subject` with zeros, the lowest possible mark. Then, during the process of computing max marks, I will continuously update with each greater grade.\n\nI need to make sure I am handling the index properly. The students are 0-indexed. This means I'm adding `i` to the `successful_students_indices` set, which is the actual student's number.\nI also need to remember to convert characters to integers when comparing marks.\n\nOnce coded and tested with the example, I will add input/output with `sys.stdin.readline()` and `strip()` for potentially faster I/O in a competitive programming context.\n\nI've carefully considered any edge cases. I'll check if my solution still works when N or M is 1, when all students have same marks, or when some students have same marks. I think that my strategy will hold for these cases because of how I'm handling the set of `successful_students_indices`. If a student is the best at any subject, they will be present in the set.\n",
