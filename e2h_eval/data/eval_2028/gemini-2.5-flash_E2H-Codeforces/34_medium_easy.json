And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey: Calculating Average Sleep Time**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this task: compute the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" within a given dataset of sleep records.  A \"week\" here is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days, and I've got `n` days worth of data represented by `a1, a2, ... an`.  My goal is to figure out the most efficient way to do this.\n\nMy initial thought is to brute-force it: calculate the sum of sleep times for each `k`-day window, then average those sums. This would mean identifying all the windows: `[a1...ak]`, `[a2...a{k+1}]`, and so on, up to `[a{n-k+1}...an]`. The total number of windows is `n-k+1`.\n\nI immediately recognize that just summing each window from scratch is inefficient, with `O(n*k)` which won't cut it when `n` is large. So, I need a smarter approach. I need to be efficient and find the overlapping data.\n\nThen I realized that each subsequent window's sum can be computed incrementally from the previous one, and that's the key.  I can use a sliding window: to get the next window's sum, I simply subtract the first element of the old window and add the new element that falls into the next window. This approach is `O(n)`. This feels like the right track.\n\nI also verified my approach with some example data. I needed to make sure I was calculating the average correctly. I reviewed some examples to verify the problem statement's requirement to output a precision of 10-6.\n\nI checked for potential integer overflow issues, keeping in mind the constraints: `n <= 2*10^5`, and `a_i <= 10^5`. I can be sure that this value fits into the bounds of a standard 64-bit integer, and that Python integers won't present any issues. The final calculation is a division of large numbers, and the result will be a floating-point number.\n\nI also considered edge cases: where `k=n` (only one full window), and where `k=1` (each data point is a separate week). This confirmed that my logic handled those correctly.\n\nSo, here's my plan: calculate the sum of the initial `k`-day window, and then use the sliding window technique to efficiently calculate the sums of the remaining windows.  Sum all these window sums. Divide by the total count of windows (`n-k+1`).\n\nHere's my approach:\n1.  Read input: `n`, `k`, and the sleep data `a`.\n2.  Compute the sum of the first `k` elements (`S_1`).\n3.  Use a `for` loop, from `1` to `n-k` to calculate `S_i` from `S_{i-1}`, and simultaneously accumulate the `S_i` values.\n4.  Divide that accumulated total sum by `(n-k+1)`.\n5.  Print the result with the required precision.\n\nIt's efficient, robust, and handles the potential edge cases. I'm pretty confident in this solution.\n",
