    "thought": "**Problem Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  The goal is to find the minimum instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\nMy immediate thought is that minimizing instability boils down to making that range (max - min) as small as possible. I need to consider what happens when I remove an element. The constraints give a decent range for values, suggesting a potentially brute-forceable solution, but I know there's a more elegant approach.\n\nMy first thought is that the *critical* elements are the original maximum and minimum. If I remove anything *other* than those extremes, the overall instability is unchanged, assuming no repeated min/max values. I can see that removing something in the middle won't help. This leads me to think I only need to consider removing the smallest value or the largest.\n\nIf I remove the minimum, the new minimum will be the *second* smallest element. If I remove the maximum, the new maximum will be the second largest.  Either way, the range should decrease as long as the second smallest is bigger than the original min and the second largest is smaller than the original max.\n\nTherefore, the problem is really just to compute the instability of the array after removing the minimum and after removing the maximum and choosing the smaller of the two. This is very straightforward. I can sort the array or iterate through the array twice. I can find the minimum and maximum and then the second smallest and second largest. This leads to a complexity of O(n) which is the most optimal.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from an array `a` to minimize the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nLet the original array be `a`. When we remove an element, we get a new array `a'`. We want to minimize `max(a') - min(a')`.\n\nConsider the elements that determine the instability: the global minimum and global maximum of the array.\nLet `min_val` be the minimum element in the original array `a`.\nLet `max_val` be the maximum element in the original array `a`.\n\nIf we remove an element `x` that is neither `min_val` nor `max_val` (and `min_val` and `max_val` are unique or have other occurrences), then `min_val` and `max_val` will still be present in the `n-1` element array. In this case, the instability will remain `max_val - min_val`. This doesn't help reduce the instability.\n\nTo reduce the instability, we must either:\n1. Increase the minimum value of the array. This can only happen if we remove the current `min_val`. The new minimum will then be the second smallest element in the original array.\n2. Decrease the maximum value of the array. This can only happen if we remove the current `max_val`. The new maximum will then be the second largest element in the original array.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy must involve removing either the smallest element or the largest element from the original array. We need to calculate the instability for both scenarios and pick the minimum of the two.\n\nLet's sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nNow, `min_val = a_1` and `max_val = a_n`.\n\n**Scenario 1: Remove the smallest element (`a_1`).**\nThe remaining elements are `a_2, a_3, ..., a_n`.\nThe new minimum is `a_2`.\nThe new maximum is `a_n`.\nThe instability in this case is `a_n - a_2`.\n\n**Scenario 2: Remove the largest element (`a_n`).**\nThe remaining elements are `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}`.\nThe new minimum is `a_1`.\nThe new maximum is `a_{n-1}`.\nThe instability in this case is `a_{n-1} - a_1`.\n\nThe minimum possible instability will be `min( (a_n - a_2), (a_{n-1} - a_1) )`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the `n` integers into an array (or list).\n3. Sort the array.\n4. Calculate `a[n-1] - a[1]` (which is `max_val - second_min_val` after sorting).\n5. Calculate `a[n-2] - a[0]` (which is `second_max_val - min_val` after sorting).\n6. Print the minimum of these two values.\n\n**Example 1: `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`, `n = 4`**\nSorted `a`: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`\n`a_0 = 1`, `a_1 = 3`, `a_2 = 3`, `a_3 = 7`\n\nScenario 1 (remove `a_0=1`): Instability = `a_3 - a_1 = 7 - 3 = 4`.\nScenario 2 (remove `a_3=7`): Instability = `a_2 - a_0 = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n\nMinimum instability = `min(4, 2) = 2`.\n\n**Example 2: `a = [1, 100000]`, `n = 2`**\nSorted `a`: `[1, 100000]`\n`a_0 = 1`, `a_1 = 100000`\n\nScenario 1 (remove `a_0=1`): Instability = `a_1 - a_1 = 100000 - 100000 = 0`.\nScenario 2 (remove `a_1=100000`): Instability = `a_0 - a_0 = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n\nMinimum instability = `min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nSorting takes `O(N log N)` time.\nThe rest of the operations are constant time.\nSo, the overall time complexity is `O(N log N)`, which is efficient enough for `N = 10^5`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array to easily find min, max, second_min, second_max\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Case 1: Remove the smallest element (a[0])\n    # The remaining elements are a[1]...a[n-1].\n    # The new minimum is a[1], the new maximum is a[n-1].\n    # Instability = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    instability_if_remove_min = a[n-1] - a[1]\n\n    # Case 2: Remove the largest element (a[n-1])\n    # The remaining elements are a[0]...a[n-2].\n    # The new minimum is a[0], the new maximum is a[n-2].\n    # Instability = a[n-2] - a[0]\n    instability_if_remove_max = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n    # The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two cases\n    print(min(instability_if_remove_min, instability_if_remove_max))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
