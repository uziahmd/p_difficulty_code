His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Best and Worst Case Ranking Analysis for Olympiad Participant**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best and worst possible rankings for Vasya in this Olympiad. I've got the number of participants, `n`, and the minimum total score Vasya achieved, `x`.  I'm also given two lists: `a`, which contains the scores from the first tour for all participants, and `b`, which contains the scores from the second tour.  The catch is, I don't know which score in `a` corresponds to which score in `b`.\n\nMy main challenge is that Vasya's total score is at least `x`. So I need to find a pair of scores, `a_i` and `b_j`, such that their sum is greater than or equal to `x`, and those are *Vasya's* scores. The rest of the scores from `a` and `b` will then be paired amongst the remaining participants.\n\nThe ranking is based on total score, in decreasing order. Ties are broken arbitrarily by the jury, which adds a layer of complexity!\n\nTo find the *best* rank, I need to maximize Vasya's score and minimize the scores of the other participants. For Vasya, I want to pair the scores from `a` and `b` such that `a_i + b_j` is as large as possible, while still meeting the `x` threshold. It's not immediately obvious how to deal with maximizing Vasya's rank, or maximizing Vasya's score *relative* to others' scores. I need to make sure Vasya gets the highest possible score he can while remaining within the conditions. I think I should sort the `a` and `b` lists to assist with that.\n\nLet's assume `A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` and `B = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`.\nTo maximize Vasya's score and thus, his ranking, the most intuitive approach would be to assign him the largest values from `a` and `b`. So let's start with sorting.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given his minimum total score `x`, and two lists of scores `a` and `b` from the first and second tours, respectively. There are `n` participants, and the scores in `a` and `b` are not linked to specific participants.\n\n**Understanding the Ranking Rules:**\n1. Participants are ranked by their total score (sum of points from both tours) in decreasing order.\n2. If multiple participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places arbitrarily. This means for a given score `S`, if `k` participants achieve `S`, and `m` participants achieve scores strictly greater than `S`, then any of these `k` participants could be ranked anywhere from `m+1` (best tie-breaking) to `m+k` (worst tie-breaking).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nWe need to consider how to pair the scores from lists `a` and `b` to determine Vasya's best and worst ranks. Vasya's specific scores `a_i` and `b_j` are unknown, but we know `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n\n**1. Finding the Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best rank (closest to 1), Vasya wants to:\n*   Maximize his own total score.\n*   Minimize the total scores of other participants.\n*   Benefit from favorable tie-breaking rules.\n\nFor the best rank, Vasya can always choose the pair `(a_i, b_j)` that gives him the highest possible total score `S_V = a_i + b_j` such that `S_V >= x`.\nThe other `n-1` participants will be assigned the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b`. To give Vasya the best possible rank, we assume the jury pairs the remaining scores in a way that minimizes the number of participants who score *strictly higher* than Vasya.\n\nLet's sort `a` and `b` in ascending order.\n`a_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`b_sorted = sorted(b)`\n\nConsider the maximum possible score any participant can get: `a_sorted[n-1] + b_sorted[n-1]`. If this sum is `S_max`, and `S_max >= x`, then Vasya can potentially achieve `S_max`. If he achieves `S_max`, and no one else can achieve `S_max` (or higher), he gets 1st place.\n\nTo maximize Vasya's score, he should take the highest `a_i` and highest `b_j`.\nLet's iterate through all possible `a_i` for Vasya. For a given `a_i`, Vasya needs `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To maximize `a_i + b_j`, he should pick the largest `b_j` that satisfies `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nThis approach is complex because picking `a_i` and `b_j` for Vasya affects the remaining scores for others.\n\nA simpler observation for the best rank:\nVasya's best rank is 1 if he can achieve a score `S_V` such that no other participant can achieve a score strictly greater than `S_V`.\nSince Vasya can pick any `a_i` and `b_j` (as long as `a_i+b_j >= x`), he can always pick the highest `a_i` and `b_j` available. Let `a_max = max(a)` and `b_max = max(b)`. If `a_max + b_max >= x`, Vasya can achieve `a_max + b_max`.\nThe other participants will then be assigned `a \\setminus \\{a_max\\}` and `b \\setminus \\{b_max\\}`.\nCan any other participant score more than `a_max + b_max`? No, because `a_max` and `b_max` are the highest individual scores.\nSo, if `max(a) + max(b) >= x`, Vasya can take `max(a)` and `max(b)`, achieving `max(a) + max(b)` points. No one else can score higher. With favorable tie-breaking, Vasya gets 1st place.\nThe problem statement guarantees that \"there are two integers i, j such, that a_i + b_j >= x\". This implies that Vasya can always find a valid pair. Thus, Vasya can always achieve 1st place.\n\n**Best Rank: 1**\n\n**2. Finding the Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the worst rank (closest to `n`), Vasya wants to:\n*   Minimize his own total score (while still being at least `x`).\n*   Maximize the total scores of other participants.\n*   Suffer from unfavorable tie-breaking rules.\n\nLet Vasya take `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To minimize his rank, he should choose `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j` is as small as possible, but still at least `x`. Let this minimum possible score for Vasya be `S_V_min`.\nThe remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` are then paired up among the other `n-1` participants. To maximize the number of people who score *at least* `S_V_min`, we should pair the remaining scores such that as many participants as possible get high scores. This means we should pair the largest remaining `a` with the largest remaining `b`, the second largest `a` with the second largest `b`, and so on.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.\n`a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)`\n`b_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)`\n\nConsider a specific `a_k` from `a_sorted_asc` as Vasya's first tour score. For Vasya to get this `a_k`, he must be paired with some `b_l` such that `a_k + b_l >= x`. The remaining `n-1` scores in `a` and `n-1` scores in `b` are for others.\nTo maximize the number of people who score *more than or equal to* Vasya, we should try to match the remaining highest `a` scores with the remaining highest `b` scores.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score to be `S_V`. To find the worst rank for this `S_V`:\n1. Count how many other participants can achieve a score `S_k > S_V`.\n2. Count how many other participants can achieve a score `S_k = S_V`.\nWith worst tie-breaking, Vasya's rank would be `(count_strictly_greater) + (count_equal) + 1`.\n\nThe problem is that Vasya's `a_i` and `b_j` are unknown, and the pairings for others also depend on Vasya's choice.\nThis is a maximum bipartite matching problem or a greedy approach.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in ascending order: `b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`.\n\nWe want to find pairings `(a_i, b_j)` for all `n` participants such that:\n1. One participant (Vasya) gets `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n2. The remaining `n-1` participants are paired with the remaining `n-1` scores.\n3. We want to maximize the number of participants whose scores are greater than or equal to Vasya's score.\n\nConsider the scores `a_i` and `b_j`. If we pair `a_i` with `b_{n-i+1}` (i.e., smallest `a` with largest `b`, second smallest `a` with second largest `b`, etc.), this strategy aims to equalize the sums or minimize the maximum sum.\nThis is not what we want for worst rank. For worst rank, we want to maximize the number of people who score *at least* Vasya's score. This means we want to find a pairing for *all* participants that maximizes the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis is a standard two-pointer problem:\nInitialize `count = 0`, `j = n-1` (pointer for `b`).\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n  While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n    `j--`\n  If `j < n-1` (meaning we found a `b[j+1]` such that `a[i] + b[j+1] >= x`):\n    `count++`\n    The `b[j+1]` is now \"used\". We need to find a way to mark `b` elements as used.\n\nThis is not quite right. We need to find a maximum matching.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order.\nLet's sort `b` in descending order.\n`a_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`b_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)`\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis can be done using a greedy approach:\nIterate through `a_sorted` from smallest to largest (`a_i`). For each `a_i`, try to find the largest `b_j` from `b_sorted_desc` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. If such a `b_j` exists, we form a pair.\nThis greedy strategy is correct. To maximize the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` that satisfy `a_i + b_j >= x`:\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in ascending order.\nUse two pointers: `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = n-1`.\n`num_valid_pairs = 0`.\nWhile `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n  If `a_sorted[ptr_a] + b_sorted[ptr_b] >= x`:\n    // This pair `(a_sorted[ptr_a], b_sorted[ptr_b])` satisfies the condition.\n    // We count it, and use both scores.\n    `num_valid_pairs++`\n    `ptr_a++`\n    `ptr_b--`\n  Else (`a_sorted[ptr_a] + b_sorted[ptr_b] < x`):\n    // `a_sorted[ptr_a]` is too small to make `x` even with the largest available `b_sorted[ptr_b]`.\n    // It means `a_sorted[ptr_a]` cannot form a pair with any `b_k` (where `k <= ptr_b`) to satisfy the condition.\n    // So, we discard `a_sorted[ptr_a]` and try the next `a`.\n    `ptr_a++`\n\nAfter this process, `num_valid_pairs` will be the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x`.\nVasya is one of these participants.\nSo, if `num_valid_pairs` participants can achieve a score of at least `x`, and Vasya is one of them, then in the worst case (unfavorable tie-breaking), Vasya will be ranked `num_valid_pairs`.\n\nExample: `a = [1,1,1,1,1]`, `b = [1,1,1,1,1]`, `x = 2`.\n`a_sorted = [1,1,1,1,1]`\n`b_sorted = [1,1,1,1,1]`\n`ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 4`, `num_valid_pairs = 0`\n1. `a[0]=1`, `b[4]=1`. `1+1=2 >= x`. `num_valid_pairs=1`. `ptr_a=1`, `ptr_b=3`.\n2. `a[1]=1`, `b[3]=1`. `1+1=2 >= x`. `num_valid_pairs=2`. `ptr_a=2`, `ptr_b=2`.\n3. `a[2]=1`, `b[2]=1`. `1+1=2 >= x`. `num_valid_pairs=3`. `ptr_a=3`, `ptr_b=1`.\n4. `a[3]=1`, `b[1]=1`. `1+1=2 >= x`. `num_valid_pairs=4`. `ptr_a=4`, `ptr_b=0`.\n5. `a[4]=1`, `b[0]=1`. `1+1=2 >= x`. `num_valid_pairs=5`. `ptr_a=5`, `ptr_b=-1`.\nLoop ends. `num_valid_pairs = 5`.\nWorst rank for Vasya is 5.\n\nExample 2: `n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n`a_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 5`, `num_valid_pairs = 0`\n1. `a[0]=3`, `b[5]=8`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. `num_valid_pairs=1`. `ptr_a=1`, `ptr_b=4`.\n2. `a[1]=4`, `b[4]=6`. `4+6=10 >= 7`. `num_valid_pairs=2`. `ptr_a=2`, `ptr_b=3`.\n3. `a[2]=4`, `b[3]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `num_valid_pairs=3`. `ptr_a=3`, `ptr_b=2`.\n4. `a[3]=4`, `b[2]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `num_valid_pairs=4`. `ptr_a=4`, `ptr_b=1`.\n5. `a[4]=5`, `b[1]=3`. `5+3=8 >= 7`. `num_valid_pairs=5`. `ptr_a=5`, `ptr_b=0`.\n6. `a[5]=6`, `b[0]=0`. `6+0=6 < 7`. `ptr_a=6`.\nLoop ends. `num_valid_pairs = 5`.\nWorst rank for Vasya is 5.\n\nThis greedy approach correctly finds the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x`. Since Vasya is guaranteed to be one of them, his worst rank is this count.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBest rank: 1\nWorst rank: The count determined by the two-pointer greedy approach.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank for Vasya\n    # Vasya can always choose the highest score from list a and the highest score from list b.\n    # If max(a) + max(b) >= x, then Vasya can achieve this score.\n    # No other participant can achieve a score higher than max(a) + max(b).\n    # Since the problem guarantees that Vasya was present and a_i + b_j >= x for some i, j,\n    # it implies that Vasya can always form a valid pair.\n    # By picking the highest available scores, Vasya can achieve the maximum possible total score.\n    # With favorable tie-breaking, Vasya can always get the 1st place.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst rank for Vasya\n    # To find the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of participants\n    # who score at least x points.
