Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solved: Crazy Town - Finding the Minimum Steps**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it efficiently.  My initial thought is to break down the problem into manageable parts. I'm given the coordinates of a home block (x1, y1) and a university block (x2, y2), along with a set of `n` roads. Each road is defined by the equation `aix + biy + ci = 0`. The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps needed to travel from the home to the university. A step is crossing a road, meaning you move from one block to an adjacent block.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The coordinates can range from -10^6 to 10^6, and there are up to 300 roads. The coefficients for the road equations are within the same range. Crucially, the home and university are *not* on any road.\n\nThe key insight is that crossing a road is a step, and the minimum number of steps is simply the number of roads that *separate* the home and the university. If the home and university are on the same side of a road, that road doesn't need to be crossed. If they are on opposite sides, that road *must* be crossed.\n\nTo determine if two points (the home and the university) are on the same or opposite sides of a road, I can use the equation of the line.  For any point (x, y), calculating `f(x, y) = ax + by + c` gives me a value that indicates the point's position relative to the line: > 0 means one side, < 0 means the other side, and = 0 means on the line (but we are guaranteed that home and uni won't be on the line).\n\nIf the product of the line function evaluated at the home and university points (val1 * val2) is negative, it means they are on opposite sides, and that road must be crossed.\n\nThe algorithm is straightforward:\n\n1.  Initialize a `steps` counter to 0.\n2.  Read the home and university coordinates and the number of roads (`n`).\n3.  For each road, read its coefficients (ai, bi, ci).\n4.  Calculate `val1 = ai * x1 + bi * y1 + ci` (home point).\n5.  Calculate `val2 = ai * x2 + bi * y2 + ci` (university point).\n6.  If `val1 * val2 < 0`, the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, so increment `steps`.\n7.  After processing all roads, `steps` holds the minimum number of steps required, which is the number of separating roads.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a destination block (containing the university). A step involves moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length, which means crossing a road.\n\nThe key insight is to determine for each road whether it separates the home from the university.\nA line defined by `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two half-planes. For any point `(x, y)`, the value `ax + by + c` will be positive in one half-plane and negative in the other. If a point lies on the line, the value is zero.\n\nGiven that neither the home `(x1, y1)` nor the university `(x2, y2)` lies on any road, for any road `i` with equation `aix + biy + ci = 0`:\n1.  Calculate `val1 = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci`.\n2.  Calculate `val2 = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`.\n\n*   If `val1` and `val2` have the *same sign* (i.e., `val1 * val2 > 0`), it means both points are on the same side of road `i`. You do not need to cross road `i` to travel between home and university.\n*   If `val1` and `val2` have *different signs* (i.e., `val1 * val2 < 0`), it means home and university are on opposite sides of road `i`. To get from home to university, you *must* cross road `i`.\n\nEach road that separates the home and the university must be crossed exactly once. The minimum number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)`.\n2.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `ai, bi, ci`.\n    b.  Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates: `res1 = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci`.\n    c.  Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates: `res2 = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`.\n    d.  If `res1` and `res2` have different signs (i.e., `res1 * res2 < 0`), increment `steps`.\n5.  Print the final `steps` count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates\n        # ax + by + c\n        res1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates\n        res2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If res1 and res2 have different signs, it means the home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this road.
