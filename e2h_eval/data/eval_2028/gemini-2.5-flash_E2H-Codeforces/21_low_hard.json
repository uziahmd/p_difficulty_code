The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Optimization Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where the goal is to maximize the number of opened chests. The core constraint is simple: a chest opens only if the sum of its number and the key's number results in an odd number.  That's just a fancy way of saying they need to have different parities – one must be even, the other odd.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down by parity.  I'll count how many even and odd chests I have, and the same for the keys.  Let's call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. This fundamentally becomes a matching problem. I need to pair even chests with odd keys, and odd chests with even keys. The beauty is these two pairings are independent; opening one doesn't affect the other.\n\nTo maximize the openings, I need to match as many as possible. The number of even chests I can open is limited by the availability of odd keys.  So, I can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` even chests.  Similarly, I can open `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` odd chests.\n\nSince a key can only open one chest, and a chest can be opened by only one key, and the two types of matchings are completely independent, the total number of opened chests is simply the sum of these two: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. This gives me the optimal solution.\n\nLet's test this with an example. If I have, say, three even chests and one odd key, then I can only open one chest using an odd key. If I also have two odd chests and three even keys, I can open two chests. The maximum number of chests opened is then 1+2 = 3\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open. A chest with number $a_i$ can be opened by a key with number $b_j$ if their sum $a_i + b_j$ is an odd number. This condition $a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ implies that $a_i$ and $b_j$ must have different parities. That is, one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n1.  **Even chests**: Chests with an even number $a_i$.\n2.  **Odd chests**: Chests with an odd number $a_i$.\n3.  **Even keys**: Keys with an even number $b_j$.\n4.  **Odd keys**: Keys with an odd number $b_j$.\n\nTo open a chest, we need to match it with a key of different parity:\n*   An **even chest** can only be opened by an **odd key**.\n*   An **odd chest** can only be opened by an **even key**.\n\nSince one key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once, we want to maximize the total number of such valid pairings.\n\nLet's count the number of each type:\n*   `chests_even`: Count of even chests.\n*   `chests_odd`: Count of odd chests.\n*   `keys_even`: Count of even keys.\n*   `keys_odd`: Count of odd keys.\n\nThe number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys is limited by the number of available even chests (`chests_even`) and the number of available odd keys (`keys_odd`). Therefore, we can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` even chests using odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, the number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys is limited by the number of available odd chests (`chests_odd`) and the number of available even keys (`keys_even`). Therefore, we can open `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` odd chests using even keys.\n\nSince these two types of matches (even chest + odd key, and odd chest + even key) use entirely separate sets of resources (even chests/odd keys vs. odd chests/even keys), they do not interfere with each other. Thus, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum matches from these two categories:\n\n`Total opened chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read $n$ and $m$.\n2.  Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the $n$ chest numbers $a_i$. For each $a_i$:\n    *   If $a_i$ is even, increment `chests_even`.\n    *   If $a_i$ is odd, increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the $m$ key numbers $b_j$. For each $b_j$:\n    *   If $b_j$ is even, increment `keys_even`.\n    *   If $b_j$ is odd, increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate `result = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7.  Print `result`.\n\nThis approach is efficient as it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then a constant number of operations for the final calculation. The time complexity will be $O(N+M)$, which is well within limits for $N, M \\leq 10^5$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    \n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n            \n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    \n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n            \n    # To open an even chest, we need an odd key.\n    # Max matches: min(number of even chests, number of odd keys)\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # To open an odd chest, we need an even key.\n    # Max matches: min(number of odd chests, number of even keys)\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    # Total matches is the sum of these two independent types of matches\n    print(matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
