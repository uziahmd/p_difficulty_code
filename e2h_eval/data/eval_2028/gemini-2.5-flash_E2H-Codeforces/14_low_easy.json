He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to find all the positive integers 'n' whose factorials end with exactly 'm' zeroes.  First things first, I need to figure out how to count those trailing zeroes efficiently.  I immediately recognize that it boils down to the number of factors of 5 in `n!`, since there are always more factors of 2 than 5.  This leads me directly to Legendre's formula.\n\nUsing Legendre, the count of trailing zeroes, which I'll call `Z(n)`, is the sum of `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`.  This sum will continue until the term becomes zero.\n\nNow, analyzing `Z(n)` is key. I see it's a non-decreasing function; it either stays the same or increases as 'n' grows. It only increases when 'n' is a multiple of 5. And it doesn't increase by a consistent amount.  For instance, between n=24 and n=25, Z(n) jumps from 4 to 6! This is a good example of what I need to watch for.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, if I'm given an 'm' (the desired number of trailing zeroes), I need to find all 'n' values where `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, I just need to find the range where this condition is met.  I'll likely need to use a loop or some iterative search. However, I must consider the cases where there might not be any solutions. For instance, based on my analysis of `Z(n)`, there is no 'n' that satisfies `Z(n)=5`. This means not all 'm' values will have a corresponding 'n'. I'll need to account for that.\n\nThe increase in `Z(n)` at a multiple of 5 is dependent on how many factors of 5 that number has, which can be expressed with `v_5(n)`, where v is the valuation function. This gives me another layer of efficiency to consider.\n\nMy next step will be to formulate an algorithm to find these 'n' values and count them.  I'll need to handle the cases where no solution exists for a given 'm' and organize my output properly. I should be able to whip up a Python script for this fairly quickly.\n",
