Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my thought process:** The user needs a Python script for the \"Amusing Joke\" problem.  First, I break down the problem statement. We've got three strings: guest name, host name, and the pile of letters. The core task is to check if the pile can be perfectly assembled from the guest and host names.  No extra letters, no missing ones.\n\nI quickly analyze the provided examples. The examples help clarify the letter count matching process.\n\nI'm thinking about the algorithm. I'll read the inputs, combine the guest and host names, then count the occurrences of each letter in *both* the combined name and the pile. A frequency map, like a Python dictionary or a list representing each letter, is ideal for counting.\n\nI'll use a `Counter` object from the `collections` module. It is efficient, easy to use, and directly provides the frequencies. Python's `Counter` is the perfect data structure for counting occurrences of items. After counting, I'll compare the frequency maps. If they're identical, it's a \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThe problem constraints (line lengths <= 100) are pretty loose, so a simple approach will work. The time complexity is O(L), where L is the total length of the input strings.\n\nMy code will use `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for clean input. I'll test it thoroughly with the provided examples and a third example to make sure it handles all cases.\n\nI use `collections.Counter` to efficiently count the characters in both the combined names and the pile of letters. The problem is now very simple because the comparison part is automatically taken care of by the `==` comparison of the counters. The script is now ready.  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` ensures the `solve()` function runs when the script is executed. No further optimization seems necessary for the given problem constraints.\n",
