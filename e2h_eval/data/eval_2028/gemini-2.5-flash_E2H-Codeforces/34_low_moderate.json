And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Efficiently Calculating Average Sleep Time Over Weeks**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core problem is finding the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" within Polycarp's sleep data. A \"week\" here is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days, and we have `n` total days of sleep data. That means we're looking at `n - k + 1` weeks to consider.\n\nMy initial thought was straightforward: calculate the sum of sleep times for each week and then average those sums.  Specifically, for each week `i`, starting from day `i` up to `i + k - 1`, sum the sleep values `a_i` through `a_{i + k -1}`. Then I'd sum all those weekly totals and divide by the number of weeks. Simple, right? But the problem is, if I simply did that, the time complexity would be `O((n-k+1) * k)`, which could be too slow with such large inputs.\n\nThinking through it, I realized a more efficient method using a sliding window approach is the way to go.  Instead of recalculating the entire sum for each week, I can leverage the sum of the previous week. So, to calculate the sum of the next week, I can subtract the first element of the previous week and add the new element that is now included. For example, if I've calculated the sum of week 1 (days 1 to k), to calculate the sum of week 2 (days 2 to k+1), I just need to subtract the first day's sleep and add the sleep of the new day. That way I could avoid having to reiterate all the sum for each and every k days.\n\nSo the strategy is:\n1.  Calculate the initial sum for the first week (days 1 to k).\n2.  Iterate through the remaining weeks. For each subsequent week, update the sum by subtracting the \"old\" element and adding the \"new\" element.\n3.  Keep a running sum of all the weekly sums.\n4.  Finally, divide the total sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to get the average.\n\nThis sliding window approach should bring the time complexity down to `O(n)`, which is much more manageable for the given constraints. I'm confident this will solve the problem effectively.\n",
