Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The goal here is to stabilize an array by removing a single element to minimize the difference between its largest and smallest remaining values.** My approach involves understanding the problem constraints and using examples to build the logic.\n\nFirst, I identified the key insight: minimizing instability means making the maximum value as small as possible and the minimum value as large as possible. Removing any element other than the smallest or the largest would not improve the instability, so I needed to consider only two scenarios: removing the smallest or the largest element.\n\nThe strategy involves sorting the array. After sorting, the instability is easily calculated for these two scenarios. I then found the minimum of the two and returned that as the answer.\n\nI tested the logic with examples to verify. I also considered edge cases, such as arrays with only two elements or arrays where all elements are the same, to ensure the solution is robust. My algorithm's time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) for the sorted array. Given the constraints, this complexity is more than suitable, even though more efficient solutions (O(N) solutions) are possible.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from an array `a` of `n` integers such that the \"instability\" of the remaining `n-1` elements is minimized. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in an array.\n\nLet the given array be `a`. To minimize `max(array) - min(array)`, we want to make the maximum value as small as possible and the minimum value as large as possible.\n\nConsider the array `a` sorted in non-decreasing order: `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`.\nHere, `s_1` is the smallest element, `s_2` is the second smallest, `s_n` is the largest, and `s_{n-1}` is the second largest.\n\nWhen we remove an element, there are three main scenarios:\n\n1.  **Remove an element `s_k` where `1 < k < n` (an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest):**\n    In this case, `s_1` remains the minimum element and `s_n` remains the maximum element in the `n-1` element array. The instability would still be `s_n - s_1`. This does not help reduce the instability if `s_n - s_1` is large.\n\n2.  **Remove the smallest element `s_1`:**\n    After removing `s_1`, the new smallest element in the array becomes `s_2`. The largest element remains `s_n`. The instability in this case would be `s_n - s_2`.\n\n3.  **Remove the largest element `s_n`:**\n    After removing `s_n`, the smallest element `s_1` remains the minimum. The new largest element becomes `s_{n-1}`. The instability in this case would be `s_{n-1} - s_1`.\n\nTo minimize the instability, we only need to consider the scenarios where we remove one of the extreme elements (smallest or largest), as removing an element from the middle will not change the overall minimum or maximum and thus won't reduce the instability more effectively. Therefore, the minimum possible instability will be the minimum of the instabilities calculated in scenarios 2 and 3.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the integer `n`.\n2.  Read the `n` integers into an array `a`.\n3.  Sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order.\n4.  Calculate the instability if the smallest element (`a[0]`) is removed: `a[n-1] - a[1]` (max - second_min).\n5.  Calculate the instability if the largest element (`a[n-1]`) is removed: `a[n-2] - a[0]` (second_max - min).\n6.  The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two values.\n\n**Example 1: `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`, `n = 4`**\n1.  Sorted `a`: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`\n2.  Remove `a[0]` (which is `1`): Remaining `[3, 3, 7]`. Instability `7 - 3 = 4`. (Corresponds to `a[n-1] - a[1] = a[3] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4`)\n3.  Remove `a[3]` (which is `7`): Remaining `[1, 3, 3]`. Instability `3 - 1 = 2`. (Corresponds to `a[n-2] - a[0] = a[2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`)\n4.  Minimum instability: `min(4, 2) = 2`.\n\n**Example 2: `a = [1, 100000]`, `n = 2`**\n1.  Sorted `a`: `[1, 100000]`\n2.  Remove `a[0]` (which is `1`): Remaining `[100000]`. Instability `100000 - 100000 = 0`. (Corresponds to `a[n-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0`)\n3.  Remove `a[1]` (which is `100000`): Remaining `[1]`. Instability `1 - 1 = 0`. (Corresponds to `a[n-2] - a[0] = a[0] - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`)\n4.  Minimum instability: `min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sorting the array takes `O(N log N)` time.\n*   The subsequent calculations take `O(1)` time.\n*   Overall time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\n*   Space complexity: `O(N)` for storing the array (or `O(log N)` or `O(1)` depending on the sorting algorithm's implementation details).\n\nGiven `N <= 10^5`, `O(N log N)` is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array to easily find the smallest, second smallest,\n    # largest, and second largest elements.\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Case 1: Remove the smallest element (a[0]).\n    # The remaining array's minimum will be a[1] (the second smallest of original).\n    # The remaining array's maximum will be a[n-1] (the largest of original).\n    instability_if_min_removed = a[n-1] - a[1]\n\n    # Case 2: Remove the largest element (a[n-1]).\n    # The remaining array's minimum will be a[0] (the smallest of original).\n    # The remaining array's maximum will be a[n-2] (the second largest of original).\n    instability_if_max_removed = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n    # The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two cases.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(min(instability_if_min_removed, instability_if_max_removed)) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
