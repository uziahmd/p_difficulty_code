    "thought": "**My Plan for Solving the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. I need to figure out the sum of  `d(1, n)` across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, and I have to do it modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to nail down what a \"good\" tree *is*. It's an n-vertex tree where each edge has a weight of 1 or -1, and for every vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n\nLet's unpack this. If I take the product of all these vertex conditions, I get `(-1)^n`.  On the other hand, since each edge's weight squared is 1, the product of all vertex conditions simplifies to 1.  Therefore, I'm stuck with `1 = (-1)^n`. This means 'n' has to be even for a good tree to even exist. If 'n' is odd, the answer is immediately 0. That's a nice, quick check.\n\nAssuming n is even, this \"good\" condition means each vertex must have an odd number of edges with a weight of -1. I denote the number of such edges incident to a vertex i as ki, and this must be odd.\n\nNow I need to calculate `sum_{T good} d(1,n)`.  `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights on the path from u to v.  So I'm summing path weights from vertex 1 to vertex n over all \"good\" trees.\n\nThe total number of trees is `n^(n-2)`, and for each tree, there are `2^(n-1)` ways to assign weights.  How do I isolate the \"good\" ones?  Let's look at fixing a tree structure and figuring out how many valid weight assignments there are.\n\nFor a fixed tree `T`, I have a system of `n` equations, one for each vertex, and `n-1` unknowns (the edge weights, which are either 1 or -1). I convert it to a system in GF(2) with 0 and 1 representing edge weights. It is: `A * y = 1_n`. Here, A is the incidence matrix.  \n\nThe trick is, this is a rank-deficient system of equations. Since `n` is even, the equations aren't independent. They sum up to 0 in GF(2).  But this means there's a solution, and *exactly one* solution. With a bit of thought, and perhaps an inductive argument, I believe I can show that any tree structure, if `n` is even, will have one and only one \"good\" weight assignment.  This is a huge simplification!\n\nThis means I need to sum `d(1,n)` over all `n^(n-2)` possible tree structures, where `d(1,n)` is calculated using this *unique* \"good\" weighting.\n\nSo, how to calculate `d(1, n)` for a specific tree? It is the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n.\n\nThe sum is:  `sum_{T} (|P_{1,n}| - 2 * sum_{(u,v) in P_{1,n}} y_{(u,v)})`.\nThis becomes two sums:  `sum_{T} |P_{1,n}| - 2 * sum_{T} sum_{(u,v) in P_{1,n}} y_{(u,v)}`.\n\nI know some things about counting trees now. It seems that a known result exists about the sum of the lengths of paths between two vertices (1 and n) over all possible trees, which is `n^(n-3) * (n-1)` when `n>=2`. However, for `n=2`, the sum is simply `1`.\n\nThe second sum, the sum over edge weightings, seems trickier.  I need to figure out, for each edge on the path from 1 to n, how many times will it have a weight of -1 in the unique good weight assignment, across all trees.  I feel some analysis here is needed, but I'm thinking I can do it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. An edge-weighted tree has `n` vertices, and each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1. A tree is \"good\" if for each vertex `i`, the product of the weights of all edges incident to `i` is -1. `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique simple path from `u` to `v`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for a \"good\" tree. For each vertex `i`, `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1`.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n`product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the other hand, each edge `e=(u,v)` appears in the product for vertex `u` and for vertex `v`. So `w(u,v)` appears twice in the overall product. Since `w(u,v)` is either 1 or -1, `(w(u,v))^2 = 1`.\nThus, `product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{e} (w(e))^2 = product_{e} 1 = 1`.\nEquating these, we get `1 = (-1)^n`. This implies that `n` must be an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, no good tree exists, so the sum of `d(1,n)` is 0. This covers the `n=1` case from the example, where `d(1,1)=0`.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nLet `y_e = 1` if `w(e) = -1` and `y_e = 0` if `w(e) = 1`. The condition `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` is equivalent to `sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)` for all vertices `i`.\nFor any fixed tree structure, this system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)` in `n-1` variables (one for each edge) has a unique solution. This is because the incidence matrix of a tree has rank `n-1` over `GF(2)`, and if `n` is even, the sum of the right-hand sides (`1` for each vertex) is `n = 0 (mod 2)`, which is consistent with the fact that the sum of the rows of the incidence matrix is the zero vector (each `y_e` is counted twice). Therefore, for each of the `n^(n-2)` tree structures, there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it good.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{T} d(1,n)`, where `T` ranges over all `n^(n-2)` labeled trees, and `d(1,n)` is computed using the unique good weighting for `T`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_{1,n}} w(e)`, where `P_{1,n}` is the unique path between 1 and `n`.\nWe can rewrite `w(e) = 1 - 2y_e`.\nSo, `d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_{1,n}} (1 - 2y_e) = |P_{1,n}| - 2 * sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nThe total sum is `Sum = sum_{T} (|P_{1,n}| - 2 * sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e) = sum_{T} |P_{1,n}| - 2 * sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\n\nLet's evaluate the two terms separately.\n\n**Term 1: `sum_{T} |P_{1,n}|`**\n`|P_{1,n}|` is the number of edges on the path from 1 to `n`.\nFor `n=2`, there is only one tree (1-2), and `|P_{1,2}|=1`.\nFor `n >= 3`, the sum of lengths of paths between two fixed vertices `u` and `v` over all `n^(n-2)` trees is `(n-1) * n^(n-3)`.\nSo, `sum_{T} |P_{1,n}| = (n-1) * n^(n-3)` if `n >= 3`.\nNote that for `n=2`, `(2-1)*2^(2-3) = 1/2`, which is not an integer. So the formula is for `n>=3`.\nThus, `sum_{T} |P_{1,n}| = 1` if `n=2`, and `(n-1) * n^(n-3)` if `n >= 3`.\n\n**Term 2: `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e`**\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{e=(u,v)} (sum_{T: e in P_{1,n}} y_e)`.\nConsider a fixed edge `e=(u,v)`. We need to calculate `y_e` for the unique good weighting.\n`y_e = 1` if `w(e)=-1`, `y_e = 0` if `w(e)=1`.\nThe condition `sum_{e' incident to x} y_{e'} = 1 (mod 2)` for all `x`.\nConsider cutting the edge `e=(u,v)`. This separates the tree `T` into two components, `T_u` (containing `u`) and `T_v` (containing `v`). Let `S_u` be the set of vertices in `T_u` and `S_v` be the set of vertices in `T_v`.\nSumming the conditions for all `x` in `S_u`:\n`sum_{x in S_u} (sum_{e' incident to x} y_{e'}) = sum_{x in S_u} 1 = |S_u| (mod 2)`.\nAlso, `sum_{x in S_u} (sum_{e' incident to x} y_{e'}) = sum_{e' within T_u} (2 y_{e'}) + y_e = y_e (mod 2)`.\nSo, `y_e = |S_u| (mod 2)`. Similarly, `y_e = |S_v| (mod 2)`.\nSince `|S_u| + |S_v| = n` and `n` is even, `|S_u|` and `|S_v|` must have the same parity. So `y_e` is 1 if `|S_u|` is odd, and 0 if `|S_u|` is even.\n\nWe need to count trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}`. This means `u` and `v` are separated by `e`, and `1` is in one component while `n` is in the other.\nCase 1: `1` is in `T_u` and `n` is in `T_v`.\nIn this case, `y_e = |S_u| (mod 2)`.\nThe number of such trees where `|S_u|=k` is `k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (n-2)! / ((k-1)! * (n-k-1)!)`. This is `k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`. This counts trees where `e=(u,v)` is fixed, `u` is in `S_u`, `v` is in `S_v`, `1` is in `S_u`, `n` is in `S_v`.\nSumming `y_e` over such trees: `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1) * (k mod 2))`.\nCase 2: `1` is in `T_v` and `n` is in `T_u`.\nThis is symmetric. `y_e = |S_v| (mod 2)`. The number of trees where `|S_v|=k` is `k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nSumming `y_e` over such trees: `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1) * (n-k mod 2))`.\n\nSince `n` is even, `k` and `n-k` have the same parity. So `k mod 2 = (n-k) mod 2`.\nThus, for any fixed edge `e=(u,v)`, the contribution to `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e` is:\n`sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1) * (k mod 2))` for `1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v`\nplus\n`sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1) * (k mod 2))` for `1 \\in S_v, n \\in S_u`.\nThis simplifies to `2 * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1) * (k mod 2))`.\nThis is for a *fixed* edge `e=(u,v)`.\nThis sum needs to be over all possible edges `(u,v)`. There are `C(n,2)` possible edges.\nHowever, this is not how it works. `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e` is `sum_{e=(u,v)} N(e, P_{1,n}) * y_e(T_e)` where `N(e, P_{1,n})` is the number of trees where `e` is on `P_{1,n}`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` is `2 * (n-2)! * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) / ((k-1)! * (n-k-1)!))` where `1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v` or `1 \\in S_v, n \\in S_u`.\nThe factor `2` is for the two cases (`1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v` and `1 \\in S_v, n \\in S_u`).\nSo `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (k mod 2)`.\nThis sum is `sum_{k \\text{ odd}} C(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`.\nThis is a known identity related to trees: `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) = 2 * n^(n-3)`. This is the sum of `|P_{1,n}|` over all trees.\nWait, this identity is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-2}`. No, this is wrong.\nThe sum of `y_e` over all trees where `e` is on the path `P_{1,n}` is `(n-1) * n^(n-4)` for `n >= 3`.\nFor `n=2`, `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,2}} y_e = y_{(1,2)} = 1`.\nFor `n >= 3`, `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e = (n-1) * n^(n-4)`. This is the sum of `y_e` for `e` on `P_{1,n}`.\n\nLet's verify this. The number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` is `2 * n^(n-3)`. (This is for `n>=3`. For `n=2`, it is 1).\nFor `n=2`, `y_{(1,2)} = 1` (since `|S_1|=1` is odd). So `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,2}} y_e = 1`.\nFor `n=4`, `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,4}} y_e = (4-1) * 4^(4-4) = 3 * 4^0 = 3`.\nLet's check the example `n=4`. `d(1,4)` values are: `-2` for 2 trees, `-1` for 8 trees, `0` for 4 trees, `1` for 2 trees.\nSum of `d(1,4)` is `2*(-2) + 8*(-1) + 4*0 + 2*1 = -4 - 8 + 0 + 2 = -10`.\n`sum_{T} |P_{1,4}| = (4-1)*4^(4-3) = 3*4^1 = 12`.\nWe need `sum_{T} |P_{1,4}| - 2 * sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,4}} y_e = 12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThis does not match -10. So my formula for `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_{1,n}} y_e` is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nThe sum `sum_{T} |P_{1,n}|` is `(n-1)n^{n-3}` for `n \\ge 3` and `1` for `n=2`.\nThe sum `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nLet's consider the number of times `y_e=1` for an edge `e` on `P_{1,n}`.\n`y_e=1` if `|S_u|` is odd (where `1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v` or `1 \\in S_v, n \\in S_u`).\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` and `1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v` and `|S_u|=k` is `k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} C(n-2, k-1)`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` and `1 \\in S_v, n \\in S_u` and `|S_v|=k` is `k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} C(n-2, k-1)`.\nSo, for a fixed edge `e=(u,v)`, the sum of `y_e` over trees where `e` is on `P_{1,n}` is:\n`sum_{k \\text{ odd}, 1 \\le k < n} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}` (for `1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v`)\n`+ sum_{k \\text{ odd}, 1 \\le k < n} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}` (for `1 \\in S_v, n \\in S_u`)\nThis sum is `2 * sum_{k \\text{ odd}, 1 \\le k < n} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis sum is for a specific edge `(u,v)`. We need to sum over all possible edges `(u,v)`.\nThis is `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`. This sum is `(n-1) * n^(n-4)` for `n \\ge 3` and `1` for `n=2`.\nLet `A_n = sum_{T} |P_{1,n}|` and `B_n = sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nFor `n=2`: `A_2 = 1`, `B_2 = 1`. Total sum `1 - 2*1 = -1`. Modulo `998244353`, this is `998244352`. Matches example.\nFor `n=4`: `A_4 = (4-1)*4^(4-3) = 3*4 = 12`.\n`B_4 = (4-1)*4^(4-4) = 3*1 = 3`. Total sum `12 - 2*3 = 6`.\nExample output for `n=4` is `-10`. My calculation gives `6`.\nThe discrepancy means the formula `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e = (n-1) * n^(n-4)` is probably incorrect.\n\nLet's use a different approach for `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` is `2 * n^(n-3)`. This is for `n \\ge 3`.\nFor each such tree, `y_e = k mod 2`, where `k` is the size of the component containing `1` (or `n`).\nThe sum we want is `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nThis is `sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{T: e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e`.\nLet's fix `e=(u,v)`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` and `1 \\in T_u, n \\in T_v` is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nFor each such tree, `y_e = k \\pmod 2`.\nSo `sum_{T: e \\in P_{1,n}, 1 \\in T_u, n \\in T_v} y_e = sum_{k \\text{ odd}} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThe same sum applies for `1 \\in T_v, n \\in T_u`.\nLet `S_k = C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nWe need `2 * sum_{k \\text{ odd}} S_k`.\nThis sum is taken over all `C(n,2)` possible edges `(u,v)`.\nThe total `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e` is `sum_{u \\ne v} (sum_{k \\text{ odd}} S_k)`. No, this is incorrect.\nThe sum `sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e` is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} N_k * (k \\pmod 2)`, where `N_k` is the number of trees where the path `P_{1,n}` contains an edge `e` such that one component formed by removing `e` has size `k` and contains `1`, and the other component has size `n-k` and contains `n`.\n`N_k = C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`. This is the number of trees where `1` and `n` are separated by a specific cut of size `k`.\nThis is the number of trees where removing a *specific* edge `e` creates components of size `k` and `n-k`, with `1` in the `k`-component and `n` in the `n-k`-component.\nThe sum `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}` is the total number of trees where `1` and `n` are in different components after removing *some* edge. This is `n^(n-2)`. No, this is `n^(n-3) * (n-1)`.\nThe number of trees where `1` and `n` are connected by a path of length `L` is `(n-1)! / ( (n-L)! ) * (n-L)^{n-L-1} * (L-1)! / ( (L-1)! ) * L^{L-1}`.\nThis is getting complicated. Let's use the result from a known identity or a simpler argument.\n\nThe problem states that for `n=4`, the sum is `-10`.\n`A_4 = 12`. So `12 - 2 * B_4 = -10` implies `2 * B_4 = 22`, so `B_4 = 11`.\n`B_4 = sum_{T} sum_{e \\in P_{1,4}} y_e = 11`.\nLet's check `B_4` using the formula `sum_{k \\text{ odd}} C(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nFor `n=4`, `k` can be `1` or `3`.\n`k=1`: `C(2,0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = 1 * 1 * 9 = 9`.\n`k=3`: `C(2,2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = 1 * 9 * 1 = 9`.\nSo `sum_{k \\text{ odd}} S_k = 9+9 = 18`. This is `sum_{T: 1 \\in S_u, n \\in S_v} y_e`.\nThe total `B_4` should be `18`.\nThis would give `12 - 2*18 = 12 - 36 = -24`. Still not -10.\n\nThe formula for `sum_{T} d(1,n)` is given by a result from \"Enumeration of trees by distance\" by D. S. Moon.\nThe sum of distances between two fixed vertices `u` and `v` over all `n^(n-2)` labeled trees is `(n-1)n^{n-3}` for `n \\ge 2`.\nThis is for unweighted trees, so it's `sum_{T} |P_{1,n}|`.\nFor `n=2`, `(2-1)*2^(2-3) = 1/2`. The formula is actually `(n-1)n^{n-3}` for `n \\ge 3` and `1` for `n=2`.\nSo `A_n` values are correct.\n\nLet's re-examine `y_e = |S_u| \\pmod 2`.\n`d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} w(e)`.\n`w(e) = -1` if `|S_u|` is odd (where `S_u` contains `1` and `e` separates `1` from `n`).\n`w(e) = 1` if `|S_u|` is even.\nLet `L = |P_{1,n}|`. `d(1,n) = \\sum_{j=1}^L w(e_j)`.\nLet `P_{1,n} = (v_0=1, v_1, \\dots, v_L=n)`. Let `e_j = (v_{j-1}, v_j)`.\nWhen we remove `e_j`, it splits `T` into `T_j` (containing `v_0, \\dots, v_{j-1}`) and `T'_j` (containing `v_j, \\dots, v_L`).\nThe number of vertices in `T_j` is `k_j`. Then `w(e_j) = (-1)^{k_j}`.\nSo `d(1,n) = \\sum_{j=1}^L (-1)^{k_j}`.\nThe value `k_j` is the size of the component containing vertex 1 when edge `e_j` is removed.\nFor `n=4`, `d(1,4) = -10`.\n`A_4 = 12`. `sum_{T} d(1,4) = sum_{T} (L - 2 \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,4}} y_e)`.\nWe need `sum_{T} \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}} y_e = 11`.\nThe number of trees where `P_{1,n}` has length `L` is `C(n-2, L-1) L^{L-1} (n-L)^{n-L-1}`.\nLet `N(L) = C(n-2, L-1) L^{L-1} (n-L)^{n-L-1}`.\nFor `n=4`, `L` can be `1, 2, 3`.\n`N(1) = C(2,0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = 9`.\n`N(2) = C(2,1) * 2^1 * 2^1 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n`N(3) = C(2,2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = 9`.\nTotal trees: `9+8+9 = 26`. But `n^(n-2) = 4^2 = 16`. This is incorrect.\nThe formula `C(n-2, L-1) L^{L-1} (n-L)^{n-L-1}` is for trees where the path `P_{1,n}` has length `L` and the *intermediate vertices* are specified.\nThe number of trees where path `P_{1,n}` has length `L` is `(n-2)! / (L-1)! * C(n-L,0) * L^{L-1} * (n-L-1)!`.\nNo, this is `(n-2)! / (L-1)! * n^{n-L-2} * L^{L-1}`. This is `(n-2)! / (L-1)! * n^{n-L-2} * L^{L-1}`.\n\nLet's use a simpler known identity:\n`sum_{T} d(u,v)` for unweighted trees is `(n-1)n^{n-3}` for `n \\ge 3`.\nThe sum of `w(e)` values over all good trees.\nThe total sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis is for a fixed edge `e=(u,v)` that separates `1` from `n`.\nThis sum is `sum_{T} d(1,n) = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis formula is for `sum_{T} d(1,n)` directly.\nLet `n=2`. `k=1`. `(-1)^1 * C(0,0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = -1`. Matches example.\nLet `n=4`. `k=1, 2, 3`.\n`k=1`: `(-1)^1 * C(2,0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 9 = -9`.\n`k=2`: `(-1)^2 * C(2,1) * 2^1 * 2^1 = 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n`k=3`: `(-1)^3 * C(2,2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 9 * 1 = -9`.\nSum: `-9 + 8 - 9 = -10`. Matches example!\n\nSo the final formula is:\nIf `n` is odd, the answer is 0.\nIf `n` is even: `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\pmod{998244353}`.\n\nWe need to compute combinations `C(N, K)`, powers `A^B`, and factorials.\n`N = n-2`, `K = k-1`.\n`C(N,K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)`.\n`k^{k-1}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThe sum goes up to `n-1`. `n` can be up to `5 \\cdot 10^5`.\nWe need precomputed factorials and inverse factorials modulo `998244353`.\n`MOD = 998244353`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. If `n % 2 != 0`, print 0.\n2. If `n == 1`, print 0. (Already covered by `n % 2 != 0`)\n3. If `n == 2`, print `MOD - 1`. (Covered by formula: `(-1)^1 * C(0,0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = -1`).\n4. Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n5. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `n-2`.\n   `fact[i] = i!`\n   `inv_fact[i] = (i!)^(-1) mod MOD`.\n   `inv_fact[i] = pow(fact[i], MOD-2, MOD)`.\n   `C(N, K) = fact[N] * inv_fact[K] % MOD * inv_fact[N-K] % MOD`.\n6. Loop `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n   a. `term = C(n-2, k-1)`\n   b. `term = (term * pow(k, k-1, MOD)) % MOD`\n   c. `term = (term * pow(n-k, n-k-1, MOD)) % MOD`\n   d. If `k` is odd, `total_sum = (total_sum - term + MOD) % MOD`.\n   e. If `k` is even, `total_sum = (total_sum + term) % MOD`.\n7. Print `total_sum`.\n\nEdge cases for `pow(x, y, MOD)`:\n`0^0` is typically `1` in combinatorics.\nWhen `k=1`, `k-1=0`. `pow(1,0,MOD)=1`.\nWhen `n-k=1`, `n-k-1=0`. `pow(1,0,MOD)=1`.\nWhen `k=0` or `n-k=0`, this means `k` is not in range `1` to `n-1`. `k` is always `\\ge 1`.\n`n-k` can be `0` if `k=n`. But `k` goes up to `n-1`. So `n-k` is always `\\ge 1`.\nSo `k^{k-1}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-1}` are always well-defined as `1^0=1`.\n\nExample `n=43434`: `n` is even. Calculate sum.\n`MOD = 998244353`.\nMax `n-2` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 - 2`. Factorials up to `5 \\cdot 10^5`.\nEach iteration involves `C(N,K)` and two `pow` calls. `pow` is `O(log B)`.\nTotal complexity `O(N log N)`. This is fine. `5 \\cdot 10^5 * log(5 \\cdot 10^5)` is feasible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if n == 1: # n=1 is odd, but special case for d(1,1)=0\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n    MAX_N_MINUS_2 = n - 2\n    fact = [1] * (MAX_N_MINUS_2 + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (MAX_N_MINUS_2 + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, MAX_N_MINUS_2 + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact[MAX_N_MINUS_2] = pow(fact[MAX_N_MINUS_2], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(MAX_N_MINUS_2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\n    def nCr_mod_p(N, R):\n        if R < 0 or R > N:\n            return 0\n        num = fact[N]\n        den = (inv_fact[R] * inv_fact[N-R]) % MOD\n        return (num * den) % MOD\n\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Loop k from 1 to n-1\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        # C(n-2, k-1)\n        term_C = nCr_mod_p(n - 2, k - 1)\n        \n        # k^(k-1)\n        # Handle 0^0 = 1 for k=1 (k-1=0)\n        term_k_power = pow(k, k - 1, MOD)\n        \n        # (n-k)^(n-k-1)\n        # Handle 0^0 = 1 for n-k=1 (n-k-1=0)\n        term_nk_power = pow(n - k, n - k - 1, MOD)\n        \n        term = (term_C * term_k_power) % MOD\n        term = (term * term_nk_power) % MOD\n        \n        if k % 2 != 0: # k is odd, so (-1)^k is -1\n            total_sum = (total_sum - term + MOD) % MOD\n        else: # k is even, so (-1)^k is 1\n            total_sum = (total_sum + term) % MOD\n            \n    print(total_sum)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
