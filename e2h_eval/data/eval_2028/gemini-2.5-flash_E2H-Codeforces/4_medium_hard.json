The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core idea is that since both Nikephoros and Polycarpus use cyclical strategies, the game's outcomes will *also* be cyclical. That means we don't need to simulate *every* round. My approach will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Cycle Length:** First, I'll figure out how long it takes for the game's pattern to repeat. This is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences, which is `lcm(m, k)`. Efficiently, I'll calculate this using `lcm(m,k) = (m * k) // gcd(m,k)`.\n\n2.  **Simulate One Cycle:** I'll simulate a single cycle of `L` rounds. This'll tell me how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus each lose within that cycle. I can determine the number of red spots in the cycle. This is done round by round, comparing the move and getting outcome. If Nikephoros loses, I increment `n_losses_in_cycle`, else if Polycarpus loses, I increment `p_losses_in_cycle`.\n\n3.  **Count Full Cycles:** The total number of rounds, `n`, can be broken into full cycles (repeats of length `L`) and some leftover rounds. I'll determine how many full cycles are involved using integer division (`n // L`). Total losses for full cycles are found by multiplying the number of full cycles by `n_losses_in_cycle` or `p_losses_in_cycle`.\n\n4.  **Handle Remaining Rounds:** The remainder (`n % L`) gives me the number of rounds after any full cycles. I'll need to simulate these remaining rounds to calculate any additional red spots. In each of these remaining rounds, I'll compare moves and tally any additional losses using my `get_round_outcome` helper function.\n\n5.  **Final Output:**  Finally, I'll add the losses from the full cycles and the remaining rounds to get the total number of red spots for Nikephoros and Polycarpus and print them.\n\nThe key to efficiency here is avoiding direct simulation of all the rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of the cyclic sequences and calculating the results for a single cycle. It's concise, clear, and takes into consideration the large input constraints.  I've double-checked my helper function and edge cases to ensure the logic and code is correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the number of red spots (losses) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both players use a cyclic strategy: Nikephoros repeats a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus repeats a sequence `B` of length `k`. The total number of rounds `n` can be very large (up to 2 * 10^9), while `m` and `k` are relatively small (up to 1000).\n\n**Understanding the Cyclic Nature:**\n\nSince both players use cyclic sequences, the pair of moves played in each round `i` will also follow a cyclic pattern.\n*   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n*   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\nThe combined sequence of pairs `(A[i % m], B[i % k])` will repeat with a period equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\nLet `L = LCM(m, k)`. We can calculate `L` using the formula `L = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)`, where `GCD` is the Greatest Common Divisor. Since `m, k <= 1000`, the maximum value for `L` is `1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000`. This means one full cycle of the game pattern consists of at most 1 million rounds, which is small enough to simulate directly.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Cycle Length:**\n    *   Determine `m = len(A)` and `k = len(B)`.\n    *   Compute `g = GCD(m, k)` using `math.gcd()`.\n    *   Calculate `cycle_length = (m * k) // g`.\n\n2.  **Simulate One Full Cycle:**\n    *   Initialize `n_losses_in_cycle = 0` and `p_losses_in_cycle = 0`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `cycle_length - 1`:\n        *   Get Nikephoros's move: `n_move = A[i % m]`.\n        *   Get Polycarpus's move: `p_move = B[i % k]`.\n        *   Determine the winner of the round:\n            *   If `n_move` beats `p_move` (Nikephoros wins), increment `p_losses_in_cycle`.\n            *   If `p_move` beats `n_move` (Polycarpus wins), increment `n_losses_in_cycle`.\n            *   If it's a draw, neither count is incremented.\n\n3.  **Calculate Losses for Full `n` Rounds:**\n    *   Determine how many full cycles fit into `n`: `num_full_cycles = n // cycle_length`.\n    *   Calculate initial total losses:\n        *   `n_total_losses = num_full_cycles * n_losses_in_cycle`\n        *   `p_total_losses = num_full_cycles * p_losses_in_cycle`\n\n4.  **Simulate Remaining Rounds:**\n    *   Determine the number of rounds remaining after the full cycles: `remaining_rounds = n % cycle_length`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`:\n        *   Get Nikephoros's move: `n_move = A[i % m]`.\n        *   Get Polycarpus's move: `p_move = B[i % k]`.\n        *   Determine the winner of the round:\n            *   If `n_move` beats `p_move`, increment `p_total_losses`.\n            *   If `p_move` beats `n_move`, increment `n_total_losses`.\n\n5.  **Print Results:** Output `n_total_losses` and `p_total_losses`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n = 7`, `A = \"RPS\"` (`m=3`), `B = \"RSPP\"` (`k=4`)\n\n1.  **Cycle Length:**\n    *   `GCD(3, 4) = 1`\n    *   `cycle_length = (3 * 4) // 1 = 12`\n\n2.  **Simulate One Full Cycle (12 rounds):**\n    | Round `i` | N Move (`A[i%3]`) | P Move (`B[i%4]`) | Outcome (N vs P) | N Losses | P Losses |\n    | :-------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :------- | :------- |\n    | 0         | R                 | R                 | Draw             | 0        | 0        |\n    | 1         | P                 | S                 | P wins           | 1        | 0        |\n    | 2         | S                 | P                 | N wins           | 1        | 1        |\n    | 3         | R                 | P                 | P wins           | 2        | 1        |\n    | 4         | P                 | R                 | N wins           | 2        | 2        |\n    | 5         | S                 | S                 | Draw             | 2        | 2        |\n    | 6         | R                 | P                 | P wins           | 3        | 2        |\n    | 7         | P                 | P                 | Draw             | 3        | 2        |\n    | 8         | S                 | R                 | N wins           | 3        | 3        |\n    | 9         | R                 | S                 | N wins           | 3        | 4        |\n    | 10        | P                 | P                 | Draw             | 3        | 4        |\n    | 11        | S                 | P                 | N wins           | 3        | 5        |\n    After 12 rounds: `n_losses_in_cycle = 3`, `p_losses_in_cycle = 5`.\n\n3.  **Losses for Full `n` Rounds:**\n    *   `num_full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0`\n    *   `n_total_losses = 0 * 3 = 0`\n    *   `p_total_losses = 0 * 5 = 0`\n\n4.  **Simulate Remaining Rounds:**\n    *   `remaining_rounds = 7 % 12 = 7`\n    *   We simulate rounds `i = 0` to `6` (the first 7 rounds of the cycle):\n    | Round `i` | N Move | P Move | Outcome (N vs P) | N Total Losses | P Total Losses |\n    | :-------- | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :------------- | :------------- |\n    | 0         | R      | R      | Draw             | 0              | 0              |\n    | 1         | P      | S      | P wins           | 1              | 0              |\n    | 2         | S      | P      | N wins           | 1              | 1              |\n    | 3         | R      | P      | P wins           | 2              | 1              |\n    | 4         | P      | R      | N wins           | 2              | 2              |\n    | 5         | S      | S      | Draw             | 2              | 2              |\n    | 6         | R      | P      | P wins           | 3              | 2              |\n\n5.  **Print Results:** `3 2`.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the game.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    #
