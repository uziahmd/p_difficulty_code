There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Tennis Championship Problem: A Python Script Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to build a Python script to solve this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. The core of it seems to be figuring out the *maximum* number of games the tournament winner can play, given this specific constraint: two players only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one. Both players must have won all their previous games.\n\nLet's call the number of games played by a player `k`.  The rule is that if player A has played `k_A` games and player B has played `k_B` games, then `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1`.\n\nThe tournament is a knockout, which means with `n` players, there are `n-1` games total.  We want the *winner* to have played the maximum number of games, `G`.\n\nI'm thinking, let's look at `f(k)` which would be the minimum number of players needed to get a winner who has played `k` games (or, perhaps more helpfully, the maximum number of players that can be supported with a winner playing `k` games).\n\nThe rule about game difference is key.  In the first round, everyone is at zero games. Then, someone with 1 game can only play someone with 0 or 1 games.  Makes sense.  If a player is at game `k`, their opponent could be at `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\n\nIf my player is at `k` games and about to play their `k`-th game, their opponent, let's call them `O`, must have played some number of games `k_O` such that `abs((k-1) - k_O) <= 1`.\n\nSo `k_O` could be `k-2`, `k-1` or `k`. However, if the opponent has played `k` games, then they have already *won* `k` games and they would be the tournament's current champion.\n\nThis means if the winner has played `k` games then, on their way to `k` games, the winner can have played only opponents who are at game counts `k-2` or `k-1` when the winner has played `k-1` games.\n\nAlright, I think I have a handle on the core logic. Time to start coding this up.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games a player has won. To play their `k+1`-th game, a player must have won `k` games. Let's call this player `P_A`.\nTheir opponent, `P_B`, must have won `k_B` games such that `abs(k - k_B) <= 1`.\nThis means `k_B` can be `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`.\nHowever, `P_B` cannot have won `k+1` games, because if they had, they would have played more games than `P_A` and would be further along in the tournament structure. If `P_B` had won `k+1` games, `P_A` would be playing their `k+1`-th game, not `k`-th.\nSo, `P_B` must have won either `k-1` games or `k` games.\n\nLet `N(g)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `g` games, while adhering to the rule.\nLet `W_g` be a player who has won `g` games.\n\n1.  **To play 1 game (win 1 game):** `W_0` plays against `O_0`. Both have played 0 games. `abs(0-0) = 0 <= 1`. Valid.\n    Requires 2 players. `N(1) = 2`.\n    After the game, `W_1` has played 1 game.\n\n2.  **To play 2 games (win 2 games):** `W_1` has played 1 game.\n    `W_1` can play against `O_0` (0 games played) or `O_1` (1 game played).\n    *   If `W_1` plays `O_0`: `abs(1-0) = 1 <= 1`. Valid.\n        This requires 1 player who has played 1 game, and 1 player who has played 0 games.\n        To get `W_1`, we need 2 initial players (who play 1 game). So, total players needed: 2 (for `W_1`) + 1 (for `O_0`) = 3.\n        In this scenario, `W_1` beats `O_0`. `W_2` has played 2 games.\n    *   If `W_1` plays `O_1`: `abs(1-1) = 0 <= 1`. Valid.\n        This requires 1 player who has played 1 game, and another player who has played 1 game.\n        To get two players who have played 1 game, we need two separate initial games. Each initial game requires 2 players. So, total players needed: 2 + 2 = 4.\n        In this scenario, `W_1` beats `O_1`. `W_2` has played 2 games.\n\n    To maximize the winner's games for a given `n`, we want to use as few players as possible to advance the winner. So, `W_1` playing `O_0` is more efficient in terms of players.\n    However, we are looking for the *maximum* number of games for the winner. This means we want to find the largest `g` such that `N(g) <= n`.\n    The \"more efficient\" path (playing `O_0`) produces a winner who has played 2 games using 3 players.\n    The \"less efficient\" path (playing `O_1`) produces a winner who has played 2 games using 4 players.\n    For `n=3`, the winner can play 2 games (1 beats 2, 1 beats 3).\n    For `n=4`, the winner can play 2 games. For example, (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4). Then winner of (1 vs 2) plays winner of (3 vs 4). Both have played 1 game. The final winner plays 2 games.\n\nLet's define `F(k)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n`F(0) = 1` (A player who hasn't played yet).\n`F(1) = 2` (Player 1 plays Player 2. Winner plays 1 game).\n\nTo play `k` games, the winner `W` must have won `k-1` games.\n`W` needs an opponent `O`.\n`O` can have won `k-1` games (same number of games as `W`).\n`O` can have won `k-2` games (one fewer game than `W`).\n\nIf `W` plays `O` where `O` has won `k-1` games:\nThis requires two players who have both won `k-1` games.\nThe total number of initial players needed is `F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)`.\nIn this case, `F(k) = 2 * F(k-1)`.\n\nIf `W` plays `O` where `O` has won `k-2` games:\nThis requires one player who has won `k-1` games, and one player who has won `k-2` games.\nThe total number of initial players needed is `F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\nIn this case, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n\nTo maximize the number of games for the winner given `n` players, we want to choose the strategy that requires the *fewest* players for each additional game played by the winner.\nComparing `2 * F(k-1)` and `F(k-1) + F(k-2)`:\n`F(k-1) + F(k-2)` will always be less than or equal to `2 * F(k-1)` (since `F(k-2) <= F(k-1)`).\nSo, to get a winner who has played `k` games using the minimum number of players, we should always choose the opponent who has played `k-2` games.\n\nThis means `F(k)` follows the Fibonacci sequence: `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\nLet's establish the base cases:\n`F(0)`: 1 player (player hasn't played yet).\n`F(1)`: 2 players (1 vs 2. Winner plays 1 game).\n`F(2)`: `F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3` players. (Winner of (1 vs 2) (1 game played) plays player 3 (0 games played). Winner plays 2 games).\n`F(3)`: `F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5` players.\n`F(4)`: `F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8` players.\nAnd so on.\n\nThe sequence `F(k)` represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's list the Fibonacci sequence starting with `F_0=1, F_1=2`:\n`k=0`: `F_0 = 1`\n`k=1`: `F_1 = 2`\n`k=2`: `F_2 = 3`\n`k=3`: `F_3 = 5`\n`k=4`: `F_4 = 8`\n`k=5`: `F_5 = 13`\n...\n\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `F_k <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively until they exceed `n`.\n\nExample walkthrough:\n`n = 2`:\n`F_0 = 1 <= 2`\n`F_1 = 2 <= 2`\n`F_2 = 3 > 2`\nMax games = 1.\n\n`n = 3`:\n`F_0 = 1 <= 3`\n`F_1 = 2 <= 3`\n`F_2 = 3 <= 3`\n`F_3 = 5 > 3`\nMax games = 2.\n\n`n = 4`:\n`F_0 = 1 <= 4`\n`F_1 = 2 <= 4`\n`F_2 = 3 <= 4`\n`F_3 = 5 > 4`\nMax games = 2.\nNote: For `n=4`, we could have (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Winners play. Winner plays 2 games. This uses `2 * F(1) = 2 * 2 = 4` players. This is `2 * F(k-1)` strategy. The `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` strategy (which is `F(2)=3`) is for `n=3`. Since we have `n=4`, which is greater than `F(2)=3`, we can still achieve 2 games. `F(3)=5` is the next minimum for 3 games, which `n=4` cannot support.\n\nThe logic holds: `F(k)` is the *minimum* number of players to achieve `k` games for the winner. If `n >= F(k)`, then `k` games are possible. We find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1`, `b = 2` (representing `F(0)` and `F(1)`).\n2. Initialize `games = 1` (since `n >= 2`, at least 1 game is always possible).\n3. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `temp = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a = b`.\n   c. Update `b = temp`.\n   d. Increment `games`.\n4. Print `games`.\n\nLet's re-check the initial values for `a` and `b` and `games`.\nIf `n=2`:\nInitial: `a=1, b=2, games=1`.\nLoop: `b (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n  `temp = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n  `a = 2`.\n  `b = 3`.\n  `games = 2`.\nLoop: `b (3) <= n (2)` is false.\nPrint `games = 2`. This is incorrect for `n=2`. Expected output is 1.\n\nThe `games` counter should track the index `k` for `F_k`.\nLet `f_prev = 1` (for `k=0`)\nLet `f_curr = 2` (for `k=1`)\nLet `games_count = 1` (current games possible for `f_curr`)\n\nIf `n=2`:\n`f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `games_count = 1`.\nLoop: `f_curr (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n  `next_f = f_prev + f_curr = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n  `f_prev = f_curr = 2`.\n  `f_curr = next_f = 3`.\n  `games_count = 2`.\nLoop: `f_curr (3) <= n (2)` is false.\nPrint `games_count = 2`. Still incorrect.\n\nThe `games_count` should be incremented *before* checking the condition, or initialized differently.\nLet `fib_a = 1` (represents `F_0`)\nLet `fib_b = 1` (represents `F_1` in standard Fibonacci, but here we need `F_1` to be 2)\n\nLet's use `f0` and `f1` for the Fibonacci numbers and `k` for the number of games.\n`k = 0`: `f0 = 1` (1 player, 0 games played)\n`k = 1`: `f1 = 2` (2 players, winner plays 1 game)\n\nInitialize:\n`k_games = 1`\n`f_k_minus_1 = 1` (corresponds to `F(0)`)\n`f_k = 2` (corresponds to `F(1)`)\n\nLoop to find `k` such that `F(k) <= n`:\nWhile `f_k <= n`:\n  `next_f_k = f_k_minus_1 + f_k`\n  `f_k_minus_1 = f_k`\n  `f_k = next_f_k`\n  `k_games += 1`\n\nAfter the loop, `f_k` is the first Fibonacci number *greater* than `n`.\nThe `k_games` value will be one step ahead. So we need to subtract 1.\n\nLet's trace again:\n`n = 2`:\nInitial: `k_games = 1`, `f_k_minus_1 = 1`, `f_k = 2`.\nLoop: `f_k (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n  `next_f_k = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n  `f_k_minus_1 = 2`.\n  `f_k = 3`.\n  `k_games = 2`.\nLoop: `f_k (3) <= n (2)` is false.

Loop ends.\nPrint `k_games - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct for `n=4`.\n\n`n = 10`:\nInitial: `k_games = 1`, `f_k_minus_1 = 1`, `f_k = 2`.\n1. `f_k (2) <= 10`: True. `next_f_k = 3`. `f_k_minus_1 = 2`, `f_k = 3`. `k_games = 2`.\n2. `f_k (3) <= 10`: True. `next_f_k = 5`. `f_k_minus_1 = 3`, `f_k = 5`. `k_games = 3`.\n3. `f_k (5) <= 10`: True. `next_f_k = 8`. `f_k_minus_1 = 5`, `f_k = 8`. `k_games = 4`.\n4. `f_k (8) <= 10`: True. `next_f_k = 13`. `f_k_minus_1 = 8`, `f_k = 13`. `k_games = 5`.\n5. `f_k (13) <= 10`: False. Loop ends.\nPrint `k_games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`. Correct for `n=10`.\n\nThis logic seems robust. The maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `F_90` is approximately `2.8 * 10^18`. So, the loop will run at most about 90 times, which is very efficient.
