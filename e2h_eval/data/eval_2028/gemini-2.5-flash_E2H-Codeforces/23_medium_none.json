            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nMy goal is to figure out the fewest tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make a winning set (a \"mentsu\") from an initial hand of three tiles. A mentsu is either a triplet of identical tiles (like three 1s) or a run of three sequential tiles of the same suit (like 1, 2, 3 of \"s\").\n\nI'm breaking down the problem into cases:\n\n*   **Zero Draws:** First, I'll check if the initial three tiles *already* form a mentsu.  I need to check for both the triplet and run possibilities. For the run, I'll compare the suits and ensure the numbers are consecutive.\n*   **One Draw:** If the initial hand isn't a mentsu, I'll see if drawing just *one* extra tile makes a winning set possible.  This means, among the four tiles (the three initial ones plus the draw), there needs to be a pair that, with an extra tile, can be formed into a winning set.  I need to consider all possible pairs within the starting tiles to check if two are the same or could build into a sequence.\n*   **Two Draws:** If I can't form a mentsu in zero or one draws, I know two draws will *always* be enough. With two draws, I have five tiles, so I can always complete a winning set. For example, by drawing two of any tile I already have, I can make a triplet.\n\n**My Approach:**\n\n1.  **Parse the input:** I'll read the tile strings ('1s', '2m', etc.) and convert them into a handy format, like a list of (number, suit) tuples, to make comparisons easier.\n2.  **Check for zero draws:** I'll check if the tiles already are a koutsu (triplet) or shuntsu (sequence).\n3.  **Check for one draw:** If that failed, I'll go through all possible pairs within my hand to see if either:\n    *   I have two of the same tile, meaning I can just draw one more to make a triplet.\n    *   I have two tiles of the same suit that are part of a sequence (like 2s, 3s). In this case, I can draw the missing tile (1s or 4s in this case, or 3s in the case of 2s, 4s).\n4.  **If all else fails, the answer is 2:** If the above tests don't work, that indicates I need two draws to form a valid mentsu.\n",
    "response": "Tokitsukaze needs to form a mentsu (meld) using her tiles. A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles and can draw any number of additional tiles. We need to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw.\n\nThe minimum number of draws can be 0, 1, or 2. It cannot be more than 2 because, in the worst case, she can always pick one of her existing tiles and draw two more identical tiles to form a koutsu (e.g., if she has '1m', she can draw two more '1m' to get '1m, 1m, 1m').\n\nThe strategy is to check these possibilities in increasing order of draws:\n\n1.  **0 Draws:** Check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    *   **Koutsu:** Are all three tiles identical?\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Are all three tiles of the same suit AND do their numbers form a sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 3)?\n    *   If yes, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **1 Draw:** If 0 draws is not enough, check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This means among her initial three tiles, there must be a pair that can be completed into a mentsu with one additional tile.\n    *   **Koutsu:** Are any two of her tiles identical? If she has `[X, X, Y]`, she can draw another `X` to form `[X, X, X]`.\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Are any two of her tiles of the same suit and their numbers are separated by at most 2?\n        *   If she has `[X_s, (X+1)_s]`, she can draw `(X-1)_s` (if `X > 1`) or `(X+2)_s` (if `X < 8`) to form a sequence.\n        *   If she has `[X_s, (X+2)_s]`, she can draw `(X+1)_s` to form a sequence.\n    *   If any of these conditions are met for any pair of her initial three tiles, the answer is 1.\n\n3.  **2 Draws:** If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws are always enough. As explained, she can pick any tile she has and draw two more identical tiles to form a koutsu. So, the answer is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   Tiles are represented as tuples `(number, suit_char)`, e.g., '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`.\n*   For shuntsu checks, numbers are extracted and sorted to easily verify sequential order.\n*   For checking pairs, we iterate through the three unique pairs of tiles `(t0, t1), (t0, t2), (t1, t2)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to parse a tile string into a (number, suit) tuple\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    num = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    return (num, suit)\n\n# Function to check if the three tiles already form a mentsu (0 draws needed)\ndef check_0_draws(tiles):\n    # Koutsu check: all three tiles are identical\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    \n    # Shuntsu check: all three tiles are of the same suit AND form a sequence\n    # First, check if all suits are the same\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]:\n        # Extract numbers and sort them to easily check for sequence\n        nums = sorted([tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]])\n        # Check if numbers are sequential (e.g., 1, 2, 3)\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            return True\n            \n    return False\n\n# Function to check if a mentsu can be formed with one extra draw\ndef check_1_draw(tiles):\n    # Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the hand\n    # There are 3 pairs: (tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2])\n    \n    # Check pair (tiles[0], tiles[1])\n    t1, t2 = tiles[0], tiles[1]\n    # Koutsu possibility: If two tiles are identical, drawing a third identical tile forms a koutsu\n    if t1 == t2:\n        return True \n    # Shuntsu possibility: If two tiles are of the same suit and can form a sequence with one missing tile\n    if t1[1] == t2[1]: # Same suit\n        n1, n2 = t1[0], t2[0]\n        # If numbers are n, n+1 (e.g., 2m, 3m), can draw n-1 or n+2 to form a sequence\n        # If numbers are n, n+2 (e.g., 2m, 4m), can draw n+1 to form a sequence\n        # In both cases, the absolute difference between numbers is 1 or 2.\n        if abs(n1 - n2) <= 2:\n            return True\n            \n    # Check pair (tiles[0], tiles[2])\n    t1, t2 = tiles[0], tiles[2]\n    if t1 == t2:\n        return True\n    if t1[1] == t2[1]:\n        n1, n2 = t1[0], t2[0]\n        if abs(n1 - n2) <= 2:\n            return True\n            \n    # Check pair (tiles[1], tiles[2])\n    t1, t2 = tiles[1], tiles[2]\n    if t1 == t2:\n        return True\n    if t1[1] == t2[1]:\n        n1, n2 = t1[0], t2[0]\n        if abs(n1 - n2) <= 2:\n            return True\n                    \n    return False\n\n# Main function to solve the problem\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input line and split into tile strings\n    input_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    tile_strings = input_str.split()\n    \n    # Parse tile strings into a list of (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = [parse_tile(s) for s in tile_strings]\n\n    # Check for 0 draws needed\n    if check_0_draws(tiles):\n        print(0)\n    # Check for 1 draw needed\n    elif check_1_draw(tiles):\n        print(1)\n    # If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws are always enough\n    else:\n        print(2)\n\n# Entry point of the script\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
