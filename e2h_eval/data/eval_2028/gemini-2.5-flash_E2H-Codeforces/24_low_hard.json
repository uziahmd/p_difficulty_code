She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on the \"Browser\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Browser\" problem, and my immediate goal is to crank out a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down the core elements. We've got `n` tabs, a cursor at position `pos`, and a crucial segment `[l, r]` that needs to stay open. The rest *must* be closed. The key actions seem straightforward, each taking a second: move the cursor left or right, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nI need to minimize the time to clear those unwanted tabs.  My initial reaction is to consider dynamic programming or a greedy approach. Given that `n` tops out at 100, DP feels potentially feasible, but the state definition might be a bit nuanced. Let's see if a more intuitive strategy emerges.\n\nMy first impulse is to analyze the initial state; `a = 1`, `b = n`, and what needs to be closed are  `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. There has to be some kind of pattern.\n\nThe trivial edge case immediately jumps out: If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, we're done!  Zero time. So, that's taken care of.\n\nThe remaining scenarios are: only the left side needs to be closed, only the right side needs to be closed, or both. The crucial detail is that closing tabs, regardless of how many, takes a single second. That's a real giveaway!  Moving the cursor, however, incurs a time cost for each step.\n\nMy mind immediately begins visualizing these scenarios.\nFor `l = 1` and `r < n`, I only need to close tabs from `r+1` up to `n`.  I need to get my cursor to some point at or to the right of `r+1` and then close everything to the right. I'm starting to zero in on how to calculate the most efficient path. I need to keep in mind the current cursor location, as that is a critical factor!\n",
