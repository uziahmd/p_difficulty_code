Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem. It's essentially a geometric matching problem with a non-intersection constraint. I need to connect Rebel spaceships to bases, ensuring the paths don't cross. The input constraints (R, B <= 10, integer coordinates within +/- 10000) strongly suggest a brute-force approach might be viable, given the relatively small factorial complexity of permutations.  The core of the problem lies in efficiently detecting whether two line segments intersect or not.  The \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee is a huge help; it should simplify the intersection detection logic and save computation time.\n\n**Intersection Detection**\n\nThe key to this is understanding proper intersections (excluding shared endpoints). With the guarantee of no collinear points, I can simplify the intersection check. Two segments intersect properly if and only if their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other's lines. The orientation function (using the cross product) will be my primary tool.\n\n**Algorithmic Approach**\n\nMy plan is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Input:** Read the Rebel and base coordinates.\n2.  **Validation:** Check if R equals B. If not, immediately output \"No\".\n3.  **Permutation Iteration:** Generate all permutations of bases. For each permutation:\n    *   Form the segments connecting each Rebel to its assigned base.\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of segments in this configuration.\n    *   Use the `do_intersect` function (which will call `orientation`) to check for intersection.\n    *   If any pair intersects, discard this permutation and move to the next.\n    *   If no intersections are found, output \"Yes\" and terminate.\n4.  **No Solution:** If all permutations are exhausted without finding a valid non-intersecting configuration, output \"No\".\n\n**Detailed Intersection Check**\n\nI'll use the cross-product to detect orientations. Two segments intersect if, and only if, their endpoints are on opposite sides. No collinear points mean I only have three valid orientation outcomes. I am aiming to use a `do_intersect` function:\n\n*   The function will take two segments (defined by their endpoints) as input.\n*   It will perform orientation checks to see if the endpoints are on opposite sides of each other's lines.\n*   It will return \"True\" for intersection, \"False\" otherwise.\n\n**Coding Strategy**\n\nI'll define a `Point` class or structure for clarity. The code will involve the implementation of `orientation` and `do_intersect` with the detailed logic. The loop structure will be set up to iterate through permutations and test for intersections. I am confident in the correctness of my code given these checks.\n\n**Optimization Considerations**\n\nThe complexity is primarily dictated by the `N!` permutations.  While the intersection check's N-squared iterations and the orientation calls are less of a bottleneck, it's worth writing the logic in a way that minimizes redundant calculations within each `do_intersect` call.\n\n**Validation & Debugging**\n\nI will test the code with the example inputs provided in the problem description, carefully tracing its execution and confirming the results. The \"No three points on a line\" is a crucial aspect to handle. The `orientation` logic must ensure that this condition is handled correctly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, and no two paths (straight line segments) from a spaceship to its assigned base intersect. We are given the coordinates of all spaceships and bases.\n\n**1. Initial Check: Number of Spaceships and Bases**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible to satisfy the \"exactly one guardian per base\" and \"exactly one assigned base per spaceship\" conditions. In this case, we can immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. The Non-Intersecting Paths Constraint**\nThis is the core of the problem. We need to find an assignment (a permutation of bases for the spaceships) such that if we draw straight lines between each spaceship and its assigned base, no two lines cross each other.\n\n**3. Small Constraints Hint at Brute Force**\nThe problem states `1 <= R, B <= 10`. This is a very small constraint, which strongly suggests that a brute-force approach iterating through all possible assignments might be feasible.\n\nLet `N = R = B`. There are `N!` ways to assign `N` bases to `N` spaceships. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`. This number of permutations is small enough to iterate through.\n\n**4. Algorithm**\nThe algorithm will be as follows:\na. Read `R` and `B`.\nb. Read the coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships into a list `rebels`.\nc. Read the coordinates of `B` bases into a list `bases`.\nd. If `R != B`, print \"No\" and terminate.\ne. Let `N = R`.\nf. Iterate through every possible permutation of the `bases` list. For each permutation `P = (p_0, p_1, ..., p_{N-1})`:\n    i. Form `N` segments: `(rebels[0], p_0), (rebels[1], p_1), ..., (rebels[N-1], p_{N-1})`.\n    ii. Check if any two of these `N` segments intersect.\n        - Iterate through all unique pairs of segments `(segment_i, segment_j)`.\n        - For each pair, use a geometric test to determine if they intersect.\n        - If an intersection is found, this permutation is invalid. Stop checking this permutation and move to the next one.\n    iii. If no intersections are found after checking all pairs for the current permutation, then we have found a valid assignment. Print \"Yes\" and terminate.\ng. If all permutations are checked and none are valid, print \"No\".\n\n**5. Intersection Test (Orientation / Cross Product)**\nTo check if two line segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` intersect, we can use the concept of orientation (or cross product).\nThe orientation of an ordered triplet of points `(A, B, C)` tells us if `C` is to the left (counter-clockwise), right (clockwise), or collinear with respect to the directed line segment `AB`.\nThe function `orientation(P, Q, R)` can be calculated as `(Q.y - P.y) * (R.x - Q.x) - (Q.x - P.x) * (R.y - Q.y)`.\n- If `> 0`, `R` is counter-clockwise (left) of `PQ`.\n- If `< 0`, `R` is clockwise (right) of `PQ`.\n- If `= 0`, `R` is collinear with `PQ`.\n\nThe problem guarantees that \"no three points are on the same line\". This simplifies the intersection test:\nTwo segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` properly intersect if and only if:\n1. `P1` and `Q1` are on opposite sides of the line `P2Q2`, AND\n2. `P2` and `Q2` are on opposite sides of the line `P1Q1`.\n\nIn terms of orientation:\n`orientation(P1, Q1, P2)` and `orientation(P1, Q1, Q2)` must have different signs (one positive, one negative).\nAND\n`orientation(P2, Q2, P1)` and `orientation(P2, Q2, Q1)` must have different signs.\n\nSince no three points are collinear, `orientation` will never return 0, so we just need to check if the signs are different.\n\n**6. Complexity**\n- `N` is up to 10.\n- Number of permutations: `N!`\n- For each permutation, we form `N` segments.\n- We check `N * (N-1) / 2` pairs of segments. This is `O(N^2)`.\n- Each intersection check involves 4 calls to `orientation`, which are constant time arithmetic operations.\n- Total complexity: `O(N! * N^2)`.\n- For `N=10`: `10! * 10^2 = 3,628,800 * 100 = 3.6 * 10^8`. This is on the higher side for a 1-second time limit but often passes for simple integer arithmetic operations.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\nInput:\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\n`R=3, B=3`. `N=3`.\nRebels: `R0=(0,0), R1=(2,0), R2=(3,1)`\nBases: `B0=(-2,1), B1=(0,3), B2=(2,2)`\n\nConsider the permutation of bases `(B0, B1, B2)`. This forms segments:\n`S0 = (R0, B0) = ((0,0), (-2,1))`\n`S1 = (R1, B1) = ((2,0), (0,3))`\n`S2 = (R2, B2) = ((3,1), (2,2))`\n\nCheck pairs:\n- `S0` and `S1`:\n  - `P1=(0,0), Q1=(-2,1), P2=(2,0), Q2=(0,3)`\n  - `orientation(P1,Q1,P2)`: `(1-0)*(2-(-2)) - (-2-0)*(0-1) = 1*4 - (-2)*(-1) = 4 - 2 = 2` (CCW)\n  - `orientation(P1,Q1,Q2)`: `(1-0)*(0-(-2)) - (-2-0)*(3-1) = 1*2 - (-2)*2 = 2 + 4 = 6` (CCW)\n  - Signs are same (both positive). They are on the same side of `P1Q1`. No intersection.\n- `S0` and `S2`: (Similarly, no intersection)\n- `S1` and `S2`: (Similarly, no intersection)\n\nSince no intersections are found for this permutation, the output is \"Yes\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define a Point class for better readability and organization of coordinates\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    # For debugging purposes, can be omitted\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Point({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n\n# Helper function to determine the orientation of an ordered triplet of points (p, q, r)\n# Returns:\n#   1 if r is counter-clockwise (left) of vector pq\n#  -1 if r is clockwise (right) of vector pq\n#   0 if p, q, r are collinear (guaranteed not to happen by problem constraints)\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Calculate the cross product (q - p) x (r - q)\n    # This is equivalent to (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)\n    val = (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - \\\n          (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)\n    \n    # The problem guarantees that no three points are on the same line.\n    # Therefore, 'val' will never be 0 for distinct points.\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1 # 1 for CCW, -1 for CW\n\n# Function to check if two line segments p1q1 and p2q2 intersect\n# Assumes no three points are collinear and all four endpoints are distinct.\ndef do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Find the four orientations needed for the general case:\n    # 1.
