On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "**Finding the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence with Segment Reversal**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem where I need to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after flipping a subsegment of a sequence containing only 1s and 2s. The key here is the 1s and 2s constraint, which makes this a bit simpler. A non-decreasing subsequence is basically a bunch of 1s followed by a bunch of 2s.\n\nInitially, I thought it would just be the total number of 1s and 2s, but that's clearly not right. The crucial point is the order *after* the reversal. The LNDS is about finding the maximum number of 1s and 2s, in that order, *after* the segment flip.\n\nI started thinking about breaking it down by looking at the reversed segment as being potentially composed of both 1s and 2s, but this was getting cumbersome.\n\nThen, I reframed the problem. I need to find some index `k` where I take all the 1s *up to* `k`, and all the 2s *from* `k+1` onwards, in the *modified* sequence `a'`. My goal is to maximize the sum of those counts: `count1(a'_1, ..., a'_k) + count2(a'_{k+1}, ..., a'_n)`. This means I have to consider *all* possible `k` values and *all* possible subsegments `[l, r]`.\n\nThis feels like a computational issue since I have to iterate over all possible `l` and `r` values for the reversal, plus all possible split points `k`. That's a triple nested loop, which is not ideal, even with the small sequence size.\n\nThe realization that an LNDS is composed of all 1s up to an index and all 2s after is the turning point here. Now I see it as iterating through possible split points and calculating the count. I believe this can be optimized with prefix sums or some clever indexing to avoid all those iterations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing an arbitrary subsegment `[l, r]` of a given sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s must consist of some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. For example, `1, 1, 2, 2`. The length of such a subsequence is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s.\n\nLet the modified sequence be `a'`. To find the LNDS of `a'`, we can iterate through all possible split points `i` (from `0` to `n`). For each `i`, we consider forming an LNDS by taking all 1s in `a'_1, ..., a'_i` and all 2s in `a'_{i+1}, ..., a'_n`. The length for this split point `i` would be `(number of 1s in a'_1, ..., a'_i) + (number of 2s in a'_{i+1}, ..., a'_n)`. The maximum over all `i` gives the LNDS length for `a'`.\n\nLet's fix the interval `[l, r]` that is reversed.\nThe sequence `a'` looks like:\n`a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` (original prefix)\n`a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l` (reversed segment)\n`a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` (original suffix)\n\nWe can iterate over all possible `l` and `r` (where `1 <= l <= r <= n`). For each `[l, r]`, we construct the modified sequence `a'` and then calculate its LNDS. Since `n` is up to 2000, `O(N^2)` choices for `[l, r]`. For each choice, calculating LNDS in `O(N)` time would lead to an `O(N^3)` solution, which is `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`, too slow. We need a faster way to calculate the LNDS.\n\nLet's analyze the counts of 1s and 2s.\nLet `prefix_ones[k]` be the count of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_k`.\nLet `suffix_twos[k]` be the count of 2s in `a_k, ..., a_n`.\nThese can be precomputed in `O(N)` time.\n`prefix_ones[0] = 0`. For `k > 0`, `prefix_ones[k] = prefix_ones[k-1] + (1 if a_k == 1 else 0)`.\n`suffix_twos[n+1] = 0`. For `k <= n`, `suffix_twos[k] = suffix_twos[k+1] + (1 if a_k == 2 else 0)`.\n\nNow, consider a fixed `[l, r]`. We want to maximize `(count of 1s in a'_1, ..., a'_i) + (count of 2s in a'_{i+1}, ..., a'_n)` over all `i`.\n\nThe split point `i` can fall into three regions:\n1. `i < l`: The split is entirely within the original prefix.\n   `count1(a'_1, ..., a'_i) = prefix_ones[i]`\n   `count2(a'_{i+1}, ..., a'_n) = count2(a_{i+1}, ..., a_{l-1}) + count2(a_r, ..., a_l) + count2(a_{r+1}, ..., a_n)`\n   This can be rewritten as `suffix_twos[i+1] - count2(a_l, ..., a_r) + count1(a_l, ..., a_r)`.\n   More simply, `suffix_twos[i+1]` is the count of 2s in `a_{i+1}, ..., a_n`. If we reverse `[l, r]`, the 2s originally in `[l, r]` are still 2s, but their positions change. The 1s in `[l, r]` are still 1s. This is the wrong way to think about it.\n   \nLet's reformulate the LNDS for `a'`:\nThe LNDS length is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count of 1s in a'_1...a'_k + count of 2s in a'_{k+1}...a'_n)`.\nThe `count of 1s in a'_1...a'_k` is `prefix_ones[k]` if `k < l`.\nThe `count of 2s in a'_{k+1}...a'_n` is `suffix_twos[k+1]` if `k >= r`.\n\nLet `ones_in_reversed[j]` be the count of 1s in `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_{r-j+1}` (i.e., the first `j` elements of the reversed segment).\nLet `twos_in_reversed[j]` be the count of 2s in `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_{r-j+1}`.\n\nThe total number of 1s in `a'` is `total_ones = prefix_ones[n]`.\nThe total number of 2s in `a'` is `total_twos = n - total_ones`.\n\nLet `c1(i, j)` be the count of 1s in `a_i, ..., a_j`.\nLet `c2(i, j)` be the count of 2s in `a_i, ..., a_j`.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\nThe LNDS length is `max_{k_split}` of `(count of 1s up to k_split) + (count of 2s from k_split+1 onwards)`.\n\nConsider the contributions from the three parts of the sequence:\n1. `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`: These elements are fixed. We can take some `x` ones from here and some `y` twos from here.\n2. `a_r, ..., a_l`: These elements are reversed. We can take some `x'` ones and some `y'` twos from here.\n3. `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`: These elements are fixed. We can take some `x''` ones and some `y''` twos from here.\n\nSince it's a non-decreasing subsequence, all 1s must come before all 2s.\nSo, we can choose a split point `p` such that we take 1s from `a'_1, ..., a'_p` and 2s from `a'_{p+1}, ..., a'_n`.\n\nLet's iterate over all possible `l` and `r` (`O(N^2)` pairs).\nFor a fixed `l, r`:\nThe elements `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` contribute `prefix_ones[l-1]` ones.\nThe elements `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` contribute `suffix_twos[r+1]` twos.\n\nWhat happens inside `[l, r]`? When `a_l, ..., a_r` is reversed to `a_r, ..., a_l`:\n- Original 1s become 1s.\n- Original 2s become 2s.\nThe crucial part is their *order*.\nAn LNDS can be formed by:\n`prefix_ones[l-1]` (all 1s before `l`)\n+ `count of 1s chosen from a_r, ..., a_l`\n+ `count of 2s chosen from a_r, ..., a_l`\n+ `suffix_twos[r+1]` (all 2s after `r`)\nThe constraint is that all chosen 1s must appear before all chosen 2s in the *final sequence*.\n\nThis means we can pick some `k` (where `l-1 <= k <= r`) such that we take all 1s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`, all 1s from `a_r, ..., a_{r-k+l}` (the first `k-(l-1)` elements of the reversed segment), and all 2s from `a_{r-k+l+1}, ..., a_l` (the remaining elements of the reversed segment), and all 2s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\n\nLet `ones_in_prefix[i]` be the count of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_i`.\nLet `twos_in_suffix[i]` be the count of 2s in `a_i, ..., a_n`.\nThese can be precomputed in `O(N)` time.\n`ones_in_prefix[i] = ones_in_prefix[i-1] + (1 if a[i-1] == 1 else 0)` (using 0-indexed array `a`)\n`twos_in_suffix[i] = twos_in_suffix[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n\nFor each pair `(l, r)`:\nThe total length of the LNDS will be:\n`ones_in_prefix[l-1]` (all 1s before index `l`)\n+ `twos_in_suffix[r]` (all 2s from index `r` onwards, this is wrong, `twos_in_suffix[r+1]` is for `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`)\n+ `max_val_in_middle` (max LNDS within the reversed segment `a_r, ..., a_l` *if we consider it in isolation*).\nThis is not quite right. The split point can be anywhere.\n\nLet's fix the split point `k` in the original sequence.\nThe LNDS is `ones_in_prefix[k] + twos_in_suffix[k+1]`.\nWe want to maximize this value.\nWhen we reverse `a_l, ..., a_r`, the only parts affected are `a_l, ..., a_r`.\nThe number of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` is `ones_in_prefix[l-1]`.\nThe number of 2s in `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` is `twos_in_suffix[r+1]`.\n\nThe total number of 1s in `a'` is `total_ones = ones_in_prefix[n]`.\nThe total number of 2s in `a'` is `total_twos = n - total_ones`.\n\nLet `LNDS(l, r)` be the length of the LNDS after reversing `a_l, ..., a_r`.\n`LNDS(l, r) = max_{0 <= i <= n} (count of 1s in a'_1...a'_i + count of 2s in a'_{i+1}...a'_n)`.\n\nWe can iterate over all possible `l` from `1` to `n`, and `r` from `l` to `n`.\nFor each `(l, r)`:\nThe modified sequence `a'` is `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\nWe need to calculate the LNDS for `a'`.\nThis can be done in `O(N)` time.\n`current_max_lnds = 0`\n`current_ones = 0`\n`temp_a = list(a)`\n`temp_a[l-1:r] = a[l-1:r][::-1]` (Python slicing for 0-indexed)\n\nFor `i` from `0` to `n`:\n  `current_ones` accumulates 1s in `temp_a[0...i-1]`.\n  `twos_in_suffix_from_i` needs to be calculated for `temp_a[i...n-1]`.\n  This is still `O(N)` for each `(l, r)` pair, leading to `O(N^3)`.\n\nLet's optimize the calculation of LNDS for `a'`.\nThe LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is `max_k (ones_up_to_k + twos_from_k_plus_1)`.\nHere, `k` is an index in the *modified* array `a'`.\nLet `cnt1[i]` be the number of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_i`.\nLet `cnt2[i]` be the number of 2s in `a_i, ..., a_n`.\nThe LNDS for the original array is `max_{i=0..n} (cnt1[i] + cnt2[i+1])`.\n\nWhen we reverse `a_l, ..., a_r`:\nThe elements `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` remain in place.\nThe elements `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` remain in place.\nThe elements `a_l, ..., a_r` are replaced by `a_r, ..., a_l`.\n\nLet's iterate over all possible `l` and `r`.\nFor a fixed `l, r`:\nThe LNDS can be formed by:\n- Taking `ones_in_prefix[l-1]` (all 1s before `l`).\n- Taking `twos_in_suffix[r+1]` (all 2s after `r`).\n- And then, from the reversed segment `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l`, we take some 1s followed by some 2s.\nThe maximum number of 1s we can take from `a_r, ..., a_l` is `c1(l, r)`.\nThe maximum number of 2s we can take from `a_r, ..., a_l` is `c2(l, r)`.\n\nSo, the LNDS for `a'` could be:\n`ones_in_prefix[l-1] + c1(l, r) + c2(l, r) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]`\nThis is simply `ones_in_prefix[l-1] + (r-l+1) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]`.\nThis is the total number of 1s before `l`, plus all elements in `[l, r]`, plus all 2s after `r`. This assumes we can perfectly separate all 1s and 2s within `[l, r]` and combine them with the prefix/suffix. This is true because `a_r, ..., a_l` is a segment, and we can take all 1s from its beginning and all 2s from its end.\nExample: `1 2 1 2`, `l=2, r=3`. `a_l...a_r` is `2 1`. Reversed: `1 2`.\n`a'` becomes `1 1 2 2`.\n`ones_in_prefix[l-1] = ones_in_prefix[1] = 1` (from `a_1`)\n`c1(l, r)` for `a_2, a_3` (i.e., `2, 1`) is `1`.\n`c2(l, r)` for `a_2, a_3` (i.e., `2, 1`) is `1`.\n`twos_in_suffix[r+1] = twos_in_suffix[4] = 1` (from `a_4`)\nTotal: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`. This matches the example.\n\nExample 2: `1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1`, `n=10`.\n`l=3, r=7`. `a_l...a_r` is `2 2 2 1 1`. Reversed: `1 1 2 2 2`.\n`a'` becomes `1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1`.\n`ones_in_prefix[l-1] = ones_in_prefix[2] = 2` (from `a_1, a_2`)\n`c1(l, r)` for `a_3...a_7` (i.e., `2 2 2 1 1`) is `2`.\n`c2(l, r)` for `a_3...a_7` (i.e., `2 2 2 1 1`) is `3`.\n`twos_in_suffix[r+1] = twos_in_suffix[8]` (from `a_8, a_9, a_{10}`) is `twos_in_suffix[8]` for `2 2 1`.\n`twos_in_suffix[8]` for `a_8, a_9, a_{10}` is `2`.\nTotal: `2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 9`. This matches the example.\n\nThis approach seems to work!\nThe logic is:\nThe LNDS will consist of all 1s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`.\nThen, from the reversed segment `a_r, ..., a_l`, we take all its 1s and all its 2s. This is valid because all 1s in the reversed segment will appear before all 2s in the reversed segment, if we consider the segment in isolation.\nThen, all 2s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\nThis works because the maximum LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the total count of 1s plus the total count of 2s, *if* all 1s can be placed before all 2s. Here, `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` contains only 1s that appear before `l`. The reversed segment `a_r, ..., a_l` can be thought of as containing `c1(l,r)` 1s and `c2(l,r)` 2s. The suffix `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` contains `twos_in_suffix[r+1]` 2s.\nThe crucial part is that the LNDS can always be constructed by taking all 1s up to some point `P`, and all 2s from some point `Q` onwards, where `P < Q`.\nIf `P` is in `a_{l-1}` and `Q` is in `a_{r+1}`, then we take all 1s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`, all 1s from `a_r, ..., a_l`, all 2s from `a_r, ..., a_l` and all 2s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`. This is exactly `ones_in_prefix[l-1] + c1(l,r) + c2(l,r) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]`.\nNote that `c1(l,r) + c2(l,r)` is simply the length of the segment `[l, r]`, which is `r - l + 1`.\nSo the formula is `ones_in_prefix[l-1] + (r - l + 1) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]`.\n\nLet's verify this.\nThe LNDS for `a'` is `max_{k} (count1(a'_1...a'_k) + count2(a'_{k+1}...a'_n))`.\nLet `k` be an index in `a'`.\nCase 1: `k < l`.\n   `count1(a'_1...a'_k) = ones_in_prefix[k]`.\n   `count2(a'_{k+1}...a'_n) = count2(a_{k+1}...a_{l-1}) + count2(a_r...a_l) + count2(a_{r+1}...a_n)`.\n   This is `twos_in_suffix[k+1] - c2(l,r) + c1(l,r)`. (This is not quite right, it's `twos_in_suffix[k+1]` minus `count of 2s in a_l..a_r` plus `count of 1s in a_l..a_r` - the number of elements in `[l,r]` that are 2s is replaced by 1s, and vice-versa).\n   The actual count of 2s is `twos_in_suffix[k+1]` (original 2s) MINUS `c2(l,r)` (2s in `[l,r]` which are now reversed) PLUS `c1(l,r)` (1s in `[l,r]` which are now reversed). No, this is wrong.\n   Let `total_twos_in_a_prime = total_twos`.\n   `count2(a'_{k+1}...a'_n) = total_twos - count2(a'_1...a'_k)`.\n   This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's stick to the structure of the LNDS.\nAn LNDS can be formed by taking all 1s up to some index `i` (in the modified sequence), and all 2s from some index `j` onwards (in the modified sequence), where `i < j`.\nThe actual LNDS is `max_{0 \\le k \\le n} (ones\\_before\\_k\\_in\\_a' + twos\\_after\\_k\\_in\\_a')`.\nLet `a_prime` be the sequence after reversal.\n`ones_before_k_in_a_prime`: number of 1s in `a_prime[0...k-1]`.\n`twos_after_k_in_a_prime`: number of 2s in `a_prime[k...n-1]`.\n\nPrecompute `prefix_ones[i]` (count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`) and `suffix_twos[i]` (count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`).\n`prefix_ones` is 0-indexed, `prefix_ones[0]=0`. `prefix_ones[i]` for `a[0...i-1]`.\n`suffix_twos` is 0-indexed, `suffix_twos[n]=0`. `suffix_twos[i]` for `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1` (0-indexed) and `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n  `current_max_lnds = 0`\n  `current_ones_count = 0`\n  For `k` from `0` to `n`: (`k` is the split point, `a_prime[0...k-1]` and `a_prime[k...n-1]`)\n    `ones_left = 0`\n    `twos_right = 0`\n\n    If `k <= l`: (split point before or at `l`)\n      `ones_left = prefix_ones[k]`\n      `twos_right = suffix_twos[k]` (all 2s from `a[k...n-1]`)\n      `twos_right -= (suffix_twos[l] - suffix_twos[r+1])` (remove 2s from original `[l,r]`)\n      `twos_right += (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l])` (add 1s from original `[l,r]` as 2s)\n      This is getting too complex. The original values are 1s and 2s, they don't change type. Only their position changes.\n\nLet's use the `O(N^2)` approach for `l, r` and `O(N)` for LNDS.\nFor each `l, r`:\n  `temp_a = list(a)`\n  `temp_a[l:r+1] = a[l:r+1][::-1]` (0-indexed `l, r` are inclusive)\n  `max_lnds_for_current_lr = 0`\n  `current_ones = 0`\n  For `k` from `0` to `n`: (`k` is the split point, `a_prime[0...k-1]` and `a_prime[k...n-1]`)\n    `twos_in_suffix = 0`\n    If `k > 0` and `temp_a[k-1] == 1`: `current_ones += 1` (this is wrong, `current_ones` should be `prefix_ones` for `temp_a`)\n    \n    To calculate `LNDS(temp_a)`:\n    `count_ones_prefix = [0] * (n + 1)`\n    `count_twos_suffix = [0] * (n + 1)`\n    For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n      `count_ones_prefix[i+1] = count_ones_prefix[i]`\n      If `temp_a[i] == 1`: `count_ones_prefix[i+1] += 1`\n    For `i` from `n-1` down to `0`:\n      `count_twos_suffix[i] = count_twos_suffix[i+1]`\n      If `temp_a[i] == 2`: `count_twos_suffix[i] += 1`\n    \n    `current_max_lnds = 0`\n    For `k` from `0` to `n`:\n      `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, count_ones_prefix[k] + count_twos_suffix[k])`\n    `overall_max_lnds = max(overall_max_lnds, current_max_lnds)`\n\nThis is `O(N^3)`.\n`N=2000`, `N^3 = 8 * 10^9`. Too slow.\n`N^2 = 4 * 10^6`. This suggests the LNDS calculation part must be `O(1)` or `O(log N)` or amortized `O(1)`.\n\nThe LNDS formula `ones_in_prefix[l-1] + (r - l + 1) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]` is only one possible way to form an LNDS. It assumes we take all 1s before `l`, all elements in `[l, r]`, and all 2s after `r`. This works if all elements in `[l, r]` can be arranged such that all their 1s come before all their 2s, which is true. And it assumes that all 1s from `[l, r]` can be placed after `ones_in_prefix[l-1]` and before `twos_in_suffix[r+1]`. This is also true by position.\n\nHowever, consider the sequence `1 2 1 2` and `l=1, r=4`. Reversed: `2 1 2 1`.\n`ones_in_prefix[0] = 0`.\n`r-l+1 = 4`.\n`twos_in_suffix[5] = 0`.\nFormula gives `0 + 4 + 0 = 4`.\nLNDS of `2 1 2 1` is `1+1=2` (e.g., `a'_2, a'_4` which is `1,1` or `a'_1, a'_3` which is `2,2`). The formula gives 4 which is wrong.\nThe formula `ones_in_prefix[l-1] + (r - l + 1) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]` is only correct if the *entire* reversed segment `a_r, ..., a_l` is used *between* the fixed prefix 1s and fixed suffix 2s. This implies that all 1s in `a_r, ..., a_l` must appear before all 2s in `a_r, ..., a_l` in the final LNDS. This is true within the segment `a_r, ..., a_l` itself. But it might be possible to take some 1s from `a_r, ..., a_l` and combine them with 1s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` (if `a_i=1` for `i > r`), or take some 2s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` (if `a_i=2` for `i < l`) and combine them with 2s from `a_r, ..., a_l`.\n\nThe issue is that an LNDS can pick 1s from `a_1, ..., a_i` and 2s from `a_{j}, ..., a_n` where `i < j`.\nThe formula `ones_in_prefix[l-1] + (r - l + 1) + twos_in_suffix[r+1]` assumes the split point `k` is somewhere inside `[l, r]`. More specifically, it takes `prefix_ones[l-1]` (1s before `l`), all elements `a_r, ..., a_l` (which is `r-l+1` elements), and `suffix_twos[r+1]` (2s after `r`).\nThis is equivalent to assuming that the LNDS is formed by all 1s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`, all elements (1s and 2s) from the reversed segment `a_r, ..., a_l`, and all 2s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`. This is only valid if `a_{l-1} <= a_r` and `a_l <= a_{r+1}` and `a_r` (the first element of the reversed segment) is 1 and `a_l` (the last element of the reversed segment) is 2. This is not generally true.\n\nThe actual LNDS is `max_{k=0..n} (count1(a'_1...a'_k) + count2(a'_{k+1}...a'_n))`.\nLet `A` be the original array (0-indexed). `n` is its length.\n`prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `A[0...i-1]`. `prefix_ones[0]=0`.\n`suffix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`. `suffix_twos[n]=0`.\n\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1`, `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n  `current_max_lnds = 0`\n  `ones_count_in_reversed_segment = prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]`\n  `twos_count_in_reversed_segment = (r - l + 1) - ones_count_in_reversed_segment`\n\n  For each possible split point `k` (index in the modified array `A'`):\n    `ones_left = 0`\n    `twos_right = 0`\n\n    If `k <= l`: (Split point before the reversed segment)\n      `ones_left = prefix_ones[k]`\n      `twos_right = suffix_twos[k]` (original 2s from `A[k...n-1]`)\n      `twos_right -= twos_count_in_reversed_segment` (remove 2s that were in `A[l...r]`)\n      `twos_right += ones_count_in_reversed_segment` (add 1s that were in `A[l...r]` but are now part of the \"2s\" group)\n      This is still wrong.
