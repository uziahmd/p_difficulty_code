The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solving the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The core is maximizing the number of opened chests, and I've got a solid handle on the constraints.  I've got `n` chests and `m` keys, with each chest and key having a number. The opening rule is key: `a_i + b_j` must be odd, which means they need different parities – one even, one odd. That's the crux of it.\n\nOkay, so each key opens at most one chest, and each chest is opened at most once.  This screams \"matching problem\" to me. I want to maximize the pairings of chests and keys that satisfy the parity constraint.\n\nMy strategy is to break this down. First, I'm going to count the even and odd chests and the even and odd keys. I'll use `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd` for these counts.  Knowing the parity distribution is key.\n\nNow, consider the pairings. An even chest *must* be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest needs an even key. I have to maximize these independent pairings.\n\nFor the even chests and odd keys, I can match at most `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` pairs.  Similarly, for odd chests and even keys, I can match at most `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  Since these pairings are mutually exclusive (different parities), the total maximum number of chests I can open is the sum of these two maxima: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  That should be it, a nice and elegant solution.\n\nLet me just quickly run through an example to confirm this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i + b_j` must be odd. This occurs if and only if one of `a_i` and `b_j` is even and the other is odd. In other words, `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys by their parity:\n1.  **Even chests**: Chests with an even number `a_i`.\n2.  **Odd chests**: Chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n3.  **Even keys**: Keys with an even number `b_j`.\n4.  **Odd keys**: Keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nTo open an even chest, we must use an odd key.\nTo open an an odd chest, we must use an even key.\n\nThese two types of pairings are independent:\n*   Even chests can only be opened by odd keys. The keys used for this purpose cannot be used for odd chests, and the chests opened cannot be odd chests.\n*   Odd chests can only be opened by even keys. The keys used for this purpose cannot be used for even chests, and the chests opened cannot be even chests.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the maximum number of pairings for each case separately and sum them up.\n\nLet:\n*   `count_a_even` be the number of even chests.\n*   `count_a_odd` be the number of odd chests.\n*   `count_b_even` be the number of even keys.\n*   `count_b_odd` be the number of odd keys.\n\n1.  **Matching even chests with odd keys**: We have `count_a_even` even chests and `count_b_odd` odd keys. Each odd key can open at most one even chest, and each even chest needs one odd key. The maximum number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of the available even chests and available odd keys. So, `min(count_a_even, count_b_odd)`.\n\n2.  **Matching odd chests with even keys**: We have `count_a_odd` odd chests and `count_b_even` even keys. Similarly, the maximum number of such pairings is `min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)`.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two maximums:\n`max_chests_opened = min(count_a_even, count_b_odd) + min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `count_a_even = 0`, `count_a_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`:\n    *   If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `count_a_even`.\n    *   Else, increment `count_a_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `count_b_even = 0`, `count_b_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`:\n    *   If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `count_b_even`.\n    *   Else, increment `count_b_odd`.\n6.  Calculate `result = min(count_a_even, count_b_odd) + min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)`.\n7.  Print `result`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1.  **Count chest parities:**\n    *   `9` (odd)\n    *   `14` (even)\n    *   `6` (even)\n    *   `2` (even)\n    *   `11` (odd)\n    `count_a_even = 3` (for 14, 6, 2)\n    `count_a_odd = 2` (for 9, 11)\n\n2.  **Count key parities:**\n    *   `8` (even)\n    *   `4` (even)\n    *   `7` (odd)\n    *   `20` (even)\n    `count_b_even = 3` (for 8, 4, 20)\n    `count_b_odd = 1` (for 7)\n\n3.  **Calculate maximum pairings:**\n    *   Even chests with odd keys: `min(count_a_even, count_b_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    *   Odd chests with even keys: `min(count_a_odd, count_b_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4.  **Total:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThe maximum number of chests Neko can open is 3.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then a constant number of arithmetic operations. The time complexity will be O(N + M), which is well within limits for N, M up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Count even and odd numbers for chests\n    count_a_even = 0\n    count_a_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            count_a_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_a_odd += 1\n\n    # Count even and odd numbers for keys\n    count_b_even = 0\n    count_b_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            count_b_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_b_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened\n    # Even chests can only be opened by odd keys\n    # Odd chests can only be opened by even keys\n    \n    # Matches between even chests and odd keys\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(count_a_even, count_b_odd)\n    \n    # Matches between odd chests and even keys\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)\n    \n    total_matches = matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key\n    \n    print(total_matches)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
