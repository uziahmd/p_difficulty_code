The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is straightforward: two players, cyclic strategies, and a large number of rounds. The critical thing here is that the game is *periodic* due to the cyclic strategies. This means I can significantly reduce the computational effort by figuring out the repeating pattern.\n\n**Analysis and Optimization Strategy:**\n\nMy first step is to recognize the periodicity. Nikephoros plays a sequence of length *m*, and Polycarpus plays a sequence of length *k*.  The combined play repeats every *lcm(m, k)* rounds. Since *m* and *k* are at most 1000, their least common multiple will be at most 1,000,000.  This tells me I can *afford* to simulate a cycle, because simulating 1,000,000 rounds isn't going to blow up my time complexity.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Implementation:**\n\nSo the main plan is this:\n\n1.  Read the input (number of rounds *n*, and the player strategies *A* and *B*).\n2.  Calculate *m*, *k*, and *lcm(m, k)*.\n3.  Simulate *lcm(m, k)* rounds, counting how many losses each player incurs in a single cycle.\n4.  Use integer division (`//`) and the modulo operator (`%`) to efficiently calculate the losses over the *n* rounds, using the data from one cycle.\n\nI'm thinking of building a separate helper function, `get_winner()`, which returns 1 if player A wins, -1 if player B wins, and 0 for a draw. I'll make sure this function implements the correct Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. I'll also use `math.gcd` from the `math` module to find the GCD for my LCM function.\n\n**Code Walkthrough and Edge Cases:**\n\nI'll then rigorously test this. I need to make sure I'm using *integer division* (`//`) to get the number of full cycles and the *modulo* operator (`%`) to find the remaining rounds. I should test edge cases like where one player always plays the same move, or where n is really small. I need to ensure the calculation of `L = lcm(m, k)` is correct to maximize efficiency.\n\nThe solution should have a time complexity that's close to O(m\\*k). This matches the constraints where m and k are smaller than 1000. This looks right.\n\n**Refinement and Final Thoughts:**\n\nThe input format is standard, so the input should be taken line by line with `input()`. The final output must be formatted exactly as requested. There are no additional optimizations, and no external libraries needed besides `math`.\n",
