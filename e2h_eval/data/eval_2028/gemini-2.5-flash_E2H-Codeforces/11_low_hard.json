A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script for the \"Soft Drinking\" problem. Let's break this down systematically. I have to figure out how many toasts each friend can make, and the key is that everyone drinks the same amount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input variables: `n` is the number of friends, `k` the drink bottles, `l` the ml per bottle, `c` the limes, `d` the slices per lime, `p` the salt grams, `nl` the ml needed per friend per toast, and `np` the grams of salt needed per toast.\n\nMy goal is to find the maximum number of toasts, `t`, each friend can have.\n\nLet's calculate the available resources:\n*   Total drink: `k * l` ml\n*   Total lime slices: `c * d`\n*   Total salt: `p` grams\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many toasts I can make from each resource, but *as a group*. The problem says everyone drinks the same amount, so it makes more sense to calculate the total toasts possible for the group, and then distribute them among the friends.\n\nLet's start with the drink.  Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. The total drink is `k * l` ml.  So, the *total* number of toasts possible based on the drink is `(k * l) / nl`. Let's test this to be sure: If `k * l` is the total ml of drink and each friend needs `nl` ml for one toast, then `(k * l) / nl` should give me the total number of toasts the *group* can make.  Thinking of it in terms of \"portions\" of `nl`, I see it is exactly right. And this gives me the total toasts the group can make.\n\nSo, for drink, the number of toasts I can provide is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`. So in this case the total number of toasts I have to divide among the friends is `(k * l) / nl`\n\nNow, regarding the lime slices, each friend gets 1 lime for each toast. Therefore, the total number of toasts, based on limes, is simply `(c * d) // n`\n\nAnd, using the salt, similarly, it will be `(p // np) // n`.\n\nThe minimum of these values, divided by `n`, will give the maximum number of toasts each friend can have.  Therefore, I'll take `min((k * l) // (n * nl), (c * d) // n, p // (n * np))` and I will need the result `//` rather than `/` to ensure that it's integer division.\n\nSeems like I have it. Now, it's time to translate this into Python code.\n",
