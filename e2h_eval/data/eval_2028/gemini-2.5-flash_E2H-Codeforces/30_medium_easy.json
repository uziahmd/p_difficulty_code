Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**TV Game Problem: My Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of the problem is a two-player game, where both Homer and Marge are trying to maximize their combined score, essentially two n-digit numbers.  We're given a large 2n-digit number, 'A', and need to figure out the best sequence of moves for each player.  The trick here is to see it as a dynamic programming problem.\n\nThe key insight is that the order in which a digit is taken dramatically affects its contribution to the final sum. The earlier a digit is taken, the more it \"weighs\" (multiplied by a higher power of 10). So, we need to consider every possible combination of moves, and memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nI've set up my state using a 3D DP table, indexed by: the current position in the number A (from 0 to 2n-1), Homer's current count of taken digits, and Marge's current count of taken digits.  My base case is simple: if we've reached the end of 'A' (k == 2n), the score is zero.\n\nThe recursive step is the heart of the solution. At each position `k`, I have two choices: Homer can take `A[k]`, *or* Marge can.  For each choice, I calculate the contribution of that digit to the corresponding player's number (using the digit's value and its position's power of 10).  Then I recursively call the DP function for the next digit.  The optimal move at each step (H or M) is the one that leads to the higher total prize, and this max value is stored in the memo table to prevent redundant computation.  I'm using memoization for efficiency.\n\nTo reconstruct the optimal move sequence, I use a separate path-reconstruction process, going backward from my stored memo values to find the actual choice at each step.\n\nBased on some initial tests, it seems that there's a need to handle edge-cases for 'best_choice' where there's a tie, so I ensure that the code is consistent in tie-breaking decisions (e.g. always preferring Homer in case of ties for equal prizes). The runtime seems fine, as I'm memoizing the results in the DP array to improve efficiency.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') such that each player makes exactly `n` moves, and their total prize (S1 + S2) is maximized. S1 is the number Homer forms, and S2 is the number Marge forms. Digits are taken from the left of the original number `A`.\n\nLet `A` be a 2n-digit number. When a player takes a digit `d` from `A`, its contribution to their personal number (S1 or S2) depends on its position. If `d` is the `p`-th digit (1-indexed) a player takes, and their final number will have `n` digits, then `d` contributes `d * 10^(n-p)` to their score.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We need to keep track of:\n1. `k`: The index of the current leftmost digit being considered from `A` (from 0 to `2n-1`).\n2. `h_taken`: The number of digits Homer has already taken.\n3. `m_taken`: The number of digits Marge has already taken.\n\nLet `dp(k, h_taken, m_taken)` be the maximum total prize achievable from the remaining digits `A[k:]`, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits.\n\n**Base Case:**\nIf `k == 2n` (all digits have been processed), then `dp(2n, h_taken, m_taken) = 0`.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\nFor `dp(k, h_taken, m_taken)`, we consider the digit `A[k]`. There are two choices:\n\n1.  **Homer takes `A[k]`:**\n    This is only possible if `h_taken < n`.\n    The current digit `A[k]` (let its value be `digit_val = int(A[k])`) will be Homer's `(h_taken + 1)`-th digit. Its contribution to S1 will be `digit_val * 10^(n - (h_taken + 1))`.\n    The total prize for this choice will be `digit_val * 10^(n - (h_taken + 1)) + dp(k + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes `A[k]`:**\n    This is only possible if `m_taken < n`.\n    The current digit `A[k]` will be Marge's `(m_taken + 1)`-th digit. Its contribution to S2 will be `digit_val * 10^(n - (m_taken + 1))`.\n    The total prize for this choice will be `digit_val * 10^(n - (m_taken + 1)) + dp(k + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)`.\n\n`dp(k, h_taken, m_taken)` will be the maximum of the valid choices.\n\n**Memoization:**\nWe use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of `dp` calls to avoid redundant computations. The keys of `memo` will be `(k, h_taken, m_taken)`.\n\n**Reconstructing the Path:**\nAfter computing all necessary `dp` values (by calling `solve(0, 0, 0)`), we can reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves. We start from `(k=0, h_taken=0, m_taken=0)` and iterate `k` from 0 to `2n-1`. In each step, we calculate the prize for Homer taking `A[k]` and Marge taking `A[k]` (using the pre-computed `memo` values for the next states). We choose the player whose move leads to the maximum total prize. If both choices yield the same maximum prize, we can pick either (e.g., prefer Homer's move as per the example output).\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **State Space:** `k` ranges from 0 to `2n`, `h_taken` from 0 to `n`, `m_taken` from 0 to `n`. So, there are `(2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1)` states.\n*   **Transitions:** Each state computation involves at most two recursive calls and constant arithmetic operations.\n*   For `n = 18`, the number of states is approximately `(37) * (19) * (19) = 13357`. This is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (e.g., 10^8 operations per second).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=2, A=\"1234\"):**\n`N=2`, `A=\"1234\"`\n\n`solve(0, 0, 0)`:\n*   `A[0] = '1'`\n*   **Homer takes '1'**: `1 * 10^(2-(0+1)) = 10`. Next state: `solve(1, 1, 0)`.\n*   **Marge takes '1'**: `1 * 10^(2-(0+1)) = 10`. Next state: `solve(1, 0, 1)`.\n\nLet's assume `solve(1, 1, 0)` returns 36 and `solve(1, 0, 1)` returns 36.\n*   Homer's path total: `10 + 36 = 46`.\n*   Marge's path total: `10 + 36 = 46`.\n\nSince both are equal, we prefer 'H'. So the first move is 'H'.\nNow, `k=1, h_taken=1, m_taken=0`.\n`A[1] = '2'`\n*   **Homer takes '2'**: `2 * 10^(2-(1+1)) = 2 * 1 = 2`. Next state: `solve(2, 2, 0)`.\n*   **Marge takes '2'**: `2 * 10^(2-(0+1)) = 2 * 10 = 20`. Next state: `solve(2, 1, 1)`.\n\nAssume `solve(2, 2, 0)` returns 34 and `solve(2, 1, 1)` returns 7.\n*   Homer's path total: `2 + 34 = 36`.\n*   Marge's path total: `20 + 7 = 27`.\nHomer's path is better. So the second move is 'H'.\nThe sequence so far: \"HH\".\n\nNow, `k=2, h_taken=2, m_taken=0`.\n`A[2] = '3'`\n*   Homer has taken 2 digits (`h_taken=N`), so he cannot take any more.\n*   **Marge takes '3'**: `3 * 10^(2-(0+1)) = 3 * 10 = 30`. Next state: `solve(3, 2, 1)`.\n\nAssume `solve(3, 2, 1)` returns 4.\n*   Marge's path total: `30 + 4 = 34`.\nSo the third move is 'M'.\nThe sequence so far: \"HHM\".\n\nNow, `k=3, h_taken=2, m_taken=1`.\n`A[3] = '4'`\n*   Homer has taken 2 digits (`h_taken=N`), so he cannot take any more.\n*   **Marge takes '4'**: `4 * 10^(2-(1+1)) = 4 * 1 = 4`. Next state: `solve(4, 2, 2)`.\n\n`solve(4, 2, 2)` is a base case, returns 0.\n*   Marge's path total: `4 + 0 = 4`.\nSo the fourth move is 'M'.\nThe sequence so far: \"HHMM\".\n\nThe final sequence is \"HHMM\", which matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Memoization table for dynamic programming\nmemo = {}\nN = 0\nA = \"\"\n\ndef solve(k, h_taken, m_taken):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum total prize from digits A[k:] onwards,\n    given Homer has taken h_taken digits and Marge has taken m_taken digits.\n    \"\"\"\n    if (k, h_taken, m_taken) in memo:\n        return memo[(k, h_taken, m_taken)]\n\n    # Base case: All digits have been processed\n    if k == 2 * N:\n        return 0\n\n    digit_val = int(A[k])\n    \n    max_prize = -1 # Initialize with a value guaranteed to be smaller than any valid prize\n\n    # Option 1: Homer takes A[k]\n    prize_if_homer_takes = -1\n    if h_taken < N:\n        # This digit will be Homer's (h_taken + 1)-th digit.\n        # Its position value is 10^(N - (h_taken + 1))\n        h_pos_weight = 10**(N - (h_taken + 1))\n        prize_if_homer_takes = digit_val * h_pos_weight + solve(k + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)\n        max_prize = prize_if_homer_takes\n\n    # Option 2: Marge takes A[k]\n    prize_if_marge_takes = -1\n    if m_taken < N:\n        # This digit will be Marge's (m_taken + 1)-th digit.\n        # Its position value is 10^(N - (m_taken + 1))\n        m_pos_weight = 10**(N - (m_taken + 1))\n        prize_if_marge_takes = digit_val * m_pos_weight + solve(k + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)\n        \n        # Update max_prize.
