For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Analytical Journey to Classifying Triads**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a Python script that can neatly categorize a given triad—a set of three musical notes—as either \"major,\" \"minor,\" or, if it doesn't fit the mold, \"strange.\"\n\nHere's the problem: I've got a set of 12 notes (C, C#, D...H) that repeat cyclically, and distance between them is measured in semitones (where each step to the next note is 1 semitone). Importantly, the distance is *always* measured upwards.\n\nA triad is simply an unordered set of three distinct notes. Major triads are characterized by a 4-semitone distance between the first two notes and a 3-semitone distance between the second and third. Minor triads flip that—3 then 4 semitones.\n\nMy plan crystallizes:\n\n1.  **Map it Out**:  I'll translate each note name into a numerical value (C=0, C#=1, etc.). This makes the calculations cleaner.\n2.  **Distance Defined**: I'll nail down a clear function to calculate the semitone distance between any two notes, taking the cyclic nature into account. This function must give a positive, upward distance.\n3.  **Process Input**: I'll read in those three notes, convert them to their numerical forms, and then the real work begins.\n4.  **Major/Minor Check**: Now, because triads are unordered, I need to consider all the ways the notes can be arranged. Since there are only three notes, I realize I need to evaluate all 6 possible permutations to cover all scenarios. Let's call them X, Y, and Z. The problem boils down to checking if the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and between Y and Z is 3 semitones or if the distance between X and Y is 3 and the distance between Y and Z is 4.\n\nI explored a streamlined approach to account for this. Because, in a triad X, Y, Z, the distances are either 4, 3, 5 or 3, 4, 5, I began thinking that if I had the sorted notes, I could look at the distances between the notes. I realized I could use the formula `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` to calculate the distance between the two notes. Then, from the sorted list, I can find the intervals and check if they match the major or minor triad patterns. This is elegant, but requires checking the *order* of the intervals.\n\nFor a final implementation, I decided to go back to the most straightforward method: Calculate the distances between each of the notes using all 6 permutations.\n\nThe Final Algorithm is:\n1.  Map note names to numbers.\n2.  Read the input notes and convert.\n3.  Calculate the 6 permutations.\n4.  For each permutation, if the distance matches either major (4, 3) or minor (3, 4) return. Else, at the end, return strange.\n\nThe beauty of this method is its clarity and directness.  And since the problem guarantees an unambiguous result, I can stop at the first match and be confident in the answer.\n\nI've tested it on example cases, and everything checks out. The solution is complete, elegant, and I am satisfied with the result. Let's put this into action!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given the definitions of major and minor triads based on the distances between their notes along the musical scale. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, repeating cyclically. The distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Numerical Values:** To easily calculate distances, we assign each note a numerical value from 0 to 11. For example, C=0, C#=1, D=2, ..., H=11.\n\n2.  **Calculate Semitone Distance:** The distance from a note `n1` to `n2` (moving upwards cyclically) is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. For instance, from C (0) to E (4) is `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4` semitones. From E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8` semitones. This correctly captures the problem's definition of distance.\n\n3.  **Process Input:**\n    *   Read the three note names from the input.\n    *   Convert these note names into their corresponding numerical values using the mapping from step 1.\n\n4.  **Check Triad Type:**\n    A triad consists of three notes, say X, Y, and Z. The problem states that a major/minor triad can be *ordered* in a specific way. Since the input chord is an \"unordered set\" of notes, we need to check all possible orderings (permutations) of the three given notes.\n    For each permutation `(X, Y, Z)`:\n    *   Calculate the distance from X to Y (`dist_XY`).\n    *   Calculate the distance from Y to Z (`dist_YZ`).\n\n    *   **Major Triad Condition:** If `dist_XY == 4` semitones AND `dist_YZ == 3` semitones, then the chord is major.\n    *   **Minor Triad Condition:** If `dist_XY == 3` semitones AND `dist_YZ == 4` semitones, then the chord is minor.\n\n    There are only 3 notes, so there are `3! = 6` possible permutations. We iterate through these permutations. The problem guarantees that the answer will be unambiguous (a chord won't be both major and minor), so as soon as we find a match, we can classify the chord and stop.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   If a major triad condition is met for any permutation, print \"major\".\n    *   Else if a minor triad condition is met for any permutation, print \"minor\".\n    *   Otherwise (if no permutation satisfies either condition), print \"strange\".\n\n**Example: C E G**\n1.  Numerical notes: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n2.  Consider permutation (0, 4, 7):\n    *   `X=0, Y=4, Z=7`\n    *   `dist_XY = (4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   `dist_YZ = (7 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   This matches the major triad condition (4 semitones then 3 semitones). Output: \"major\".\n\n**Example: C# B F**\n1.  Numerical notes: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n2.  Consider permutations:\n    *   (1, 10, 5): `dist(1,10)=9`, `dist(10,5)=7`. No match.\n    *   (1, 5, 10): `dist(1,5)=4`, `dist(5,10)=5`. No match.\n    *   (5, 1, 10): `dist(5,1)=8`, `dist(1,10)=9`. No match.\n    *   (5, 10, 1): `dist(5,10)=5`, `dist(10,1)=3`. No match.\n    *   (10, 1, 5): `dist(10,1)=(1-10+12)%12=3`, `dist(1,5)=(5-1+12)%12=4`.\n    *   This matches the minor triad condition (3 semitones then 4 semitones). Output: \"minor\".\n\nThis approach is straightforward and directly implements the problem's definitions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Mapping from note names to numerical values (0-11)\n# C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11\nnotes_map = {\n    \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n    \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n}\n\ndef get_distance(n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the distance in semitones from n1 to n2, cyclically.\n    The distance is always positive and represents moving upwards on the scale.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (n2 - n1 + 12) % 12\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three space-separated note names from standard input\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    note_names = [input_line[0], input_line[1], input_line[2]]\n\n    # Convert note names to their numerical representations\n    numerical_notes = [notes_map[note] for note in note_names]\n\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n\n    # Iterate through all possible permutations of the three notes (X, Y, Z)\n    # There are 3! = 6 permutations, which is a very small number.\n    for p in permutations(numerical_notes):\n        x, y, z = p[0], p[1], p[2]\n\n        # Calculate the distances between X and Y, and Y and Z\n        dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n        dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n\n        # Check for major triad condition: (X,Y) = 4 semitones, (Y,Z) = 3 semitones\n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            is_major = True\n            break # Found a major triad, problem guarantees unambiguous answer\n\n        # Check for minor triad condition: (X,Y) = 3 semitones, (Y,Z) = 4 semitones\n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n            break # Found a minor triad, problem guarantees unambiguous answer\n\n    # Print the result based on the classification\n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the logic\nsolve()\n\n```",
