Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Optimization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to maximize a function `f(x)`, where `x` is between 0 and a given value `m`. The function `f(x)` is a sum of values `a_i`, but only if the `i`-th bit of `x` is a 1. Essentially, I'm building a number `x` and adding values from an array `a` based on which bits are set in `x`. The catch is `x` has to be less than or equal to `m`.\n\nThe number `m` is represented as a binary string, which is crucial.  The string `s0s1...sn-1`  implies that `s0` is the most significant bit and `sn-1` is the least significant. Let me make sure I've got this straight: if the length of the binary string `s` is `n`,  the `i`-th digit `s_i` from the left (MSB) corresponds to the `(n-1-i)`-th bit position from the LSB. That seems right.  So `s0` controls the `(n-1)`-th bit, `s1` controls the `(n-2)`-th, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to get the largest possible sum, so a greedy approach is probably worth considering.  I want to pick the largest `a_i` values, but only if setting the corresponding bit in `x` doesn't make `x` exceed `m`. This is where I'll need to pay attention to the binary string representation of `m`.  It's very similar to problems where you build a number digit-by-digit or bit-by-bit while staying within a constraint, so I should be able to leverage that knowledge. This seems like a promising direction to explore. A digit DP or greedy strategy seems the way to go.\n",
