For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. My goal is to figure out how many ways I can select values for $c_s$ such that the largest beautiful multiset possible has exactly a size of $f$.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"beautiful multiset\" means. It involves binary strings of length *n*. A multiset is beautiful if, for any binary string *s* (with a length between 1 and *n*), the number of strings in the multiset that start with *s* (i.e., *s* is their prefix) doesn't exceed a specific value, $c_s$.\n\nLet me break down what this means. Imagine a full binary tree with depth *n*. Each node represents a binary string. The root is empty, and children are formed by appending 0 or 1. If a string *S* of length *n* is in the multiset *M*, then for any prefix *s* of *S*, we increment the count of *s* by 1. The total size of *M* is simply the number of strings of length *n* we have in the multiset, which is the count of the empty string (although the problem doesn't give us $c_\\epsilon$).\n\nSo, for a string *s* of length *L* less than *n*, the count of *s* is the sum of all strings with length *n* starting with *s*. The condition here is $count(s) \\le c_s$. If *s* is length *n*, then $count(s) = N_s$, the number of times this string appears.\n\nNow, I'm trying to *maximize* the sum of the strings of length n. It feels like a maximum flow problem, or perhaps a greedy approach. To max this, I'll need to set the values of $N_s$ as high as possible. And the constraints are crucial: \n1. $N_s \\le c_s$ for any *s* of length *n*.\n2. $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n \\text{ that start with } s} N_S \\le c_s$ for any *s* shorter than *n*.\n\nEssentially, each node's count must stay under its given threshold. My goal is to find how many ways to set these $c_s$ values such that my maximum possible multiset has size *f*. That will be a challenge, but I've got a good handle on the framework.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length $1$ to $n$ such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset is exactly $f$. The values $c_s$ must be between $0$ and $k$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of $c_s$ values.\nA multiset of binary strings of length $n$ is beautiful if for every binary string $s$ of length $1 \\le |s| \\le n$, the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\n\nLet $N_S$ be the count of string $S$ (of length $n$) in the multiset. We want to maximize $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} N_S$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L < n$, the count of strings in the multiset starting with $s$ is $\\sum_{S \\text{ s.t. } s \\text{ is prefix of } S} N_S$. Let's denote this by $C(s)$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $C(s) = N_s$.\nThe conditions are $C(s) \\le c_s$ for all $1 \\le |s| \\le n$.\n\nConsider the binary tree where nodes are strings and edges connect $s$ to $s0$ and $s1$. Strings of length $n$ are leaves.\nFor any node $s$ (string) in this tree:\nIf $|s| < n$, then $C(s) = C(s0) + C(s1)$.\nIf $|s| = n$, then $C(s) = N_s$.\nThe constraints are $C(s) \\le c_s$.\n\nTo maximize $\\sum N_S$, we can use a greedy approach, working from leaves up to the root.\nFor any leaf $S$ (string of length $n$), we can pick $N_S = c_S$.\nFor any internal node $s$ (string of length $<n$), $C(s) = C(s0) + C(s1)$. To maximize $C(s)$, we should maximize $C(s0)$ and $C(s1)$.\nHowever, $C(s)$ is also constrained by $c_s$. So, the maximum possible value for $C(s)$ is $\\min(c_s, C(s0) + C(s1))$.\nThis applies recursively.\nLet $M(s)$ be the maximum possible count of strings of length $n$ starting with $s$.\nFor $s$ of length $n$: $M(s) = c_s$.\nFor $s$ of length $<n$: $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $M(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string (representing the root of the tree). Since $c_s$ is given for $1 \\le |s| \\le n$, $M(\\epsilon)$ is calculated as $M('0') + M('1')$.\n\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ such that $M(s)$ (for a string $s$ of length $L-1$) can be at most $val$.\nThis DP state seems a bit off. Let's rephrase.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings $s$ of length $L+1, \\ldots, n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $s_0$ of length $L$, and also choose $c_{s_0}$ such that $M(s_0)$ (the max count for $s_0$) is exactly $val$. This is for a single subtree.\n\nThe structure of the problem is a full binary tree. All subtrees rooted at nodes of the same depth $L$ are isomorphic.\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings $s$ in the subtree rooted at a node of depth $L$ (i.e., $|s|=L, \\ldots, n$) such that the maximum total count of strings of length $n$ in this subtree is $x$.\nThe depth is $0$ for the root (empty string). $L$ goes from $n$ down to $1$.\n\nBase case: $L=n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. We choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, for each $x \\in [0, k]$, there is 1 way to set $c_s = x$.\n$dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$. $dp[n][x] = 0$ for $x > k$.\n\nRecursive step: $L < n$.\nTo compute $dp[L][x]$:\nA string $s$ of length $L$ has children $s0$ and $s1$.\n$M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nWe need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$ and counts for the subtrees $s0$ and $s1$.\nLet $M(s0) = x_0$ and $M(s1) = x_1$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c$ values for $s0$'s subtree such that $M(s0)=x_0$ is $dp[L+1][x_0]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c$ values for $s1$'s subtree such that $M(s1)=x_1$ is $dp[L+1][x_1]$.\nThe total number of ways for children subtrees to yield $x_0, x_1$ is $dp[L+1][x_0] \\times dp[L+1][x_1]$.\nThe sum $x_0 + x_1$ can range from $0$ to $2k$.\nLet $S[L+1][y] = \\sum_{x_0+x_1=y} dp[L+1][x_0] \\times dp[L+1][x_1]$.\nThis is a convolution. $S[L+1]$ is the result of multiplying the polynomial represented by $dp[L+1]$ by itself.\n$S[L+1][y]$ stores the number of ways to choose $c$ values for children subtrees such that $M(s0)+M(s1)=y$.\n\nNow we choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nIf we choose $c_s = C$, then $M(s) = \\min(C, y)$.\nWe want $M(s) = x$.\nCase 1: $x < y$. This means $c_s$ must be $x$. If $c_s=x$, then $M(s)=\\min(x,y)=x$.\nThe number of ways for this is $S[L+1][y]$ (for fixed $y$) multiplied by 1 (for $c_s=x$). This is valid if $x \\le k$.\nCase 2: $x = y$. This means $c_s$ can be any value $C \\ge x$. If $c_s=C \\ge x$, then $M(s)=\\min(C,x)=x$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ is $k-x+1$. This is valid if $x \\le k$.\nCase 3: $x > y$. This is impossible, as $M(s) \\le y$.\n\nSo, for $dp[L][x]$:\n$dp[L][x] = \\sum_{y=0}^{x-1} S[L+1][y] \\times 1 \\quad \\text{ (if } x \\le k \\text{, for } c_s=x \\text{)}$\n$+ \\sum_{y=x}^{2k} S[L+1][y] \\times (k-x+1) \\quad \\text{ (if } x \\le k \\text{, for } c_s \\ge x \\text{)}$\nAll sums are modulo 998244353.\nThe maximum value for $y$ is $2k$. The maximum value for $x$ is $k$.\nThe range of $x$ for $dp[L][x]$ is $0 \\ldots k$.\n\nThe final answer will be $dp[1][f]$. Note that $M(\\epsilon) = M('0') + M('1')$. This means we need to find $S[1][f] = \\sum_{x_0+x_1=f} dp[1][x_0] \\times dp[1][x_1]$.\n\nThe maximum value of $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum length of $dp[L]$ array is $k+1$.\nThe convolution $S[L+1]$ takes $O(k \\log k)$ using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform).\nThere are $n$ layers of DP. So total time $O(n k \\log k)$.\n$n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $15 \\times 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\times \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\times 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\times 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This should be acceptable.\n\nLet's refine the recurrence for $dp[L][x]$:\n$dp[L][x] = 0$ if $x > k$.\nFor $0 \\le x \\le k$:\n$dp[L][x] = \\left( \\sum_{y=0}^{x-1} S[L+1][y] \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{y=x}^{2k} S[L+1][y] \\times (k-x+1) \\right) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nLet $P[L+1][Y] = \\sum_{y=0}^{Y} S[L+1][y]$ be the prefix sums of $S[L+1]$.\nLet $Q[L+1][Y] = \\sum_{y=0}^{Y} S[L+1][y] \\times y$. This is not quite right.\nLet $R[L+1][Y] = \\sum_{y=Y}^{2k} S[L+1][y]$. These are suffix sums.\nThen $dp[L][x] = P[L+1][x-1] + R[L+1][x] \\times (k-x+1)$.\nThis can be computed efficiently:\n1. Compute $S[L+1]$ using NTT for $dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]$.\n2. Compute suffix sums $R[L+1]$. $R[L+1][Y] = (R[L+1][Y+1] + S[L+1][Y]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n3. For each $x \\in [0, k]$, calculate $dp[L][x]$.\n\nFinal answer is $S[1][f]$.\n\nNTT implementation details:\n- Modulo is $998244353$, which is a prime number of the form $c \\cdot 2^e + 1$.\n- Primitive root $g=3$.\n- Max size of polynomial is $2k+1$. We need to pad to nearest power of 2 greater than $2k$. For $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$. Next power of 2 is $2^{19} = 524288$.\n\nLet's trace for $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$L=1$: Base case.\n$dp[1][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le 42$. $dp[1][x] = 0$ for $x > 42$.\nThe problem asks for $M(\\epsilon) = M('0') + M('1')$ to be $f$.\nSo we need to compute $S[1][f] = \\sum_{x_0+x_1=f} dp[1][x_0] \\times dp[1][x_1]$.\nFor $f=2$:\n$S[1][2] = dp[1][0]dp[1][2] + dp[1][1]dp[1][1] + dp[1][2]dp[1][0]$\n$S[1][2] = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 = 3$.\nThis matches example output.\n\nFor $n=2, k=37, f=13$.\n$L=2$: Base case.\n$dp[2][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le 37$. $dp[2][x] = 0$ for $x > 37$.\n$L=1$:\nCompute $S[2] = dp[2] * dp[2]$.\n$S[2][y] = \\sum_{x_0+x_1=y} dp[2][x_0] \\times dp[2][x_1]$.\nSince $dp[2][x]=1$ for $x \\in [0,37]$:\n$S[2][y]$ is the number of ways to write $y$ as sum of two integers $x_0, x_1 \\in [0,37]$.\nFor $0 \\le y \\le 37$: $S[2][y] = y+1$. (e.g., $(0,y), (1,y-1), \\ldots, (y,0)$)\nFor $38 \\le y \\le 74$: $S[2][y] = 37 - (y-37) + 1 = 75-y$. (e.g., $(y-37, 37), \\ldots, (37, y-37)$)\n$S[2][y] = 0$ for $y > 74$.\nMax value for $y$ is $2k = 74$.\n\nNow compute $dp[1][x]$ for $x \\in [0, k=37]$.\n$dp[1][x] = P[2][x-1] + R[2][x] \\times (k-x+1)$.\n$P[2][Y]$ is prefix sum of $S[2]$.\n$R[2][Y]$ is suffix sum of $S[2]$.\nExample: $dp[1][0] = P[2][-1] + R[2][0] \\times (37-0+1) = 0 + \\left(\\sum_{y=0}^{74} S[2][y]\\right) \\times 38$.\n$\\sum_{y=0}^{74} S[2][y]$ is the total number of pairs $(x_0, x_1)$ with $x_0, x_1 \\in [0,37]$, which is $(37+1) \\times (37+1) = 38^2 = 1444$.\n$dp[1][0] = 1444 \\times 38 = 54872$.\n\nAfter computing $dp[1][x]$ for all $x \\in [0,37]$, the final answer is $S[1][f] = S[1][13]$.\n$S[1][13] = \\sum_{x_0+x_1=13} dp[1][x_0] \\times dp[1][x_1]$.
