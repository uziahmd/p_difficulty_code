Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem. It involves string manipulation and large number modulo arithmetic. The core of it seems to be applying a series of string replacements to an initial string of digits and then calculating the final numerical value of the resulting string modulo 10^9 + 7.  The string replacement queries are the key here.  I've got an initial string `s` made up of digits, and then a series of queries, each of the form `di -> ti`, which tells me to replace all occurrences of the digit `di` with the string `ti`. The real kicker is that the order of the queries *matters*.\n\nThe obvious, brute-force approach of performing the string replacements directly seems like a terrible idea.  I'm worried about exponential string growth. The constraints make it pretty clear that trying to build the entire string each step is going to blow up in terms of memory or time. The string can get *huge* really fast, given the nature of the replacement rules.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to perform the calculation without actually constructing this massive string. The modulo operation hints that I can probably keep the intermediate values reasonably small as I go.\n\nThe problem specifically says the `di` is a literal digit.  Since the order of queries is important, any given digit in the string is going to evolve. I need to keep track of that *evolution*. I'm thinking about it like this: I need to know what each digit, from 0 to 9, *eventually* turns into after *all* the queries have been applied.  That should be the key to getting the final value without building the huge intermediate strings.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of *post-query* transformation. I'll need to define some state variable, maybe `val[d]` and `length[d]`, to store the transformed string value and length for each original digit `d`. This means the value that a digit ends up as. When a query `di -> ti` comes in, it's not simply replacing, but updating that mapping. The fact that the replacement is a single digit is the key.\n\nSo, with each query `di -> ti`, any instance of the original `di` must be transformed. I think it makes more sense to work backwards, to know the final form of each digit, then perform calculation to apply that final mapping to the initial string. I'll start by assuming each digit just stays its value (so `val[d] = d` and `length[d] = 1`). Then, I'll process the queries to get this final mapping. Once I know this, I can easily calculate the final result in the initial string by just replacing the digit value with the new string values and lengths.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to perform a series of digit replacements in a string and then calculate the numerical value of the resulting (potentially very long) string modulo 10^9 + 7. The key challenge is that the string length can grow exponentially, making direct string manipulation impossible.\n\nWe need to find the final numerical value and length of the string that each digit `0` through `9` would eventually transform into. Since queries are applied sequentially and a digit `d_i` is replaced by `t_i`, any subsequent query `d_j -> t_j` might affect digits that originated from `t_i`. This suggests processing queries in reverse order.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nWe'll maintain two pieces of information for each digit `d` from `0` to `9`:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD - 1` (because lengths are used as exponents for powers of 10, and by Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)` for prime `p`, so exponents are taken modulo `p-1`).\n\n**Initialization (before any queries):**\nInitially, each digit `d` transforms into itself.\nFor `d` from `0` to `9`:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries in Reverse:**\nWhen we process a query `d_i -> t_i` in reverse order (from `n` down to `1`), we are determining what the *original* digit `d_i` should become *after all subsequent queries have been applied*.\n\nFor a query `d_i -> t_i`:\nWe need to calculate the `new_val` and `new_length` for `d_i` based on `t_i`. The string `t_i` itself consists of digits. For each digit `c` in `t_i` (from left to right), we know its current `val[c]` and `length[c]` (which already incorporate the effects of queries *after* the current one).\n\nLet `new_val = 0` and `new_length = 0`.\nIterate through the characters `c` in `t_i` from left to right:\n*   `c_int = int(c)`\n*   `new_val = (new_val * pow(10, length[c_int], MOD) + val[c_int]) % MOD`\n*   `new_length = (new_length + length[c_int]) % (MOD - 1)`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `t_i`:\n*   Update `val[d_i] = new_val`\n*   Update `length[d_i] = new_length`\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` store the final value and length for each original digit `d`.\nNow, iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right.\nLet `final_val = 0` and `final_length = 0`.\nFor each character `c` in `s`:\n*   `c_int = int(c)`\n*   `final_val = (final_val * pow(10, length[c_int], MOD) + val[c_int]) % MOD`\n*   `final_length = (final_length + length[c_int]) % (MOD - 1)`\n\nThe `final_val` is the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`s = 222`, `n = 2`\nQueries: `2->0`, `0->7`\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (all modulo `MOD-1`)\n\n**Processing queries in reverse:**\n\n**Query 2: `0 -> 7`**\nThis query determines what digit `0` becomes.\n`t_i = \"7\"`.\n`new_val = 0`, `new_length = 0`\nFor `c = '7'`:\n    `c_int = 7`\n    `new_val = (0 * pow(10, length[7], MOD) + val[7]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_length = (0 + length[7]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\nUpdate `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n\nState after Query 2:\n`val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Query 1: `2 -> 0`**\nThis query determines what digit `2` becomes.\n`t_i = \"0\"`.\n`new_val = 0`, `new_length = 0`\nFor `c = '0'`:\n    `c_int = 0`\n    `new_val = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_length = (0 + length[0]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\nUpdate `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n\nState after Query 1 (final state for digits):\n`val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Final calculation for initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_val = 0`, `final_length = 0`\n\nFor `c = '2'`:\n    `c_int = 2`\n    `final_val = (0 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    `final_length = (0 + length[2]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n\nFor `c = '2'`:\n    `c_int = 2`\n    `final_val = (7 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (7 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = (70 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n    `final_length = (1 + length[2]) % (MOD - 1) = (1 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 2`\n\nFor `c = '2'`:\n    `c_int = 2`\n    `final_val = (77 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (77 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = (770 + 7) % MOD = 777`\n    `final_length = (2 + length[2]) % (MOD - 1) = (2 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 3`\n\nResult: `777`.
