Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking about Minimizing Array Instability**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the minimum instability of an array after removing one element. Instability is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. My goal is to minimize this difference by strategically removing an element.\n\nThe core idea is this: I need to make the *new* maximum as small as possible and the *new* minimum as large as possible after the removal. Intuitively, this suggests focusing on the extreme values in the array.\n\nLet's say the given array is `a` with `n` elements. I can sort it into `a_sorted` to make it easier to reason about the maximum and minimum.  I can quickly see that removing an element that's *not* the max or min will do nothing to decrease the initial instability. The max stays the same, and the min stays the same. So that isn't helping.\n\nIf I remove the largest element, `a_sorted[n-1]`, the new max becomes the second-largest element, `a_sorted[n-2]`. The minimum remains the same. If I remove the smallest element, `a_sorted[0]`, then the max stays the same, and the minimum becomes the second smallest, `a_sorted[1]`.\n\nSo, it boils down to considering these two scenarios: either removing the largest element and calculating `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]` or removing the smallest element and calculating `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]`.  The minimum of these two values will be the answer.  This should be the correct approach to finding the minimum instability.\n\nI should also make sure to address the edge case when `n=2`, though the problem statement says n >= 2. The instability is zero in this case.",
