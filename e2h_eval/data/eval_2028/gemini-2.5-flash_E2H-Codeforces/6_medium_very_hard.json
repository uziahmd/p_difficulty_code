Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my approach to solving it:**\n\nMy initial goal is to find the minimum cost for two non-overlapping vouchers that sum up to a specific duration *x*.  Breaking down the problem, I'm starting with the input values: the number of vouchers *n*, the target duration *x*, and the details of each voucher (start, end, and cost). The key conditions are: the two chosen vouchers can't overlap, their durations must sum to *x*, and their total cost must be minimized. If no pair of vouchers meets these criteria, I need to output -1.\n\nFirst, I define the duration of a voucher as its end day minus its start day plus one.  The non-overlapping condition is crucial: either the first voucher must end *before* the second begins, or vice versa.  Because the order doesn't matter, for simplicity I'll assume that the first voucher's end day is before the second's start day.\n\nA brute-force solution (checking all pairs of vouchers) would be O(N^2), which is too slow given the problem constraints. I need a more efficient approach, likely O(N log N) or O(N).  This is where I start thinking about sorting or using data structures to make this efficient.\n\nI'm considering a strategy of fixing one voucher and then efficiently searching for a suitable second voucher. Let's say I fix a voucher *i*. I calculate its duration.  I then need to find another voucher *j* that complements it to achieve the total duration of *x*. The overlap condition means that the *j* must start after *i* ends. This *ri* < *lj* is critical, where *ri* is the end day of voucher *i*, and *lj* is the start day of voucher *j*. And for it to work I need to minimize the *costj* for the sum to be min. This suggests that sorting by the *start* or *end* days could be helpful. I then think about what if I group vouchers of the same duration, and this may become a good start.\n\nI decide to experiment with sorting vouchers by their end day (*ri*).  If I iterate through the vouchers in this sorted order, when I'm looking at voucher *i*, I can easily identify candidate vouchers *j* that start *after* *i*'s end date. I now define the `min_cost_for_duration[d][s]` which denotes minimum cost of a voucher with the duration *d* that has start date *s*, but I quickly realize there will be memory issues when I attempt to do this.\n\nI'm thinking a *sweep-line* approach may be the best fit. I'll iterate through the days, and keep a track of the minimum costs to construct a solution.\n\nI'm creating an `min_cost_for_duration` array, where each index *d* represents a duration, and the value at that index stores the minimum cost of a voucher with that duration.  I'm also considering storing vouchers based on start and end dates.\n\nI then structure a sweep-line algorithm:\n1.  **Iterate through each day:** From 1 to the maximum end day (*2* * 10^5*)\n2.  **Process vouchers ending on the previous day:** These are the vouchers that are eligible to be the \"first\" voucher. For any such vouchers, update the `min_cost_for_duration` array for the voucher's duration.\n3.  **Process vouchers starting on the current day:**  For each voucher starting on the current day, if its duration *d_j* is such that *x* - *d_j* is a valid duration and there exists a voucher ending earlier, calculate the total cost for the potential pair and update my minimum cost.\n\nI use `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end`, and I will now have, by the end of each day a `min_costs` array that will allow for O(1) look-ups of potential minimum values. This ensures the overlap condition is met.\n\nThe crucial part here is the `min_costs` array. This stores the minimum cost of vouchers with various durations that have already ended. When I encounter a voucher starting at a certain day, I only need to consider durations up to *x* - voucher's own duration. This allows me to efficiently find the best possible combinations without iterating through all previous vouchers.\n\nIn essence, I'm processing the vouchers in a specific order and maintaining a running record of the best voucher costs for each duration that's already become \"available\" (i.e., ended) by that point in the timeline.  This ensures I pick the cheapest possible combination and correctly handle",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two non-overlapping vouchers `i` and `j` such that the sum of their durations `(ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1)` is exactly `x`, and their total cost `costi + costj` is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet `di = ri - li + 1` be the duration of voucher `i`. The conditions are:\n1.  `di + dj == x`\n2.  Vouchers `i` and `j` are non-overlapping: `ri < lj` or `rj < li`.\n3.  Minimize `costi + costj`.\n\nA brute-force approach of checking all pairs of vouchers would be O(N^2), which is too slow for N up to `2 * 10^5`. We need a more efficient approach, likely O(N log N) or O(N + MAX_COORD), where `MAX_COORD` is the maximum possible day value (`2 * 10^5`).\n\nWe can use a sweep-line algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the days from `1` to `MAX_COORD`. At each `current_day`, we consider two types of events:\n1.  Vouchers that *end* at `current_day - 1`: These vouchers are now \"finished\" and can potentially be the first voucher (`i`) in a non-overlapping pair `(i, j)` where `ri < lj` (specifically, `ri = current_day - 1` and `lj = current_day`). We want to keep track of the minimum cost for each possible duration among these finished vouchers.\n2.  Vouchers that *start* at `current_day`: These vouchers can potentially be the second voucher (`j`) in a non-overlapping pair `(i, j)` where `lj = current_day`. For each such voucher `j`, we calculate the required duration `d_i = x - d_j` for the first voucher `i`. Then, we query our stored minimum costs for vouchers with duration `d_i` that finished before `current_day`.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\n1.  **Data Structures**:\n    *   `vouchers_by_start[day]`: A list of `(r, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that start on `day`.\n    *   `vouchers_by_end[day]`: A list of `(l, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that end on `day`.\n    *   `min_costs_for_duration[d]`: An array (or dictionary) storing the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended* before the `current_day`. Initialize all values to `infinity`. The size of this array will be `x + 1`.\n\n2.  **Initialization**:\n    *   `MAX_DAY_COORD = 2 * 10^5` (maximum possible `li` or `ri`).\n    *   Initialize `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end` as lists of lists (or dictionaries mapping day to list).\n    *   Read all `n` vouchers. For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n        *   Calculate `duration = r - l + 1`.\n        *   Add `(r, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_start[l]`.\n        *   Add `(l, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_end[r]`.\n    *   Initialize `min_costs_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)`.\n    *   Initialize `min_total_cost = float('inf')`.\n\n3.  **Sweep-Line Algorithm**:\n    Iterate `current_day` from `1` to `MAX_DAY_COORD`.\n    *   **Phase 1: Update `min_costs_for_duration`**:\n        If `current_day > 1`, consider all vouchers that ended on `current_day - 1`. For each such voucher `(l_k, cost_k, d_k)`:\n            If `1 <= d_k <= x` (the duration is relevant for our target `x`):\n                Update `min_costs_for_duration[d_k] = min(min_costs_for_duration[d_k], cost_k)`.\n        This ensures `min_costs_for_duration[d]` always stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has finished *before* `current_day`.\n\n    *   **Phase 2: Check for pairs with vouchers starting at `current_day`**:\n        Consider all vouchers `(r_j, cost_j, d_j)` that start on `current_day` (from `vouchers_by_start[current_day]`):\n            Calculate the required duration for the first voucher: `d_i = x - d_j`.\n            If `1 <= d_i <= x`:\n                If `min_costs_for_duration[d_i]` is not `float('inf')` (meaning a suitable first voucher `i` exists):\n                    We have found a valid pair `(i, j)` where `ri < lj` (specifically, `ri < current_day` and `lj = current_day`).\n                    Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, min_costs_for_duration[d_i] + cost_j)`.\n\n4.  **Result**:\n    After the loop finishes, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no such pair of vouchers was found. Print -1. Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Reading input and populating `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end`: O(N).\n    *   Sweep-line loop runs `MAX_DAY_COORD` times.\n    *   Inside the loop, Phase 1 iterates through `vouchers_by_end[current_day - 1]`. The total number of vouchers processed across all `current_day`s in Phase 1 is `N`. Each update is O(1).\n    *   Inside the loop, Phase 2 iterates through `vouchers_by_start[current_day]`. The total number of vouchers processed across all `current_day`s in Phase 2 is `N`. Each query and update is O(1).\n    *   Total time complexity: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD). Given `N, MAX_DAY_COORD <= 2 * 10^5`, this is `2 * 10^5 + 2 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^5` operations, which is efficient enough.\n\n*   **Space Complexity**:\n    *   `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end`: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD) to store all vouchers and the lists for each day.\n    *   `min_costs_for_duration`: O(x) for the array.\n    *   Total space complexity: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD + x). This is also well within limits.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample)**:\n`n=4, x=5`\nVouchers: (1,3,4), (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)\n\n`MAX_DAY_COORD = 6` (max `ri` is 6).\n`min_costs_for_duration = [inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]` (size `x+1 = 6`)\n`min_total_cost = inf`\n\n`vouchers_by_start`:\n`1: [(3, 4, 3), (2, 5, 2), (2, 4, 2)]`\n`5: [(6, 1, 2)]`\n\n`vouchers_by_end`:\n`2: [(1, 5, 2), (1, 4, 2)]`\n`3: [(1, 4, 3)]`\n`6: [(5, 1, 2)]`\n\n`current_day = 1`:\n    Phase 1: `current_day - 1 = 0`.
