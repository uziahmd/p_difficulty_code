You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Strategy to Conquer the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge is to take a number (`a`) and a set of available digits (`s`) and, by strategically swapping digits, maximize the resulting number. The core idea is to make the *most significant digits* as large as possible – a classic greedy approach.\n\nFirst, sort the available digits in `s` in *descending order*. This gives us immediate access to the largest digits, ready to be used. Then, we walk through the number `a` from left to right (most significant to least).\n\nFor each digit in `a`, we compare it to the *largest remaining digit* from our sorted `s`. If the digit from `s` is greater, *replace* the digit in `a` with the larger digit and then move on to next *available* digit from `s`. If not, it means the largest available digit from `s` won't make the position any better, so we *don't* make the replacement and move on to the next number in the number.  We need to always try to substitute.\n\nThe key is that if the largest digit from `s` *can't* improve a digit in `a`, we don't discard it. We keep it available for later digits in `a`. If there are no more digits in s, we stop.\n\nIn essence, we're building the largest possible number by greedily grabbing the largest available digit whenever we can improve a digit in `a`. This strategy is efficient (`O(m log m + n)` time complexity) and ensures the optimal solution. The program uses Python's standard input and output methods, and handles cases for efficient execution.\n",
