            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Radio Towers\n\nThere are $$$n + 2$$$ towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n + 1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this coding challenge.**\n\nMy goal is to figure out the probability of a working tower setup, focusing on a modulo operation. I need to make sure all towns get a signal from *exactly one* tower, no exceptions. The towns are like a line from 0 to n+1, with the towers in the middle. The towers have powers (signal ranges), and these powers can't let signals go past the ends of the line (0 and n+1).\n\nThe problem hinges on two constraints: towns 0 and n+1 get *no* signals, and every town between 1 and n gets one signal.\n\nThe first constraint actually simplifies the problem; my tower powers are limited by their positions. A tower at town i has power at most min(i, n+1-i) to prevent any signal reaching towns 0 and n+1.\n\nThe real challenge is constraint two: ensure each town from 1 to n has *one* signal. So, I need to choose towers such that their signals don't overlap, and together they cover all of those towns.\n\nThinking this through, valid power assignments exist only when the towers \"tile\" the space, similar to a puzzle.\n\nThis leads to a key observation: if I know *where* towers are built, there's only *one* possible way to assign the power such that each town is covered exactly once. This simplifies the whole process. I just need to figure out which towns can have towers and the corresponding power assignments.\n\nThis means finding the proper set of tower locations. A set of towers can exist if there is a sequence of integers 0 = R_0 < R_1 < ... < R_k = n. And, for that to be true, R_j and R_{j-1} must have different parities. In addition, the location of the tower in the sequence depends on R_j + R_{j-1} + 1. The set of tower locations is then {i_1, ... i_k} with i_j = (R_j + R_{j-1} + 1)/2.\n\nSo, for any set of tower locations to be valid, then any town without a tower should not exist, otherwise the whole system would not work. This means that if I choose where to put towers, there is a unique choice of power levels that will work if such a power can exist.\n\nIn other words, the real core of the problem is counting the valid choices of tower locations, which is equivalent to counting the number of possible values of the sequence {R0, R1, ..., Rk}. For each tower choice, then there is a fixed probability. \n\nI think dynamic programming will be helpful here. I need to work on this, and hopefully figure out the actual probability.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid configuration of signal powers exists, given $n+2$ towns at coordinates $0, \\dots, n+1$. Radio towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ independently with probability $1/2$. A tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ (integer $1 \\le p \\le n$) reaches towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p$. This means it covers the interval $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nLet's analyze the first constraint. If a tower at $i$ has power $p$, it covers $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\nFor town $0$ not to get signal: $i-p+1 > 0 \\implies p \\le i$.\nFor town $n+1$ not to get signal: $i+p-1 < n+1 \\implies p \\le n+1-i$.\nThus, for any tower at $i$, its power $p$ must satisfy $1 \\le p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. If we ensure this, towns $0$ and $n+1$ will never receive a signal. This means the covered interval $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$ will always be fully contained within $[1, n]$.\n\nNow, consider the second constraint: towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one tower each. This means the chosen intervals $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$ for towers built at $i$ must form a partition of the segment $[1, n]$. That is, they must be disjoint and their union must be $[1, n]$.\n\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns where towers are built, with $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\nFor these towers to partition $[1, n]$:\nLet $C_j = [L_j, R_j]$ be the interval covered by the tower at $i_j$.\nWe must have $L_1 = 1$.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $L_{j+1} = R_j+1$.\nAnd $R_k = n$.\nFor each interval $[L_j, R_j]$, the tower $i_j$ must be its center. This means $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThis implies $L_j+R_j$ must be an even number, so $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThe power for tower $i_j$ would be $p_j = i_j - L_j + 1 = R_j - i_j + 1 = (R_j - L_j + 1)/2$.\nWe also need $p_j \\ge 1$, which means $R_j - L_j + 1 \\ge 2 \\implies R_j > L_j$. This is equivalent to $i_j > L_j$ and $R_j > i_j$.\n\nLet's define $R_0 = 0$. Then $L_1 = R_0+1 = 1$.\n$L_j = R_{j-1}+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nThe condition that $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity means $R_{j-1}+1$ and $R_j$ have the same parity.\nThis implies $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ must have different parities.\nSince $R_0=0$ (even), $R_1$ must be odd. Then $R_2$ must be even, $R_3$ must be odd, and so on.\nIn general, $R_j$ must have the same parity as $j$.\nThe final condition is $R_k=n$. So $n$ must have the same parity as $k$.\n\nTherefore, a set of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is valid if and only if:\n1.  There exists a sequence $0 = R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k = n$.\n2.  For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, $R_j$ has the same parity as $j$.\n3.  The set $S$ is *exactly* $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$, where $i_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$. (Note that $i_j$ is an integer because $R_j+R_{j-1}+1$ is even, as $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ have different parities).\n4.  The powers $p_j = (R_j-R_{j-1})/2$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n    $p_j \\ge 1$ is equivalent to $R_j > R_{j-1}$, which is already part of the sequence definition.\n    $p_j \\le i_j \\implies (R_j-R_{j-1})/2 \\le (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2 \\implies R_j-R_{j-1} \\le R_j+R_{j-1}+1 \\implies -R_{j-1} \\le R_{j-1}+1 \\implies 2R_{j-1} \\ge -1$. This is true since $R_{j-1} \\ge 0$.\n    $p_j \\le n+1-i_j \\implies (R_j-R_{j-1})/2 \\le n+1 - (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2 \\implies R_j-R_{j-1} \\le 2(n+1) - (R_j+R_{j-1}+1) \\implies R_j-R_{j-1} \\le 2n+2-R_j-R_{j-1}-1 \\implies 2R_j \\le 2n+1 \\implies R_j \\le n + 1/2$. This is true since $R_j \\le n$.\nSo, the power constraints $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ are automatically satisfied if $R_j > R_{j-1}$ and $R_k=n$.\n\nThus, a configuration of towers is valid if and only if the set of towns with towers $S$ is *exactly* $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ for some sequence $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ where $R_j$ has parity $j$.\nEach such sequence $(R_0, \\dots, R_k)$ uniquely determines a set of $k$ tower locations $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nFor such a set of locations to be successful, towers must be built at *exactly* these $k$ locations, and *not* built at the other $n-k$ locations in $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The probability of this specific outcome is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nSince different sequences $(R_0, \\dots, R_k)$ generate distinct sets of tower locations (because the $R_j$ values define the intervals), we can sum up the probabilities. The total probability is $N_{valid} \\cdot (1/2)^n$, where $N_{valid}$ is the number of such valid sequences.\n\nLet $dp[x]$ be the number of ways to partition the interval $[1, x]$ into segments $C_1, \\dots, C_k$ such that $x=R_k$ and $R_j$ has parity $j$ for all $j$.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (representing the empty partition of $[1,0]$).\nFor $x > 0$:\nTo form a partition of $[1, x]$, the last segment must be $[L_k, x]$. $L_k = R_{k-1}+1$.\nThe previous segment $[1, R_{k-1}]$ must be a valid partition ending at $R_{k-1}$.\nWe need $x$ and $R_{k-1}$ to have different parities.\nSo, $dp[x] = \\sum_{0 \\le R_{k-1} < x, \\text{ s.t. } x \\text{ and } R_{k-1} \\text{ have different parities}} dp[R_{k-1}]$.\nLet's trace this:\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $R_{k-1}$ must be even. Only $R_{k-1}=0$ works. $dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$. ($R_1=1$ is odd, $R_0=0$ is even. OK.)\n$dp[2]$: $R_{k-1}$ must be odd. Only $R_{k-1}=1$ works. $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$. ($R_2=2$ is even, $R_1=1$ is odd. OK.)\n$dp[3]$: $R_{k-1}$ must be even. $R_{k-1} \\in \\{0, 2\\}$. $dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1+1=2$.\n$dp[4]$: $R_{k-1}$ must be odd. $R_{k-1} \\in \\{1, 3\\}$. $dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1+2=3$.\n$dp[5]$: $R_{k-1}$ must be even. $R_{k-1} \\in \\{0, 2, 4\\}$. $dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1+1+3=5$.\n\nThis sequence $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$ for $dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], dp[4], dp[5]$ looks like Fibonacci numbers.\nLet $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nIt appears $dp[x] = F_x$. Let's prove it by induction.\nBase cases: $dp[0]=1$ (conventionally $F_0=0$, so $dp[0]$ is a special base case), $dp[1]=1=F_1$, $dp[2]=1=F_2$.\nAssume $dp[y]=F_y$ for $y < x$.\nIf $x$ is odd, $R_{k-1}$ must be even. $dp[x] = \\sum_{j=0, j \\text{ even}}^{x-1} dp[j]$.\n$dp[x] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[x-1]$.\nIf $x$ is even, $R_{k-1}$ must be odd. $dp[x] = \\sum_{j=1, j \\text{ odd}}^{x-1} dp[j]$.\n$dp[x] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[x-1]$.\n\nConsider the identity $F_m = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\lfloor (m-1)/2 \\rfloor} F_{m-2j} + F_1$. This is not quite right.\nA known identity for Fibonacci numbers is $F_m = F_{m-1} + F_{m-2}$.\nAlso, $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_i = F_{m+2}-1$.\nAnd $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i-1} = F_{2m}$. $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i} = F_{2m+1}-1$.\n\nLet's check $dp[x] = F_x$.\nIf $x$ is odd: $dp[x] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[x-1] = 1 + F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_{x-1}$.\nUsing $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$:\n$1 + F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_{x-1} = 1 + (F_3-F_1) + (F_5-F_3) + \\dots + (F_x-F_{x-2})$ (by $F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2} \\implies F_k-F_{k-2}=F_{k-1}$? No.)\nUsing $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i} = F_{2m+1}-1$:\n$F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_{x-1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{(x-1)/2} F_{2j} = F_{x}-1$.\nSo, $dp[x] = 1 + (F_x-1) = F_x$. This holds for odd $x$.\n\nIf $x$ is even: $dp[x] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[x-1] = F_1 + F_3 + \\dots + F_{x-1}$.\nUsing $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i-1} = F_{2m}$:\n$F_1 + F_3 + \\dots + F_{x-1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{x/2} F_{2j-1} = F_x$. This holds for even $x$.\n\nSo, $dp[x] = F_x$ for $x \\ge 1$.\nThe total number of valid sets of tower locations is $dp[n] = F_n$.\nThe probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nWe need to compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ and $(1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe modulus $M = 998244353$ is a prime number.\nWe can compute $F_n$ using matrix exponentiation:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo, $\\begin{pmatrix} F_n \\\\ F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis computes $F_n$ in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\nThe inverse of $2^n \\pmod M$ is $(2^n)^{M-2} \\pmod M$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\nThis is $2^{-n} \\pmod M = (2^{-1})^n \\pmod M$.\n$2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\nSo we need to compute $499122177^n \\pmod{998244353}$. This is also $O(\\log n)$.\n\nTotal time complexity: $O(\\log n)$.\nSpace complexity: $O(1)$ for matrix exponentiation.\n\nExample $n=1$: $F_1=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nExample $n=2$: $F_2=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nExample $n=3$: $F_3=2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$.\nExample $n=5$: $F_5=5$. Probability $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$.\n\nThese match the example outputs.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$MOD = 998244353$\n$inv2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)$\n$inv2_n = pow(inv2, n, MOD)$\n\nIf $n=0$, $F_0=0$. But $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\nMatrix power for $n=1$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{0} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $F_1=1$.\nThis works correctly.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef multiply_matrices(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef matrix_power(A, p):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    A = [row[:] for row in A] # Make a copy to avoid modifying original\n    while p > 0:\n        if p % 2 == 1:\n            res = multiply_matrices(res, A)\n        A = multiply_matrices(A, A)\n        p //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # Problem constraint n >= 1, but good to handle for completeness\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate F_n using matrix exponentiation\n    # F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1\n    # [F_{k+1}, F_k] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]] * [F_k, F_{k-1}]\n    # [F_n, F_{n-1}] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]^(n-1) * [F_1, F_0]\n    # For n=1, we need F_1.
