The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my main focus is figuring out the probability of a \"valid\" signal power configuration. I've got a set of towns, and the challenge lies in the random placement of towers, signal power assignments, and the strict coverage rules. I need to output this probability modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the givens: `n + 2` towns from 0 to `n+1`, towers built randomly in towns 1 to `n` with a 50/50 chance. Each tower has a signal power `p` (from 1 to `n`). The coverage rule is standard: tower at `i` with power `p` covers towns within distance `p`.  The signal has to cover each town 1 to `n` only one time and the towns 0 and `n+1` do not receive a signal.\n\nNow, let's break down the constraints.  The first big one is that towns 0 and `n+1` *cannot* receive any signal. This immediately tells me that the signal power of any tower `i` must be small enough that it *doesn't* reach those boundary towns.  Mathematically, this translates to `p_i <= min(i, n + 1 - i)` for each tower. Let's call this the *maximum* possible power, `P_max(i)`.\n\nThe second constraint is the core of the problem: each town from 1 to `n` must be covered by *exactly one* tower. This means that the coverage ranges of the active towers must perfectly partition the interval [1, n]. No overlaps, no gaps, the entire thing covered once. I need to think about how to represent these ranges and how to efficiently check for valid partitions. I'll need a good data structure to efficiently test these things.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random selection of towers in towns $1, \\dots, n$ (each with probability $1/2$), it's possible to assign signal powers $p_i \\in [1, n]$ to the built towers such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one tower.\n\nA tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This means the interval $(i-p, i+p)$ is covered.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built.\nCondition 1 implies that for any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$:\n- $i - p_i + 1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n- $i + p_i - 1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nThus, $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\nCondition 2 implies that the union of intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ for $i \\in S$ must exactly cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and these intervals must be disjoint except possibly at their boundaries. Since towns are integers, this means for each $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there is exactly one $i \\in S$ such that $c \\in (i-p_i, i+p_i)$.\n\nThis structure implies that the intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ must form a partition of the range $[1, n]$. Specifically, if we sort the towers in $S$ as $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then the covered intervals must be $(i_1-p_{i_1}, i_1+p_{i_1}), (i_2-p_{i_2}, i_2+p_{i_2}), \\dots, (i_k-p_{i_k}, i_k+p_{i_k})$, and they must perfectly tile the range $[1, n]$.\nThis means:\n- $i_1 - p_{i_1} = 0$\n- $i_k + p_{i_k} = n+1$\n- For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$\n\nFrom $i - p_i + 1 > 0$ and $i+p_i-1 < n+1$, we know $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nThe conditions $i-p_i=0$ and $i+p_i=n+1$ are equivalent to $p_i=i$ and $p_i=n+1-i$.\nFor a tower $i \\in S$ to cover $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $j$ must be in $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$.\nThe condition that town $0$ is not covered means $i-p_i \\ge 0$.\nThe condition that town $n+1$ is not covered means $i+p_i \\le n+1$.\n\nConsider the \"boundary points\" $i-p_i$ and $i+p_i$.\nLet $L_i = i-p_i$ and $R_i = i+p_i$.\nThe conditions become:\n1. $L_i \\ge 0$ and $R_i \\le n+1$ for all $i \\in S$.\n2. The intervals $(L_i, R_i)$ for $i \\in S$ must be disjoint and their union must be $(0, n+1)$.\nThis implies that if $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ with $i_1 < \\dots < i_k$:\n- $L_{i_1} = 0$\n- $R_{i_k} = n+1$\n- $R_{i_j} = L_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n\nFrom $L_i = i-p_i$ and $R_i = i+p_i$, we have $p_i = (R_i - L_i)/2$.\nAlso, $i = (R_i + L_i)/2$.\nFor $p_i$ and $i$ to be integers, $R_i - L_i$ and $R_i + L_i$ must both be even. This means $R_i$ and $L_i$ must have the same parity.\n\nLet's look at the sequence of boundary points: $0 = L_{i_1} < R_{i_1} = L_{i_2} < R_{i_2} = L_{i_3} < \\dots < R_{i_k} = n+1$.\nAll $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $L_{i_1}=0$ is even, all boundary points $L_j, R_j$ must be even.\nSo, we need to find a sequence of distinct even integers $0 = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_k = n+1$.\nFor each pair $(x_{j-1}, x_j)$, we define a tower $i_j$ and its power $p_{i_j}$:\n$L_{i_j} = x_{j-1}$, $R_{i_j} = x_j$.\n$i_j = (x_j + x_{j-1})/2$.\n$p_{i_j} = (x_j - x_{j-1})/2$.\nFor this to be a valid assignment, we must have:\n1. $i_j$ must be an integer (guaranteed since $x_j, x_{j-1}$ are even).\n2. $p_{i_j}$ must be an integer (guaranteed since $x_j, x_{j-1}$ are even).\n3. $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le n$. This means $x_j - x_{j-1} \\ge 2$.\n4. $1 \\le i_j \\le n$. This means $x_j + x_{j-1} \\ge 2$ and $x_j + x_{j-1} \\le 2n$.\n   Since $x_j > x_{j-1} \\ge 0$, $x_j + x_{j-1} \\ge 2$ is always true if $x_j \\ge 2$.\n   Since $x_k = n+1$, if $n+1$ is even, $x_k \\le n+1 \\le 2n$ for $n \\ge 1$. If $n+1$ is odd, this construction is impossible.\n\nSo, a valid assignment of powers is possible if and only if $n+1$ is even. This implies $n$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd. Then $R_{i_k} = n+1$ would be odd, contradicting that all boundary points must be even.\nTherefore, if $n$ is even, the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's check this against the examples:\n- $n=2$: Output is $748683265$. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. My logic says $0$. What's wrong?\n\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ only ensures towns $0$ and $n+1$ are not covered.\nThe condition \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" does not require that $i-p_i$ and $i+p_i$ be integers. The towns are integers, so the interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ covers integer points $c$ such that $i-p_i < c < i+p_i$.\nThe actual covered points are $\\{c \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid i-p_i < c < i+p_i\\}$.\nLet $L'_i = \\lceil i-p_i \\rceil$ and $R'_i = \\lfloor i+p_i \\rfloor$. The set of covered towns is $\\{L'_i, \\dots, R'_i\\}$.\nThe condition that towns $1, \\dots, n$ are covered exactly once means that the union of intervals $[L'_i, R'_i]$ for $i \\in S$ must be exactly $[1, n]$, and these intervals must be disjoint except at endpoints.\nThis means:\n- $L'_{i_1} = 1$\n- $R'_{i_k} = n$\n- $R'_{i_j} = L'_{i_{j+1}}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n\nLet's redefine the boundary points.\nA tower at $i$ with power $p$ covers $c$ if $i-p < c < i+p$.\nThe first town covered is $i-p+1$. The last town covered is $i+p-1$.\nThe set of covered towns is $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\nThe conditions become:\n1. $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n2. $i+p_i-1 \\le n \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n3. For $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$:\n   - $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n   - $i_k+p_{i_k}-1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n+1-i_k$.\n   - For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\n\nFrom $p_j = i_j$ and $p_k = n+1-i_k$, we see these towers must be able to reach towns $1$ and $n$ respectively.\nThe condition $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ means the covered intervals are adjacent.\nLet $A_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ be the first town covered by tower $j$.\nLet $B_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$ be the last town covered by tower $j$.\nWe need $A_{i_1}=1, B_{i_k}=n$, and $B_{i_j} = A_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nThis implies $B_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nSubstituting $p_j = i_j$ and $p_k = n+1-i_k$ into the definitions of $A_j, B_j$:\n$A_j = i_j - p_j + 1$\n$B_j = i_j + p_j - 1$\nSumming these gives $A_j+B_j = 2i_j$. So $i_j = (A_j+B_j)/2$.\nSubtracting gives $B_j-A_j = 2p_j-2$. So $p_j = (B_j-A_j)/2+1$.\nFor $i_j$ and $p_j$ to be integers, $A_j+B_j$ must be even, and $B_j-A_j$ must be even. This means $A_j$ and $B_j$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe sequence of covered ranges is $[A_1, B_1], [A_2, B_2], \\dots, [A_k, B_k]$.\n$A_1=1$.\n$B_k=n$.\n$B_j = A_{j+1}-1$.\nThis means $A_j, B_j$ must alternate parity.\n$A_1=1$ (odd). So $B_1$ must be odd.\n$B_1 = A_2-1$. So $A_2$ must be even.\n$A_2$ (even). So $B_2$ must be even.\n$B_2 = A_3-1$. So $A_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $A_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\n$B_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nThis means $A_j$ and $B_j$ always have the same parity! This is consistent.\n\nThe sequence of points $1=A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, \\dots, A_k, B_k=n$ must satisfy $B_j = A_{j+1}-1$.\nThis means the points are $1, B_1, B_1+1, B_2, B_2+1, \\dots, B_{k-1}, B_{k-1}+1, n$.\nThe set of towns where towers are built is $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\n$i_1 = (1+B_1)/2$.\n$i_j = (A_j+B_j)/2 = (B_{j-1}+1+B_j)/2$ for $j>1$.\n$p_1 = (B_1-1)/2+1$.\n$p_j = (B_j-(B_{j-1}+1))/2+1$ for $j>1$.\n\nAlso, we need $p_j \\le i_j$ and $p_j \\le n+1-i_j$.\n$p_1 \\le i_1 \\implies (B_1-1)/2+1 \\le (1+B_1)/2 \\implies B_1+1 \\le B_1+1$. This is always true.\n$p_k \\le n+1-i_k \\implies (n-A_k)/2+1 \\le n+1-(A_k+n)/2 \\implies (n-A_k)/2+1 \\le (n+2-A_k)/2 \\implies n-A_k+2 \\le n+2-A_k$. This is always true.\nThe conditions $p_j \\le i_j$ and $p_j \\le n+1-i_j$ are automatically satisfied for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nSo, we need to find a sequence $1=A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, \\dots, A_k, B_k=n$ such that $B_j = A_{j+1}-1$, $A_j, B_j$ have the same parity, and $A_j < B_j$.\nThe condition $A_j, B_j$ having the same parity is equivalent to $B_j-A_j$ being even.\n$B_j-A_j = 2p_j-2$. So $p_j-1$ must be an integer, which is true.\nThe length of the segment covered by tower $j$ is $B_j-A_j+1 = 2p_j-1$.\nSince $p_j \\ge 1$, we need $2p_j-1 \\ge 1$, so $B_j-A_j+1 \\ge 1 \\implies B_j \\ge A_j$.\nIf $B_j=A_j$, then $p_j=1$.\nIf $B_j=A_j$, then $i_j=A_j$. This means tower $A_j$ covers only town $A_j$.\n\nThe problem states that $p_i$ is an integer from $1$ to $n$.\nFor $i_j = (A_j+B_j)/2$ to be an integer between $1$ and $n$:\n$A_j+B_j$ must be even.\n$A_j, B_j$ same parity is required.\n$1 \\le (A_j+B_j)/2 \\le n$.\n$A_j \\ge 1$. $B_j \\le n$. So $A_j+B_j \\ge 2$. $A_j+B_j \\le 2n$. These are always satisfied.\n\nThe sequence of points $1=A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, \\dots, A_k, B_k=n$ must satisfy $B_j = A_{j+1}-1$.\nThis means we are effectively choosing $k$ segments $[A_j, B_j]$ that partition $[1, n]$.\nFor each segment $[A_j, B_j]$, we must have $A_j$ and $B_j$ of the same parity.\nThis implies that the length of the segment $B_j-A_j+1$ must be odd.\nIf $B_j-A_j+1$ is odd, then $B_j-A_j$ is even, so $A_j, B_j$ have same parity.\nThis means each tower must cover an odd number of towns.\nExample: $n=5$.\nPossible partitions into segments of odd length:\n1. $[1,5]$: $A_1=1, B_1=5$. Length 5 (odd). $i_1=(1+5)/2=3$, $p_1=(5-1)/2+1=3$. Tower at 3, power 3. Covers $[1,5]$. Valid. Tower set: $\\{3\\}$.\n2. $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5]$: Invalid, lengths are 1 (odd), but $A_j, B_j$ parities don't match for $j>1$.\n   $A_1=1, B_1=1$. $i_1=1, p_1=1$.\n   $A_2=2, B_2=2$. $i_2=2, p_2=1$.\n   $A_3=3, B_3=3$. $i_3=3, p_3=1$.\n   $A_4=4, B_4=4$. $i_4=4, p_4=1$.\n   $A_5=5, B_5=5$. $i_5=5, p_5=1$.\n   This is a valid partition if all towers $1,2,3,4,5$ are present. Tower set: $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n3. $[1,3], [4,5]$: $A_1=1, B_1=3$. Length 3 (odd). $i_1=2, p_1=2$.\n   $A_2=4, B_2=5$. Length 2 (even). Invalid.\n4. $[1,1], [2,5]$: $A_1=1, B_1=1$. $i_1=1, p_1=1$.\n   $A_2=2, B_2=5$. Length 4 (even). Invalid.\n\nThis means that for a choice of towers $S$, a valid power assignment exists if and only if $S$ can be written as $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where $i_j$ are centers of segments $[A_j, B_j]$ that partition $[1, n]$, and each segment $[A_j, B_j]$ must have an odd length.\nEquivalently, $B_j-A_j$ must be even for all $j$.\nThis means $A_j$ and $B_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $A_1=1$ (odd), $B_1$ must be odd.\nSince $A_2=B_1+1$ (even), $B_2$ must be even.\nSince $A_3=B_2+1$ (odd), $B_3$ must be odd.\n...\nIn general, $A_j$ and $B_j$ must have the same parity, which is $j \\pmod 2$.\nSo $A_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$ and $B_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\nAnd $B_k=n$. So $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis implies that $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity. $k$ is the number of towers built.\nThe problem is to find the number of subsets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that there exists a partition of $[1, n]$ into $k$ segments $[A_j, B_j]$ of odd length, where $i_j = (A_j+B_j)/2$ for each $j$, and $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nThis is equivalent to finding a sequence $1=A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, \\dots, A_k, B_k=n$ such that $B_j=A_{j+1}-1$, $B_j-A_j$ is even for all $j$, and $S = \\{ (A_j+B_j)/2 \\mid j=1,\\dots,k \\}$.\nThe condition $B_j-A_j$ is even means $A_j, B_j$ have same parity.\nThis implies $A_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$ and $B_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\nSo $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition the interval $[1, n]$ into $k$ segments of odd length.\nLet $dp[x]$ be the number of ways to partition $[1, x]$ into segments of odd length.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty partition).\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{j=1, j \\text{ odd}}^x dp[x-j]$.\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-3] + \\dots$\n$dp[x-1] = dp[x-2] + dp[x-4] + \\dots$\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2] + dp[x-3] + \\dots$\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1] + (dp[x-2] + dp[x-4] + \\dots)$\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-1]$ for $x \\ge 2$.\nSo $dp[x] = 2 \\cdot dp[x-1]$ for $x \\ge 2$.\nBase cases:\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=dp[0]=1$. (segment [1,1])\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$. (segment [1,1] then [2,2] is not valid, segment [1,2] is even. Wait, $dp[2]$ should be 0.\n$dp[x]$ should be number of ways to partition $[1,x]$ into segments of odd length.\n$dp[0]=1$ (empty interval).\n$dp[1]$: $[1,1]$. Length 1. Valid. $dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2]$: No way to partition $[1,2]$ into segments of odd length.\n   $[1,1], [2,2]$: $A_1=1, B_1=1$. $A_2=2, B_2=2$. $B_1=1, A_2=2$. $B_1 \\ne A_2-1$.

And $A_j$ must have parity $j \\pmod 2$.\nThe total number of segments $k$ must satisfy $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n\nLet $f(m)$ be the number of ways to partition the interval $[1, m]$ into segments $[A_j, B_j]$ such that $A_j, B_j$ have the same parity as $j \\pmod 2$.\n$f(0)=1$.\n$f(1)$: $[1,1]$. $A_1=1, B_1=1$. Both odd. $j=1$ is odd. Valid. $f(1)=1$.\n$f(2)$: No way.\n   $[1,2]$ length 2. $A_1=1, B_1=2$. Parities different.

Both odd. $j=1$ odd. Valid.\n   $[1,1], [2,3]$: $A_1=1, B_1=1$ (odd, $j=1$ odd). $A_2=2, B_2=3$ (different parities, invalid).\n   $[1,2], [3,3]$: $A_1=1, B_1=2$ (different parities, invalid).\n   So $f(3)=1$.\n$f(4)$:\n   $[1,4]$ length 4. $A_1=1, B_1=4$.

Each configuration identifies a unique set of towers $S$.\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is $f(n)$.\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$.\nSo the probability is $f(n) / 2^n$.\n\nLet's recheck $f(m)$ for $m=2$.\n$n=2$. $f(2)=1$. $1/2^2 = 1/4$. This matches example 1.\n$n=3$. $f(3)=2$. $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. This matches example 2.\n$n=5$. $f(5)=5$. $5/2^5 = 5/32$. This matches example 3.\n\nThis seems to be the correct interpretation. The number of favorable outcomes is $F_{n+1}$ (using $F_1=1, F_2=1$).\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nFibonacci sequence:\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$\nTo compute $F_{n+1}$ efficiently, we can use matrix exponentiation.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_{n+1}$, so we need to compute $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n$.\nThe top-left element of this matrix will be $F_{n+1}$.\n\nModular inverse of $2^n$:\n$2^n \\pmod{998244353}$. $998244353$ is a prime number.\nSo $(2^n)^{-1} \\equiv 2^{n \\cdot (-1)} \\equiv 2^{\\phi(998244353) - n} \\equiv 2^{998244353-1-n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nNo, it's $2^{-n} \\equiv (2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nSo we need to calculate $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$, which is $2^{n(MOD-2)} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nNo, it's just $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nThis is $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nWe need to calculate $2^n \\pmod{MOD}$ and then find its modular inverse.\nOr directly calculate $(2^{-1})^n \\pmod{MOD}$.\n$2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\nSo we need to calculate $F_{n+1} \\cdot (499122177)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Define MOD = 998244353.\n2. Compute $F_{n+1}$ using matrix exponentiation for $n$.\n   Let $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Calculate $M^n$.\n   $M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\\\ F_n & F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   The value we need is $F_{n+1}$.\n3. Compute $(2^{-1})^n \\pmod{MOD}$. Let $inv2 = 499122177$. Compute $inv2^n \\pmod{MOD}$.\n4. Multiply these two results and take modulo MOD.\n\nMatrix exponentiation function:\n```python\ndef mat_mult(A, B, mod):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % mod\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, p, mod):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    A = [[x % mod for x in row] for row in A] # Ensure elements are within modulo range\n    while p > 0:\n        if p % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, A, mod)\n        A = mat_mult(A, A, mod)\n        p //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef fibonacci(n, mod):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # We need F_n.\n    # M^k gives F_{k+1}, F_k, F_k, F_{k-1}\n    # For F_n, we need to raise M to power n-1.\n    # M^(n-1) = [[F_n, F_{n-1}], [F_{n-1}, F_{n-2}]]\n    # So F_n is the top-left element.\n    # Our problem wants F_{n+1}, so we raise M to power n.\n    # M^n = [[F_{n+1}, F_n], [F_n, F_{n-1}]]\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    Tn = mat_pow(T, n, mod)\n    return Tn[0][0] # This is F_{n+1}\n```\n\nModular exponentiation for $inv2^n$:\n```python\ndef power(base, exp, mod):\n    res = 1\n    base %= mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n```\n\nFinal calculation:\n`fib_n_plus_1 = fibonacci(n, MOD)`\n`inv2_pow_n = power(499122177, n, MOD)`\n`result = (fib_n_plus_1 * inv2_pow_n) % MOD`\n\nEdge case $n=1$:\n$F_{1+1} = F_2 = 1$.\n$inv2^1 = 499122177$.\nResult: $1 \\cdot 499122177 = 499122177$.\n$1/2 \\pmod{998244353} = 499122177$.
