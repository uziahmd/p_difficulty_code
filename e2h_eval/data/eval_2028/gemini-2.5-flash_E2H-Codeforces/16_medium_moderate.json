Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "**Understanding the \"Crazy Town\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem called \"Crazy Town.\" The gist of it is this: we've got a 2D plane with `n` lines (roads) cutting it up into different regions (blocks). We're given a starting point (\"home\") and an ending point (\"university\"), and we need to find the shortest path – which means figuring out the *minimum number of lines* we have to cross to get from home to the university. The tricky part is, home and the university aren't *on* any of the roads.\n\n**The Key Insight: Crossing Lines = Steps**\n\nThe biggest realization I had was that crossing a line is equivalent to taking a \"step\" to the next block.  We can move from one block to another only if they share a border, which essentially means crossing a line. So, the core of the solution is this:  to minimize the number of steps, we minimize the number of lines crossed.\n\n**Determining if Points Are Separated by a Line**\n\nNow, how do we know if a line actually *separates* home and the university?  A line `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two regions.  We can use the expression `f(x, y) = ax + by + c` for each point:\n*   If `f(home)` and `f(university)` have *opposite* signs (one positive, one negative), the line separates them – we have to cross it.\n*   If they have the *same* sign, the line doesn't separate them – we don't need to cross it.\nSince home and university aren't on any roads, `f(x,y)` will *never* be zero, which simplifies things.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nHere's the algorithm I've come up with:\n\n1.  Read the coordinates of home and university.\n2.  Read the number of roads (`n`).\n3.  Initialize a `steps` counter to 0.\n4.  For *each* road:\n    a. Read the coefficients (a, b, c) of the line.\n    b. Calculate `val1 = a * x_home + b * y_home + c` and `val2 = a * x_university + b * y_university + c`.\n    c. If `val1 * val2 < 0` (meaning opposite signs), increment `steps`.\n5.  Print the final value of `steps`.\n\n**Python Implementation**\n\nI'm pretty confident in the approach. The code is concise:  we read the input, loop through the lines, and check if the product of the `f(x,y)` values for home and university is negative. It looks efficient and robust and handles edge cases where lines might be parallel, intersecting at a single point, etc. The arbitrary precision of Python integers is great for handling potentially large coordinates and coefficients. After reviewing the problem description and examples again, I've got this one figured out.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing your home) to an ending block (containing the university). A \"step\" is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border of non-zero length. This means that to move from one block to another, you must cross exactly one road (line).\n\nTherefore, the problem can be rephrased as finding the minimum number of roads that must be crossed to get from the home's location to the university's location.\n\nA key geometric property is that a line `ax + by + c = 0` divides the 2D plane into two half-planes: `ax + by + c > 0` and `ax + by + c < 0`.\nTwo points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of the line `ax + by + c = 0` if and only if the values `(a*x1 + b*y1 + c)` and `(a*x2 + b*y2 + c)` have different signs. If they have the same sign, both points are on the same side of the line.\n\nSince it's guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lies on any road, the expression `ax + by + c` will never evaluate to zero for these points. This simplifies the check:\n\n1.  For each road `i` defined by `a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0`:\n2.  Calculate `val_home = a_i * x_home + b_i * y_home + c_i`.\n3.  Calculate `val_uni = a_i * x_uni + b_i * y_uni + c_i`.\n4.  If `val_home` and `val_uni` have different signs (i.e., `val_home * val_uni < 0`), then this road separates the home and the university. This means you *must* cross this road to get from one point to the other. Increment a counter for the number of steps.\n\nThe total count of such roads will be the minimum number of steps required.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\nHome: (1, 1), University: (-1, -1)\nRoad 1: `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y = 0`)\nRoad 2: `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x = 0`)\n\n1.  **For Road 1 (y = 0):**\n    *   Home (1, 1): `0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`.\n    *   University (-1, -1): `0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`.\n    *   `1` and `-1` have different signs (`1 * -1 < 0`). So, Road 1 separates them. `steps = 1`.\n\n2.  **For Road 2 (x = 0):**\n    *   Home (1, 1): `1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`.\n    *   University (-1, -1): `1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`.\n    *   `1` and `-1` have different signs (`1 * -1 < 0`). So, Road 2 separates them. `steps = 2`.\n\nThe minimum number of steps is 2.\n\nThe constraints are small (`N <= 300`), and coordinates/coefficients can be up to `10^6`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the calculations `a*x + b*y + c` without overflow.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to solve the problem\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of steps (roads to cross)\n    steps = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients (a, b, c) for the current road: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Evaluate the expression ax + by + c for the home coordinates.\n        # This value determines which side of the line the home point is on.\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        \n        # Evaluate the expression ax + by + c for the university coordinates.\n        # This value determines which side of the line the university point is on.\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        # If val_home and val_uni have different signs, it means:\n        # - One point is on the side where ax + by + c > 0.\n        # - The other point is on the side where ax + by + c < 0.\n        # This implies that the current road (line) separates the home and university.\n        # To get from home to university, this road must be crossed.\n        # The product of two numbers with different signs is negative.\n        # Since it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on any road,\n        # val_home and val_uni will never be zero.\n        if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n            steps += 1\n            \n    # Print the total minimum number of steps required\n    print(steps)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
