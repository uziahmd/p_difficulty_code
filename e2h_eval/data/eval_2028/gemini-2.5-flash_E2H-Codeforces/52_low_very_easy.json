Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Algorithm Design for New Year Candles**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem. The core is figuring out the total burn time, or, more precisely, the total number of candles lit. Vasily starts with 'a' candles, and each burns for an hour.  Then, 'b' spent candles can be used to make a new one.  Essentially, it's a recycling problem.\n\nMy initial thought is that this is best approached as a simulation. I need to track a few key variables:  `total_hours` (which is what I need to output), the number of `current_new_candles`, and the count of `burned_out_candles`.\n\nThe strategy I've landed on is an iterative approach. I'll initialize `total_hours` to zero, `current_new_candles` to the initial value 'a', and `burned_out_candles` to zero.  \n\nThen, I'll enter a loop that continues as long as I have new candles (`current_new_candles > 0`). Inside the loop, I'll:\n\n1.  Add the current number of `current_new_candles` to the `total_hours` – this simulates burning them.\n2.  Increment `burned_out_candles` by the same amount, as all burnt candles are \"used.\"\n3.  Set `current_new_candles` to zero for the current batch, since they've all been used.\n4.  Calculate `new_candles_from_crafting` by integer dividing `burned_out_candles` by 'b' (the recycling ratio).\n5.  Update `burned_out_candles` to keep only the remainder after crafting.\n6.  Finally, update `current_new_candles` to the calculated value.  This is what kicks off the next iteration, if any.\n\nI also worked through the example with a=4 and b=2 to check that my thinking maps to the test cases. This gives me confidence in the algorithm. So, now it is just a matter of implementing this in Python. This should be a straightforward translation of the algorithm to code.\n",
