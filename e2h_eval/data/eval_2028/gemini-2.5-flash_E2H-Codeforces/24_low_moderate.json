She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Browser Tab Closing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem in competitive programming, and the core challenge is figuring out the most efficient way to close tabs outside a specific range, `[l, r]`. My thought process is breaking down like this:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the available actions: I can move the cursor left or right, each taking a second, or close tabs to the left or right of the cursor, again, taking a second. The `a` and `b` variables represent the current bounds of *unclosed* tabs, and my initial assumption is that all tabs are open (`a=1`, `b=n`). Closing tabs changes these bounds. If I close tabs to the left of `pos`, the new left bound `a` becomes `pos`, and if I close to the right, `b` becomes `pos`.\n\nThe ultimate objective is to end up with only the tabs within the desired range, `[l, r]`, open. This means closing tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nI'm considering a few cases to simplify the logic:\n\n*   **Case 1: `l = 1` and `r = n`:** All tabs are already within the target range, meaning no action is needed, and the time is 0. This is the trivial case.\n\n*   **Case 2: `l > 1` and `r = n`:** I need to close tabs to the left of `l`, which means closing `[1, l-1]`. I'll consider where the cursor `pos` currently is:\n    *   If `pos` is already at or to the left of `l`, the time is the distance I need to travel to get to `l`, `l - pos`, plus one second to close.\n    *   If `pos` is to the right of `l`, the time is the distance I need to travel, `pos - l`, plus one second to close.\n    * I can consolidate this using the absolute difference, `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n*   **Case 3: `l = 1` and `r < n`:** I need to close tabs to the right of `r`, that is `[r+1, n]`. Again, I'll need to consider the position of my cursor:\n    * If `pos` is at or to the right of `r`: The time is the distance from `pos` to `r`, `pos - r`, plus one second.\n    * I see that in this case, the time will be `pos - r + 1`.\n\nNow that I've mapped out the cases, I should be able to translate this into an efficient Python script to get the correct result.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each move of the cursor or closing operation takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:**\n    If `l = 1` and `r = n`, all tabs are already within the desired range. No operations are needed.\n    Time: `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left need to be closed (i.e., `l > 1` and `r = n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l`, and then we perform the \"close left\" operation.\n    The time taken will be:\n    *   `abs(pos - l)` seconds to move the cursor from `pos` to `l`.\n    *   `1` second to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right need to be closed (i.e., `l = 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r`, and then we perform the \"close right\" operation.\n    The time taken will be:\n    *   `abs(pos - r)` seconds to move the cursor from `pos` to `r`.\n    *   `1` second to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Both tabs to the left and tabs to the right need to be closed (i.e., `l > 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two closing operations: one at `l` (to close left) and one at `r` (to close right). The cursor must visit both `l` and `r` at some point.\n\n    Let `cost_left = abs(pos - l) + 1` be the time to move to `l` and close tabs to its left.\n    Let `cost_right = abs(pos - r) + 1` be the time to move to `r` and close tabs to its right.\n\n    The total time will be:\n    *   Time to move from `pos` to `l` or `r` (whichever is closer or chosen first).\n    *   `1` second for the first closing operation.\n    *   Time to move from the first closing position (`l` or `r`) to the second closing position (`r` or `l`).\n    *   `1` second for the second closing operation.\n\n    This can be simplified:\n    The cursor starts at `pos`. It needs to visit `l` and `r`.\n    The total path length will be `(distance from pos to one endpoint) + (distance between endpoints)`.\n    For example, if we go `pos -> l -> r`: `abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r)`.\n    If we go `pos -> r -> l`: `abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l)`.\n    The `abs(l - r)` part is always `r - l`.\n    The two closing operations always take `2` seconds.\n\n    So, the total time is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n    This formula effectively calculates:\n    1.  Time to move from `pos` to the *closer* of `l` or `r`.\n    2.  Time to traverse the segment `[l, r]` to reach the other endpoint.\n    3.  `2` seconds for the two closing operations (one at `l`, one at `r`).\n\n    Let's combine these:\n    *   If `pos < l`: We must move right to `l`. Then, we must move right to `r`.\n        Time: `(l - pos) + (r - l) + 2 = r - pos + 2`.\n    *   If `pos > r`: We must move left to `r`. Then, we must move left to `l`.\n        Time: `(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 = pos - l + 2`.\n    *   If `l <= pos <= r`: The cursor is already within `[l, r]`. We can either:\n        *   Go left to `l`, close left, then go right to `r`, close right.\n            Time: `(pos - l) + (r - pos) + 2 = (r - l) + 2`.\n        *   Go right to `r`, close right, then go left to `l`, close left.\n            Time: `(r - pos) + (pos - l) + 2 = (r - l) + 2`.\n        In both cases, it's `(r - l) + 2`.\n\n    These three sub-cases can be summarized by `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n    Let's check:\n    *   If `pos < l`: `min(l - pos, r - pos)` is `l - pos`. Total: `(l - pos) + (r - l) + 2 = r - pos + 2`. Correct.\n    *   If `pos > r`: `min(pos - l, pos - r)` is `pos - r`. Total: `(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 = pos - l + 2`. Correct.\n    *   If `l <= pos <= r`: `min(pos - l, r - pos)`. Total: `min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l) + 2`. This is correct. For example, if `pos` is closer to `l`, `(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`. This is not `(r-l)+2`.\n        Ah, the `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))` part calculates the cost to reach *one* of the endpoints. The `(r - l)` part calculates the cost to travel *between* the endpoints. The `+2` is for the two closing operations.\n        So, if `l <= pos <= r`, we can move `pos -> l` (cost `pos - l`), close left (cost `1`), then move `l -> r` (cost `r - l`), close right (cost `1`). Total: `(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = pos - l + r - l + 2`.\n        Or, move `pos -> r` (cost `r - pos`), close right (cost `1`), then move `r -> l` (cost `r - l`), close left (cost `1`). Total: `(r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = r - pos + r - l + 2`.\n        This is not `(r - l) + 2`. The `(r - l) + 2` only works if `pos` is already inside the range `[l, r]` and we can just traverse it.\n        The correct way for `l <= pos <= r` is:\n        `min( (pos - l) + (r - l), (r - pos) + (r - l) ) + 2`\n        which simplifies to `(r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Case 4 with a more structured approach:\nWe need to perform two closing operations: one at `l` (to close `[1, l-1]`) and one at `r` (to close `[r+1, n]`). Each operation costs 1 second. So, 2 seconds for closing operations.\nThe remaining time is for moving the cursor. The cursor starts at `pos`. It needs to visit `l` and `r`.\nThe total movement time is `(distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r)` OR `(distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l)`.\nEffectively, it's `(r - l)` (distance between `l` and `r`) plus the distance from `pos` to the *closer* of `l` or `r`.\nSo, total time = `(r - l) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + 2`. This formula correctly covers all sub-cases within Case 4.\n\n**Summary of logic:**\n\n1.  Read `n, pos, l, r`.\n2.  Initialize `ans = 0`.\n3.  **Check if `l > 1` (need to close left side):**\n    If `l > 1`:\n    *   We need to move to `l` and perform a \"close left\" operation. This costs `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n    *   Add `1` to `ans` (for the closing operation).\n    *   Update `ans += abs(pos - l)`.\n    *   Update `pos = l` (cursor is now at `l` after closing left).\n4.  **Check if `r < n` (need to close right side):**\n    If `r < n`:\n    *   We need to move to `r` and perform a \"close right\" operation. This costs `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n    *   Add `1` to `ans` (for the closing operation).\n    *   Update `ans += abs(pos - r)`.\n    *   Update `pos = r` (cursor is now at `r` after closing right).\n\nThis approach is slightly flawed because it assumes a fixed order of operations (close left then close right). The `pos` updates after the first operation might make the second operation suboptimal.\n\nLet's use the derived formulas directly:\n\n*   **If `l == 1` and `r == n`:**\n    `ans = 0`\n*   **If `l == 1` and `r < n`:** (Only close right)\n    `ans = abs(pos - r) + 1`\n*   **If `l > 1` and `r == n`:** (Only close left)\n    `ans = abs(pos - l) + 1`\n*   **If `l > 1` and `r < n`:** (Close both left and right)\n    `ans = (r - l) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + 2`\n\nThis covers all cases and is correct. `n` is up to 100, so efficiency is not an issue.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n1.  `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\n    `l > 1` and `r < n`. This is the \"close both\" case.\n    `ans = (r - l) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + 2`\n    `ans = (4 - 2) + min(abs(3 - 2), abs(3 - 4)) + 2`\n    `ans = 2 + min(1, 1) + 2`\n    `ans = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`. Correct.\n\n2.  `n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\n    `l = 1` and `r < n`. This is the \"only close right\" case.\n    `ans = abs(pos - r) + 1`\n    `ans = abs(3 - 3) + 1`\n    `ans = 0 + 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\n3.  `n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\n    `l = 1` and `r = n`. This is the \"no operations\" case.\n    `ans = 0`. Correct.\n\nThe logic seems solid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        ans = 0\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the right need to be closed\n    elif l == 1: # implies r < n because if r == n, it's Case 1\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the left need to be closed\n    elif r == n: # implies l > 1 because if l == 1, it's Case 1 or Case 2\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 4: Both tabs to the left and right need to be closed\n    else: # l > 1 and r < n\n        # Option A: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right\n        # Cost: (pos -> l) + 1 (close left) + (l -> r) + 1 (close right)\n        cost_path_l_r = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        \n        # Option B: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left\n        # Cost: (pos -> r) + 1 (close right) + (r -> l) + 1 (close left)\n        cost_path_r_l = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        \n        ans = min(cost_path_l_r, cost_path_r_l)\n        \n        # This simplifies to:\n        # ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n        # Let's verify:\n        # (abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1) = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        # (abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1) = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        # So, min of these two is indeed min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n        ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    print(ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
