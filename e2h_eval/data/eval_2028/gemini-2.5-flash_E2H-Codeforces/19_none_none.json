The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

This might make the neighbor a leaf.\n\n    # Algorithm:\n    # 1. Initialize `current_degree[u]` for all `u` as `len(adj[u])`.\n    # 2. Initialize `is_removed[u] = False` for all `u`.\n    # 3. Create a queue `q`. Add all nodes `u` with `current_degree[u] == 1` to `q`.\n    # 4. `removed_count = 0`.\n    # 5. While `q` is not empty and `removed_count < k`:\n    #    a. Dequeue node `u`.\n    #    b. If `u` is not already removed and `n - removed_count > n - k`: (i.e., we can still remove `u` and have `n-k` nodes left)\n    #       i. Mark `u` as removed: `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    #       ii. Add `u` to `removed_nodes` list.\n    #       iii. `removed_count += 1`.\n    #       iv. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    #           1. Decrement `current_degree[v]`.\n    #           2. If `current_degree[v] == 1` and `v` is not removed, enqueue `v`.\n\n    # This greedy approach removes leaves. This ensures connectivity.\n    # However, it removes the smallest leaves first. This is exactly what we want!\n    # By removing leaves, we guarantee that the remaining graph is connected.\n    # And by processing nodes in increasing order (implicitly, by adding leaves to queue),\n    # we prioritize removing smaller indexed nodes.\n\n    # Example: 1-2-3-4-5, n=5, k=2\n    # Initial degrees: deg[1]=1, deg[2]=2, deg[3]=2, deg[4]=2, deg[5]=1\n    # Queue: [1, 5] (or [5, 1] depending on implementation)\n    # removed_count = 0\n\n    # Pop 1:\n    #   is_removed[1] = True, removed_count = 1, removed_nodes = [1]\n    #   Neighbor 2: current_degree[2] = 1. Add 2 to queue.\n    # Queue: [5, 2]\n\n    # Pop 5:\n    #   is_removed[5] = True, removed_count = 2, removed_nodes = [1, 5]\n    #   Neighbor 4: current_degree[4] = 1.

This is optimal.\n\n    # What if a node `u` has degree 1, but its neighbor `v` is already removed?\n    # `current_degree[v]` would have been decremented when `v`'s other neighbor was removed.\n    # The `current_degree` should reflect the degree in the *current* active graph.\n    # When `u` is processed, we iterate its `adj[u]`.\n    # For each `v` in `adj[u]`: if `v` is NOT removed, decrement `current_degree[v]`.\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # What if `n - removed_count > n - k` check?\n    # This means `removed_count < k`.
