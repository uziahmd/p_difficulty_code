            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down.**\n\nI'm tackling the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem. It seems straightforward at first glance, but there's a subtle geometric twist. The problem involves matching Rebel spaceships to bases, ensuring *no* intersections between their connecting lines.\n\n**The core idea:** We're given the number of Rebels (`R`) and Bases (`B`), along with their 2D coordinates. The key is in that \"perfect matching\" requirement, the fact that each Rebel has exactly one Base and vice versa. First thing I'm checking, if `R != B` there's no way this can work, so it's an immediate \"No\" and I can bail. \n\n**Intersection Detection is Key:** The constraints are lenient (`R, B <= 10`), so I'm thinking brute force with permutations is likely acceptable here, but I need to optimize how I detect line intersections. I need to be able to efficiently check if any two segments representing the matched Rebel-Base pairs intersect.  I'll leverage the classic orientation test using cross products.\n\n**The algorithm:** I'll generate all possible permutations of base assignments (since the number is small, it's feasible). For each permutation, I'll calculate the segments formed by matching each Rebel to its assigned base. Then, I'll iterate through all pairs of segments and use the cross-product to determine if they intersect. If I find a permutation without any intersections, I can print \"Yes\" and stop. If I exhaust all permutations and *still* can't find a valid matching, I'll print \"No\". \n",
