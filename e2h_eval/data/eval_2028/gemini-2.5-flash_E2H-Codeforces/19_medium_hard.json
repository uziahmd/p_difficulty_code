The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to pick a connected group of districts (a tree really, since it's n districts and n-1 roads) and maximize a weighted sum where each district's weight is 2 raised to the power of its index. Since the powers of two grow so fast, I should try to keep districts with the highest indices (most fans!) and remove districts with lower indices. I want to remove 'k' districts and report their indices.\n\nA greedy approach seems natural: I'll start with the largest index, 'n', and build a connected component. My intuition tells me to build it by trying to grab the next largest index, (n-1), making sure that it's connected to my existing component and so on.\n\nI considered a few approaches. First was picking all districts greater than or equal to `n-k+1`. But that might not be connected, so I need to check for it.  The logic is that if I remove leaves, the graph should stay connected after the removal.\n\nThe other thing to note is that removing a node from a tree, if it's not a leaf, can disconnect the tree. If it does, and the other parts are disconnected, I need to keep just one connected piece. \n\nI settled on a greedy strategy: I'll start by repeatedly removing leaves with the *smallest* index. This guarantees that I preserve the larger indices as much as possible, as the problem wants me to.  This is basically the same as the \"remove small, keep big\" logic.\n\nMy approach will be this:\n\n1.  Build an adjacency list for the tree.\n2.  Calculate degrees of each node (number of connections).\n3.  Add all initial leaves (nodes with a degree of 1) to a priority queue (min-heap), ordered by index.\n4.  While I need to remove more nodes ('k' is not zero):\n    a. Remove the smallest index leaf from the queue.\n    b. Decrement 'k'.\n    c. Update the degrees of its neighbors; add those new leaves to the queue.\n5.  Return the list of removed districts in increasing order.\n\nI think this strategy should work efficiently (`O(N log N)`) and correctly.  The reasoning is that since I'm removing leaves in increasing order, I'm prioritizing the preservation of larger indexed nodes. Removing leaves maintains connectivity in the graph, as it creates a smaller connected subtree.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts to participate in The Number Games such that:\n1. All selected districts form a connected component in the given graph.\n2. The total number of fans, which is the sum of `2^i` for each selected district `i`, is maximized.\nWe need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order of their district numbers.\n\nThe graph is a tree (given `n` districts and `n-1` roads, with a unique path between any two districts).\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. For any `j`, `2^j` is greater than the sum of `2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^(j-1)`. This means that to maximize the total number of fans, we should prioritize including districts with larger indices. For example, including district `N` is always better than including any combination of smaller-indexed districts if `N` can be part of a valid connected component of the required size.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach: we want to keep the `n-k` districts with the largest possible indices.\nLet `S_kept` be the set of districts we choose to keep. We start by including the largest district, `N`, in `S_kept`. Then, we try to add other districts, prioritizing those with the largest available indices, while ensuring `S_kept` remains connected.\n\nThis can be achieved using a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from district `N`.\n1. Initialize `S_kept = {N}`.\n2. Initialize a queue (or stack for DFS) with `N`.\n3. Initialize a `visited` set with `N`.\n4. While `len(S_kept) < n - k` and the queue/stack is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue/pop a district `u`.\n    b. Get all unvisited neighbors of `u`.\n    c. Sort these neighbors in *descending* order of their district numbers (to prioritize larger indices).\n    d. For each neighbor `v` in the sorted list:\n        i. If `len(S_kept) < n - k`:\n            Add `v` to `S_kept`.\n            Mark `v` as `visited`.\n            Enqueue/push `v`.\n        ii. Else (we have found `n-k` districts):\n            Break from this inner loop and the outer loop.\n\nAfter this process, `S_kept` will contain `n-k` districts that form a connected component and maximize the sum of `2^i`. The districts not in `S_kept` are the ones to be removed.\n\nLet's trace with the first example: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `6-3=3` districts.\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\n1. `S_kept = {6}`, `queue = [6]`, `visited = {6}`.\n2. `len(S_kept)` (1) < `n-k` (3).\n   Dequeue `u = 6`.\n   Unvisited neighbors of 6: `[2, 5]`.\n   Sorted descending: `[5, 2]`.\n   a. Consider `v = 5`. `len(S_kept)` (1) < 3. Add 5 to `S_kept`. `S_kept = {6, 5}`. `visited = {6, 5}`. Enqueue 5. `queue = [5]`.\n   b. Consider `v = 2`. `len(S_kept)` (2) < 3. Add 2 to `S_kept`. `S_kept = {6, 5, 2}`. `visited = {6, 5, 2}`. Enqueue 2. `queue = [5, 2]`.\n3. `len(S_kept)` (3) is now equal to `n-k`. Stop.\n\nThe districts to be kept are `{2, 5, 6}`.\nThe districts to be removed are all districts from `1` to `N` that are not in `S_kept`.\nRemoved districts: `[1, 3, 4]`.\nOutput these in increasing order: `1 3 4`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n- Use a `deque` for the BFS queue for efficient `popleft()`.\n- Use a `set` for `visited` nodes for `O(1)` average time complexity for lookups.\n- After finding `S_kept`, generate the `removed_nodes` list by iterating from `1` to `N` and checking if a node is in `S_kept`. Sort this list for output.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n- Building adjacency list: `O(N + M)` where `M = N-1` is the number of edges, so `O(N)`.\n- BFS: Each node and edge is processed at most once. Sorting neighbors takes `O(deg(u) log deg(u))`. In the worst case, a star graph, one node has degree `N-1`. The total time for sorting neighbors across all nodes would be `sum(deg(u) log deg(u))`. Since `sum(deg(u)) = 2(N-1)`, this sum can be `O(N log N)`.\n- Generating `removed_nodes` and sorting: `O(N)` for iteration, `O(k log k)` for sorting.\nOverall time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is approximately `10^6 * 20`, which is feasible within typical time limits (1-2 seconds).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Number of nodes to keep\n    nodes_to_keep_count = n - k\n\n    # If we need to keep all nodes, no nodes are removed.\n    # This case is actually k < n, so n-k >= 1.\n    # If k=0, nodes_to_keep_count = n, removed = [].\n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"\") # No nodes removed\n        return\n\n    # S_kept will store the districts we choose to keep\n    s_kept = set()\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    q = deque()\n    \n    # Visited set for BFS\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Start BFS from the largest district N\n    # We must keep node N if n-k >= 1, which is guaranteed by k < n.\n    s_kept.add(n)\n    q.append(n)\n    visited.add(n)\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while q and len(s_kept) < nodes_to_keep_count:\n        u = q.popleft()\n\n        # Collect unvisited neighbors and sort them by district number in descending order\n        neighbors_to_add = []\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if v not in visited:\n                neighbors_to_add.append(v)\n        \n        neighbors_to_add.sort(reverse=True) # Prioritize larger indices\n\n        for v in neighbors_to_add:\n            if len(s_kept) < nodes_to_keep_count:\n                s_kept.add(v)\n                visited.add(v)\n                q.append(v)\n            else:\n                # We have found enough nodes, stop adding\n                break\n    \n    # Collect the districts that were not kept\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in s_kept:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    # Output the removed districts in increasing order\n    # They are already collected in increasing order by the loop\n    print(*(removed_nodes))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
