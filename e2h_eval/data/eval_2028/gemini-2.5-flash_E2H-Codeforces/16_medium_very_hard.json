Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "**Algorithm Elaboration for \"Crazy Town\" Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so the Crazy Town problem is about finding the fewest road crossings to get from my home to the university. It's on a 2D plane with 'n' lines (roads). The key insight, which is where my thought process started, is that each line (represented as `ax + by + c = 0`) divides the plane into two regions. The sign of `ax + by + c` for any point (x, y) tells me which side of the line that point is on. Now, if my home and the university are on *opposite* sides of a line, then I *have* to cross that line. If they're on the same side, I don't need to. That's the core of it.\n\nThe whole \"minimum steps\" part of the problem description clued me into the fact that the actual coordinates of home and university don't matter as long as I know which side of each line they're on.  My thought process was that each line is like a barrier. I *must* cross it if home and uni are on opposite sides. Then I just need to count those barriers. Since you can only move between adjacent blocks via a common border and the start/end points are not directly on a road, a simple count of separating lines gives the minimum number of steps.\n\nSo, the algorithm that started to form was straightforward:  Read in the home and university coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2).  Then, for each road defined by (a, b, c), I'd calculate `val_home = a*x1 + b*y1 + c` and `val_uni = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`. If `val_home * val_uni` is negative, I increment the step count because that means they are on opposite sides of that road and must be crossed.  Easy.\n\nThe example walkthrough in the problem description further solidified this intuition. I worked out a simple case with a single line (x=0) and then with two lines (x=0, y=0), carefully calculating the signs and counting the crossings.  It all checked out, confirming my approach.\n\nThen, there was some careful examination of how the wording about a \"common border of non-zero length\" fit in. If two blocks are adjacent to an intersection but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, you cannot move. This implies that if the paths cross at a single point, it's not a valid move. But my thinking was if I *had* to cross that line to get to the uni from the home, that step would be counted.\n\nI then did a deep dive into the constraints, which is critical in competitive programming. The coordinates could be pretty large, but Python's arbitrary precision integers handle that without a problem. And the number of roads (n <= 300) is small enough for an O(n) algorithm. So that validated my O(n) solution.\n\nI went through the constraints like a checklist, making sure everything was covered.  I mentally ran through some edge cases -- parallel lines, intersecting lines, lines that are close, and so on. In each case, my core logic of checking the sign of `ax + by + c` continued to hold. Finally, I double-checked the code against the given example cases, just to be completely sure. After a thorough review and some testing, I was confident that I could write a reliable Python script to solve the \"Crazy Town\" problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing your home) to a destination block (containing the university). A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a single road (line segment).\n\nThe core idea relies on how a line `ax + by + c = 0` divides the 2D plane. For any point `(x, y)` not on the line, the expression `ax + by + c` will have a non-zero value.\n*   If `ax + by + c > 0`, the point `(x, y)` is on one side of the line.\n*   If `ax + by + c < 0`, the point `(x, y)` is on the other side of the line.\n\nSince it's guaranteed that neither your home `(x1, y1)` nor the university `(x2, y2)` lies on any road, the value `a * x + b * y + c` will always be non-zero for both points for any given road.\n\nNow, consider a single road `i` defined by `a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0`:\n1.  Calculate `val_home_i = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i`.\n2.  Calculate `val_uni_i = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i`.\n\n*   **If `val_home_i` and `val_uni_i` have the same sign** (both positive or both negative), it means your home and the university are on the same side of road `i`. To get from home to university, you do not need to cross this road.\n*   **If `val_home_i` and `val_uni_i` have different signs** (one positive and one negative), it means your home and the university are on opposite sides of road `i`. To get from home to university, you *must* cross this road at least once.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required is simply the count of roads that separate the home and the university. Each such road *must* be crossed, and each crossing constitutes one step. You cannot reach the opposite side of a line without crossing it. By crossing only the necessary lines, you achieve the minimum number of steps.\n\nWe can efficiently check if two numbers have different signs by multiplying them: if their product is negative, they have different signs.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `a, b, c`.\n    b.  Calculate `val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val_home * val_uni < 0`, increment `steps` (because home and university are on opposite sides of this road).\n6.  Print the final `steps` count.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Example 1):**\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nRoads:\n1. `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y=0`)\n2. `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x=0`)\n\n*   **For Road 1 (y=0):**\n    *   `val_home = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `val_uni = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Signs are different. `steps = 1`.\n*   **For Road 2 (x=0):**\n    *   `val_home = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `val_uni = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Signs are different. `steps = 2`.\n\nFinal answer: 2.\n\nThe constraints are small (`N <= 300`) and Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the potentially large intermediate products `a*x` and `val_home * val_uni`, making this approach efficient and correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for home (x1, y1)\n        # This value's sign indicates which side of the line the home is on.\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for university (x2, y2)\n        # This value's sign indicates which side of the line the university is on.\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val_home and val_uni have different signs, it means\n        # home and university are on opposite sides of this road.\n        # To get from home to university, this road must be crossed.\n        # The product of two numbers is negative if and only if they have different signs.\n        if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n            steps += 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
