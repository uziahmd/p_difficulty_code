Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle, and it's sounding like a straightforward optimization problem.  I need to find the smallest radius (let's call it `d`) for each lantern so that the entire street is illuminated. I can see the core of the problem: a street of length `l`, with `n` lanterns at specific locations `a_i`.  The goal is to find the minimum `d` required such that every point on the street from 0 to `l` is lit.\n\nFirst things first, I'm thinking sorting the lantern positions is key. The relative positions of the lanterns are going to impact how efficiently I can illuminate the street.  So, I'll sort the input list `a` to simplify calculations. Let's represent the sorted lantern positions as `a_0`, `a_1`, ... `a_{n-1}`.\n\nThe strategy that immediately comes to mind is to identify the critical \"gaps\" that need to be filled.  There are essentially two types of gaps I need to consider:\n\n1.  **Gaps between lanterns:**  For any two consecutive lanterns, there's a segment of the street that might not be lit. I need to figure out how much `d` needs to be to cover the segment between adjacent lanterns, from the one at `a_i` and the one at `a_{i+1}`.\n2.  **Gaps at the ends of the street:** The beginning (from 0 to `a_0`) and the end (from `a_{n-1}` to `l`) of the street need to be lit as well, potentially requiring a larger `d` value.\n\nNow, how to calculate the required `d` for each gap? Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Between Lanterns:**  To cover the segment between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, I need to find the maximum gap between them. The distance between the lanterns, divided by two gives me the amount needed for `d`.  This means I need `d` to be at least `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I'll need to calculate this for all consecutive lantern pairs and then take the maximum value. Let's call this maximum gap `max_gap_d`.\n\n*   **At the ends:** The first lantern at `a_0` needs to light all the way to 0.  This implies `d` must be at least `a_0`. Similarly, the last lantern at `a_{n-1}` must light all the way to `l`, meaning `d` should be at least `l - a_{n-1}`. I will keep track of this, let's say: `d = max(d, l - a_{n-1})`.\n\nThe total required `d` will be the max of those two.\n\nSo, the process seems to be: sort the lantern positions, calculate the distances between them, determine the necessary radius for each gap (between and at the ends), and finally take the maximum value across all gaps, with high precision for the output. I can write a Python script that implements these steps.\n",
