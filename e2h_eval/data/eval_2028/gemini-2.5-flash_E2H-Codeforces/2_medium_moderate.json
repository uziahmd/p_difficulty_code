Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this \"X\" grid problem.**\n\nFirst, I need to read the input - the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself as a 2D list.  Since `n` is odd and at least 3, I know I'll always have a valid grid. The core logic hinges on these key points:\n\n1. **Diagonal Consistency:** All characters along both main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) must be identical.  I'll grab the character at `grid[0][0]` as my reference for the diagonals.\n\n2. **Off-Diagonal Difference:** Every other cell (those *not* on a diagonal) must contain the *same* character, but crucially, this character needs to be different from the diagonal character.  I can safely grab the character at `grid[0][1]` as it is guaranteed to be a non-diagonal cell.\n\nThe main algorithm will iterate through every cell in the grid.  For each cell, I'll determine if it's on a diagonal using the conditions `r == c` (main diagonal) or `r + c == n - 1` (anti-diagonal).\n\n*   **If the cell is diagonal:** I check that its character matches the `diag_char`. If not, it's a \"NO\".\n*   **If the cell is off-diagonal:** I check that its character matches the `other_char`.  If not, it's a \"NO\".\n\nThere's an early check right after reading the input: if the `diag_char` and `other_char` are the same, I immediately print \"NO\" - that breaks the problem's rules.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies, it means the grid forms a valid \"X,\" and I print \"YES.\" I'll also ensure all input processing includes stripping the lines to remove the newline characters. And that's about it!\n",
