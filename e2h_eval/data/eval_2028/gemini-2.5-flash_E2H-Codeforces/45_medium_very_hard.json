There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Knockout Tournament Problem**\n\nMy main goal is to figure out the largest number of games the tournament winner can play, given a special rule about who can play whom.  The rule is that two players can only face each other if the difference in the number of games they've already played is no more than one. I'm thinking of this as an \"experience level\" – how many games they've won.  The winner must start at zero wins and keep winning. The loser is eliminated from the tournament.\n\nTo maximize the games for the winner, I need the winner to play as many games as possible against opponents close to the winner's experience.  I figured I needed to analyze the *minimum* number of players required to support the winner playing a particular number of games. I tried to figure this out with examples, like when n=4, or n=3. This is how I stumbled into the rule applying to all games, and not just the final games.  The winner can only keep playing by following the rule with all eliminated players.\n\nI started thinking about the total number of players needed. I realized that to have the winner with a certain number of wins `k`, the last game would be some player with `k-1` wins against someone with `k-1` or `k-2` wins.\n\nLet `N(k)` be the minimum number of players needed to produce a winner with `k` wins.  I'm trying to find a pattern.  I realized it was Fibonacci-like! I found a pattern: `N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)` because that's the minimal way to make tournaments. I also discovered that `N(0)` is 1 and `N(1)` is 2 to make the sequence work (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). The problem is now to find the largest `k` where `N(k)` is less than or equal to the total number of players `n`.\n\nSo, the new problem is to find `k` such that `Fib(k+1) <= n`. This turns into an algorithm, and given the massive range of n, I used an iterative approach, knowing the complexity is very good. I checked my approach with the examples in the problem description, like the edge case `n=2` and `n=4` to make sure it's valid.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. All `n` players must participate in the tournament.\n\nLet `N_k` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games, under the given rule, and ensuring all `N_k` players participate in the tournament.\n\nLet's analyze the base cases:\n*   **k = 0**: A player who hasn't played any games. This requires 1 player. So, `N_0 = 1`.\n*   **k = 1**: To play 1 game and win, a player (let's call them W) with 0 wins must play against an opponent (O) with 0 wins. `abs(0 - 0) = 0 <= 1`, so this is allowed. W wins and now has 1 win. This uses 2 players (W and O). So, `N_1 = 2`.\n\nNow, consider how to achieve `k` wins for the winner (W) in the most efficient way (i.e., using the minimum number of players).\nSuppose the winner `W` has `k-1` wins and is about to play their `k`-th game. Their opponent (O) must have `j` wins, such that `abs((k-1) - j) <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2` or `k-1`. (An opponent cannot have `k` wins before the game, as that would imply they won more games than the current winner in their path to this match).\n\nThere are two ways `W_{k-1}` can play their `k`-th game:\n\n1.  **`W_{k-1}` plays `O_{k-1}`**: Both players have `k-1` wins. `abs((k-1) - (k-1)) = 0 <= 1`, allowed.\n    To produce `W_{k-1}`, we need `N_{k-1}` players.\n    To produce `O_{k-1}`, we also need `N_{k-1}` players.\n    The total number of players for this scenario is `N_{k-1} + N_{k-1} = 2 * N_{k-1}`.\n\n2.  **`W_{k-1}` plays `O_{k-2}`**: The winner has `k-1` wins, the opponent has `k-2` wins. `abs((k-1) - (k-2)) = 1 <= 1`, allowed.\n    To produce `W_{k-1}`, we need `N_{k-1}` players.\n    To produce `O_{k-2}`, we need `N_{k-2}` players.\n    The total number of players for this scenario is `N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}`.\n\nTo find `N_k`, the *minimum* number of players, we should choose the option that requires fewer players. Since `N_{k-2} <= N_{k-1}` (it takes fewer or equal players to achieve fewer wins), `N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}` will always be less than or equal to `2 * N_{k-1}`.\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for `N_k` is:\n`N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence. Let's list the first few terms:\n*   `N_0 = 1`\n*   `N_1 = 2`\n*   `N_2 = N_1 + N_0 = 2 + 1 = 3`\n*   `N_3 = N_2 + N_1 = 3 + 2 = 5`\n*   `N_4 = N_3 + N_2 = 5 + 3 = 8`\n*   `N_5 = N_4 + N_3 = 8 + 5 = 13`\n...and so on.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` (number of games the winner plays) given `n` players. This means we need to find the largest `k` such that `N_k <= n`.\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n*   `n=2`: `N_1=2`. `N_2=3 > 2`. So, max `k=1`. Correct.\n*   `n=3`: `N_1=2, N_2=3`. `N_3=5 > 3`. So, max `k=2`. Correct.\n*   `n=4`: `N_1=2, N_2=3`. `N_3=5 > 4`. So, max `k=2`. Correct.\n*   `n=10`: `N_1=2, N_2=3, N_3=5, N_4=8`. `N_5=13 > 10`. So, max `k=4`. Correct.\n\nThe approach is to generate Fibonacci numbers (using `N_0=1, N_1=2` as base) until `N_k` exceeds `n`. The largest `k` for which `N_k <= n` is our answer.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to use 64-bit integers (Python handles large integers automatically). Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will be relatively small (around 80-90 for `10^18`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `a = 1` (representing `N_0`).\n2.  Initialize `b = 2` (representing `N_1`).\n3.  Initialize `k = 1` (because `N_1` is the first possible number of games for `n >= 2`).\n4.  While `b <= n`:\n    a.  Store `b` in a temporary variable `temp`.\n    b.  Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `b = a + b`.\n    c.  Update `a` to the previous `b`: `a = temp`.\n    d.  Increment `k` by 1.\n5.  When the loop terminates, `b` is the first `N_k` that is greater than `n`. The previous `k` value (before the last increment) corresponds to `a` (which holds `N_{k-1}`). So, the maximum number of games is `k-1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for N_k:\n    # N_0 = 1 (a player who hasn't played)\n    # N_1 = 2 (winner plays 1 game)\n    # N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2} for k >= 2\n\n    # If n is 2, the winner plays 1 game.\n    # The loop below correctly handles n=2.\n    # Initial state: a = N_0, b = N_1, k = 1\n    a = 1  # Represents N_{k-1} in the loop's context\n    b = 2  # Represents N_k in the loop's context\n    k = 1  # Represents the current number of games for which b is the required players\n\n    # We want to find the largest k such that N_k <= n.\n    # The loop continues as long as the current N_k (stored in 'b') is less than or equal to n.\n    while b <= n:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number (N_{k+1})\n        temp = b\n        b = a + b\n        a = temp\n        k += 1\n    \n    # When the loop exits, 'b' holds the first Fibonacci number (N_k) that is greater than 'n'.\n    # 'a' holds the previous Fibonacci number (N_{k-1}), which was <= n.\n    # 'k' was incremented one too many times.
