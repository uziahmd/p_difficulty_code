Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Longest Repeating Substring**\n\nAlright, let's figure out how to find the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. The input string will only have lowercase letters and will be no longer than 100 characters.\n\nMy approach will be straightforward: I'll try all possible substring lengths, starting with the longest. For each length, I'll iterate through all the substrings of that length within the main string. If a substring occurs more than once (allowing overlaps), I'll return its length, knowing I've found the maximum. If I get to the end without finding any substring that appears at least twice, I'll return 0.\n\nSince the string is small (length <= 100), a brute-force approach should be efficient enough.\n\nLet's say the input string is `S` with length `N`.\n\nHere's how I'll do it:\n\n1.  I'll start by iterating through lengths `L` from `N-1` down to 1.\n2.  For each length `L`, I'll slide a window of size `L` across the string.\n3.  For each substring, I'll check if it already exists in the set of substrings I've seen. If it does, great! I return `L`. If not, I'll add the substring to my set.\n4.  If I reach the end without finding a repeating substring, I'll return 0.\n\nThe key to efficiency here is using a set to store the seen substrings. This allows me to check if a substring has been encountered previously in almost constant time, avoiding a nested loop.\n\nThis approach should be `O(N^3)` in time complexity, which is fine for the given input constraints.\n\nI'll write the code and run it, and that should give me the answer.\n",
