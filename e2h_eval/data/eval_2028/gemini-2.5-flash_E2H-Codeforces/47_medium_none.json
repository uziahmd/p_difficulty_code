    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find a non-negative integer 'k' that minimizes the least common multiple (lcm) of (a+k) and (b+k), where 'a' and 'b' are given integers.  If there are multiple 'k' values that result in the minimum lcm, I need to pick the smallest 'k'.\n\nMy approach is based on understanding the relationship between lcm and greatest common divisor (gcd).  I know `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. Let `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`. Then, the problem becomes minimizing `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. I will define `d = gcd(x, y)`, and from the properties of gcd, I know that `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`. Let's assume without loss of generality that `a <= b`, so `diff = b - a >= 0`. If `diff` is 0, then a equals b. In that case, `lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`, and the solution is k=0.\n\nNow, if `diff > 0`, the key insight is that `d = gcd(a+k, diff)`. So, `d` must be a divisor of `diff`. I'll iterate through all divisors 'd' of `diff`. For each 'd', I need to find the smallest non-negative 'k' such that `a+k` is a multiple of 'd'.  I can calculate this smallest 'k' as `k = (D - (a % D)) % D` .\n\nOnce I have 'k', I compute `x = a + k`, `y = b + k`, and calculate the current lcm: `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. However, I will calculate this as `(x // actual_gcd) * y` to avoid potential integer overflow.  I'll keep track of the minimum lcm found so far and the corresponding 'k'. The algorithm will return the 'k' associated with the minimum lcm.\n\nI've carefully considered edge cases, such as when `a = b` and when `diff` is small or large.  I am confident in the correctness of this algorithm, especially after verifying it with several examples. My time complexity will depend on the number of divisors of `diff`, which is in the order of the square root of diff. The gcd operation is logarithmic, so the overall complexity should be efficient enough to solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. If there are multiple `k` values that yield the minimum LCM, we should choose the smallest such `k`.\n\nLet `X = a+k` and `Y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(X, Y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(X, Y) = (X * Y) / gcd(X, Y)`.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the `gcd` term.\n`gcd(X, Y) = gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\nUsing the property `gcd(A, B) = gcd(A, B-A)`, we can write:\n`gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume `a <= b`. If `a > b`, we can swap `a` and `b` because `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is symmetric.\nLet `diff = b-a`. So `diff >= 0`.\n\nSpecial case: If `a = b`, then `diff = 0`.\nIn this case, `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we must choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`. The minimum LCM is `a`.\n\nGeneral case: `a < b`, so `diff > 0`.\nFrom `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, diff)`, we know that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `diff`.\nLet `D` be a divisor of `diff`. We can iterate through all possible values for `D`. For each `D`, we need to find the smallest `k >= 0` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `D`. This ensures that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` will be at least `D`.\n\nFor a given divisor `D` of `diff`:\n1.  **Find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `D`**:\n    This `k` can be calculated as `(D - (a % D)) % D`.\n    *   If `a % D == 0`, then `a` is already a multiple of `D`, so `k=0`. The formula gives `(D - 0) % D = 0`.\n    *   If `a % D != 0`, let `a % D = r`. Then `k = D - r`. This `k` is positive and less than `D`. The formula gives `(D - r) % D = D - r`.\n    This `k` ensures that `a+k` is the smallest multiple of `D` that is greater than or equal to `a`.\n\n2.  **Calculate `X` and `Y`**:\n    Let `X = a+k` and `Y = b+k` using the `k` found in step 1.\n\n3.  **Calculate the actual `gcd(X, Y)`**:\n    Even though we chose `k` such that `X` is a multiple of `D`, `gcd(X, Y)` might be a multiple of `D`, not necessarily `D` itself. We need the true `gcd(X, Y)`. Let `actual_gcd = gcd(X, Y)`. We know `actual_gcd = gcd(X, diff)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate `lcm(X, Y)`**:\n    `current_lcm = (X * Y) // actual_gcd`. To prevent potential integer overflow if `X*Y` is very large (though Python handles arbitrary-precision integers), it's safer to compute this as `(X // actual_gcd) * Y`.\n\n5.  **Update minimum LCM and best `k`**:\n    We maintain `min_lcm` and `best_k` found so far.\n    *   If `current_lcm < min_lcm`, update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k`.\n    *   If `current_lcm == min_lcm`, we need to choose the smallest `k`. So, if `k < best_k`, update `best_k = k`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read integers `a` and `b`.\n2.  If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3.  Ensure `a < b` by swapping if necessary.\n4.  Calculate `diff = b - a`.\n5.  Initialize `min_lcm = infinity` and `best_k = 0`.\n6.  Find all divisors of `diff`. A common way is to iterate from `1` to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors.\n7.  For each divisor `D` of `diff`:\n    a.  Calculate `k = (D - (a % D)) % D`.\n    b.  Calculate `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`.\n    c.  Calculate `actual_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)`.\n    d.  Calculate `current_lcm = (x // actual_gcd) * y`.\n    e.  Compare `current_lcm` with `min_lcm` and update `min_lcm` and `best_k` according to the rules described above.\n8.  Print `best_k`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   `a, b <= 10^9`.\n*   `diff` can be up to `10^9 - 1`.\n*   Finding divisors of `diff` takes `O(sqrt(diff))` time. For `diff` up to `10^9`, `sqrt(10^9)` is about `31622`, which is efficient.\n*   The number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is at most `1344` (for `735134400`).\n*   For each divisor, we perform a few arithmetic operations and one `gcd` calculation. `math.gcd` is efficient, taking `O(log(max(x, y)))` time.\n*   The maximum values for `x, y` can be around `2 * 10^9`.\n*   Overall time complexity: `O(sqrt(diff) + num_divisors(diff) * log(max(a,b)))`. This is well within typical time limits (e.g., 1-2 seconds).\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n# Function to find all divisors of a number\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divs = set()\n    # Iterate up to sqrt(n) to find divisors\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return list(divs)\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read input integers a and b\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Special case: if a and b are equal, lcm(a+k, b+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, the smallest non-negative k is 0.\n    if a == b:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a is the smaller number for consistent diff calculation.\n    # Swapping a and b does not change lcm(a+k, b+k).\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    # Calculate the difference between b and a.\n    # gcd(a+k, b+k) must be a divisor of (b-a).\n    diff = b - a\n\n    # Initialize minimum LCM to infinity and best_k to 0.\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n\n    # Get all divisors of 'diff'.
