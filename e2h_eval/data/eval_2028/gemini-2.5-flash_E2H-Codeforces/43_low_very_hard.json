He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing String Formation Logic**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to write a Python script, and the core of it will be a function that determines whether a given string, which I'll call `S`, conforms to a specific set of rules. Let's break down those rules into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, the string's construction starts with a variable number of 'a's. We'll denote this quantity as `count_a`, and it *has* to be at least one. So, the string begins looking like `aaaa...a`.\n\nNext, we append a number of 'b's. This number, `count_b`, is also at least one, and the string now resembles `aaaa...abbbb...b`.\n\nFinally, we append a number of 'c's. This final count, `count_c`, is the interesting part. It *must* be equal to either `count_a` or `count_b`, or potentially both. So, the end result is a string like `aaaa...abbbb...bcccc...c`.\n\nMy primary task is to receive a string `S` and determine if it could have been generated following these rules. Let's analyze the properties of a valid string structure. It must consist of an initial sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and concluded by 'c's. Regarding the counts, we have the constraints: `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, and `count_c >= 1`. Additionally, `count_c` has to match `count_a` or `count_b`.\n\nI'm envisioning iterating through the input string `S` in order to identify these distinct segments. For instance, finding the initial occurrence of 'b' will signify the boundary between the 'a's and 'b's. Similarly, discovering the initial 'c' will mark the transition from 'b's to 'c's.\n\nI can envision a process, let's call the length of S n = len(S).\n\n**Step 1. Check Character Order and Counts:**\n\n1.  **Find `count_a`:** I can iterate from the beginning, checking for sequences of 'a's. As soon as I find a character that isn't 'a', it indicates the end of the 'a's.\n    *   Let `i` be my index counter through the string, and initially `count_a = 0`.\n    *   I'll increment `count_a` as long as the current character is 'a'.\n    *   If `count_a` ends up being zero, the string is invalid, as we must have at least one 'a'.\n\n2.  **Find `count_b`:** Proceeding from the index after the 'a' segment, I expect to encounter 'b's.\n    *   Let `j` be the index after `count_a` (i from previous step). `count_b` will start as 0.\n    *   Increment `count_b` so long as the character is 'b'.\n    *   If `count_b` ends up being zero, it is invalid (at least 1 'b' is required.)\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed by a specific three-step process involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nLet's break down the rules for forming the string and the constraints:\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with a string of one or more 'a's. Let `count_a` be the number of 'a's. So, `count_a >= 1`.\n    *   The string looks like: `a...a`\n\n2.  **B's step**: B appends one or more 'b's to the end of A's string. Let `count_b` be the number of 'b's.\n    *   Constraint: At this point, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Since `count_a >= 1` is already established, this means `count_b >= 1`.\n    *   The string looks like: `a...ab...b`\n\n3.  **C's step**: C appends some 'c's to the end. Let `count_c` be the number of 'c's.\n    *   Constraint: `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`. It can also be equal to both.\n    *   The string looks like: `a...ab...bc...c`\n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the structural and numerical properties of a valid string:\n\n**Structural Properties:**\n*   The string must start with one or more 'a's.\n*   These 'a's must be followed by one or more 'b's.\n*   These 'b's must be followed by one or more 'c's.\n*   No other characters ('a', 'b', or 'c') should appear after their respective segments. For example, an 'a' cannot appear after a 'b' or 'c', and a 'b' cannot appear after a 'c'.\n*   All characters in the string must be 'a', 'b', or 'c'. (The problem statement guarantees this.)\n\n**Numerical Properties (Counts):**\n*   `count_a >= 1`\n*   `count_b >= 1`\n*   `count_c >= 1` (This is implied because `count_c` must equal `count_a` or `count_b`, and both are at least 1).\n*   `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can iterate through the string `S` to identify the segments of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's and count them.\n\n1.  **Initialize counts and pointers**:\n    *   `count_a = 0`, `count_b = 0`, `count_c = 0`\n    *   `n = len(S)`\n    *   `i = 0` (current index)\n\n2.  **Count 'a's**:\n    *   While `i < n` and `S[i] == 'a'`:\n        *   `count_a += 1`\n        *   `i += 1`\n\n3.  **Count 'b's**:\n    *   While `i < n` and `S[i] == 'b'`:\n        *   `count_b += 1`\n        *   `i += 1`\n\n4.  **Count 'c's**:\n    *   While `i < n` and `S[i] == 'c'`:\n        *   `count_c += 1`\n        *   `i += 1`\n\n5.  **Check remaining characters**:\n    *   If `i < n` (meaning there are characters left after the 'c's segment), then the string has an incorrect structure (e.g., `aaabbccda`). This is invalid.\n\n6.  **Apply all constraints**:\n    *   Check if `count_a >= 1`.\n    *   Check if `count_b >= 1`.\n    *   Check if `count_c >= 1`.\n    *   Check if `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`.\n\n    If all these conditions are met, the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **Input: \"aaabccc\"**\n    1.  `count_a = 3`, `i = 3` (after 'aaa')\n    2.  `count_b = 1`, `i = 4` (after 'b')\n    3.  `count_c = 3`, `i = 7` (after 'ccc')\n    4.  `i == n` (no remaining chars).\n    5.  Constraints:\n        *   `count_a = 3 >= 1` (True)\n        *   `count_b = 1 >= 1` (True)\n        *   `count_c = 3 >= 1` (True)\n        *   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3) is True.\n    Result: \"YES\"\n\n*   **Input: \"bbacc\"**\n    1.  `count_a = 0`, `i = 0` (first char is 'b', not 'a')\n    2.  Constraints: `count_a = 0 >= 1` is False.\n    Result: \"NO\" (as expected by example output)\n\n*   **Input: \"aabc\"**\n    1.  `count_a = 2`, `i = 2` (after 'aa')\n    2.  `count_b = 1`, `i = 3` (after 'b')\n    3.  `count_c = 1`, `i = 4` (after 'c')\n    4.  `i == n` (no remaining chars).\n    5.  Constraints:\n        *   `count_a = 2 >= 1` (True)\n        *   `count_b = 1 >= 1` (True)\n        *   `count_c = 1 >= 1` (True)\n        *   `count_c == count_a` (1 == 2) is False.\n        *   `count_c == count_b` (1 == 1) is True.\n    Result: \"YES\"\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   String length 1: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\". All would fail `count_a>=1`, `count_b>=1`, `count_c>=1`. Correct.\n*   String \"aa\": `count_a=2`, `count_b=0`, `count_c=0`. Fails `count_b>=1`. Correct.\n*   String \"ab\": `count_a=1`, `count_b=1`, `count_c=0`. Fails `count_c>=1`. Correct.\n*   String \"abc\": `count_a=1`, `count_b=1`, `count_c=1`. `count_c==count_a` (1==1). Valid. Correct.\n\nThis algorithm correctly covers all structural and numerical constraints. The time complexity will be O(N) because we iterate through the string once, where N is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n    \n    i = 0\n\n    # Count 'a's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Count 'b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Count 'c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Check if there are any characters left (indicating incorrect order)\n    if i < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Check all conditions based on counts\n    # 1.
