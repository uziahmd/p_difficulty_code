Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Colored Boots Problem: A Maximum Matching Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Colored Boots,\" and it's a classic matching problem at heart. The setup is straightforward: *n* left boots, *n* right boots, each with a color or a question mark.  The goal is to maximize the number of compatible pairs, keeping in mind that a boot can only be in one pair.\n\nMy initial thought is that this boils down to finding a maximum matching.  The compatibility rules are key here.  Identical colors are always a match, and a question mark is a wildcard, compatible with anything.  This suggests a greedy strategy might be the way to go, prioritizing the most restrictive matches first to avoid potentially blocking more favorable pairings later on.\n\nI need to start with understanding the input and output formats thoroughly. I'm given an integer *n* and two strings *l* and *r* representing the left and right boots respectively, and I have to output the maximum number of pairs *k*, followed by *k* lines with the 1-indexed indices of the pairs. The constraints tell me that *n* can be as large as 150,000, so any solution needs to be reasonably efficient.\n\nNow, let's break down the strategy in more detail. I'm thinking of categorizing the boots:  those with specific colors (a-z) and those with question marks. Given how matching works, it's pretty clear that a `specific_color` - `specific_color` pairing is the most restrictive and desirable. I also have to consider the fact that a '?' can be paired with any other boot.\n\nTherefore, my intuitive strategy is to work through these compatibility types in descending order of restrictiveness: first matching boots of the *same* specific color, followed by boots of a specific color with a question mark, and finally question marks with other question marks. That means I will prioritize the 'specific_color' - 'specific_color' matching first. I'm trying to ensure that I maximize specific color pairings before pairing a '?' with a color, which might block a better, all-'specific_color' match.\n\nTo implement this, I'll need to store the indices of the boots.  My thought is to use lists, something like a `left_indices` and `right_indices` structure.  I can use a `collections.defaultdict(list)` or an array, where the index represents the color (using ord() to map letters to indices) with an additional element for the question mark ('?'). So, I'll have an array of lists: `left_indices = [[] for _ in range(27)]` and `right_indices = [[] for _ in range(27)]`.  The first 26 indices will correspond to the letters 'a' to 'z', and the 27th will correspond to '?'.  I'll iterate through the input strings and populate these lists accordingly, storing the 1-indexed boot indices. This will make it easier to go through the different matchings in order.\n",
