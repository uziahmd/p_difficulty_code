For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**A Deep Dive into a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm tackling a tricky competitive programming problem where the goal is to count the number of ways to pick values (c_s) for binary strings. These values determine the maximum size of a \"beautiful multiset.\" The beautiful multiset's size is influenced by these c_s values, which have constraints. Finding the maximum size and then figuring out how many different c_s combinations lead to a specific maximum size (f) is the core of the challenge.\n\nThe concept of a beautiful multiset is key. It means that for every substring 's', the count of strings in the multiset with 's' as a prefix is limited by c_s. The mathematical structure is like a binary tree (trie). We're essentially trying to \"fill\" this tree with paths, but each node (representing a prefix string) has a capacity (c_s).\n\nI started by looking for a greedy or dynamic programming (DP) approach. Initially, my intuition led me to define a DP state that represents the maximum number of strings under each node. This translated into a recursive definition: at a leaf node (strings of length n), the max count is simply c_s; at an internal node, it's the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximums of its children (because a string under an internal node must extend under one of its children).\n\nThis structure strongly suggested a bottom-up DP. If I could figure out the maximum number of strings in each subtree, I can derive the maximum multiset.  The crucial insight here is that for any string of length L, all strings of length L behave structurally the same. The DP state becomes `dp[L][val]`.\n\nHere's where things got interesting. I refined my thinking to use this structure to count the solutions. Each value 'val' at depth L represents the number of solutions for a specific node to equal 'val'. The key is to carefully construct the DP so that transitions between levels incorporate the constraints and maximize the resulting multiset.\n\nI realized I need to count *how many* ways to get each possible maximum size. I settled on a DP formulation:  Let `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways, from level `L` down to level `n`, that the maximum value equals 'val.' \n\nThis leads to a recursive transition: the number of ways to pick `c_s` and  the number of ways to pick values for the children of node 's' so that `max(s) = val`.\n\nAfter some iterations, the DP transition formula emerges: the total is a sum of ways to choose c_s such that `min(c_s, x + y) = val`.\n\nThis requires computing convolutions using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform). The problem boils down to computing a series of polynomial convolutions for a bunch of subtrees and combining the results. The final answer will be found in the convolution result.\n\nNTT is efficient polynomial multiplication modulo a prime and requires careful implementation to achieve the required performance. The constraints of the problem guide the implementation. I need to take care of modulo arithmetic throughout the calculations.\n\nThe critical step involves NTT to efficiently multiply polynomials during the DP transitions. I need the NTT, the modulo prime, and all the required calculations and array sizes. I need to pad the array size to the closest power of 2, a crucial step for NTT. In the end, the solution has been reached.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$, such that $0 \\le c_s \\le k$, and the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly $f$. We need to output the answer modulo $998244353$.\n\nLet $M(s)$ be the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe definition of a beautiful multiset implies a hierarchical structure based on prefixes, which can be modeled using a binary tree (trie).\n- If $s$ is a binary string of length $n$ (a leaf in the trie), then $M(s) = c_s$. This is because any string in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix must be $s$ itself.\n- If $s$ is a binary string of length $L < n$ (an internal node), then the strings in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix either have $s0$ as a prefix or $s1$ as a prefix. To maximize the count for $s$, we would sum the maximum counts from its children: $M(s0) + M(s1)$. However, this sum must not exceed $c_s$. So, $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\n\nThe \"empty string\" (root of the trie) is not constrained by a $c_s$ value. The total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $M(\\text{empty string})$. This is simply the sum of maximum counts from its children '0' and '1': $S_{max} = M('0') + M('1')$.\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to choose all $c_s$ such that $S_{max} = f$. This can be solved using dynamic programming.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ in the subtree rooted at a specific string $s$ of length $L$, such that $M_L(s) = val$. By symmetry, this value is the same for any string $s$ of length $L$.\n\n**Base Case:** $L=n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $M_n(s) = c_s$. We must choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, $dp[n][val] = 1$ if $0 \\le val \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step:** For $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$.\nTo compute $dp[L][v]$ for a string $s$ of length $L$:\n$M_L(s) = \\min(c_s, M_{L+1}(s0) + M_{L+1}(s1))$.\nWe need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nLet $X = M_{L+1}(s0)$ and $Y = M_{L+1}(s1)$. The number of ways to achieve these values are $dp[L+1][X]$ and $dp[L+1][Y]$ respectively.\nSo, $dp[L][v] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{X=0}^k \\sum_{Y=0}^k [v = \\min(c_s, X+Y)] \\cdot dp[L+1][X] \\cdot dp[L+1][Y]$.\n\nThis triple summation can be optimized.\nLet $S_{L+1}[Z] = \\sum_{X+Y=Z} dp[L+1][X] \\cdot dp[L+1][Y]$. This is the convolution of $dp[L+1]$ with itself.\n$S_{L+1}[Z]$ represents the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ values in the subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $M_{L+1}(s0) + M_{L+1}(s1) = Z$.\nThe maximum value for $X, Y$ is $k$, so $Z$ can range from $0$ to $2k$.\nThe convolution can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in $O(K \\log K)$ time, where $K$ is the maximum possible sum $2k$.\n\nNow, the expression for $dp[L][v]$ becomes:\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{Z=0}^{2k} [v = \\min(c_s, Z)] \\cdot S_{L+1}[Z]$.\nLet's analyze the condition $v = \\min(c_s, Z)$:\n1. If $c_s = v$: Then we need $v = \\min(v, Z)$, which implies $Z \\ge v$. The contribution is $\\sum_{Z=v}^{2k} S_{L+1}[Z]$. This occurs for one choice of $c_s$.\n2. If $c_s > v$: Then we need $v = \\min(c_s, Z)$, which implies $Z = v$. The contribution is $S_{L+1}[v]$. This occurs for $k-v$ choices of $c_s$ (namely $v+1, \\dots, k$).\n3. If $c_s < v$: Then we need $v = \\min(c_s, Z)$, which implies $v = c_s$. This contradicts $c_s < v$, so there is no contribution from this case.\n\nCombining these, for $0 \\le v \\le k$:\n$dp[L][v] = \\left( \\sum_{Z=v}^{2k} S_{L+1}[Z] \\right) + (k-v) \\cdot S_{L+1}[v]$.\nLet $SuffS_{L+1}[v] = \\sum_{Z=v}^{2k} S_{L+1}[Z]$ be the suffix sum.\nThen $dp[L][v] = (SuffS_{L+1}[v] + (k-v) \\cdot S_{L+1}[v]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nThe suffix sums can be precomputed in $O(K)$ time after $S_{L+1}[Z]$ is known.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize $dp\\_current = [1] * (k+1)$ (representing $dp[n]$).\n2. For $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n   a. Pad $dp\\_current$ to a length $N$ which is a power of 2 and $\\ge 2k+1$. (e.g., $N=2^{19}$ for $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n   b. Compute $S\\_coeffs = \\text{NTT}(dp\\_current, \\text{false})$. Then square each element: $S\\_coeffs[i] = (S\\_coeffs[i] \\cdot S\\_coeffs[i]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n   c. Compute $S\\_values = \\text{NTT}(S\\_coeffs, \\text{true})$. This gives the $S_{L+1}[Z]$ values.\n   d. Compute suffix sums: $SuffS[2k] = S\\_values[2k]$, and $SuffS[v] = (S\\_values[v] + SuffS[v+1]) \\pmod{MOD}$ for $v$ from $2k-1$ down to $0$.\n   e. Create a new $dp\\_next$ array (representing $dp[L]$) of size $k+1$. For $v$ from $0$ to $k$:\n      $dp\\_next[v] = (SuffS[v] + (k-v) \\cdot S\\_values[v]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n   f. Set $dp\\_current = dp\\_next$.\n3. After the loop, $dp\\_current$ holds $dp[1]$ values.\n4. Compute the final answer: $S_{final}[f] = \\sum_{X+Y=f} dp[1][X] \\cdot dp[1][Y]$. This is the $f$-th coefficient of the convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself.\n   a. Pad $dp\\_current$ to length $N$.\n   b. Compute $S\\_coeffs = \\text{NTT}(dp\\_current, \\text{false})$. Square elements.\n   c. Compute $S\\_values = \\text{NTT}(S\\_coeffs, \\text{true})$.\n   d. The answer is $S\\_values[f]$.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Time: $n$ iterations. Each iteration involves one NTT, one inverse NTT, and $O(K)$ operations for suffix sums and final $dp$ array calculation. NTT takes $O(N \\log N)$ where $N$ is the padded length (power of 2, $N \\ge 2k+1$). For $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $N=2^{19}=524288$.\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot N \\log N)$. With $n=15$, this is approximately $15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$, which is acceptable for typical competitive programming limits (around $10^8$ operations per second).\n- Space: $O(N)$ for storing polynomial coefficients and intermediate arrays.\n\n**Modulus and Primitive Root:**\nThe modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number. Its factors are $1, 3, 23, 29, 461, 998244353$. $998244353 - 1 = 998244352 = 2^{23} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 1729$. This allows NTT up to size $2^{23}$.\nA primitive root modulo $998244353$ is $3$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# NTT function (Number Theoretic Transform)\n# a: list of coefficients (polynomial)\n# invert: boolean, True for inverse NTT, False for forward NTT\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative butterfly operations\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        # wlen is the n-th root of unity (or its inverse)\n        wlen = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = pow(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD) # Modular inverse for inverse NTT\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half * 2):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    # Scale by inverse of N for inverse NTT\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Determine the required size for NTT.\n    # The maximum value for X or Y is k.\n    # The maximum sum X+Y is 2k.\n    # The polynomial for S_values will have degree 2k.\n    # So we need N >= 2k + 1.
