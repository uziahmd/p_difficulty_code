            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

This forms [1p, 2p, 3p]. This is 1 draw.\n    # This was covered in the 1 draw section.\n\n    # Let's re-evaluate the logic for 2 draws.\n    # We are looking for a mentsu in (t1, t2, t3, d1, d2).\n    # If 0 or 1 draw is not enough, it means:\n    #   - No mentsu in (t1, t2, t3)\n    #   - For any single drawn tile `d`, no mentsu in (t1, t2, t3, d)\n\n    # This means we need to draw TWO tiles (d1, d2) such that a mentsu exists.\n    # The mentsu could be:\n    # 1.

Draw 1m. This forms [1m, 1m, 1m].\n    #    E.g., if hand has 1m, 2m. Draw 3m. This forms [1m, 2m, 3m].\n    #    The 1-draw check: `check_mentsu(tiles + [new_tile])`.\n    #    If `tiles` has `1m, 1m, X`, then `tiles + [1m]` has `1m, 1m, 1m, X`. `check_mentsu` would find it.\n    #    If `tiles` has `1m, 2m, X`, then `tiles + [3m]` has `1m, 2m, 3m, X`. `check_mentsu` would find it.\n    #    So, the 1-draw case covers mentsu formed by (2 existing + 1 drawn).\n\n    # Therefore, if 0 or 1 draw doesn't work, we need 2 draws.\n    # The only remaining case is that 2 draws is always possible.\n    # Why? We can always draw two tiles that form a pair for a koutsu with one existing tile,\n    # or two tiles that complete a shuntsu with one existing tile.\n    # For example, if we have [1m, 5p, 9s].\n    # Take 1m. We can draw 1m, 1m to make a koutsu [1m, 1m, 1m]. (2 draws)\n    # We can draw 2m, 3m to make a shuntsu [1m, 2m, 3m]. (2 draws)\n    # We can draw 9s, 9s to make a koutsu [9s, 9s, 9s]. (2 draws)\n    # This means 2 draws is always sufficient if 0 or 1 is not.\n\n    # So, the logic is:\n    # 0 draws: check if current hand has a mentsu.\n    # 1 draw: check if adding any single tile creates a mentsu.\n    # If neither of above, then it must be 2 draws.\n\n    # This seems to be the intended solution. The problem statement's example 3:\n    # [3p, 9m, 2p]. Output 1.\n    # My logic:\n    # 0 draws:\n    #   Hand: [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]\n    #   Counts: { (3,'p'):1, (9,'m'):1, (2,'p'):1 }. No koutsu.\n    #   Shuntsu:\n    #     m: [9]\n    #     p: [2, 3]\n    #     s: []\n    #   No shuntsu. So 0 draws is False.\n\n    # 1 draw:\n    #   Try drawing 1p: Hand becomes [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (1, 'p')]\n    #     Counts: { (3,'p'):1, (9,'m'):1, (2,'p'):1, (1,'p'):1 }.

This matches the example.\n\n    # My reasoning for 2 draws being the maximum needed if 0 or 1 isn't enough seems correct.\n    # It's always possible to pick one of your existing tiles (e.g., the first one `t1`) and\n    # draw two more tiles to form a koutsu (t1, t1, t1) or a shuntsu (t1, t1+1, t1+2, or t1-1, t1, t1+1, etc.).\n    # Since we only need \"at least one mentsu\", any of these options would work.\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of draws is 2.\n\n    print(2)\n\n\nsolve()\n```",

This forms [1m, 2m, 3m].\n    #    The 1-draw check: `check_mentsu(tiles + [new_tile])`.\n    #    If `tiles` has `1m, 1m, X`, then `tiles + [1m]` has `1m, 1m, 1m, X`. `check_mentsu` would find it.\n    #    If `tiles` has `1m, 2m, X`, then `tiles + [3m]` has `1m, 2m, 3m, X`. `check_mentsu` would find it.\n    #    So, the 1-draw case covers mentsu formed by (2 existing + 1 drawn).\n\n    # Therefore, if 0 or 1 draw doesn't work, we need 2 draws.\n    # The only remaining case is that 2 draws is always possible.\n    # Why? We can always draw two tiles that form a pair for a koutsu with one existing tile,\n    # or two tiles that complete a shuntsu with one existing tile.\n    # For example, if we have [1m, 5p, 9s].\n    # Take 1m. We can draw 1m, 1m to make a koutsu [1m, 1m, 1m]. (2 draws)\n    # We can draw 2m, 3m to make a shuntsu [1m, 2m, 3m]. (2 draws)\n    # We can draw 9s, 9s to make a koutsu [9s, 9s, 9s]. (2 draws)\n    # This means 2 draws is always sufficient if 0 or 1 is not.\n\n    # So, the logic is:\n    # 0 draws: check if current hand has a mentsu.\n    # 1 draw: check if adding any single tile creates a mentsu.\n    # If neither of above, then it must be 2 draws.\n\n    # This seems to be the intended solution. The problem statement's example 3:\n    # [3p, 9m, 2p]. Output 1.\n    # My logic:\n    # 0 draws:\n    #   Hand: [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]\n    #   Counts: { (3,'p'):1, (9,'m'):1, (2,'p'):1 }. No koutsu.\n    #   Shuntsu:\n    #     m: [9]\n    #     p: [2, 3]\n    #     s: []\n    #   No shuntsu. So 0 draws is False.\n\n    # 1 draw:\n    #   Try drawing 1p: Hand becomes [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (1, 'p')]\n    #     Counts: { (3,'p'):1, (9,'m'):1, (2,'p'):1, (1,'p'):1 }. No koutsu.\n    #     Shuntsu:\n    #       m: [9]\n    #       p: [1, 2, 3] -> YES, [1p, 2p, 3p] is a shuntsu.\n    #   So 1 draw is True. Output 1. This matches the example.\n\n    # My reasoning for 2 draws being the maximum needed if 0 or 1 isn't enough seems correct.\n    # It's always possible to pick one of your existing tiles (e.g., the first one `t1`) and\n    # draw two more tiles to form a koutsu (t1, t1, t1) or a shuntsu (t1, t1+1, t1+2, or t1-1, t1, t1+1, etc.).\n    # Since we only need \"at least one mentsu\", any of these options would work.\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of draws is 2.\n\n    print(2)\n\n\nsolve()",
