There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Tennis Championship Conundrum**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and my expert brain immediately starts breaking it down.  The core challenge is figuring out the *maximum* number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given this specific rule about win discrepancies. Let's see...\n\nFirst, the rule.  It's all about keeping those win counts close.  Two players can only face off if the absolute difference in their wins is no more than one.  The winner, obviously, keeps racking up wins as they advance.\n\nSo, if the winner plays `k` games, they've got `k` wins.  Let's think through the implications of this rule for each game the winner plays.  Game one is easy, the winner is at zero wins, and so is the opponent. They can play against anyone. After each game, my win count goes up by one, and I've got to find the optimal opponent. What are the possibilities?\n\nLooking at that win discrepancy rule, it seems to suggest that the sequence of total player involvement increases in a Fibonacci-like pattern. If the winner has won `k` games, I need to figure out the minimal number of players to accommodate all the games and ensure everyone plays following the rule.  That minimum player count seems linked to the maximum number of people we can get into the tournament when the winner plays `k` games.\n\nLet me define `f(k)` as the *minimum* number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games, and `N(k)` as the *maximum* number of players that can be in the tournament with that number of games. These are equivalent, right? If I know the minimum player count required for a winner to play `k` games, that also defines the largest tournament that can have that number of games.\n\nTracing this out, let's start small. One game means two players, zero wins each initially. Two games? The winner needs to play two opponents. Let's maximize the number of people. If I've won one game, the next opponent has to have either zero or one win. That tells me the number of players.\n\nI think I can formulate this recursively. Let's use `dp[k]` to represent that maximum number of participants for a winner playing `k` games.  This looks like a dynamic programming problem. I'll have to consider all the ways the previous games could have played out to maximize the number of players involved. I can probably set up a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can define `dp[k]` in terms of `dp[k-1]` and `dp[k-2]`... The Fibonacci sequence hint is definitely sticking with me.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games they have already won differs by no more than one.\n\nLet `F(k)` be the maximum number of players that can participate in a tournament where the winner plays `k` games. We want to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the rule for the winner:\n- To play the 1st game, the winner (0 wins) plays an opponent (0 wins). This requires 2 players. So, `F(1) = 2`.\n- To play the 2nd game, the winner has 1 win. The opponent for this game can have:\n    - 0 wins: This means the opponent hasn't played any game yet. This is possible.\n    - 1 win: This means the opponent has played and won one game. This is also possible.\n    To maximize the total number of players `F(k)`, the winner should play against an opponent who has also played as many games as possible (i.e., 1 game). This is because an opponent who has played more games represents a sub-tournament that has already consumed more initial players.\n    So, for the winner to play their 2nd game, they (1 win) play against an opponent who has also won 1 game. To get an opponent with 1 win, that opponent must have won their first game against some other player.\n    This structure means:\n    - The winner (0 wins) beats Player A (0 wins). Winner has 1 win. (2 players consumed)\n    - Player B (0 wins) beats Player C (0 wins). Player B has 1 win. (2 players consumed)\n    - The winner (1 win) beats Player B (1 win). Winner has 2 wins. (2 players from previous rounds, now 4 players in total).\n    So, `F(2) = 4`.\n\nLet's generalize this. Suppose the winner has played `k` games. For their `k+1`-th game, they have `k` wins. According to the rule, their opponent can have `k-1` or `k` wins. To maximize `F(k+1)`, the winner should play against an opponent who has also won as many games as possible, i.e., `k` games.\nSo, to allow the winner to play `k+1` games:\n1. The winner plays `k` games, beating `k` opponents. This path requires `F(k)` players.\n2. An opponent for the `k+1`-th game also plays `k` games, beating `k` opponents. This path also requires `F(k)` players.\n3. These two winners (both with `k` wins) play against each other. The winner of this game proceeds with `k+1` wins.\nThis implies `F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k) = 2 * F(k)`.\n\nHowever, what if the winner plays against an opponent with `k-1` wins?\nLet's consider the maximum number of players that can be in a tournament where the winner plays `k` games.\n- To play `k` games, the winner must beat `k` opponents.\n- For the `i`-th game (where the winner has `i-1` wins), the opponent can have `i-2` or `i-1` wins.\n- To maximize the total number of players, the winner should play against the \"strongest\" possible opponent (i.e., one who has also won many games).\n- If the winner (with `i-1` wins) plays against an opponent with `i-1` wins, this means two sub-tournaments of `F(i-1)` players each merge. So, `F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-1)`.\n- If the winner (with `i-1` wins) plays against an opponent with `i-2` wins, this means a sub-tournament of `F(i-1)` players merges with a sub-tournament of `F(i-2)` players. So, `F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)`.\n\nThe rule is `|k_A - k_B| <= 1`.\nIf the winner (with `i-1` wins) plays against an opponent with `i-1` wins, this is valid.\nIf the winner (with `i-1` wins) plays against an opponent with `i-2` wins, this is also valid.\n\nTo maximize the *number of games the winner plays* for a given `n`, we want to find `k` such that `F(k) <= n` and `F(k+1) > n`.\nThe sequence `F(k)` that grows fastest is `F(k) = 2 * F(k-1)`. This corresponds to a perfectly balanced binary tree structure, where all players at a given stage have won the same number of games. For example, `F(1)=2, F(2)=4, F(3)=8, ... F(k)=2^k`.\nHowever, this is not always possible. Consider `n=3`.\n`F(1)=2`. Winner plays 1 game.\nFor `F(2)`:\nWinner (0 wins) beats P2 (0 wins). Winner has 1 win. (2 players used)\nNow Winner (1 win) needs an opponent.\n- If opponent has 0 wins (P3): Valid. Total 3 players. Winner plays 2 games.\n  This gives `F(2)=3`.\n- If opponent has 1 win: This would require P3 to beat P4. Total 4 players. `F(2)=4`.\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner *can* play, given `n` players.\nFor `n=3`, the winner can play 2 games. (e.g., P1 beats P2, then P1 beats P3).\nFor `n=4`, the winner can play 2 games. (e.g., P1 beats P2, P3 beats P4, then P1 beats P3).\n\nThe sequence of `F(k)` values (maximum players for winner to play `k` games) actually follows the Fibonacci sequence.\nLet `fib[k]` be the maximum number of players in a tournament whose winner plays `k` games.\n`fib[0] = 1` (a player who has won 0 games, conceptually)\n`fib[1] = 2` (winner (0 wins) beats opponent (0 wins). Total 2 players, winner plays 1 game)\n\nFor the winner to play `k` games, their `k`-th game is played when they have `k-1` wins.\nTheir opponent for this `k`-th game can have:\n1. `k-1` wins: This opponent comes from a sub-tournament where its winner played `k-1` games. This sub-tournament involved `fib[k-1]` players. The winner's path also involved `fib[k-1]` players to get `k-1` wins. So, `fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-1]`.\n2. `k-2` wins: This opponent comes from a sub-tournament where its winner played `k-2` games. This sub-tournament involved `fib[k-2]` players. The winner's path involved `fib[k-1]` players to get `k-1` wins. So, `fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2]`.\n\nTo maximize the number of players, we should use the `fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2]` recurrence. This is because this recurrence allows for a more \"unbalanced\" tournament structure, which can accommodate more players for a given number of games played by the winner.\nLet's define `f[k]` as the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games.\n`f[0] = 1` (a single player, no games played)\n`f[1] = 2` (P1 vs P2, P1 wins 1 game)\n`f[2]`: P1 (0 wins) beats P2 (0 wins). P1 has 1 win.\n       P1 (1 win) needs opponent. Opponent can have 0 or 1 win.\n       To minimize players, P1 (1 win) beats P3 (0 wins). Total 3 players. P1 wins 2 games. So `f[2]=3`.\n`f[3]`: P1 (0 wins) beats P2 (0 wins). P1 has 1 win.\n       P1 (1 win) beats P3 (0 wins). P1 has 2 wins.\n       P1 (2 wins) needs opponent. Opponent can have 1 or 2 wins.\n       To minimize players:\n       - Opponent has 1 win: P4 (0 wins) beats P5 (0 wins). P4 has 1 win.\n         P1 (2 wins) beats P4 (1 win). Total 5 players. P1 wins 3 games. So `f[3]=5`.\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` is the Fibonacci sequence shifted.\n`F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, F_5 = 5, F_6 = 8, ...`\nOur sequence is `f[k] = F_{k+2}`.\n`f[0] = F_2 = 1`\n`f[1] = F_3 = 2`\n`f[2] = F_4 = 3`\n`f[3] = F_5 = 5`\n`f[k] = F_{k+2}`.\n\nWe need to find the maximum `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nLet's generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n`n` can be up to `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so we won't need many terms.\n\nExample:\n`n = 2`:\n`f[0] = 1`\n`f[1] = 2`. `2 <= 2`. Max games = 1.\n`f[2] = 3`. `3 > 2`. Stop.\nAnswer for `n=2` is 1.\n\n`n = 3`:\n`f[0] = 1`\n`f[1] = 2`. `2 <= 3`. Max games = 1.\n`f[2] = 3`. `3 <= 3`. Max games = 2.\n`f[3] = 5`. `5 > 3`. Stop.\nAnswer for `n=3` is 2.\n\n`n = 4`:\n`f[0] = 1`\n`f[1] = 2`. `2 <= 4`. Max games = 1.\n`f[2] = 3`. `3 <= 4`. Max games = 2.\n`f[3] = 5`. `5 > 4`. Stop.\nAnswer for `n=4` is 2.\n\n`n = 10`:\n`f[0] = 1`\n`f[1] = 2`. `2 <= 10`. Max games = 1.\n`f[2] = 3`. `3 <= 10`. Max games = 2.\n`f[3] = 5`. `5 <= 10`. Max games = 3.\n`f[4] = 8`. `8 <= 10`. Max games = 4.\n`f[5] = 13`. `13 > 10`. Stop.\nAnswer for `n=10` is 4.\n\nThis matches the examples.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F_{k+2}` for `k=0`) and `b = 2` (representing `F_{k+2}` for `k=1`).\n2. Initialize `games = 1` (as `n >= 2`, the winner will always play at least 1 game).\n3. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `temp = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a = b`.\n   c. Update `b = temp`.\n   d. Increment `games` by 1.\n4. Print `games`.\n\nLet's trace with `n=10`:\n- Initial: `a=1, b=2, games=1`\n- Loop 1: `b (2) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  - `a = 2`\n  - `b = 3`\n  - `games = 2`\n- Loop 2: `b (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  - `a = 3`\n  - `b = 5`\n  - `games = 3`\n- Loop 3: `b (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 3 + 5 = 8`\n  - `a = 5`\n  - `b = 8`\n  - `games = 4`\n- Loop 4: `b (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 5 + 8 = 13`\n  - `a = 8`\n  - `b = 13`\n  - `games = 5`\n- Loop 5: `b (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n- Print `games` which is `5`.\n\nWait, the example output for `n=10` is `4`. My trace gives `5`. What went wrong?\nThe `games` variable should store the maximum `k` for which `f[k] <= n`.\nLet's refine the loop:\n\nAlgorithm (corrected):\n1. Read `n`.\n2. If `n == 2`, print `1` and exit. (Base case for `n < 3` where `f[2]=3` is already too large)\n3. Initialize `a = 2` (representing `f[1]`)\n4. Initialize `b = 3` (representing `f[2]`)\n5. Initialize `games = 2` (since `n >= 3` means `f[2]=3` is possible, so at least 2 games)\n6. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `temp = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a = b`.\n   c. Update `b = temp`.\n   d. Increment `games` by 1.\n7. Print `games`.\n\nLet's re-trace with `n=10` using the corrected algorithm:\n- Read `n=10`.\n- `n != 2`, continue.\n- Initial: `a=2, b=3, games=2`\n- Loop 1: `b (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  - `a = 3`\n  - `b = 5`\n  - `games = 3`\n- Loop 2: `b (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 3 + 5 = 8`\n  - `a = 5`\n  - `b = 8`\n  - `games = 4`\n- Loop 3: `b (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 5 + 8 = 13`\n  - `a = 8`\n  - `b = 13`\n  - `games = 5`\n- Loop 4: `b (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n- Print `games` which is `5`.\n\nStill `5`. The examples indicate `4` for `n=10`.\nThe definition of `f[k]` is \"minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games\".\nIf `n=10`, the winner can play 4 games. `f[4] = F_6 = 8`. `8 <= 10`.\nThe next value `f[5] = F_7 = 13`. `13 > 10`.\nSo, the maximum `k` for which `f[k] <= n` is `k=4`.\n\nMy `games` variable is always one step ahead.\nThe loop condition `b <= n` means that the current `b` value (which corresponds to `f[games]`) is still valid.\nWhen the loop terminates, `b > n`, meaning `f[games]` is too large. So the answer is `games - 1`.\n\nLet's try one more time, with the `games - 1` adjustment.\n\nAlgorithm (final attempt):\n1. Read `n`.\n2. If `n == 2`, print `1` and exit.\n3. Initialize `a = 2` (representing `f[1]`)\n4. Initialize `b = 3` (representing `f[2]`)\n5. Initialize `games = 2` (since `n >= 3` means `f[2]=3` is possible, so at least 2 games)\n6. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `temp = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a = b`.\n   c. Update `b = temp`.\n   d. Increment `games` by 1.\n7. Print `games - 1`.\n\nLet's re-trace with `n=10` using the final algorithm:\n- Read `n=10`.\n- `n != 2`, continue.\n- Initial: `a=2, b=3, games=2`\n- Loop 1: `b (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  - `a = 3`\n  - `b = 5`\n  - `games = 3`\n- Loop 2: `b (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 3 + 5 = 8`\n  - `a = 5`\n  - `b = 8`\n  - `games = 4`\n- Loop 3: `b (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `temp = 5 + 8 = 13`\n  - `a = 8`\n  - `b = 13`\n  - `games = 5`\n- Loop 4: `b (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n- Print `games - 1` which is `5 - 1 = 4`. This matches the example.\n\nLet's trace `n=2`:\n- Read `n=2`.\n- `n == 2`, print `1` and exit. Correct.\n\nLet's trace `n=3`:\n- Read `n=3`.\n- `n != 2`, continue.\n- Initial: `a=2, b=3, games=2`\n- Loop 1: `b (3) <= n (3)` is true.\n  - `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  - `a = 3`\n  - `b = 5`\n  - `games = 3`\n- Loop 2: `b (5) <= n (3)` is false. Loop terminates.\n- Print `games - 1` which is `3 - 1 = 2`.
