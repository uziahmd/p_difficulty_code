She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Browser\" Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem, and here's how I'm thinking about it.  It's all about minimizing the time to close tabs outside a target range,  `[l, r]`.  I have `n` tabs total, and the current cursor position is `pos`.\n\nThe core logic here revolves around these four actions, each taking a second: moving left or right, and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.  The key is realizing that closing a *block* of tabs is constant time, which is the crux of how to optimally solve this problem.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze what the target state looks like. In the desired state, only tabs `l` to `r` remain open. That immediately tells me I need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n\nNow, how do I actually achieve this?  I realize that to close a block to the left, I need to have the cursor at the leftmost tab in that block; similarly, to close a block to the right, I need the cursor at the rightmost tab.  So, for the `[1, l-1]` block, I need to get the cursor to `l`, and for the `[r+1, n]` block, I need to get the cursor to `r`.  This is where the absolute value of the current cursor position comes into play because I have to move the cursor to either `l` or `r`.\n\nThe number of operations involves moving the cursor and then closing the tabs. It's essentially  `abs(pos - l)` or `abs(pos - r)` moves, plus one \"close\" operation. This is also where edge cases arise, and I'll need to consider them. For example, when `l = 1` and `r = n` I have all tabs open. This must be the edge case where the minimum time is 0. If I only have tabs to the left of `l` to close then only the absolute value of the cursor position to `l` matters.\n\nLet's see if this thought process translates into an efficient Python script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each move of the cursor takes 1 second, and each closing operation (closing all tabs to the left of the cursor, or all tabs to the right of the cursor) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:**\n    If `l = 1` and `r = n`, all tabs are already within the desired segment. No operations are needed.\n    Time: `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed:**\n    This happens if `l > 1` and `r = n`. We need to close `[1, l-1]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or to its right) to perform a \"close left\" operation that affects tabs `[1, l-1]`. The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then close.\n    Time: `abs(pos - l)` (moves) + `1` (close operation).\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\n    This happens if `l = 1` and `r < n`. We need to close `[r+1, n]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or to its left) to perform a \"close right\" operation that affects tabs `[r+1, n]`. The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then close.\n    Time: `abs(pos - r)` (moves) + `1` (close operation).\n\n4.  **Both tabs to the left of `l` and tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\n    This happens if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n    In this case, we must perform two closing operations: one for the left side and one for the right side. This means we will spend at least 2 seconds on closing operations. The remaining time will be spent moving the cursor.\n\n    We have two main strategies:\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`.\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `abs(l - r)`.\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`.\n        Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n        (Note: `abs(l - r)` is `r - l` since `l <= r`).\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`.\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `abs(r - l)`.\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`.\n        Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n    We choose the minimum of these two strategies.\n    Time: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nCombining these observations:\n\n*   If `l == 1` and `r == n`: `ans = 0`\n*   If `l == 1` (only close right): `ans = abs(pos - r) + 1`\n*   If `r == n` (only close left): `ans = abs(pos - l) + 1`\n*   If `l > 1` and `r < n` (close both): `ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n\nLet's implement this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs to close\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        ans = 0\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of 'l' need to be closed (r is already n)\n    elif l > 1 and r == n:\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed (l is already 1)\n    elif l == 1 and r < n:\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 4: Both left and right tabs need to be closed\n    else: # l > 1 and r < n\n        # Option A: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right\n        # Cost: moves from pos to l + 1 (close) + moves from l to r + 1 (close)\n        cost_l_then_r = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n        \n        # Option B: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left\n        # Cost: moves from pos to r + 1 (close) + moves from r to l + 1 (close)\n        cost_r_then_l = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n        \n        ans = min(cost_l_then_r, cost_r_then_l)\n        \n    print(ans)\n\n# Read input line by line as specified by the competitive programming platform format\n# The example input is given as:\n# ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n# This implies each test case is on a separate line.\n# The problem description says \"The only line of input contains four integer numbers...\"\n# This usually means a single test case.
