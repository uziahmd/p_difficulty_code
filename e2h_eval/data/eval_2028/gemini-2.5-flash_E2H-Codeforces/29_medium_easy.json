            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Substitutes in Number\n\nAndrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my approach.** The core challenge is string substitutions that can lead to explosive string lengths, and calculating the final number modulo a large prime. The naive way, actually performing those substitutions, is a disaster; think of `1->11`, `1->11` ... quickly gets out of hand.\n\nMy key insight is to work without building these massive strings. Instead, I need to track the *transformation* of each *original* digit (0-9) throughout the query process. For each digit, I'll store its *value* (`dp_val`) and *effective length* (`dp_len`) after all substitutions, both modulo their appropriate values (modulo M for value, M-1 for length for use with modular exponentiation).\n\nI initialize `dp_val` to be the digit itself and `dp_len` to 1 (initial length of each digit). The queries `di -> ti` are processed *backwards*. This is crucial; if `2->0` and then `0->7`, `2` needs to become `7` (through `0`), which means the queries' effects are *not independent* and are applied in reverse order to resolve nested replacements. When I process a query `di -> ti`, I consider what each *digit* in `ti` has become based on the current `dp_val` and `dp_len`.\n\nAs I traverse the initial string `s` *after* all the substitution logic, I use the saved `dp_val` and `dp_len` to construct the final number piece by piece, incorporating the digits' transformed values and accounting for their transformed lengths in powers of ten (modulo M). The `dp_len` gives the correct exponent when I compute modular powers of 10. The modulo operations are used throughout the calculations to avoid intermediate numbers becoming too large. Finally, I construct the number represented by the final transformed string. Empty strings are handled by `dp_len` being zero.\n\nThis reverse processing and the digit-by-digit approach ensures I correctly handle cascading substitutions without ever building huge intermediate strings and ensures I find the right answer. My time complexity of O(s + sum(len(ti))) gives the required efficiency.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string substitutions on an initial string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct simulation infeasible.\n\nWe can observe that each digit `0` through `9` eventually transforms into some string of digits. When a query `di -> ti` occurs, it means that any instance of the digit `di` should now be replaced by the string `ti`. However, `ti` itself might contain digits that are subject to further transformations by subsequent queries.\n\nThis suggests that the final transformation of an original digit depends on all queries that affect it, potentially cascading through intermediate substitutions. For example, if we have `2 -> 0` and then `0 -> 7`, an original `2` eventually becomes `7`.\n\nA common technique for problems involving sequential transformations where later transformations affect earlier ones is to process the operations in reverse order.\n\nLet `dp_val[d]` be the numerical value (modulo `MOD`) of the string that a single digit `d` ultimately transforms into after all queries.\nLet `dp_len[d]` be the length (modulo `MOD - 1`) of the string that a single digit `d` ultimately transforms into after all queries. We use `MOD - 1` for the length because it will be used as an exponent for powers of 10, and by Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^k % P = a^(k % (P-1)) % P` for prime `P`.\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, if no queries have been applied, each digit `d` transforms into itself.\nSo, for `d` from `0` to `9`:\n`dp_val[d] = d`\n`dp_len[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries in Reverse:**\nWe iterate through the queries from the last one (`n-1`) down to the first one (`0`).\nFor each query `di -> ti`:\n1.  **Calculate `current_val_ti` and `current_len_ti` for `ti`**: We need to determine what the string `ti` itself evaluates to, given the *current* `dp_val` and `dp_len` states. These `dp` states represent the transformations that would occur *after* the current query `di -> ti` in the forward timeline.\n    *   Initialize `current_val_ti = 0` and `current_len_ti = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `char_t` in `ti_str`:\n        *   Convert `char_t` to an integer `digit_t`.\n        *   The value `dp_val[digit_t]` is appended to `current_val_ti`, shifted by `10^(dp_len[digit_t])`.\n            `current_val_ti = (current_val_ti * pow(10, dp_len[digit_t], MOD) + dp_val[digit_t]) % MOD`\n        *   The length `dp_len[digit_t]` is added to `current_len_ti`.\n            `current_len_ti = (current_len_ti + dp_len[digit_t]) % (MOD - 1)`\n2.  **Update `dp_val[di]` and `dp_len[di]`**: Now, the digit `di` itself will transform into the string `ti`. So, `dp_val[di]` and `dp_len[di]` should be updated to `current_val_ti` and `current_len_ti` respectively.\n    `dp_val[di] = current_val_ti`\n    `dp_len[di] = current_len_ti`\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `dp_val[d]` and `dp_len[d]` hold the final value and length for each original digit `d`.\nNow, we iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right:\n*   Initialize `final_val = 0`.\n*   For each character `char_s` in `s`:\n    *   Convert `char_s` to an integer `digit_s`.\n    *   Append `dp_val[digit_s]` to `final_val`, shifted by `10^(dp_len[digit_s])`.\n        `final_val = (final_val * pow(10, dp_len[digit_s], MOD) + dp_val[digit_s]) % MOD`\n*   The final `final_val` is the answer.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   **Empty string `ti`**: If `ti` is empty, `current_val_ti` will be `0` and `current_len_ti` will be `0`. This correctly means that `di` transforms into an empty string, having value `0` and length `0`. When `dp_len[d]` is `0`, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is `1`, which correctly handles the multiplication by `1` (effectively removing the digit `d` from the number's length).\n*   **Leading zeros**: The calculation `(current_val * 10^len + digit_val) % MOD` naturally handles leading zeros. For example, `007` would be calculated as `((0 * 10^1 + 0) * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`.\n*   **Empty final string**: If the initial string `s` or all its digits transform into empty strings, `final_val` will remain `0`, which is the correct interpretation.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity**: `O(|s| + sum(|ti|))`. Initialization is `O(10)`. Processing `n` queries takes `O(sum(|ti|))` because each character in `ti` is processed a constant number of times. The final calculation on `s` takes `O(|s|)`. Given `|s| <= 10^5` and `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5`, this is `O(10^5)`, which is efficient enough.\n*   **Space Complexity**: `O(n + sum(|ti|))` for storing queries, plus `O(10)` for `dp_val` and `dp_len` arrays. This is also `O(10^5)`, which is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Modulo for the final number calculation\nMOD = 1000000007\n# Modulo for exponents (Fermat's Little Theorem: a^k % P = a^(k % (P-1)) % P)\nMOD_EXP = 1000000006\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    # dp_val[d] stores the numerical value of the string that digit d transforms into\n    # dp_len[d] stores the length of the string that digit d transforms into (modulo MOD_EXP)\n    # Initialize: each digit d transforms into itself, with value d and length 1.\n    dp_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    dp_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order to correctly apply transformations\n    # A query 'di -> ti' means that 'di' now transforms into 'ti'.\n    # The 'ti' string itself might contain digits that have already been\n    # transformed by queries that occur *after* 'di -> ti' in the original sequence.\n    # By processing in reverse, when we update dp_val[di] and dp_len[di],\n    # the values dp_val[digit_t] and dp_len[digit_t] used for characters in ti_str\n    # already reflect all subsequent transformations.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_char, ti_str = queries[i]\n        di = int(di_char)\n\n        current_val_ti = 0\n        current_len_ti = 0\n\n        # Calculate the value and length of ti_str based on the current dp states\n        # Each character 'char_t' in 'ti_str' will eventually transform into\n        # dp_val[int(char_t)] with length dp_len[int(char_t)].\n        for char_t in ti_str:\n            digit_t = int(char_t)\n            \n            # The length dp_len[digit_t] is used as the exponent for 10\n            power_of_10 = dp_len[digit_t] \n            \n            # Update current_val_ti: shift existing value by 10^(power_of_10) and add the new digit's value\n            current_val_ti = (current_val_ti * pow(10, power_of_10, MOD) + dp_val[digit_t]) % MOD\n            \n            # Update current_len_ti: add the new digit's length\n            current_len_ti = (current_len_ti + power_of_10) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        # Update dp_val[di] and dp_len[di] to reflect the transformation of di into ti_str\n        dp_val[di] = current_val_ti\n        dp_len[di] = current_len_ti\n\n    # Calculate the final result from the initial string s using the final dp states\n    final_val = 0\n    \n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Get the length the digit_s transforms into, to use as exponent for 10\n        power_of_10 = dp_len[digit_s]\n        \n        # Update final_val: shift existing value by 10^(power_of_10) and add the new digit's value\n        final_val = (final_val * pow(10, power_of_10, MOD) + dp_val[digit_s]) % MOD\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_val) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
