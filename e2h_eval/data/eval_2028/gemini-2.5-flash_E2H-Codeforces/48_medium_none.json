            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Conversion Script Design and Implementation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core task is to convert a number, represented as a string in base *a*, to a string in base *b*. *b* can be an integer, or the special 'R' for Roman numerals. My mental model starts with parsing the input - *a*, *b*, and the number string *c*. Then I need to build helper functions for base conversion, handling both the integer and Roman numeral cases.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. I’ll read the first line to get *a* and *b*, and then the second line for the number string *c*. The next is the conversion to decimal, which is standard: iterating from right to left, multiplying each digit by the base raised to the power of its position, and summing those values. I need a function `to_decimal(num_str, base)` for this, mapping digits '0'-'9', 'A'-'Z' to their integer values.\n\nNext, I have to convert the decimal number to base *b*. If *b* is an integer, I can use the classic method of repeatedly dividing the decimal number by *b* and collecting the remainders in reverse order. This will require a function `from_decimal(num_dec, base)` and I'll need a way to map the integer remainders (0-35) back to digit characters ('0'-'9', 'A'-'Z'). This should naturally omit leading zeros.\n\nIf *b* is 'R', it becomes a bit more complex, Roman numerals aren't purely positional. But, the problem states standard rules. I need another function `to_roman(num_dec)` with a greedy approach, repeatedly subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral value (M, CM, D, etc.) and appending the corresponding symbol, ensuring it respects the rules of subtractive notation (IV, IX, etc.). The problem guarantees the input will be less than or equal to 3000 if Roman numerals are used.\n\nI must also handle the leading zeros in the input number string *c*. Usually, base conversion algorithms will handle this naturally because an empty string means zero, and the first digit is the least significant one.\n\nI'll then build the program with these parts, calling the right functions based on the value of *b*. The `to_decimal` function must correctly interpret the input string and deal with the maximum base being 25 ('O') so I need to translate `A=10, B=11,...O=24` and raise an error for any invalid digits.\n\nI'm confident I can make this work. A good structure would be helper functions for the base conversions and then the main program with appropriate conditional logic for base-*b* conversion, as Roman or Integer. A few tests for corner cases, leading zeros, and large numbers will confirm my solution. And, the program should be fast, the input sizes are within reasonable limits.\n",
