The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Xenia and the Ringroad: A Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down logically, because that's the only way to tackle these competitive programming challenges. I've got `n` houses on a ring road, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` specifies the house I need to be at. I start at house 1, and I can only move clockwise.\n\nThe core of this problem is efficiently calculating the time it takes to move between houses. My initial thought is to trace the movement step-by-step. I'm starting at `current_house = 1`. For each task, I need to get to the `target_house`, which is given by the array `a`.\n\nThe time depends on the relative position of the `current_house` and the `target_house`. If the `target_house` is *greater* than or equal to the `current_house`, the calculation is simple: it's just `target_house - current_house`.  Easy peasy.\n\nBut what if the `target_house` is *less* than the `current_house`? Ah, that's where the ring road comes into play. I'll have to go all the way around, passing house `n` and wrapping back to house 1. The optimal path will go from `current_house` -> ... -> `n` -> `1` -> ... -> `target_house`.\n\nThe time for this wrap-around situation would be: `(n - current_house)` to get to the end of the road, then `1` to get to `1`, then `(target_house - 1)` from `1` to the desired house. That simplifies to `n - current_house + target_house`. I need to be careful with this logic; I have a good example to verify it with, so let's do that. Looks good.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I can define the core logic. I will need a variable, `total_time` to accumulate the total time. The `current_house` will need to be updated. For each task, for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`:\n1.  `target_house = a[i]`\n2.  If `target_house >= current_house`: `total_time += target_house - current_house`\n3.  Else (`target_house < current_house`): `total_time += n - current_house + target_house`\n4.  Update the `current_house` to be `target_house`.\n\nI have a concrete example to test with: `n=4`, `m=3`, tasks = `[3, 2, 3]`.  Let's simulate the run. Looks like it works, so let's get coding!\n",
