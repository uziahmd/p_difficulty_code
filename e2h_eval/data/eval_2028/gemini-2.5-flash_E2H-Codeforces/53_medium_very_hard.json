    "thought": "**The Core Idea: Finding the Longest Repeated Substring**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to write a Python script that identifies the length of the longest substring appearing at least twice within a given string. This string contains only lowercase Latin letters and has a maximum length of 100. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, which adds a bit of complexity.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through all possible substring lengths, starting from 1 up to the string's length minus 1. A substring can't be longer than the original string.  Next, for each length, I need to generate all the substrings of that length. Finally, for each substring, I need to check if it appears at least twice in the original string.\n\n**The \"Twice\" Check: A Refinement**\n\nInitially, `string.count()` seemed like a straightforward approach, but it might not handle overlapping occurrences correctly, and it could be inefficient. A more robust solution involves finding *all* starting indices of a substring. If I discover at least two distinct starting indices, it confirms the substring appears at least twice.\n\n**Overlapping Occurrences: The Crucial Point**\n\nI'm thinking about how to handle overlapping occurrences. For a substring `sub` and the original string `s`, I can iterate through all possible starting positions in `s` and compare each substring `s[i:i+len(sub)]` with `sub`. If they match, I found an occurrence, and if I find another one starting at a different index, I know the substring is repeated.\n\n**Prioritizing the Longest Substring**\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the *longest* substring. This suggests iterating the substring lengths in decreasing order or keeping track of the longest repeated substring encountered so far. Given the constraint of the string length (at most 100), an `O(N^3)` or even an `O(N^4)` solution is likely acceptable.\n\n**The Algorithm: A Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n1.  Initialize `max_repeated_len` to 0.\n2.  Iterate the `length` of substrings from 1 up to the string's length minus 1.\n    *   For each `length`, iterate through all possible starting indices `i`.\n        *   Extract the `current_substring = s[i : i + length]`.\n        *   Then iterate from index `i + 1` to find if `current_substring` appears again at `j`.\n            *   If `s[j : j + length]` equals the `current_substring`:\n                *   Update `max_repeated_len` to the `length` of the repeated substring.\n                *   I can break out of the inner loop (j loop) since only one repeated occurrence is needed per substring length.\n\n**Example and Trace**\n\nTo make sure I'm on the right track, let's take a simple example:  `s = \"ababa\"`. The algorithm would iterate, checking substrings of length 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n*   I'll have three nested loops: one for the length of the substring (up to N), one to define the starting point of the first substring, and one to search for other occurrences.  The substring comparison takes at most the length of the substring.\n*   This gives a time complexity of `O(N * N * N * length) = O(N^4)`.  \n\n**Optimization: The find() Trick**\n\nInstead of the inner `j` loop, I could use Python's `s.find()` method.  `s.find(substring, start_index)` will return the starting index of the substring in `s` starting at a given index or `-1` if the substring isn't found. This could improve the speed.\n\n**Optimized Algorithm with find():**\n\n1. Initialize `max_repeated_len = 0`.\n2. Iterate `length` from `N-1` down to `1`.\n    * Initialize `found_for_this_length = False`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `N - length`.\n        *  Extract the `current_substring = s[i : i + length]`.\n        * Find if `current_substring` appears again starting from `i+1`:\n            * `next_occurrence_idx = s.find(current_substring, i + 1)`\n            *   If found:\n                * Update `max_repeated_len = length`.\n                * Set `found_for_this_length = True`.\n                * Break the `i` loop because we found the longest possible substring for this `length`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Overlapping occurrences are allowed. The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length does not exceed 100.\n\nLet the given string be `s` and its length be `N`.\n\nWe are looking for the *longest* such substring. This suggests we can iterate through possible substring lengths in decreasing order, starting from `N-1` down to `1`. The moment we find a repeated substring for a certain length, that length must be the maximum possible, and we can stop.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `max_repeated_len = 0`. This will store our result.\n2.  Iterate `length` from `N-1` down to `1`.\n    *   For each `length`, we need to check if *any* substring of this `length` appears at least twice.\n    *   Initialize a flag `found_for_this_length = False`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `N - length`. This `i` represents the starting index of a potential first occurrence of a substring.\n        *   Extract the `current_substring = s[i : i + length]`.\n        *   Now, we need to check if `current_substring` appears again in `s` starting at an index *after* `i`.\n        *   Python's `str.find(substring, start_index)` method is perfect for this. It returns the lowest index where `substring` is found, starting its search from `start_index`. If not found, it returns `-1`.\n        *   Call `next_occurrence_idx = s.find(current_substring, i + 1)`.\n        *   If `next_occurrence_idx != -1`, it means we found `current_substring` starting at `i` and again at `next_occurrence_idx`. Since `next_occurrence_idx > i`, these are two distinct occurrences.\n            *   In this case, we have found a repeated substring of `length`.\n            *   Set `max_repeated_len = length`.\n            *   Set `found_for_this_length = True`.\n            *   Break out of the inner loop (the `i` loop) because we've already established that a substring of this `length` repeats. We don't need to check other substrings of the same length.\n    *   After checking all possible `current_substring`s for the current `length`:\n        *   If `found_for_this_length` is `True`, it means we found a repeated substring of this `length`. Since we are iterating `length` in decreasing order, this `length` must be the longest possible.\n        *   Break out of the outer loop (the `length` loop).\n\n3.  Finally, print `max_repeated_len`.\n\n**Example Trace (`s = \"ababa\"`, N=5):**\n\n1.  `max_repeated_len = 0`\n2.  `length = 4` (from `range(4, 0, -1)`)\n    *   `found_for_this_length = False`\n    *   `i = 0`: `current_substring = \"abab\"`. `s.find(\"abab\", 1)` returns `-1`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `current_substring = \"baba\"`. `s.find(\"baba\", 2)` returns `-1`.\n    *   `found_for_this_length` is still `False`.\n3.  `length = 3`\n    *   `found_for_this_length = False`\n    *   `i = 0`: `current_substring = \"aba\"`. `s.find(\"aba\", 1)` returns `2`. Found!\n        *   `max_repeated_len = 3`.\n        *   `found_for_this_length = True`.\n        *   Break `i` loop.\n    *   `found_for_this_length` is `True`. Break `length` loop.\n4.  Output `max_repeated_len` which is `3`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n\n*   The outer loop runs `N` times (for `length`).\n*   The inner loop runs `N` times (for `i`).\n*   The `s.find()` operation in Python is highly optimized and typically uses efficient string searching algorithms (like a variant of Boyer-Moore-Horspool for longer needles). In practice, for a string of length `N` and a substring of length `L`, `s.find()` often performs closer to `O(N + L)` rather than a naive `O(N * L)`.\n*   Therefore, the overall complexity is approximately `O(N * N * (N + L))`, which simplifies to `O(N^3)` because `L` is at most `N`.\n*   Given `N <= 100`, `N^3 = 100^3 = 1,000,000`. This number of operations is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually around `10^8` operations in 1-2 seconds), especially with Python's optimized built-in string functions.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for the given constraints and correctly handles all edge cases, including short strings and strings with no repeated substrings.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_repeated_len = 0\n\n    # Iterate through possible lengths of substrings, from longest to shortest.\n    # A substring of length N can only appear once.
