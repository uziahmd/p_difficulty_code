The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core of it is calculating losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus across *n* rounds, given their cyclic playing sequences, *A* and *B*, respectively. My initial thought is, \"How do I do this efficiently?\"\n\nMy first instinct is to analyze the rules: standard RPS, where Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Draws are irrelevant here; only wins and losses matter. The key is that both players are using cyclic strategies. Nikephoros’s move is `A[i % m]` in round `i+1`, and Polycarpus’s is `B[i % k]`.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is that *n* can be up to 2 * 10^9. Direct simulation is out of the question; that's way too slow. But the sequences, *A* and *B*, are much smaller, up to 1000 each. This must mean I can leverage the cyclic nature to optimize the calculation.\n\nThinking this through, the moves will repeat with a cycle of *lcm(m, k)*.  So, I can determine the period of the combined strategies, which I’ll call `L`. I can calculate `L` as `(m * k) // gcd(m, k)`. Since both *m* and *k* are relatively small, this value should be manageable. My estimate is that `L` can be at most 1,000,000. That’s feasible.\n\nHere's the algorithm I'm formulating:\n\n1.  Calculate `L = lcm(m, k)`.\n2.  Simulate a single cycle of `L` rounds:\n    *   Iterate through each round `i` from 0 to `L-1`.\n    *   In each round, determine Nikephoros's move as `A[i % m]` and Polycarpus’s as `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Calculate the winner of this round.\n    *   Keep track of Nikephoros's losses (`nike_losses_cycle`) and Polycarpus's losses (`poly_losses_cycle`) within this single cycle.\n3.  Calculate the losses for *n* rounds:\n    *   `num_cycles = n // L`\n    *   `remaining_rounds = n % L`\n    *   Total Nikephoros losses are `num_cycles * nike_losses_cycle`.\n    *   Total Polycarpus losses are `num_cycles * poly_losses_cycle`.\n    *   Then, I need to simulate the remaining `remaining_rounds` and accumulate their losses.\n\nThis should be an efficient approach. I will try implementing it in Python.\n",
