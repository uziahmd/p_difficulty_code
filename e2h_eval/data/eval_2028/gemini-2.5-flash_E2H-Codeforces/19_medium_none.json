The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games.

    "thought": "**A Quest for Connected Components and Maximized Value**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a tree representing districts, and our mission is to strategically remove some districts (k of them, to be exact) to maximize the \"fan value\" of the remaining districts. Each district's fan value is a power of 2, specifically 2 to the power of the district's index. The catch? The districts we keep must form a single connected component.\n\nMy first thought is always, \"How do we maximize the sum of powers of 2?\". We want the largest possible indices. Keeping the districts with higher indices is always beneficial. So, it feels like a greedy approach might be the key. Start with the largest index, add districts if connectivity is maintained.\n\nBut the constraint of connectivity really throws a wrench into a purely greedy strategy. We can't just pick the largest indices; we must ensure the remaining districts remain connected. Removing a node can split the tree. We need to avoid \"disconnecting\" the component with our removals.\n\nIt's tempting to try and minimize the \"cost\" of removal.  Removing a district \"costs\" 2 to the power of its index.  If the total number of districts is n, and if the total number of nodes we want is n-k, then we want to find k nodes to remove such that the remaining n-k are still connected, and the total cost (sum of 2 to the power of index for the nodes removed) is minimized. \n\nThis makes me think of pruning a tree and working from the \"bottom up,\" removing the smaller-indexed districts. I can see that the order of the removals also matters. One way is, we have n, n-1, n-2, ...  to 1. And when we remove the nodes, the total count should not exceed k nodes. But, keeping n, n-1, ... may not work because of the connectivity constraint.\n\nHowever, since the value of n is always a large number, it is very likely that the largest index n will always be part of the final connected graph.  This gives me an idea of a new greedy algorithm to form the k-node removed set.\n\nStarting with the last node, add neighbors, removing a node from the set when the largest neighbor is picked.  This will satisfy the connected condition, because we are using the edges of the original graph. \n\nThe problem boils down to carefully selecting the districts we *don't* remove. The number of nodes in that set should be n-k. However, the largest values are always preferrable. With those greedy ideas in mind, how can this be implemented?\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts to participate in The Number Games such that:\n1. The chosen districts form a connected component in the graph.\n2. The total number of fans, `sum(2^i)` for the chosen districts `i`, is maximized.\nWe need to output the `k` districts that are removed, in increasing order.\n\nThe graph is a tree. The number of fans `2^i` grows exponentially, meaning `2^i` is always greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < i`. For example, `2^5 = 32`, while `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2+4+8+16 = 30`. This implies that to maximize the sum, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices.\n\nSpecifically, since `k < n`, we must keep at least one district. If `n-k >= 1`, we must keep district `n` (the district with the largest index). This is because `2^n` is larger than the sum of `2^i` for all `i < n`. If we didn't keep district `n`, we could replace any district `j` in our chosen set with `n` (if `n` wasn't already chosen) and get a strictly larger sum, provided the new set remains connected. Since `n` is guaranteed to be part of the optimal solution, the problem reduces to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that includes district `n` and maximizes the sum of `2^i`.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` districts to remove such that district `n` is not removed, the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the sum of `2^i` for the removed districts is minimized.\n\nLet's root the tree at district `n`.\nWe want to remove `k` districts. To minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed districts, we should prioritize removing districts with smaller indices.\nConsider a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) from district `n`.\nWhen we traverse the tree rooted at `n`, we can decide for each node `u` whether to keep it or remove it.\nIf we remove `u`, we pay `2^u`.\nIf we keep `u`, we don't pay `2^u`.\nThe constraint is that if we keep a node `u` (other than `n`), its parent (in the tree rooted at `n`) must also be kept to maintain connectivity to `n`. This means the set of kept nodes must form a subtree rooted at `n`.\n\nThis problem can be solved with a greedy approach based on a traversal from `n`.\nWe will perform a DFS (or BFS) starting from `n`. During the traversal, we'll keep track of visited nodes.\nFor each node `u`, we calculate the minimum cost to remove nodes in its subtree (including `u` itself if we decide to remove it) while ensuring that if `u` is kept, it is connected to its parent.\n\nLet `dp[u]` be the minimum sum of `2^i` of nodes to remove from the subtree rooted at `u`, such that `u` is kept, and the remaining nodes in `u`'s subtree form a connected component with `u`.\nThis is not quite right. We need to select exactly `n-k` nodes.\n\nA more direct greedy approach:\nWe want to identify `k` nodes to remove. We must keep `n`.\nLet's consider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n-1` in increasing order. For each node `i`, we want to remove it if possible, as it has a small fan count `2^i`.\nHowever, removing `i` might disconnect parts of the graph that contain larger-indexed nodes we want to keep.\n\nThe key insight for `N` up to `10^6` and tree structures is often a greedy DFS/BFS or a specific tree DP.\nThe problem requires finding a connected component of size `n-k` containing `n`.\nLet's define `cost[u]` as the minimum sum of `2^i` for nodes removed from the subtree rooted at `u`, assuming `u` is kept and connected to its parent.\nWe can compute this using a DFS. For each node `u` (starting from its children), we make a decision:\n1. Keep `u` and its entire subtree. Cost = 0 for `u` and its subtree.\n2. Remove `u` and its entire subtree. Cost = `2^u` + cost of removing children's subtrees.\n3. Keep `u` and some of its children's subtrees, remove others.\n\nThis is a variation of the \"minimum weight connected subgraph\" problem.\nA common approach for this type of problem on trees is to compute for each node `u` and each possible size `s` (number of nodes in the component rooted at `u`), the minimum cost to form such a component. This is too slow.\n\nLet's simplify. We must keep `n`. We need to select `n-k-1` additional nodes.\nThe strategy for selecting nodes should be: always pick the node `v` that has the smallest `2^v` value (or `v` itself, since `2^v` is strictly increasing) among all nodes that can be removed without disconnecting `n` from the remaining nodes, and without making the final component smaller than `n-k`.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` \"cheapest\" nodes to remove, where \"cheapest\" means smallest `2^i`.\nWe can use a modified BFS/DFS to identify the nodes to remove.\nLet's start a DFS from node `n`.\nDuring the DFS, we keep track of the current path from `n` to the current node `u`.\nFor each node `u`, we can calculate the size of the subtree rooted at `u` (including `u`). Let this be `size[u]`.\nAlso, for each node `u`, we can calculate the sum of `2^i` for all nodes in `subtree(u)`. Let this be `total_fans[u]`.\n\nThe key idea is that we want to keep `n-k` nodes. We must keep `n`.\nConsider the nodes to remove. They must be \"leaves\" or \"branches\" that can be pruned without disconnecting the core component containing `n`.\nWe can use a DFS from `n`. During the DFS, we identify nodes that are candidates for removal.\nA node `u` can be removed if:\n1. It's not `n`.\n2. Removing it doesn't disconnect `n` from any other *kept* node.\nThis implies that if we remove `u`, we must also remove its entire subtree.\nSo, we can think of removing a node `u` (which is not `n`) as \"cutting\" the edge connecting `u` to its parent. This removes `u` and its entire subtree. The \"cost\" of this cut is `sum(2^j for j in subtree(u))`.\nWe want to perform `k` such \"cuts\" (or `k` node removals) to minimize the total sum `2^i` of removed nodes, such that exactly `k` nodes are removed in total.\n\nThis is not quite right. If we cut the edge `(parent(u), u)`, we remove `u` and its entire subtree. This might remove more than `k` nodes.\nWe need to remove exactly `k` nodes.\n\nLet's maintain a set of nodes to be removed. Initially, this set is empty.\nWe start with all nodes `1...n` kept. We need to remove `k` of them.\nWe must keep node `n`.\nWe can perform a DFS from `n`. For each node `u` (other than `n`), calculate `subtree_size[u]` and `subtree_fan_sum[u]`.\n`subtree_size[u]` is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at `u` (if `n` is the root).\n`subtree_fan_sum[u]` is the sum of `2^i` for all nodes `i` in the subtree rooted at `u`.\n\nNow, we want to remove `k` nodes. We can think of this as \"pruning\" `k` nodes.\nA node `u` can be pruned if its parent (in the tree rooted at `n`) is kept.\nIf `u` is pruned, its value `2^u` is added to the removed sum.\nIf `u` is pruned, its children can't be kept (because `u` is removed).\nThis means we are looking for `k` nodes to remove, starting from the \"leaves\" of the tree (when rooted at `n`), or nodes whose removal doesn't affect the connectivity of `n` to other kept nodes.\n\nLet `removed_nodes` be a list of nodes to be removed.\nWe must keep `n`.\nWe can simulate the process of removing nodes starting from the \"least valuable\" ones.\nPerform a DFS from `n` to calculate `subtree_size[u]` for all `u`.\nNodes with `subtree_size[u] = 1` are leaves in the tree rooted at `n`. These are prime candidates for removal.\nWe can put all nodes (except `n`) into a priority queue, ordered by their `2^i` value (smallest first).\nThis is not correct either, as removing a node might disconnect `n` from higher-valued nodes.\n\nThe correct approach for this type of problem is often to find the `k` nodes with smallest indices that can be removed without violating connectivity.\nLet's consider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n-1`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. We must keep `n`.\nWe can iterate through nodes `u` from `1` to `n-1`. For each `u`, we consider removing it.\nIf we remove `u`, we add `2^u` to the removed sum.\nThe challenge is checking connectivity.\n\nThis problem is a classic application of a specific greedy strategy.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. We must keep `n`.\nWe perform a DFS from `n`. For each node `u`, we calculate `dp[u]`, the minimum total fan count of nodes that must be removed from the subtree rooted at `u` (including `u` itself if it's removed), such that exactly `count` nodes are kept in `u`'s subtree, and `u` is connected to its parent if `u` is kept.\nThis DP is `O(N * (N-K))` which is too slow.\n\nThe key is that we are minimizing `sum(2^i)` for removed nodes.\nThis implies we want to remove nodes with small indices.\nLet's identify candidate nodes for removal.\nA node `u` can be removed if it's not `n` and its parent `p` (in the tree rooted at `n`) is still kept. If `u` is removed, its children cannot be kept (unless they are also connected to `p` through another path, which is not possible in a tree).\nSo, if `u` is removed, its entire subtree (rooted at `u`) is effectively removed from the component.\nThe \"cost\" of removing `u` and its entire subtree is `sum(2^j for j in subtree(u))`.\nThis is a standard minimum-cost subtree removal problem.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes in total.\n\nLet `removed_count[u]` be the number of nodes removed if we decide to \"cut\" the edge `(parent(u), u)`. This is `subtree_size[u]`.\nLet `removed_sum[u]` be the sum of `2^j` for nodes `j` in `subtree(u)`.\n\nWe want to select a set of nodes `R_cut` such that for each `u \\in R_cut`, we remove `u` and its entire subtree.\nThe total number of removed nodes `sum(subtree_size[u] for u in R_cut)` must be exactly `k`.\nAnd `sum(removed_sum[u] for u in R_cut)` must be minimized.\nThis is a variation of the knapsack problem or a tree DP.\nFor each node `u`, we can decide to keep it or remove it.\nIf we keep `u`, we must keep its parent.\nIf we remove `u`, we must also remove its children.\n\nThis problem can be solved by a greedy approach using a priority queue.\n1. Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n2. Root the tree at node `n`. Perform a DFS from `n` to compute `parent[u]`, `depth[u]`, `subtree_size[u]` for all `u`.\n   Also, identify all nodes `u` that are \"leaves\" in the tree rooted at `n` (i.e., `subtree_size[u] = 1`).\n3. Initialize `num_removed = 0`.\n4. Initialize `nodes_to_remove = []`.\n5. We use a priority queue `pq`. The elements in `pq` will be `(value, node_id)`.\n   The `value` for a node `u` is `2^u`. We want to remove nodes with smallest `2^u`.\n   Initially, add all leaves `u` (where `subtree_size[u] = 1`) to `pq` as `(2^u, u)`.\n   Also, mark these nodes as `can_be_removed = true`.\n   `current_subtree_size[u]` is initially `subtree_size[u]`.\n   `current_subtree_sum[u]` is initially `subtree_fan_sum[u]`.\n   `num_children_kept[u]` is initially the number of children `v` of `u` whose `current_subtree_size[v]` is greater than 0.\n\nThis is a classic greedy approach for removing nodes from a tree to form a connected component.\nThe strategy is to remove nodes with smallest indices, but only if they are \"leaves\" of the current component.\nWe start by keeping all `n` nodes. We need to remove `k` nodes.\nLet `kept_nodes` be a boolean array, initially all true.\nWe iterate `k` times to remove `k` nodes.\nIn each step, we want to remove a node `u` such that `kept_nodes[u]` is true, `u != n`, and `u` is a leaf of the currently kept component (i.e., `u` has exactly one neighbor `v` that is also `kept_nodes[v]`).\nAmong all such candidate leaves, we pick the one with the smallest index `u`.\nThis ensures that we remove the \"cheapest\" node that can be removed without violating connectivity.\n\nLet's refine this greedy strategy:\n1. Build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. Initialize `removed_nodes = []`.\n3. Initialize `kept_count = n`.\n4. `degree[u]` stores the number of neighbors of `u` that are currently *kept*. Initialize `degree[u] = len(adj[u])` for all `u`.\n5. Use a `deque` (double-ended queue) for nodes that are candidates for removal. A node `u` is a candidate if `u != n` and `degree[u] == 1`.\n   Populate the `deque` with all such nodes `u`.\n   Sort these initial candidates by their index `u` (smallest first). A `deque` is not ideal for this, a min-priority queue is better.\n   Let `pq` be a min-priority queue storing `(node_id)` for candidate nodes.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. Initialize `removed_nodes = []`.\n3. Initialize `kept_count = n`.\n4. `current_degree[u]` for each node `u` is `len(adj[u])`.\n5. `is_removed[u]` is a boolean array, initially all `False`.\n6. Create a min-priority queue `pq`.\n7. For `u` from `1` to `n`:\n   If `u != n` and `current_degree[u] == 1`:\n     `pq.push(u)` (add `u` to priority queue, ordered by `u`'s value).\n\n8. While `kept_count > n - k`:\n   a. Get the smallest node `u` from `pq`. `u = pq.pop()`.\n   b. If `is_removed[u]` is already true, or `current_degree[u] != 1` (meaning it's no longer a leaf of the kept component), continue to the next candidate.\n   c. Mark `u` as removed: `is_removed[u] = True`.\n   d. Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n   e. `kept_count -= 1`.\n   f. Find the unique neighbor `v` of `u` that is not removed.\n      For each neighbor `w` of `u`:\n         If `is_removed[w]` is `False`:\n           `v = w`. Break.\n      Decrement `current_degree[v]`.\n      If `v != n` and `current_degree[v] == 1` and `is_removed[v]` is `False`:\n         `pq.push(v)`.\n\n9. Sort `removed_nodes` in increasing order and print them.\n\nLet's trace `n=6, k=3`.

The `current_degree` counter correctly identifies leaves of the current component.\n\nComplexity:\n- Building adjacency list: `O(N+M)`, where `M=N-1` for a tree, so `O(N)`.\n- Initializing `current_degree` and `pq`: `O(N)`.\n- The `while` loop runs `k` times.\n  - Each `pq.pop()` and `pq.push()` operation takes `O(log N)`.\n  - Finding the unique neighbor `v` takes `O(degree(u))`. In total, over all `k` removals, each edge is traversed at most twice. So total for finding neighbors is `O(N)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N + k log N)`. Since `k < N`, this is `O(N log N)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list, `current_degree`, `is_removed`, `pq`, `removed_nodes`.\n\nThis solution is efficient enough for `N=10^6`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # current_degree[i] stores the number of neighbors of district i that are currently kept.\n    # Initially, all districts are kept.\n    current_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        current_degree[i] = len(adj[i])\n\n    # is_removed[i] is True if district i has been removed.\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Priority queue to store candidate districts for removal.\n    # We want to remove districts with smaller indices first.\n    # The priority queue stores (district_id).\n    pq = []\n\n    # Initialize PQ with districts that are not 'n' and are leaves in the initial graph.\n    # A district 'u' is a leaf if its degree is 1.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i == n:  # District 'n' must always be kept.\n            continue\n        if current_degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, i)\n\n    removed_districts = []\n    kept_count = n\n\n    # We need to remove 'k' districts.\n    # This means we need to reduce kept_count from 'n' to 'n-k'.\n    while kept_count > n - k:\n        if not pq:\n            # This should not happen if the problem guarantees a valid solution exists,\n            # and 'n' is always part of the kept component.\n            # It means we can't remove any more leaves without disconnecting 'n'.\n            # This implies the remaining graph is just a path or 'n' itself,\n            # and we still need to remove more nodes.\n            break \n\n        u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        # If 'u' has already been removed, or if its degree is no longer 1\n        # (meaning it's no longer a leaf of the currently kept component),\n        # then it's not a valid candidate for removal right now.\n        # This check is important because 'u' might have been added to PQ\n        # when its degree was 1, but then its neighbor was removed,\n        # making 'u' no longer a leaf with respect to the component containing 'n'.\n        # Or, if u's neighbor was removed and u became a leaf again, but it was already processed.\n        # It's better to check if it's already removed, and if its degree is still 1.\n        if is_removed[u] or current_degree[u] != 1:\n            continue\n\n        is_removed[u] = True\n        removed_districts.append(u)\n        kept_count -= 1\n\n        # Find the unique neighbor 'v' of 'u' that is still kept.\n        # This 'v' is the parent of 'u' in the conceptual tree formed by kept nodes.\n        v = -1\n        for neighbor in adj[u]:\n            if not is_removed[neighbor]:\n                v = neighbor\n                break\n        \n        # 'v' must exist because current_degree[u] was 1, and 'u' is not 'n'.\n        # So 'u' must have exactly one kept neighbor.\n        \n        current_degree[v] -= 1\n        \n        # If 'v' is not 'n' and becomes a leaf in the currently kept component,\n        # add it to the priority queue as a new candidate for removal.\n        if v != n and current_degree[v] == 1 and not is_removed[v]:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, v)\n\n    # Sort the removed districts in increasing order as required.\n    removed_districts.sort()\n    print(*(removed_districts))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
