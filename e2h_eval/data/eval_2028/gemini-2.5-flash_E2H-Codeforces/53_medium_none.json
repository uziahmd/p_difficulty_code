    "thought": "**My Reasoning for Solving the Longest Repeating Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice, even if the occurrences overlap. The input string will only contain lowercase letters and be at most 100 characters long. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible substring lengths. A substring's length can range from 1 (single character) up to `N-1`, where `N` is the length of the original string. If a substring of length `N` appears twice, it's just the original string repeated, which is not what the problem describes - the occurrences have to be \"distinct\" meaning different starting points, and the problem wording seems to suggest that even overlapping occurrences count.  I'll iterate through possible lengths, starting from the largest (`N-1`) and going down to 1. This is the most efficient way to find the *longest* such substring.\n\nFor each length, I need to generate all substrings of that length. Then, for each generated substring, I check if it exists *at least* twice in the original string. Since overlapping counts, a simple count using `s.count(sub)` might work, but it would be slow, especially for long substrings. An even better approach is to use `s.find(sub, i+1)` to search for subsequent occurrences of that substring.\n\nLet's say `S` is the input string and `N` is its length. My approach is to iterate `L` from `N-1` down to 1 (the length of the potential substring). Then, for a given `L`, I'll iterate through all possible starting positions (`i`) for the *first* occurrence. For each such position `i`, extract the substring `sub = S[i: i+L]`. The task now is to see if `sub` appears anywhere else in `S`. The crucial detail is to look *after* index `i`. Using `s.find(sub, i+1)` provides the most optimized way to check for that second occurrence because we can avoid all the starting points until `i`. If `s.find()` finds it (returns something other than `-1`), then we've got a repeating substring and we can stop the search. Because we iterated `L` from longest to shortest, this first `L` that gives a `s.find()` result that's not `-1` is our answer. If we get through all `L` and all `i` and `s.find()` always returns `-1`, the longest such string's length is 0.\n\nBased on this logic, I crafted a Python script. After testing it with several example inputs (including edge cases like an empty string, strings of length 1, strings with all same characters, strings with no repeating substrings, etc.) and confirming that the time complexity is `O(N^3)` due to the nested loops, and that `str.find` is efficient enough to meet the 1-2 second time constraints, I'm confident in this approach. Using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` makes the code appropriate for typical competitive programming environments. The code is efficient and elegant and directly implements the algorithm I've described.\n",
