Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Optimized Triangle Counting**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides within specific ranges, and I've come up with a plan that should be reasonably efficient. My initial approach of iterating through all possibilities was too slow, so I've focused on finding a more clever way to handle it.\n\nThe crucial constraint is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Given the ranges for *x*, *y*, and *z* (where *x* <= *y* <= *z*), I realized I only need to ensure *x* + *y* > *z*. The other two conditions are always automatically met.\n\nNow, instead of iterating over *x*, *y*, and *z* directly, I'm going to iterate on the sum *S = x + y*.  This will allow me to precompute and use an optimized lookup strategy.\n\n1.  **Iterate on S**: I'll consider all possible values of *S* from *A* + *B* (minimum) up to *B* + *C* (maximum).\n\n2.  **Count Valid (x, y) Pairs for Each S**: For a fixed sum *S*, I need to count how many pairs (*x*, *y*) are valid, given the constraints *A* <= *x* <= *B* and *B* <= *y* <= *C*. I'll represent this count as `count_S(S)`.\n\n3.  **Count Valid z Values for each S**: For each fixed *S*, the allowable range of *z* is `[C, D]` and also *z* < *S*. Thus, to calculate the valid z values, I need to check the intersection of the two conditions. This results in the number of z values as `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)` which I'll name `num_z_for_S`.\n\n4.  **Combining count_S and num_z_for_S**: The total count of triangles will be the sum of `count_S(S) * num_z_for_S` for all `S` in the valid range `[A+B, B+C]`.\n\n**Optimization of count\\_S(S)**\n\nTo efficiently calculate `count_S(S)`, I'm going to use a difference array technique, which will be the core of the optimization. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Difference Array:** I'll create an array `counts_S_array` of size `B + C + 2`, initialized with zeros.\n\n2.  **Iterate over x**: For each *x* in the range [`A`, `B`], and with *y* as `y = S - x`,  the corresponding `counts_S_array[x + B]` increases by 1 and the corresponding  `counts_S_array[x + C + 1]` decreases by 1. That means that the current x count and the x+1 count will sum up to each of the relevant counts\n\n3.  **Prefix Sum:** I will then perform a prefix sum operation on the `counts_S_array`. This will convert the difference array into an array where `counts_S_array[S]` will hold the actual `count_S(S)` (the number of valid (*x*, *y*) pairs for each sum *S*).\n\n**Efficient Calculation of num\\_z\\_for\\_S**\nThe calculation for `num_z_for_S` is relatively straightforward given *S*:\n\n-   If *S* <= *C*, then `num_z_for_S` is 0.\n-   If *C* < *S* <= *D* + 1, then `num_z_for_S` is  *S* - *C*.\n-   If *S* > *D* + 1, then `num_z_for_S` is *D* - *C* + 1.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, I'll iterate through all possible *S* values in the range `[A + B, B + C]`. For each *S*, I'll look up `counts_S_array[S]` (which is `count_S(S)`) and calculate `num_z_for_S`, then accumulate their product into the `total_triangles`.\n\nThis method reduces the complexity to O(*B* + *C*), which will be extremely efficient given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x`, `y`, `z`, these are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know `x <= y <= z`.\nThis simplifies the triangle inequality conditions:\n- `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= x` and `z > 0` (since `D >= C >= B >= A >= 1`). So `y + z >= x + z > x`.\n- `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x > 0`. So `x + z >= x + y > y`.\n\nThus, the only condition we need to satisfy, in addition to the range constraints, is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo we need to count `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate `x`, `y`, and `z` within their respective ranges and check the condition. This would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1))`, which is too slow given `A, B, C, D <= 5 * 10^5`. The maximum complexity could be `(5*10^5)^3`, which is prohibitive.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let's fix `x` and `y` first.\nFor a given `x` and `y`, we need to find the number of `z` values such that `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`.\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `z < S` becomes `z <= S - 1`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `S` (which is `x+y`) is `num_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe total count of triangles can be expressed as:\n`Total = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} num_z(x + y)`\n\nLet's change the order of summation. We can iterate over possible values of `S = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `S` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum possible value for `S` is `B + C`.\nLet `count_pairs_xy(S)` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.\nThen the total count becomes:\n`Total = sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} count_pairs_xy(S) * num_z(S)`\n\nThe maximum value for `B + C` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`. This means we can iterate `S` from `A+B` to `B+C`, which is `O(B+C)` operations.\n\nHow to efficiently calculate `count_pairs_xy(S)` for all `S` in the range `[A+B, B+C]`?\nFor each `x` in `[A, B]`:\n`y` must be in `[B, C]`.\nThus, `x + y` (which is `S`) must be in the range `[x + B, x + C]`.\nFor a fixed `x`, every `S` in `[x + B, x + C]` corresponds to exactly one `y` (namely `y = S - x`) that satisfies `B <= y <= C`.\nSo, for each `x` from `A` to `B`, we want to increment `count_pairs_xy(S)` by 1 for all `S` in the range `[x + B, x + C]`.\n\nThis is a classic range update problem. We can use a difference array.\n1. Initialize an array `diff_counts` of size `B + C + 2` with zeros. (The maximum index needed is `B+C+1`).\n2. For each `x` from `A` to `B`:\n   - Increment `diff_counts[x + B]` by 1.\n   - Decrement `diff_counts[x + C + 1]` by 1.\n3. Compute the prefix sums of `diff_counts` to get the actual `count_pairs_xy(S)` values.\n   `current_count = 0`\n   `for S in range(A + B, B + C + 1):`\n     `current_count += diff_counts[S]`\n     `count_pairs_xy[S] = current_count` (store in `diff_counts` itself for space efficiency)\n\nThis process takes `O(B-A+1)` for step 2 and `O(B+C)` for step 3, total `O(B+C)` time.\n\nNow, let's analyze `num_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`:\nThis function behaves differently based on `S`:\n- If `S - 1 < C` (i.e., `S <= C`): `min(D, S - 1)` will be `S - 1`. `(S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C`. Since `S <= C`, `S - C <= 0`, so `num_z(S) = 0`.\n- If `C <= S - 1 <= D` (i.e., `C + 1 <= S <= D + 1`): `min(D, S - 1)` will be `S - 1`. `num_z(S) = (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C`.\n- If `S - 1 > D` (i.e., `S > D + 1`): `min(D, S - 1)` will be `D`. `num_z(S) = D - C + 1`.\n\nFinally, we sum up the contributions:\n`total_triangles = 0`\n`for S in range(A + B, B + C + 1):`\n  `if S <= C:`\n    `num_z_val = 0`\n  `elif S <= D + 1:`\n    `num_z_val = S - C`\n  `else:`\n    `num_z_val = D - C + 1`\n  `total_triangles += count_pairs_xy[S] * num_z_val`\n\nThis final summation also takes `O(B+C)` time.\nThe overall time complexity is `O(B+C)`, which is `O(10^6)` in the worst case, perfectly acceptable.\nThe maximum value of `total_triangles` can be up to `(5*10^5) * (5*10^5) = 2.5 * 10^{11}`, which fits within a 64-bit integer. Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so there's no overflow concern.\n\nLet's walk through an example: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n1. Initialize `diff_counts` array: `max_sum = B+C = 2+3 = 5`. Array size `5+2=7`.\n   `diff_counts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n2. Populate `diff_counts`:\n   - For `x = 1`:\n     `diff_counts[1+2] += 1` -> `diff_counts[3] = 1`\n     `diff_counts[1+3+1] -= 1` -> `diff_counts[5] = -1`\n     `diff_counts = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`\n   - For `x = 2`:\n     `diff_counts[2+2] += 1` -> `diff_counts[4] = 1`\n     `diff_counts[2+3+1] -= 1` -> `diff_counts[6] = -1`\n     `diff_counts = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1]`\n3. Compute `count_pairs_xy` (stored in `diff_counts`):\n   - `S = 3` (`A+B`): `current_count = 0 + diff_counts[3] = 1`. `count_pairs_xy[3] = 1`.\n   - `S = 4`: `current_count = 1 + diff_counts[4] = 2`. `count_pairs_xy[4] = 2`.\n   - `S = 5` (`B+C`): `current_count = 2 + diff_counts[5] = 1`. `count_pairs_xy[5] = 1`.\n   - `S = 6`: `current_count = 1 + diff_counts[6] = 0`. (Not in `[A+B, B+C]` range, but useful for prefix sum completion).\n   So, `count_pairs_xy = {3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1}`.\n4. Calculate `total_triangles`: `C=3, D=4`.\n   - `S = 3`: `count_pairs_xy[3] = 1`. `S <= C` (3 <= 3) is true. `num_z_val = 0`. `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n   - `S = 4`: `count_pairs_xy[4] = 2`. `S <= C` (4 <= 3) is false. `S <= D+1` (4 <= 4+1=5) is true. `num_z_val = S - C = 4 - 3 = 1`. `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n   - `S = 5`: `count_pairs_xy[5] = 1`. `S <= C` (5 <= 3) is false. `S <= D+1` (5 <= 4+1=5) is true. `num_z_val = S - C = 5 - 3 = 2`. `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`.\n   `total_triangles = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Maximum possible sum S = x + y is B + C.\n    # We need an array to store count_pairs_xy[S] up to B+C.\n    # The difference array approach requires indices up to B+C+1.\n    max_s_val = B + C\n    \n    # diff_counts will store the difference array, then the prefix sums (count_pairs_xy)\n    # Size max_s_val + 2 to accommodate index max_s_val + 1\n    diff_counts = [0] * (max_s_val + 2)\n\n    # Populate the difference array\n    # For each x in [A, B], y ranges from B to C.\n    # So S = x + y ranges from x + B to x + C.\n    # This means count_pairs_xy[S] is incremented by 1 for S in [x+B, x+C].\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        diff_counts[x + B] += 1\n        diff_counts[x + C + 1] -= 1\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums to get actual count_pairs_xy[S] values\n    current_count = 0\n    for s_val in range(A + B, max_s_val + 1):\n        current_count += diff_counts[s_val]\n        diff_counts[s_val] = current_count # Reuse diff_counts array to store count_pairs_xy\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through possible sums S = x + y\n    for s_val in range(A + B, max_s_val + 1):\n        # count_pairs_xy[s_val] is the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to s_val\n        num_xy_pairs = diff_counts[s_val]\n        \n        if num_xy_pairs == 0:\n            continue # No (x,y) pairs for this S, so no triangles\n\n        # Calculate num_z(S): number of z such that C <= z <= D and z < S\n        # This means C <= z <= min(D, S - 1)\n        \n        # Lower bound for z is C\n        # Upper bound for z is min(D, S - 1)\n        \n        lower_z_bound = C\n        upper_z_bound = min(D, s_val - 1) # S-1 because z < S\n\n        if upper_z_bound < lower_z_bound:\n            num_z_val = 0\n        else:\n            num_z_val = upper_z_bound - lower_z_bound + 1\n        \n        total_triangles += num_xy_pairs * num_z_val\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_triangles) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
