He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and need to write a Python script for it. It involves maximizing profit over *k* days by assigning *n* problems with varying difficulties. The difficulty list is `a`, and the core challenge is splitting these problems into *k* contiguous daily sets. The profit for a day is the highest difficulty within that day's problems. My goal is to maximize the sum of these daily profits and output the problem distribution.\n\nMy initial thought is to consider the constraints carefully. I know *k* can't exceed *n*, and I need to use all problems. The problem description suggests a dynamic programming solution is optimal, which makes sense. I can't just greedily pick the *k* highest values; their order and placement matter. Each daily segment has to be contiguous, and each problem can only be solved once.\n\nI start by thinking about the daily profits. To maximize them, I need the highest difficulty problem within each day's group. Intuitively, the best strategy is to make those daily maximums as large as possible. If I were free to choose, I'd pick the *k* largest values from the list `a`. However, I can't arbitrarily pick; the order and contiguity are key. These *k* high-value problems will act as anchors for my daily profits.\n\nI need to figure out how to assign these *k* values to days. I could sort the problems and the days by difficulty. If I choose to let the *k* values be `m_1, m_2, ..., m_k` in descending order, then I would need to find how to assign those values to a single segment of values each. Then, the total profit would be the sum. The trick is: it must respect the order of the original problem list.\n\nNow I need to refine the approach. It's likely I'll be able to create a matrix, where the dimensions are related to the number of problems *n* and the number of days *k*. I can populate this matrix using a recursive approach, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nI'm thinking: define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum profit achievable by assigning the first `i` problems to the first `j` days. Then, the core recursive relation is where I partition the first `i` problems into the first `j-1` days and the *j*th day. And, I'll need to remember the distribution to reconstruct the solution.\n\nThe key will be efficiently calculating the daily maximums during the recursive calls and finding the optimal split points to maximize that `dp[i][j]` value. I can use the sorted problem list to keep track of the chosen daily max values, and optimize my time. This approach will be more complex than just picking the largest values. I'll need a DP approach to ensure I don't miss out on any optimal combinations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a`, into `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on one day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We want to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output the distribution of problems (number of problems per day).\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, we should try to make each daily maximum as large as possible. The largest possible values we can pick are the `k` largest difficulties from the entire list `a`. Let these `k` largest difficulties be `m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k`. If we can arrange the segments such that each `m_i` is the maximum for one of the `k` days, then the total profit will be `sum(m_i)`. This is the maximum possible total profit because any other choice of `k` daily maximums would result in a sum less than or equal to `sum(m_i)`.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1.  Identify the `k` largest difficulties in the list `a`.\n2.  Sum these `k` difficulties to get the maximum total profit.\n3.  Determine the segment boundaries such that each of these `k` largest difficulties becomes the maximum of one segment.\n\nLet's find the `k` largest difficulties and their original indices.\nWe can create a list of tuples `(difficulty, index)` for each problem. Then, sort this list in descending order of difficulty. Take the first `k` elements from this sorted list. These will be our `k` maximums.\n\nFor example, if `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` and `k = 3`:\nProblems with indices: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\nSorted by difficulty (descending): `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\nThe top `k=3` difficulties are `9, 6, 5`. Their original indices are `6, 3, 0`.\nThe maximum total profit is `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\nNow, we need to find the segment boundaries. The `k` problems corresponding to these maximum difficulties must each belong to a different day's segment. Specifically, if we sort the indices of these `k` maximums in ascending order, say `idx_1 < idx_2 < \\dots < idx_k`, then `a[idx_1]` will be the maximum of the first day's problems, `a[idx_2]` for the second day, and so on.\n\nThe segment for day `j` must include `a[idx_j]` and end *before* `idx_{j+1}` (for `j < k`). The segment for the last day (`k`) must include `a[idx_k]` and go up to `a[n-1]`.\nTo ensure `a[idx_j]` is the maximum of its segment, we can simply make `idx_j` the *last problem* of day `j`'s segment. This is a simple and valid strategy.\nSo, the first day's problems would be `a[0 \\dots idx_1]`.\nThe second day's problems would be `a[idx_1+1 \\dots idx_2]`.\n...\nThe `j`-th day's problems would be `a[idx_{j-1}+1 \\dots idx_j]`.\n...\nThe `k`-th day's problems would be `a[idx_{k-1}+1 \\dots idx_k]`.\nWait, this is not correct. The `k`-th day must solve problems up to `a[n-1]`.\nA better strategy for boundaries:\nThe `k` chosen problems with indices `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k` (sorted ascending) act as \"split points\".\nThe first day's problems will be from index `0` up to `idx_1`.\nThe second day's problems will be from index `idx_1+1` up to `idx_2`.\n...\nThe `(k-1)`-th day's problems will be from index `idx_{k-2}+1` up to `idx_{k-1}`.\nThe `k`-th day's problems will be from index `idx_{k-1}+1` up to `n-1`.\n\nLet's re-examine the example: `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `k = 3`.\nThe `k=3` largest difficulties are `9, 6, 5` at indices `6, 3, 0`.\nSorted indices: `0, 3, 6`. These are `idx_1=0, idx_2=3, idx_3=6`.\n\nUsing the strategy:\n*   Day 1: Problems from `0` up to `idx_1 = 0`. Problems: `[5]`. Max: `5`. Length: `1`.\n*   Day 2: Problems from `idx_1+1 = 1` up to `idx_2 = 3`. Problems: `[4, 2, 6]`. Max: `6`. Length: `3`.\n*   Day 3: Problems from `idx_2+1 = 4` up to `n-1 = 7`. Problems: `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max: `9`. Length: `4`.\nTotal profit: `5 + 6 + 9 = 20`.\nDistribution: `1, 3, 4`.\n\nThis distribution `1, 3, 4` is different from the example's `3, 2, 3`, but yields the same total profit. The problem states \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\"\n\nLet's trace the example's distribution: `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`.\nDay 1: `[5, 4, 2]`. Max `5`. (Index `0` is the max)\nDay 2: `[6, 5]`. Max `6`. (Index `3` is the max)\nDay 3: `[1, 9, 2]`. Max `9`. (Index `6` is the max)\nThe maximums are still `5, 6, 9` at indices `0, 3, 6`.\nThe difference is where the *splits* occur.\nThe example's splits are after indices `2` and `4`.\nOur strategy's splits are after indices `0` and `3`.\n\nThe key insight is that we need `k-1` split points. The chosen `k` largest problems `(value, index)` (let's call their sorted indices `s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}`) must be \"covered\" by the `k` segments. To ensure each `s_i` acts as a maximum for its segment, we can place a split *immediately after* `s_i` for `i=0, \\dots, k-2`. The last segment then covers everything from `s_{k-1}` to `n-1`.\n\nSo, the split points are `s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-2}`.\nThe first segment ends at `s_0`.\nThe second segment ends at `s_1`.\n...\nThe `(k-1)`-th segment ends at `s_{k-2}`.\nThe `k`-th segment ends at `n-1`.\n\nLet's re-do the example with this refined split point strategy:\n`a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `k = 3`.\n`k` largest difficulties and their indices: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`.\nSorted indices of these `k` problems: `0, 3, 6`. These are `s_0=0, s_1=3, s_2=6`.\n\nWe need `k-1 = 2` split points. These will be `s_0` and `s_1`.\n*   The first segment ends at `s_0 = 0`. Length `s_0 - (-1) = 1`.\n*   The second segment ends at `s_1 = 3`. Length `s_1 - s_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n*   The third segment ends at `n-1 = 7`. Length `(n-1) - s_1 = 7 - 3 = 4`.\nThe lengths are `1, 3, 4`. Total profit `20`. This is the same as my first attempt.\n\nThe example output `3 2 3` implies splits after index `2` and index `4`.\nLet's analyze the chosen `k` maximums `(5,0), (6,3), (9,6)`.\nThe indices are `0, 3, 6`.\nIf we make the splits after index `2` and `4`:\nDay 1: `a[0 \\dots 2]` -> `[5, 4, 2]`. Max `5` (at index `0`).\nDay 2: `a[3 \\dots 4]` -> `[6, 5]`. Max `6` (at index `3`).\nDay 3: `a[5 \\dots 7]` -> `[1, 9, 2]`. Max `9` (at index `6`).\nThis works. The chosen maximums `(5,0), (6,3), (9,6)` are indeed the maximums of their respective segments.\n\nThe general approach for split points:\n1.  Find the `k` largest values in `a` and their original indices.\n2.  Sum these `k` values for the total profit.\n3.  Collect the *indices* of these `k` values. Sort these indices in ascending order: `idx_0, idx_1, \\dots, idx_{k-1}`.\n4.  These `k` indices define `k` \"critical points\". We need to make `k-1` cuts. The cuts should be placed such that each `idx_j` falls into a different segment.\n    A simple way to achieve this is to make cuts *after* `idx_0`, `idx_1`, ..., `idx_{k-2}`.\n    The first segment runs from `0` to `idx_0`.\n    The second segment runs from `idx_0+1` to `idx_1`.\n    ...\n    The `(k-1)`-th segment runs from `idx_{k-2}+1` to `idx_{k-1}`.\n    The `k`-th segment runs from `idx_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`.\n    This ensures each `idx_j` is the *last element* of its segment (except possibly the last segment). Since `a[idx_j]` is one of the `k` largest values, and we've constructed the segments this way, `a[idx_j]` will be the maximum of its segment.\n\nLet's verify this with the example `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `k = 3`.\n`k` largest values are `9, 6, 5`. Their original indices are `6, 3, 0`.\nSorted indices: `0, 3, 6`. So `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6`.\nWe need `k-1 = 2` cuts. The cut points are `idx_0` and `idx_1`.\nThe first day takes problems from `0` to `idx_0 = 0`. Length `0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\nThe second day takes problems from `idx_0+1 = 1` to `idx_1 = 3`. Length `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.\nThe third day takes problems from `idx_1+1 = 4` to `n-1 = 7`. Length `7 - 4 + 1 = 4`.\nResulting lengths: `1, 3, 4`. Total profit `20`.\n\nThis strategy is correct and simple to implement.\nThe number of problems for day `j` (`t_j`) will be:\n*   `t_1 = idx_0 + 1`\n*   `t_j = idx_{j-1} - idx_{j-2}` for `j = 2, \\dots, k-1`\n*   `t_k = n - 1 - idx_{k-2}` (or `n - (idx_{k-1} + 1)` which is `n - idx_{k-1} - 1` if `idx_{k-1}` is the last problem of day `k-1` and day `k` starts from `idx_{k-1}+1`).\n    No, it's `n - (idx_{k-1} + 1)` if `idx_{k-1}` is the *last* index of the `(k-1)`-th day.\n    Let's use a simpler way to calculate lengths:\n    `current_pos = -1`\n    For `j = 0` to `k-2`:\n        `t_{j+1} = idx_j - current_pos`\n        `current_pos = idx_j`\n    `t_k = n - 1 - current_pos`\n\nLet's re-run with `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6` and `n=8`.\n`current_pos = -1`\n`j=0`: `t_1 = idx_0 - current_pos = 0 - (-1) = 1`. `current_pos = 0`.\n`j=1`: `t_2 = idx_1 - current_pos = 3 - 0 = 3`. `current_pos = 3`.\n`t_3 = n - 1 - current_pos = 7 - 3 = 4`.\nResulting lengths: `1, 3, 4`. This matches.\n\nConsider edge cases:\n*   `k = n`: Each day solves 1 problem. The `k` largest values are all `n` problems. Indices are `0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n    `idx_0=0, idx_1=1, ..., idx_{n-1}=n-1`.\n    `current_pos = -1`\n    For `j=0` to `n-2`: `t_{j+1} = idx_j - current_pos = j - (j-1) = 1`. `current_pos = j`.\n    `t_n = n - 1 - current_pos = n - 1 - (n-2) = 1`.\n    All `t_j` are `1`. Correct.\n*   `k = 1`: Only one day. `k-1 = 0` cuts. The list of indices of `k` largest values will have only one element, `idx_0`.\n    The loop for `j=0` to `k-2` will not run.\n    `t_1 = n - 1 - current_pos = n - 1 - (-1) = n`. Correct.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `2000`.\nSorting `n` elements takes `O(N log N)`.\nExtracting `k` elements and sorting their indices takes `O(k log k)`.\nCalculating lengths takes `O(k)`.\nOverall complexity: `O(N log N)`. This is efficient enough for `N=2000`.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create a list of (difficulty, original_index) tuples\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, original index doesn't matter for profit,\n    # but for consistent results, we can keep original index as secondary sort key.\n    # Python's sort is stable, so original order for equal difficulties is maintained.\n    # However, to explicitly pick the *first* occurrence of a max value if multiple exist,\n    # we might sort by index ascending for equal difficulties.\n    # For this problem, any valid set of k distinct values works.\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the top k problems\n    top_k_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate maximum total profit\n    max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n\n    # Step 5: Get the original indices of these top k problems and sort them\n    split_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 6: Determine the number of problems for each day\n    # The splits occur after indices idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-2}.\n    # The last day takes problems from idx_{k-1}+1 to n-1.\n    \n    daily_problem_counts = []\n    current_start_index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The i-th split_index (split_indices[i]) marks the end of a segment.\n        # This segment runs from current_start_index to split_indices[i].\n        # So its length is split_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1.\n        daily_problem_counts.append(split_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1)\n        current_start_index = split_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last day takes problems from current_start_index to n-1.\n    daily_problem_counts.append(n - current_start_index)\n\n    # Output results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_total_profit) + \"\\n\")\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, daily_problem_counts)) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
