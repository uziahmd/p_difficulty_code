The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break it down to make sure I understand it completely before I start coding.  The core of it is simulating movement on a circular ringroad. There are `n` houses, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks to complete. Each task `a_i` specifies the house where a particular task needs to be done, in order. The key is that tasks *must* be completed in the order they're given (`a1`, then `a2`, etc.), and Xenia can only move clockwise.\n\nMy starting point is house 1, and I'm looking for the *minimum* total time to complete all tasks. The time for a single hop between neighboring houses is one unit.\n\nSo, the logic I need is this: I need to simulate Xenia's journey.  She starts at house 1 (let's track this with `current_pos = 1`). For each task, I'll calculate the time it takes to move from her current location (`current_pos`) to the target house for that task (`a_i`). I'll then update `current_pos` to the target house and add the travel time to a running total (`total_time`).\n\nThe crucial part is calculating the distance between houses, since movement is *only* clockwise. If the target house is *ahead* of the current house (i.e., `target_pos >= current_pos`), the distance is straightforward: `target_pos - current_pos`.\n\nHowever, if the target house is *behind* the current house (`target_pos < current_pos`), it's a bit more involved. She has to go all the way around the ringroad. I've realized I can express this with `(n - current_pos) + target_pos`.\n\nThinking about the code structure, I'll have a loop that iterates through the tasks in the given order. Inside the loop, I'll have an `if` statement to check if `target_pos` is greater than or equal to `current_pos`. Based on that, I can calculate the time taken and update my `total_time` and `current_pos`. The initial value for `total_time` would be 0.\n",
