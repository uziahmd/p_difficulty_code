He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "**My Solution to the Rudolf and Snowflakes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: check if a number `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series, `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`, where `k > 1` and `m >= 2`.  I'm thinking, \"Let's break this down systematically.\"\n\nFirst, I figured out the snowflake structure: a central vertex, `k` leaves directly connected to it, and then each of those leaves connects to `k` more leaves... and so on.  This led me to the formula `N = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.  The goal is to determine if for a given `n`, I can find valid values for `k` and `m`.\n\nMy first idea was to try a special case.  If `m=2`, the equation simplifies to a quadratic. So, I tried solving for `k` using the discriminant. If the discriminant is a perfect square, I calculate `k`. So, I checked the equation `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`, then, if `4n-3` is a perfect square, I could get a valid `k`. I solved for `k = (-1 + s)/2`, where `s = sqrt(4n-3)`. Then I needed to make sure that `k > 1` for this to work.\n\nIf `m=2` doesn't work, I'm thinking I can just iterate through possible values of `m` from 3 up to some maximum.  To find that max `m`, I thought about the smallest possible `k`, which is 2. The sum is then `1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^(m+1) - 1`. Since n is `10^18`, that implies  `2^(m+1)`  is near `10^18`, I deduced `m` has to be about 59 at most. So, I chose to loop `m` from 3 up to 59.\n\nNow for each `m`, I used binary search to look for the right `k`.  I calculate `low` as 2 and the maximum as `n^(1/m)`, then for the search itself, I have to be VERY careful about overflows.  I compute the sum `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`. I need to ensure intermediate calculations like `k^i` and the partial sums don't exceed the max value `n`, so I implemented overflow checks within the loop.\n\nFor each `m` in the loop, I define the upper bound of the binary search `high` using the formula `n**(1/m)`.\n\nThe binary search itself works by:\n1.  **Setting up the search boundaries:** `low = 2` (since k > 1), and `high = n**(1/m) + 2`. (I added 2 to the calculated k since floating-point calculations could cause some rounding.)\n2. **Calculating current sum and managing overflows.**\n3.  **Comparing**: If `current_sum` is bigger, I lowered `high`. If `current_sum` is smaller, I raised `low`.\n4. **Found a solution**: If I find exact `current_sum == n`, then I'm done.\n\nIf after checking all `m` values I don't find a solution, the answer is \"NO\". Also I included edge cases checks like values < 7 (because the smallest valid is 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number `n` can be the total number of vertices in a special type of graph called a \"snowflake\". A snowflake is constructed with a parameter `k > 1` and a number of expansion steps `m >= 2`.\n\nThe construction rules define the number of vertices:\n1. Start with 1 initial vertex (the center).\n2. Connect the center to `k` new vertices. Total vertices: `1 + k`.\n3. This step is repeated at least once: Each vertex connected to only one other vertex (i.e., a leaf) is connected to `k` more new vertices.\n\nLet's trace the number of vertices based on `m`, the number of layers of expansion:\n- `m=0`: Only the center vertex exists. (1 vertex)\n- `m=1`: The center is connected to `k` new vertices. These `k` vertices are leaves. (1 + k vertices)\n- `m=2`: Each of the `k` leaves from step 1 is connected to `k` new vertices. This adds `k * k = k^2` new vertices. These `k^2` vertices are now leaves. (1 + k + k^2 vertices)\n- `m=3`: Each of the `k^2` leaves from step 2 is connected to `k` new vertices. This adds `k^2 * k = k^3` new vertices. (1 + k + k^2 + k^3 vertices)\n- In general, if we perform `m-1` expansions after the initial `k` connections (meaning `m` layers of vertices, `L_1` to `L_m`), the total number of vertices will be `N = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`.\n\nThis is a geometric series sum, which can be expressed as `N = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\nThe problem states that the expansion step (rule 3) must be done at least once. This means we must at least expand the `k` initial leaves. So, the minimum number of layers `m` is 2.\nTherefore, we need to find if there exist integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2` such that `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`.\n\nThe input `n` can be up to `10^18`.\n\n**Case 1: `m = 2`**\nThe equation becomes `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\nThis is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nUsing the quadratic formula, `k = (-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4(1 - n))) / 2 = (-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 + 4n)) / 2 = (-1 ± sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\nFor `k` to be an integer, `4n - 3` must be a perfect square. Let `4n - 3 = s^2` for some integer `s`.\nThen `k = (-1 + s) / 2` (since `k > 0`).\nWe need `k > 1`, which implies `(-1 + s) / 2 > 1 => -1 + s > 2 => s > 3`.\nAlso, for `k` to be an integer, `-1 + s` must be an even number, which means `s` must be odd.\nSo, for `m=2`, we check if `4n - 3` is a perfect square `s^2`, where `s > 3` and `s` is odd. If these conditions hold, `n` is a snowflake.\n\n**Case 2: `m > 2`**\nFor `m > 2`, `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`.\nThe smallest possible `k` is 2.\nIf `k = 2`, `n = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^(m+1) - 1`.\nSince `n <= 10^18`:\n`2^(m+1) - 1 <= 10^18`\n`2^(m+1) <= 10^18 + 1`\n`m+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1)`.\n`log2(10^18) approx 18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.3219 = 59.79`.\nSo `m+1` can be at most `59` (since `2^60-1` is `1.15 * 10^18`, which can be `n`, but `2^61-1` is `2.3 * 10^18`, exceeding `10^18`).\nThis implies `m` can range from `3` up to `58` or `59`. We can iterate `m` from `3` to `59` (inclusive).\n\nFor each fixed `m` in this range:\nWe need to find if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = n`.\nThe function `f(k) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m` is strictly increasing for `k > 1`.\nWe can use binary search to find `k`.\n- The lower bound for `k` is `2`.\n- The upper bound for `k`: Since `k^m < 1 + k + ... + k^m = n`, it must be that `k < n^(1/m)`.\n  - For `m=3`, `k < (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`.\n  - For `m=59`, `k < (10^18)^(1/59) approx 2`.\n  A safe upper bound for `k` in the binary search can be `int(n**(1/m)) + 2`. This takes care of potential floating-point precision issues and ensures we cover the true `k` if `n**(1/m)` is slightly underestimated.\n\nInside the binary search, when calculating `current_sum = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^m` for a candidate `mid` (which is `k`):\nWe must be careful about integer overflow, as `mid^m` can be up to `10^18` and `n` is `10^18`.\nWe can compute the sum iteratively, checking for overflow at each step:\n`current_sum = 1`\n`current_term = 1`\n`for i from 1 to m:`\n  `if current_term > n // mid: ` (check if `current_term * mid` would exceed `n`)\n    `possible_overflow = True`\n    `break`\n  `current_term *= mid`\n  `if current_sum > n - current_term: ` (check if `current_sum + current_term` would exceed `n`)\n    `possible_overflow = True`\n    `break`\n  `current_sum += current_term`\nIf `possible_overflow` is true or `current_sum > n`, then `mid` is too large, so `high = mid - 1`.\nIf `current_sum < n`, then `mid` is too small, so `low = mid + 1`.\nIf `current_sum == n`, then we found a valid `k`, so print \"YES\" and return.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- The smallest possible snowflake has `k=2, m=2`, which gives `1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7` vertices. Any `n < 7` cannot be a snowflake.\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. If `n < 7`, print \"NO\".\n3. Check `m=2`:\n   Calculate `D = 4 * n - 3`.\n   Compute `s = int(math.isqrt(D))`.\n   If `s * s == D` and `s > 3` and `s % 2 == 1`, then print \"YES\" and return.\n4. Iterate `m` from `3` to `59` (inclusive).\n   For each `m`:\n     Set `low = 2`.\n     Set `high = int(n**(1/m)) + 2`. (Ensure `high` is at least 2).\n     Perform binary search for `k` in `[low, high]`:\n       Calculate `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n       If `mid < 2`, set `low = 2` and continue (k must be > 1).\n       Calculate `current_sum = 1 + mid + ... + mid^m` with overflow checks.\n       If `current_sum == n`, print \"YES\" and return.\n       If `current_sum < n`, set `low = mid + 1`.\n       If `current_sum > n` (or overflow occurred), set `high = mid - 1`.\n5. If no `k, m` pair is found after checking all possibilities, print \"NO\".\n\nThe maximum number of test cases `t` is `10^4`.\nThe number of `m` iterations is `~57`.\nThe binary search takes `log(10^6)` (approx 20) iterations.\nThe sum calculation takes `m` (approx 60) iterations.\nThe total operations per test case is roughly `57 * 20 * 60`, which is too high.\nWait, the sum calculation `1 + k + ... + k^m` is `m` steps.\nSo total ops per test case is `sum_{m=3}^{59} (log(k_max_for_m) * m)`.\nFor `m=3`, `k_max` is `10^6`, so `log(10^6) * 3 approx 20 * 3 = 60`.\nFor `m=59`, `k_max` is `2`, so `log(2) * 59 approx 1 * 59 = 59`.\nThis sum is roughly `57 * 60 = 3420` operations per test case.\nTotal operations: `10^4 * 3420 = 3.42 * 10^7`, which is efficient enough for the given time limits.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # Minimum snowflake is 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7 (for k=2, m=2)\n    if n < 7:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Case m = 2: n = 1 + k + k^2\n    # k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0\n    # Discriminant D = 1 - 4(1 - n) = 4n - 3\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(D)) / 2\n    D = 4 * n - 3\n    s = int(math.isqrt(D)) # integer square root\n    if s * s == D:\n        # For k to be an integer > 1:\n        # s must be odd (so -1 + s is even)\n        # (-1 + s) / 2 > 1  =>  -1 + s > 2  =>  s > 3\n        if s > 3 and s % 2 == 1:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            return\n\n    # Case m > 2: n = 1 + k + ... + k^m\n    # Iterate m from 3 up to 59.\n    # The maximum m is when k=2.\n    # 2^(m+1) - 1 <= 10^18  =>  m+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1) approx 59.79\n    # So m+1 can be at most 59, meaning m can be at most 58.\n    # We iterate up to 59 to be safe, covering cases like 2^60 - 1 = 1.15e18.\n    for m in range(3, 60):\n        # Binary search for k\n        # k^m < n implies k < n^(1/m)\n        # Lower bound for k is 2.\n        # Upper bound for k: int(n**(1/m)) + 2.
