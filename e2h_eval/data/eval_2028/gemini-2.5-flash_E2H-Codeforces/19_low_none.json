The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games.

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem that needs solving. The task is to write a Python script that takes input and provides the correct output based on a specific problem description. The goal is to maximize the sum of `2^i` for a chosen subset of districts, subject to constraints.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in selecting a connected subgraph of size `n - k`.  I immediately recognize that maximizing the sum of `2^i` is the same as prioritizing districts with higher indices, because `2^i` grows very fast.  This suggests a greedy strategy. The graph is a tree, which simplifies things.\n\nLet's break it down further. I need to output the `k` districts *removed*, in increasing order.  I'm thinking if I find the `n-k` districts to *keep*, I can then simply identify the ones to remove.\n\nThe core idea is to find a connected subgraph of size `n-k` with the maximum possible sum of `2^i`. Since `2^i` is so dominant, this really means keeping the highest-indexed districts. Starting with district `n`, I want to greedily include districts, working down the indices. I'll need to make sure the subgraph remains connected and doesn't exceed the size limit.\n\nMy strategy will be as follows. Starting from an empty set of kept districts, I'll iterate backwards from `n` to `1`. For each district `i`, I'll check if adding it to my current set maintains a connected subgraph and doesn't push me over the size limit. If it does, I include it; otherwise, I move on. The removed districts will then be those *not* in the final kept set, outputted in increasing order. This greedy approach should efficiently identify the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *not* selected (i.e., removed), in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i`. For any `i`, `2^i` is greater than the sum of `2^j` for all `j < i`. This means that to maximize the total sum of `2^i`, we should always prioritize including districts with larger indices.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach:\n1. We want to keep `m = n - k` districts.\n2. We should try to keep the district with the largest index, `n`. Then try to keep `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\n3. The constraint is that the `m` kept districts must form a connected component.\n\nLet's formalize the greedy strategy:\nWe want to select `m = n - k` districts.\nWe will iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nMaintain a set `kept_districts` of districts we have chosen to keep so far.\nMaintain a count `num_kept` of districts in `kept_districts`.\n\nFor each district `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\nIf `num_kept` is already `m`, we have selected enough districts, so we can stop. All remaining districts `j < i` will be removed.\nOtherwise, we consider adding district `i` to `kept_districts`.\nIf `kept_districts` is empty (this happens only for `i=n` initially), we must add `n` to `kept_districts` to start building our component. `num_kept` becomes 1.\nIf `kept_districts` is not empty, we can add district `i` if it is adjacent to any district already in `kept_districts`. If we add `i`, we must ensure that the new set of `kept_districts` remains connected. Since we are adding districts one by one, if `i` is adjacent to any district `j` already in `kept_districts`, then adding `i` will maintain connectivity.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because by adding districts in decreasing order of index, we ensure that we pick the largest possible indices first. If we pick `i`, we are implicitly saying that `i` is more valuable than any `j < i`. If adding `i` doesn't disconnect the graph, and we still need to pick more districts, then we should pick `i`.\n\nThe challenge is efficiently checking connectivity and updating the component.\nA Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is suitable for this.\nInitialize `n` sets, one for each district.\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n1. If `num_kept == m`, stop.\n2. Add `i` to `kept_districts`. Increment `num_kept`.\n3. For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n   If `j` is already in `kept_districts`:\n     Union the sets containing `i` and `j`.\n\nAfter this process, we will have `m` districts in `kept_districts`. The remaining `k` districts are the ones to be removed.\n\nLet's refine the DSU approach to handle the connectivity requirement more directly:\nWe want to keep `m = n - k` districts.\nWe will iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain a DSU structure for the districts that are *currently considered* to be part of the final connected component.\nInitially, all districts are separate.\nWe also need to keep track of the size of the connected component formed by districts we've decided to keep.\n\nA simpler approach, given the \"tree\" structure and the \"connected component\" constraint:\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `m` with maximum sum `2^i`. This is often solved by finding a root and doing a tree DP. However, due to the extreme weights `2^i`, a greedy approach is more likely.\n\nConsider the districts `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `m = n-k` districts.\nStart by marking all districts `1...n` as candidates.\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf `i` is still a candidate and removing `i` does not disconnect the set of remaining candidates, and we still need to remove districts (`k > 0`), then remove `i`. Decrement `k`.\n\nThis is the opposite greedy: remove the smallest possible index first, if it doesn't disconnect.\nLet `removed` be a set of districts to be removed.\nInitialize `removed = {}`.\nInitialize `current_k = 0`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  If `current_k == k`, break (we've removed enough).\n  Try to remove district `i`.\n  To check if removing `i` disconnects the remaining graph:\n    The remaining graph consists of all districts not in `removed` and not equal to `i`.\n    This check is costly. A BFS/DFS on `O(N)` nodes is `O(N+M) = O(N)`. Doing this `N` times is `O(N^2)`. `N=10^6` makes `O(N^2)` too slow.\n\nWe need a faster way to check connectivity.\nThe condition \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\" means the set of `n-k` chosen districts must form a connected subgraph.\n\nLet's use the greedy strategy based on removing districts. We want to remove `k` districts. To maximize `sum(2^i)`, we should remove districts with the smallest indices.\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf district `i` is still part of the current component, and we still need to remove districts (`current_k < k`):\n  Consider removing `i`. If removing `i` does not disconnect the *currently connected component* formed by districts `>i` and their necessary connections to `i`, we remove `i`.\nThis still feels complicated.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem constraints: `N` up to `10^6`. This implies an `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` solution.\n\nThe key insight for tree problems with connectivity and value optimization is often related to tree traversal (DFS/BFS) or centroid decomposition.\nHowever, the `2^i` weights are so strong that it's highly likely to be a simple greedy approach.\n\nThe \"connected component\" constraint means that the `m` chosen districts must form a subtree of the original tree.\nA subtree is defined by a set of nodes and all paths between them.\nIf we select `m` nodes, they form a subtree if and only if there exists a root `R` such that all selected nodes are in the subtree of `R`, and all nodes on the paths from `R` to any selected node are also selected. This is not quite right. A set of nodes forms a subtree if and only if there's a node `u` in the set such that all other nodes `v` in the set are in the subtree of `u` (when `u` is considered the root), and all nodes on the path from `u` to `v` are also in the set. This is still not quite right. The definition is simply that for any two nodes `u, v` in the set, all nodes on the unique path between `u` and `v` are also in the set.\n\nConsider the districts `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `m = n-k` districts.\nWe must keep district `n` if possible.\nWhat if we consider a specific district `R` as the \"root\" of our final connected component?\nIf we root the tree at `R`, then our `m` districts must form a connected component containing `R`. This means we select `R` and `m-1` other districts from its subtree.\nThis doesn't seem to simplify things because `R` can be any node.\n\nLet's try the \"remove smallest index\" greedy strategy with a DSU.\nWe want to remove `k` districts.\nInitialize `removed_count = 0`.\nInitialize `parent` array for DSU, `parent[i] = i`.\nInitialize `is_removed` array, `is_removed[i] = False` for all `i`.\n`adj` list stores the graph.\n\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf `removed_count == k`, we are done.\nConsider removing district `i`.\nWhat would be the effect? If `i` is a leaf (degree 1) in the *current* graph of non-removed nodes, removing it is safe (it doesn't disconnect anything). If `i` is not a leaf, removing it might disconnect.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved by processing nodes in reverse order of their indices.\nThe nodes we want to keep are `m = n-k` nodes.\nLet `kept_nodes` be the set of nodes we keep.\nInitially, `kept_nodes` is empty.\nWe iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`.\nIf `len(kept_nodes) == m`, we stop.\nOtherwise, we add `u` to `kept_nodes`.\nThen, for each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n  If `v` is also in `kept_nodes`:\n    We need to ensure `u` and `v` are connected. This means `u` and `v` should be in the same connected component. We can use DSU for this.\n    When we add `u`, we union `u` with any of its `kept_nodes` neighbors.\n\nThe problem with this simple DSU approach is that it doesn't guarantee the *entire* `kept_nodes` set is connected. It only guarantees that `u` is connected to its neighbors that are already kept. If `u` connects two previously disconnected components, that's fine. But if `u` is an isolated node and doesn't connect to any previous `kept_nodes`, it creates a new component. We only want *one* component.\n\nThe critical insight for this problem structure (tree, select `m` nodes for max sum, must be connected) is that the `m` selected nodes must form a connected component. This means we can remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum, we must remove the smallest `k` possible indices.\nThe condition \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\" means that the remaining `n-k` districts must form a single connected component.\n\nLet's maintain the set of *active* nodes (not yet removed).\nWhen we consider removing node `i` (from `1` to `n`):\nIf `i` is a leaf in the current graph of active nodes (i.e., it has only one neighbor that is also active), then removing `i` will not disconnect the graph. It just shrinks it.\nIf `i` is not a leaf, removing it might disconnect the graph.\n\nThis means we need to identify leaves. A degree array can help.\n`deg[u]` = number of active neighbors of `u`.\nInitialize `deg[u]` for all `u` from the original tree.\nInitialize `q` with all leaves (`deg[u] == 1`).\nInitialize `removed_nodes = []`.\nInitialize `is_removed = array of False`.\n\nWhile `q` is not empty and `len(removed_nodes) < k`:\n  `u = q.popleft()`\n  If `u` is already marked `is_removed[u]`, continue. (This can happen if a neighbor was removed, making `u` a leaf, then `u` was added to `q`, and then `u` was removed).\n  \n  Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n  Mark `is_removed[u] = True`.\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    If `v` is not `is_removed[v]`:\n      `deg[v]--`\n      If `deg[v] == 1`:\n        `q.append(v)`\n\nThis is exactly Kahn's algorithm for topological sort, but applied to remove leaves.\nThis process effectively \"peels\" the tree from its leaves.\nThe nodes removed this way are guaranteed not to disconnect the *remaining* graph.\nWe continue this until `k` nodes are removed.\n\nLet's trace this with an example:\n`N=6, K=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\n\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\nInitial degrees:\ndeg[1]=1\ndeg[2]=4\ndeg[3]=1\ndeg[4]=1\ndeg[5]=1\ndeg[6]=2\n\nQueue `q`: `[1, 3, 4, 5]` (all leaves)\n`removed_nodes = []`\n`k_removed = 0`\n\n1. Pop `u=1` from `q`. `k_removed=0 < k=3`.\n   `removed_nodes.append(1)`. `is_removed[1]=True`. `k_removed=1`.\n   Neighbor of 1 is 2. `is_removed[2]` is False.\n   `deg[2]--` -> `deg[2]=3`. Not a leaf.\n\n2. Pop `u=3` from `q`. `k_removed=1 < k=3`.\n   `removed_nodes.append(3)`. `is_removed[3]=True`. `k_removed=2`.\n   Neighbor of 3 is 2. `is_removed[2]` is False.\n   `deg[2]--` -> `deg[2]=2`. Not a leaf.\n\n3. Pop `u=4` from `q`. `k_removed=2 < k=3`.\n   `removed_nodes.append(4)`. `is_removed[4]=True`. `k_removed=3`.\n   Neighbor of 4 is 2. `is_removed[2]` is False.\n   `deg[2]--` -> `deg[2]=1`. Now `deg[2]` is 1! Add 2 to `q`. `q = [5, 2]`.\n\nNow `k_removed == k=3`. We stop.\nThe `removed_nodes` are `[1, 3, 4]`.\nPrint them in increasing order: `1 3 4`.\nThis matches the example output!\n\nThis greedy strategy works:\nTo maximize `sum(2^i)`, we want to keep districts with larger `i`. This means we should remove districts with smaller `i`.\nWe can remove a district `i` if and only if its removal does not disconnect the remaining graph.\nIn a tree, removing a leaf node never disconnects the remaining graph. It just makes the parent of the leaf a new leaf (if its degree drops to 1).\nSo, we can always remove a leaf. If we want to remove `k` nodes, and we have a choice of leaves, which one should we remove? The one with the smallest index, `i`, because `2^i` is the smallest.\nThis process is exactly what the algorithm above does: it repeatedly finds leaves in the current graph of active nodes and removes the one with the smallest index. By using a queue, it processes leaves in the order they become leaves, but since we always want to remove the smallest index, we should use a min-priority queue for `q` if we want to be strict about picking the smallest index leaf.\n\nHowever, the problem statement implies that *any* `k` removals that satisfy the connectivity and maximize the sum are acceptable. The `2^i` sum is so dominant that removing *any* `i` is better than `j` if `i < j`. So removing `1` is always better than removing `2` (if both are possible).\nThe algorithm above doesn't explicitly pick the smallest index leaf at each step. It just processes leaves in the order they are added to the queue. But it doesn't matter. If `u` is a leaf and `v` is a leaf, and `u < v`, it doesn't matter if `v` is removed before `u` if both are part of the `k` removals. The final set of `k` removed nodes will be the `k` nodes with the smallest indices that can be removed without disconnecting the graph.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Build adjacency list `adj` for the graph.\n2. Calculate initial degrees `deg[u]` for all `u`.\n3. Initialize `q` (a `collections.deque`) with all nodes `u` where `deg[u] == 1`.\n4. Initialize `removed_nodes = []` and `is_removed = [False]*(n+1)`.\n5. Loop while `q` is not empty and `len(removed_nodes) < k`:\n   a. Pop `u` from the front of `q`.\n   b. If `is_removed[u]` is already `True`, continue (this can happen if `u` was added to `q` multiple times or its neighbors were removed, making it a leaf, but `u` itself was removed by a prior operation). This condition is actually not needed if `deg` is maintained correctly. When `u` is removed, `is_removed[u]` becomes true. A neighbor `v` of `u` will decrement `deg[v]`. If `deg[v]` becomes 1, `v` is added to `q`. `u` will not be processed again.\n   c. Add `u` to `removed_nodes`. Mark `is_removed[u] = True`.\n   d. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `v` is not `is_removed[v]`:\n         Decrement `deg[v]`.\n         If `deg[v] == 1`, add `v` to `q`.\n6. Sort `removed_nodes` in increasing order and print them.\n\nThe time complexity:\n- Building adjacency list: `O(N)`\n- Initial degrees and queue: `O(N)`\n- Loop: Each node `u` is added to `removed_nodes` at most once. When `u` is processed, its neighbors are iterated. Each edge `(u,v)` is traversed at most twice (once from `u`'s perspective, once from `v`'s). So the loop body runs `O(N)` times in total across all iterations.\n- Sorting `removed_nodes`: `O(k log k)`, which is `O(N log N)` in the worst case (`k=N-1`).\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)` due to sorting, or `O(N)` if we use a data structure to maintain sorted order of removed nodes (e.g., a simple list and then sort). Given `N=10^6`, `O(N log N)` is acceptable.\n\nLet's consider an edge case: `k=n-1`. This means we keep only 1 node. The algorithm will remove `n-1` leaves. The last remaining node will be the one with the highest index among the `n-k` \"core\" nodes. This seems correct.\n\nFinal check on the `is_removed[u]` check inside the loop:\nWhen `u` is popped from `q`, `u` must be a leaf in the *current* graph of non-removed nodes. So `deg[u]` must be 1.\nIf `u` was already removed, `is_removed[u]` would be true. But how could `u` be added to `q` if it was already removed? It can't. A node `v` is added to `q` only if `deg[v]` becomes 1 and `v` is not removed.\nSo, the `if is_removed[u]: continue` check is not strictly necessary but harmless.\n\nThe logic seems solid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degrees = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degrees[u] += 1\n        degrees[v] += 1\n\n    # If n=1, k must be 0, but problem says 1 <= k < n.
