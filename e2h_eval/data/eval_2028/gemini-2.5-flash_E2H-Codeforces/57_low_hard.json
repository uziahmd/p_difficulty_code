His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Vasya's Olympiad Rank: A Greedy Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Olympiad ranking problem. I need to figure out the absolute best and worst places Vasya could land, given his minimum total score, the scores from the two tours, and the total number of participants. The crucial thing here is that we only have the scores, not the participants' names, so the pairings are up for grabs.\n\nMy initial thought is to treat this as a perfect matching problem. I need to pair up the scores from tour A with the scores from tour B, where each score is used exactly once. This creates the individual total scores that determine the ranking. The tie-breaker is arbitrary, but that's not our concern for now.\n\nThe question explicitly wants the best and worst rankings, and Vasya's total is at least `x`. So, how do I strategically pair up scores to maximize and minimize Vasya's rank?\n\nFor the best-case scenario (getting a high rank, hopefully 1st), I need to maximize Vasya's score and minimize everyone else's.  But it's not simply a matter of picking the highest and lowest scores. The scores from tour A and tour B are linked.  \n\nIt sounds like a greedy approach could work here. Let's start with sorting the scores from both tours in ascending order. If I want Vasya to have the highest possible score, the natural strategy is to try to match the highest A score with the highest B score, as long as the sum is at least `x`. By pairing them, this maximizes the score for Vasya and minimizes the scores for other participants.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` for Vasya, and two lists of `n` scores for the first and second tours, respectively. The key challenge is that we don't know which first-tour score belongs to which second-tour score; we must form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` using each score exactly once. Ranks are determined by total scores, with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\nLet's denote the sorted arrays of scores as `A_sorted` and `B_sorted`.\n`A_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`B_sorted = sorted(b)`\n\n**1. Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (smallest rank number, ideally 1st), we want to maximize Vasya's score while minimizing the scores of other participants.\n\nConsider pairing `A_sorted[i]` with `B_sorted[n-1-i]` for all `i`. This pairing strategy generally maximizes the sum of pairs (if we pair largest with largest, second largest with second largest, etc.) or minimizes the sum of pairs (if we pair largest with smallest, second largest with second smallest, etc.).\n\nFor the best rank, let's try to make Vasya's score as high as possible. The highest possible score any participant can achieve is `max(a) + max(b)`. If this sum is at least `x`, Vasya *could* have achieved this score. If Vasya gets `max(a) + max(b)`, then all other `n-1` participants must get scores from the remaining `n-1` `a` values and `n-1` `b` values.\nIn this scenario, Vasya can always achieve 1st place. Why?\nSuppose Vasya gets `max(a) + max(b)`. All other participants will get scores `a_i + b_j` where `a_i < max(a)` or `b_j < max(b)` (or both). Thus, their scores will be strictly less than `max(a) + max(b)`. Since Vasya's score `max(a) + max(b)` is guaranteed to be `>= x` (as per the problem statement's guarantee that `exists i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x`, and `max(a) + max(b)` is the largest possible sum), Vasya would be the unique highest scorer and get 1st place.\n\nSo, the best possible rank for Vasya is always **1**.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank (largest rank number), we want to minimize Vasya's score (but still >= `x`) and maximize the scores of other participants.\n\nThis is a more complex scenario. We need to find a pairing of `a` and `b` scores such that:\n1. Each `a_i` is used exactly once, and each `b_j` is used exactly once.\n2. Vasya's assigned pair `(a_v, b_v)` satisfies `a_v + b_v >= x`.\n3. The number of participants whose total score is strictly greater than `a_v + b_v` is maximized.\n4. If there are participants with the same total score as `a_v + b_v`, we assume the jury places them ahead of Vasya.\n\nLet's try to find a pairing strategy that makes scores of *other* participants as high as possible. This is achieved by pairing the largest `a_i` with the largest `b_j`, the second largest `a_i` with the second largest `b_j`, and so on.\nSo, let's sort both `a` and `b` in ascending order:\n`A_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`B_sorted = sorted(b)`\n\nNow, consider forming `n` pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This is *one specific* way to form `n` pairs.\nThe sums would be `S_i = A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[i]`.\nIf we sort `A_sorted` in ascending order and `B_sorted` in ascending order, the sums `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[i]` are not necessarily sorted.\nHowever, if we sort `A_sorted` in ascending order and `B_sorted` in *descending* order, then `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[n-1-i]` is a common strategy to make sums as \"even\" as possible, or to minimize the maximum sum, or maximize the minimum sum. This is not directly what we need for worst rank.\n\nFor the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of people who score *more* than Vasya, and then count Vasya himself and anyone tied with him.\nConsider a fixed participant `P_k` with score `S_k = a_k + b_k`.\nTo maximize the number of people who score better than `P_k`, we want to pair the `n-1` other `a` values and `b` values such that their sums are as high as possible.\n\nThis problem can be rephrased as: find a matching `M = {(a_i, b_j)}` such that for some `(a_v, b_v) in M` with `a_v + b_v >= x`, the rank of `(a_v, b_v)` is maximized.\nThe rank of `(a_v, b_v)` is `1 + count( (a_k, b_k) in M | a_k + b_k > a_v + b_v ) + count( (a_k, b_k) in M | a_k + b_k == a_v + b_v )`.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using a two-pointer approach or by sorting and iterating.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `A_sorted = sorted(a)`.\nLet's sort `b` in descending order: `B_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)`.\n\nNow, we want to find a pairing `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted_desc[j])` for Vasya such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[j] >= x`.\nFor a fixed `A_sorted[i]`, we need to find a `B_sorted_desc[j]` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[j] >= x`.\nTo minimize Vasya's score for a given `A_sorted[i]`, we should pick the smallest `B_sorted_desc[j]` such that `B_sorted_desc[j] >= x - A_sorted[i]`.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score to be some `S_V`. We need to find `A_sorted[i]` and `B_sorted_desc[j]` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[j] = S_V` and `S_V >= x`.\nThe remaining `n-1` scores are then paired up. To maximize the number of people better than Vasya, we pair the remaining `a` values and `b` values greedily to create as many high scores as possible.\n\nConsider the scores `A_sorted` and `B_sorted_desc`.\nWe want to find a matching between `A_sorted` and `B_sorted_desc` such that the number of pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted_desc[j])` whose sum is less than `x` is maximized. The remaining participants (those whose sum is `>= x`) will then be candidates for Vasya's score or scores greater than Vasya.\n\nLet's count how many participants *can* score less than `x`.\nWe can use a two-pointer approach:\nInitialize `count_less_than_x = 0`.\nPointer `i` for `A_sorted` starts at `0`.\nPointer `j` for `B_sorted_desc` starts at `n-1`. (Note: `B_sorted_desc` is `b` sorted in descending order, so `B_sorted_desc[n-1]` is the smallest element of `b`).\nWhile `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n  If `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[j] < x`:\n    This pair `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted_desc[j])` can be formed, and its sum is less than `x`. We want to maximize such pairs to \"get them out of the way\". Since `A_sorted[i]` is the smallest available `a` and `B_sorted_desc[j]` is the smallest available `b` (from `B_sorted_desc`'s perspective, it's `B_sorted[j]`), this is the best way to form a sum less than `x`.\n    So, we use `A_sorted[i]` and `B_sorted_desc[j]`. Increment `count_less_than_x`, increment `i`, decrement `j`.\n  Else (`A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[j] >= x`):\n    This pair has a sum `>= x`. We cannot use this pair to form a sum less than `x`. Since `A_sorted[i]` is the smallest available `a`, and we couldn't make `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[j]` less than `x`, any other `A_sorted[k]` with `k > i` would also result in a sum `>= x` when paired with `B_sorted_desc[j]` (or any larger `B_sorted_desc[l]` with `l < j`).\n    So, we must try to pair `A_sorted[i]` with a smaller `b` value. But `B_sorted_desc[j]` is already the smallest available `b` value. This means `A_sorted[i]` *must* be paired with some `B_sorted_desc[k]` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted_desc[k] >= x`.\n    To maximize the number of participants scoring less than `x`, we should try to use larger `a` values with smaller `b` values (from `B_sorted_desc`) or vice versa.\n    The current approach: `A_sorted[i]` (smallest available `a`) combined with `B_sorted_desc[j]` (smallest available `b`) yields a sum `>= x`. This means `A_sorted[i]` cannot be part of *any* pair with sum `< x`, because any other `B_sorted_desc[k]` it could be paired with would be larger (`k < j`), making the sum even larger.\n    So, `A_sorted[i]` must be one of the `n - count_less_than_x` participants whose scores are `>= x`. We move on to the next smallest `a` by incrementing `i`.\n\nLet's refine the two-pointer strategy.\nSort `a` in ascending order: `A_sorted`.\nSort `b` in ascending order: `B_sorted`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] < x`.\nLet `i` be a pointer for `A_sorted` (starts at 0).\nLet `j` be a pointer for `B_sorted` (starts at `n-1`).\n`count_below_x = 0`.\nWhile `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n  If `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] < x`:\n    We can form a pair `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` whose sum is less than `x`. We take this pair. We increment `i` and decrement `j`. `count_below_x` increases.\n  Else (`A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] >= x`):\n    The current sum is `>= x`. Since `B_sorted[j]` is the largest available `b` score, any `A_sorted[k]` with `k >= i` paired with `B_sorted[j]` will also result in a sum `>= x`. This means `B_sorted[j]` *cannot* be part of a pair with sum `< x` with any of the remaining `A_sorted` values. So, `B_sorted[j]` must be used in a pair with sum `>= x`. We decrement `j`.\n\nThis `count_below_x` represents the maximum number of participants whose scores can be made strictly less than `x`.\nThe remaining `n - count_below_x` participants *must* have scores `>= x`. Vasya is one of these `n - count_below_x` participants.\nIn the worst-case scenario, all `n - count_below_x - 1` other participants among this group score strictly more than Vasya, and Vasya is placed last among those with score `>= x`.\nSo, Vasya's worst rank would be `count_below_x + 1`.\n\nLet's re-verify this logic with an example.\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]` -> `A_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]` -> `B_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`i=0, j=5, count_below_x = 0`\n1. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[5]=8`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. Decrement `j`. (`j=4`)\n2. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[4]=6`. `3+6=9 >= 7`. Decrement `j`. (`j=3`)\n3. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[3]=4`. `3+4=7 >= 7`. Decrement `j`. (`j=2`)\n4. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[2]=4`. `3+4=7 >= 7`. Decrement `j`. (`j=1`)\n5. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[1]=3`. `3+3=6 < 7`. Increment `count_below_x` (`=1`). Increment `i` (`=1`). Decrement `j` (`=0`).\n6. `A_sorted[1]=4, B_sorted[0]=0`. `4+0=4 < 7`. Increment `count_below_x` (`=2`). Increment `i` (`=2`). Decrement `j` (`=-1`).\nLoop terminates because `j < 0`.\n\n`count_below_x = 2`.\nThis means 2 participants can be assigned scores less than `x`.\nThe remaining `n - count_below_x = 6 - 2 = 4` participants *must* have scores `>= x`.\nVasya is one of these 4 participants. In the worst case, the other 3 score strictly higher than Vasya, and Vasya is placed last among the 4.\nSo, Vasya's worst rank is `count_below_x + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nThe example output for worst case is 5. My logic gives 3. What's wrong?\n\nThe logic `count_below_x + 1` assumes that Vasya is the *lowest* scoring person among those who score `>= x`. This is correct for worst case.\nThe issue might be in how `count_below_x` is calculated. My two-pointer strategy finds the maximum number of pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` such that their sum is `< x`. This is indeed the standard way to find this.\n\nLet's re-examine the example's worst case:\n`{4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}`\nSums: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\n`x=7`.\nParticipants with scores `>=7`: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7`. (5 participants)\nParticipant with score `<7`: `3`. (1 participant)\nVasya gets `4+3=7`.\nIn this specific scenario, the participants are:\nP1: 4+8=12\nP2: 4+6=10\nP3: 6+4=10\nP4: 5+4=9\nP5: 4+3=7 (Vasya)\nP6: 3+0=3\n\nRanks:\n1. P1 (12)\n2. P2 (10) - jury can place P2 before P3\n3. P3 (10)\n4. P4 (9)\n5. P5 (7) - jury can place P5 last among those with 7 points.\n6. P6 (3)\n\nVasya's rank is 5. My algorithm gives 3.\nThe difference is `n - count_below_x`. My `count_below_x` is 2. `n - count_below_x = 4`.\nThe example shows `count_below_x = 1` (only 3+0=3).\nWhat pairing strategy leads to `count_below_x = 1`?\n`A_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`B_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\nTo get only one score below 7, we must pair `3` with `0` (sum 3).\nThe remaining scores are `[4, 4, 4, 5, 6]` and `[3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`.\nWe need to pair these 5 scores such that all sums are `>= 7`.\nThis is possible:\n`4+8=12`\n`4+6=10`\n`4+4=8`\n`5+4=9`\n`6+3=9`\nAll these are `>= 7`. So, yes, it's possible to have only one participant score below `x`.\nThis means `count_below_x` can be 1.\n\nThe two-pointer method for `count_below_x`:\n`A_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`B_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n`i=0, j=5`\n`A[0]+B[5] = 3+8=11 >= 7`. `j=4`.\n`A[0]+B[4] = 3+6=9 >= 7`. `j=3`.\n`A[0]+B[3] = 3+4=7 >= 7`. `j=2`.\n`A[0]+B[2] = 3+4=7 >= 7`. `j=1`.\n`A[0]+B[1] = 3+3=6 < 7`. `count_below_x=1`. `i=1, j=0`.\n`A[1]+B[0] = 4+0=4 < 7`. `count_below_x=2`. `i=2, j=-1`.\nResult: `count_below_x = 2`.\n\nThe two-pointer approach I used finds the maximum number of pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] < x` *if `A_sorted` is matched with `B_sorted`*. This is not quite right.\nThe problem is that the pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` are formed from the original sets `a` and `b`. The indices `i` and `j` are just for sorted arrays.\nThe `count_below_x` should be the maximum number of participants `k` such that `S_k < x`.\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum matching of `a` and `b` scores into pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j < x`.\nThis is a greedy problem. Sort `a` ascending. Sort `b` descending.\n`A_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`B_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)`\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum number of participants whose total score is `x` or more. This is `n - (maximum number of participants whose total score is less than x)`.\nLet `A` be sorted ascending. Let `B` be sorted ascending.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(A[i], B[j])` such that `A[i] + B[j] < x`.\nUse two pointers: `i` for `A` (from left, smallest) and `j` for `B` (from right, largest).\nIf `A[i] + B[j] < x`: we *can* form a pair with sum less than `x`. To maximize such pairs, we should use `A[i]` (smallest `a`) with `B[j]` (largest `b`). If this sum is less than `x`, then `A[i]` can potentially be paired with any `B[k]` where `k <= j` to get a sum less than `x`. To maximize the count, we use `A[i]` and `B[j]`, increment `i`, decrement `j`, and increment `count`.\nIf `A[i] + B[j] >= x`: `A[i]` combined with `B[j]` is already `>= x`. Since `B[j]` is the largest available `b`, `A[i]` cannot be paired with any `B[k]` (where `k <= j`) to get a sum less than `x`. So, `A[i]` must be one of the scores that sum to `>= x`. We discard `A[i]` by incrementing `i`.\n\nThis is the standard greedy approach for maximum pairs with sum less than `x`.\nLet's re-run the example:\n`A_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`B_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`i=0, j=5, count_below_x = 0`\n1. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[5]=8`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. Increment `i`. (`i=1`)\n2. `A_sorted[1]=4, B_sorted[5]=8`. `4+8=12 >= 7`. Increment `i`. (`i=2`)\n3. `A_sorted[2]=4, B_sorted[5]=8`. `4+8=12 >= 7`. Increment `i`. (`i=3`)\n4. `A_sorted[3]=4, B_sorted[5]=8`. `4+8=12 >= 7`. Increment `i`. (`i=4`)\n5. `A_sorted[4]=5, B_sorted[5]=8`. `5+8=13 >= 7`. Increment `i`. (`i=5`)\n6. `A_sorted[5]=6, B_sorted[5]=8`. `6+8=14 >= 7`. Increment `i`. (`i=6`)\nLoop terminates because `i=n`.\nResult: `count_below_x = 0`. This is also wrong. This strategy actually finds the minimum number of participants who score `>=x`.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy for finding the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j < x` is as follows:\nSort `a` in ascending order: `A_sorted`.\nSort `b` in ascending order: `B_sorted`.\nInitialize `count_less = 0`.\nUse a pointer `i` for `A_sorted` starting at `0`.\nUse a pointer `j` for `B_sorted` starting at `n-1`.\nWhile `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n  If `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] < x`:\n    We can form a pair `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` that sums to less than `x`. To maximize `count_less`, we should use this pair. This is because `A_sorted[i]` is the smallest available `a`, and `B_sorted[j]` is the largest available `b`. If their sum is less than `x`, then `A_sorted[i]` can definitely be paired with any `B_sorted[k]` where `k <= j` to give a sum less than `x`. By pairing `A_sorted[i]` with `B_sorted[j]`, we use up the smallest `a` and largest `b` that *can* form a sum `< x`. This allows other elements to form pairs.\n    Increment `i`, decrement `j`, increment `count_less`.\n  Else (`A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] >= x`):\n    The sum `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j]` is already `>= x`. Since `B_sorted[j]` is the largest available `b`, `A_sorted[i]` cannot be paired with any `B_sorted[k]` (where `k <= j`) to result in a sum `< x`. So `A_sorted[i]` must be part of a pair with sum `>= x`. We discard `A_sorted[i]` by incrementing `i`.\n\nThis strategy is known to be correct for finding the maximum number of pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] >= x`.\nLet's re-run with this logic for `count_greater_equal_x`.\n`A_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`B_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`i=0, j=5, count_greater_equal_x = 0`\n1. `A_sorted[0]=3, B_sorted[5]=8`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. This pair can form a sum `>= x`. We take it. Increment `count_greater_equal_x` (`=1`). Increment `i` (`=1`). Decrement `j` (`=4`).\n2. `A_sorted[1]=4, B_sorted[4]=6`. `4+6=10 >= 7`. This pair can form a sum `>= x`. We take it. Increment `count_greater_equal_x` (`=2`). Increment `i` (`=2`). Decrement `j` (`=3`).\n3. `A_sorted[2]=4, B_sorted[3]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`.

This pair cannot form a sum `>= x`. Since `A_sorted[5]` is the largest remaining `a`, it cannot be paired with `B_sorted[0]` (smallest remaining `b`) to make `>= x`. This means `B_sorted[0]` cannot be part of any pair with sum `>= x`. So we decrement `j`. (`j=-1`).\nLoop terminates.\n\n`count_greater_equal_x = 5`.\nThis means a maximum of 5 participants *can* score `>= x`.\nVasya is one of these 5 participants. In the worst case, the other 4 score strictly higher, and Vasya is placed last among the 5.\nSo, Vasya's worst rank is `n - count_greater_equal_x + 1` is not right. It should be `count_less_than_x + 1`.\nIf `count_greater_equal_x` is the maximum number of people who can score `>= x`, then Vasya's worst rank is `n - count_greater_equal_x + 1`.\nIn this case, `6 - 5 + 1 = 2`. Still not 5.\n\nLet's rethink the worst case from the example.\nThe example's worst case pairing: `{(4,8), (4,6), (6,4), (5,4), (4,3), (3,0)}`.\nSums: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\n`x=7`.\nScores `>= x`: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7`. (5 participants)\nScores `< x`: `3`. (1 participant)\nVasya gets `4+3=7`.\nThe number of participants scoring `>=x` is 5. Vasya is one of them.\nVasya's rank is `1 + (number of participants with score > Vasya's score) + (number of participants with score == Vasya's score and placed before Vasya)`.\nIn this specific scenario, Vasya has score 7.\nScores > 7: `12, 10, 10, 9` (4 participants).\nScores == 7: None, other than Vasya.\nSo, Vasya's rank is `1 + 4 = 5`. This matches the example.\n\nThe `count_greater_equal_x` (my last calculation gives 5) is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x`.\nLet this be `K_max`. So `K_max = 5`.\nThis means there are `n - K_max = 6 - 5 = 1` participant who *must* score less than `x`.\nVasya is one of the `K_max` participants.\nIn the worst case, Vasya is the lowest scoring person among these `K_max` participants, and all `K_max - 1` other participants score higher than him.\nSo Vasya's rank would be `1 + (K_max - 1) + (n - K_max) = K_max + n - K_max = n`.\nNo, this is not right.\nVasya's rank is `(number of people with score > Vasya) + (number of people with score == Vasya and placed before Vasya) + 1`.\nIf there are `K_max` people who score `>=x`, and Vasya is one of them, then `K_max-1` people are *not* Vasya.\nTo get the worst rank:\n1. Maximize the number of people who score strictly greater than Vasya.\n2. Maximize the number of people who score equal to Vasya and are placed before him.\n3. Minimize Vasya's score, but keep it `>= x`.\n\nThe maximum number of people who can score `>= x` is `K_max`.\nThe minimum number of people who must score `< x` is `n - K_max`.\nVasya's worst rank will be `(n - K_max) + K_max = n`.\nThis is if we assume Vasya is the lowest among the `K_max` people, and all `n - K_max` people score less than `x`.\nThis is `(n - K_max)` people with scores `< x`.\nAnd `K_max` people with scores `>= x`. Vasya is one of them.\nIf Vasya is the lowest among these `K_max` people, and he is placed last among them, his rank would be `(n - K_max) + K_max = n`.\nThis `n` is the worst possible rank in general (last place).\nFor the example, `K_max = 5`. So `n - K_max = 1`.\nThe worst rank `n - K_max + 1` would be `1 + 1 = 2`. Still not 5.\n\nThe problem states \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"\nThis means if Vasya gets score `S_V`, and `C_gt` people get `> S_V`, and `C_eq` people get `== S_V` (excluding Vasya), then Vasya's worst rank is `C_gt + C_eq + 1`.\n\nThe `count_greater_equal_x` calculated (5 in example) is the maximum number of people who can score `>= x`.\nLet `N_ge_x` be this value.\nThe number of people who *must* score `< x` is `N_lt_x = n - N_ge_x`.\nVasya's worst rank is `N_lt_x + N_ge_x = n`.\nThis is if Vasya has the lowest score among the `N_ge_x` people, and all of them score strictly more than Vasya, and all `N_lt_x` people score less than `x`.\nThis is not quite right.\nThe `N_ge_x` calculation is the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis is correct.\nSo, `N_ge_x` is the maximum number of people who can get a score of at least `x`.\nThe remaining `n - N_ge_x` people *must* get a score less than `x`.\nVasya is one of the `N_ge_x` people.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank (make it as large as possible):\n- All `n - N_ge_x` people score less than `x`. They will be ranked after Vasya.\n- Among the `N_ge_x` people (including Vasya), we want Vasya to be ranked last.\n  This means `N_ge_x - 1` people score higher than or equal to Vasya and are placed before him.\nSo, Vasya's rank would be `(N_ge_x - 1) + 1 = N_ge_x`.\nWait, this is if all `n - N_ge_x` people are ranked after Vasya.\nThe total rank would be `(N_ge_x - 1) + 1 = N_ge_x`.\nThe maximum possible rank for Vasya is `N_ge_x`.\n\nLet's trace the example `n=6, x=7` again with `N_ge_x = 5`.\nThis means 5 people can score `>=7`.\n1 person must score `<7`.\nExample's worst case:\nScores: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\nThe person with score 3 is ranked 6th.\nThe 5 people with scores `>=7` are ranked 1st to 5th.\nVasya is one of these 5 people. If he gets score 7, and the other 4 get `12, 10, 10, 9`, then his rank is 5.\nThis `N_ge_x` value of 5 is exactly the worst rank.\nSo, the worst rank is `N_ge_x`.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the first example:\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`A_sorted = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`B_sorted = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nCalculate `N_ge_x`:\n`i=0, j=4, count_ge_x = 0`\n1. `A[0]=1, B[4]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `count_ge_x=1`. `i=1, j=3`.\n2. `A[1]=1, B[3]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `count_ge_x=2`. `i=2, j=2`.\n3. `A[2]=1, B[2]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `count_ge_x=3`. `i=3, j=1`.\n4. `A[3]=1, B[1]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `count_ge_x=4`. `i=4, j=0`.\n5. `A[4]=1, B[0]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `count_ge_x=5`. `i=5, j=-1`.\nLoop ends. `N_ge_x = 5`.\nWorst rank according to hypothesis: `N_ge_x = 5`.\nExample output: `1 5`. This matches.\n\nSo, the logic for worst rank seems to be:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order: `A_sorted`.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order: `B_sorted`.\n3. Use two pointers `i` (for `A_sorted`, starting at 0) and `j` (for `B_sorted`, starting at `n-1`).\n4. Initialize `N_ge_x = 0`.\n5. While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n   If `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] >= x`:\n     This pair `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` can form a sum `>= x`. To maximize such pairs, we use the smallest available `a` (`A_sorted[i]`) and the largest available `b` (`B_sorted[j]`). This is a greedy choice that ensures we maximize the count.\n     Increment `N_ge_x`, increment `i`, decrement `j`.\n   Else (`A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] < x`):\n     The sum `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j]` is less than `x`. Since `A_sorted[i]` is the smallest available `a`, and `B_sorted[j]` is the largest available `b`, if their sum is less than `x`, then `B_sorted[j]` (the largest available `b`) cannot be paired with `A_sorted[i]` (or any smaller `a`) to achieve a sum of at least `x`. So, `B_sorted[j]` must be paired with some `A_sorted[k]` (`k > i`) to achieve `>=x`, or it will be part of a pair that sums to `<x`. To maximize `N_ge_x`, we should try to use `B_sorted[j]` with a larger `a`. But we are iterating `a` from smallest. This means `A_sorted[i]` cannot form a sum `>= x` with `B_sorted[j]`. So `A_sorted[i]` must be paired with some `B_sorted[k]` where `k > j`. This means `B_sorted[j]` is \"too small\" for `A_sorted[i]` to reach `x`. We should try `A_sorted[i]` with a larger `b`. But `j` is already at the largest available `b`. This means `A_sorted[i]` will be part of a pair with sum `<x`. So we should just increment `i` to consider the next smallest `a`.\n\nThis is the correct greedy strategy for finding the maximum number of pairs `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` such that `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] >= x`.\nThe worst rank for Vasya is this `N_ge_x`.\n\nFinal check for worst rank logic:\nWe want to maximize Vasya's rank. This means maximizing the number of people who score strictly higher than Vasya, and maximizing the number of people who score equal to Vasya and are placed before him.\nThe `N_ge_x` calculated is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a total score of at least `x`.\nLet these `N_ge_x` participants be `P_1, P_2, ..., P_{N_ge_x}`.\nLet their scores be `S_1, S_2, ..., S_{N_ge_x}`. All `S_k >= x`.\nThe remaining `n - N_ge_x` participants `Q_1, ..., Q_{n-N_ge_x}` must have scores `T_k < x`.\nVasya is one of the `P_k` participants.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank, we assume:\n1. All `P_k` participants (excluding Vasya) score equal to or higher than Vasya, and are placed before him. There are `N_ge_x - 1` such participants.\n2. All `Q_k` participants score less than `x`, so they are ranked after all `P_k` participants.\nTherefore, Vasya would be placed after `N_ge_x - 1` participants. His rank would be `(N_ge_x - 1) + 1 = N_ge_x`.\nThis logic seems sound and matches both examples.\n\n**Summary of Solution:**\n1. **Best Rank:** Always 1. Vasya can take `max(a)` and `max(b)`. Since `max(a) + max(b)` is guaranteed to be `>= x` (as per problem statement, there exists *some* `a_i, b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, and `max(a)+max(b)` is the largest possible sum), Vasya can achieve this highest possible score. All other participants will necessarily score less than this, making Vasya the unique first place.\n2. **Worst Rank:**\n   a. Sort array `a` in ascending order: `A_sorted`.\n   b. Sort array `b` in ascending order: `B_sorted`.\n   c. Initialize `N_ge_x = 0` (number of participants who can score `>= x`).\n   d. Use two pointers: `i = 0` (for `A_sorted`) and `j = n - 1` (for `B_sorted`).\n   e. While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n      If `A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] >= x`:\n         A pair `(A_sorted[i], B_sorted[j])` can achieve a sum `>= x`. Increment `N_ge_x`. Move both pointers: `i += 1`, `j -= 1`.\n      Else (`A_sorted[i] + B_sorted[j] < x`):\n         The smallest available `a` (`A_sorted[i]`) paired with the largest available `b` (`B_sorted[j]`) still results in a sum less than `x`. This implies that `A_sorted[i]` cannot be paired with any `B_sorted[k]` (where `k <= j`) to achieve a sum `>= x`. Thus, `A_sorted[i]` must be part of a pair that sums to less than `x`. We \"discard\" `A_sorted[i]` from consideration for sums `>= x` by incrementing `i`.\n   f. The worst rank for Vasya is `N_ge_x`.\n\nThis approach is efficient: sorting takes `O(N log N)`, and the two-pointer scan takes `O(N)`. Total time complexity `O(N log N)`. Space complexity `O(N)` for storing sorted arrays.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank for Vasya is always 1.\n    # Vasya can take the highest score from A and highest score from B.\n    # The problem guarantees that there exist i, j such that a[i] + b[j] >= x.\n    # max(a) + max(b) is the largest possible sum any participant can achieve.\n    # This sum must be >= x.
