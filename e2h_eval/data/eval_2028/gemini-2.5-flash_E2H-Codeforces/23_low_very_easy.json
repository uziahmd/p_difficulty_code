In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Mahjong Tile Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Tokitsukaze tile problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of tiles she needs to *draw* (0, 1, or 2) to complete a mentsu, which is either a koutsu (three of a kind) or a shuntsu (a run of three).  My initial tiles are `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`, and I need to figure out the most efficient way to get a mentsu.  I know right off the bat it can't be more than two draws, because worst case scenario, I just duplicate one of my existing tiles twice to make a koutsu.\n\nFirst, let's represent the tiles properly: each one will have a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, or s).  I'll store these as tuples (number, suit). Let's call them `(n1, s1)`, `(n2, s2)`, and `(n3, s3)`.\n\nNow, I'll go through the logic step-by-step:\n\n*   **Zero Draws:**  The simplest scenario: I already have a mentsu. This means either I have a koutsu (all three tiles are identical) - in other words,  `(n1, s1) == (n2, s2) == (n3, s3)`.  Or, I have a shuntsu.  For a shuntsu, all three tiles must be the same suit (`s1 == s2 == s3`) and the numbers must be sequential. To be sure, I can sort the numbers: `n_sorted = sorted([n1, n2, n3])`, and check that `n_sorted[1] == n_sorted[0] + 1` and `n_sorted[2] == n_sorted[1] + 1`.\n\n*   **One Draw:** If zero draws isn't enough, can one additional tile do the trick?  After drawing one tile, `t_new`, my hand will be `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, and `t_new`.  I need to check if *any* three tiles in this set of four make a mentsu. It is equivalent to checking if  `t1`, `t2`, `t_new`,  or `t1`, `t3`, `t_new`, or `t2`, `t3`, `t_new` forms a mentsu.\n\nI'll proceed based on this logic.  First check if I have a mentsu already (0 draws).  If not, check to see if one draw can make a mentsu. If neither condition is true, then the solution must require two draws.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) with her current three tiles. A koutsu is three identical tiles, and a shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile can be represented as a pair `(number, suit)`. For example, '1s' is `(1, 's')`.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws, which can be 0, 1, or 2. The maximum is 2 because we can always form a koutsu by drawing two tiles identical to one of the tiles already in hand (e.g., if she has '1m', she can draw two '1m's to form `[1m, 1m, 1m]`).\n\nLet's check the possibilities in increasing order of draws:\n\n**0 Draws:**\nTokitsukaze already has a mentsu among her three initial tiles.\nThis occurs if:\n1.  **Koutsu:** All three tiles are identical. `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n    Example: `['2m', '2m', '2m']`\n2.  **Shuntsu:** All three tiles are of the same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n    First, check if `s1 == s2 == s3`.\n    Then, sort the numbers `n1, n2, n3` to get `n_sorted`. Check if `n_sorted[1] == n_sorted[0] + 1` AND `n_sorted[2] == n_sorted[1] + 1`.\n    Example: `['1s', '2s', '3s']` (or `['3s', '1s', '2s']`)\n\nIf either of these conditions is true, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can Tokitsukaze form a mentsu by drawing one tile?\nThis means that by adding one tile `t_new` to her hand `[t1, t2, t3]`, she can form a mentsu using any three tiles from `[t1, t2, t3, t_new]`.\nThis simplifies to checking if any *two* of her initial tiles `(ti, tj)` can form a mentsu by drawing one specific tile.\nConsider all pairs of tiles from `(t1, t2, t3)`: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\nFor each pair `(ti, tj)`:\n1.  **To form a Koutsu:** If `ti == tj`, she needs to draw one more tile identical to `ti` (i.e., `ti`).\n    Example: `['3p', '9m', '3p']`. The pair `(3p, 3p)` needs one `3p` to form `[3p, 3p, 3p]`.\n2.  **To form a Shuntsu:** If `si == sj`:\n    Let `ni, nj` be the numbers. Sort them: `n_min, n_max`.\n    She can form a shuntsu by drawing:\n    *   `n_min - 1` (if `n_min > 1`): `[n_min-1, n_min, n_max]` (only if `n_max == n_min`)\n    *   `n_min + 1` (if `n_max == n_min + 2`): `[n_min, n_min+1, n_max]` (e.g., `(1m, 3m)` needs `2m`)\n    *   `n_max + 1` (if `n_max < 9`): `[n_min, n_max, n_max+1]` (only if `n_max == n_min`)\n    More generally, if `s_i == s_j`, we need to draw a tile `(k, s_i)` such that `k, n_i, n_j` are consecutive numbers.\n    The possible values for `k` are:\n    *   `n_i - 1` (if `n_i > 1` and `n_j == n_i + 1`)\n    *   `n_i + 1` (if `n_j == n_i - 1` or `n_j == n_i + 1`)\n    *   `n_j - 1` (if `n_j > 1` and `n_i == n_j + 1`)\n    *   `n_j + 1` (if `n_j < 9` and `n_i == n_j - 1`)\n    This covers cases where the two tiles are `(x, x+1)` (needs `x-1` or `x+2`), `(x, x+2)` (needs `x+1`), or `(x, x)` (needs `x-1` and `x-2`, or `x+1` and `x+2`).\n    For 1 draw, we only care about `(x, x+1)` needing `x-1` or `x+2`, and `(x, x+2)` needing `x+1`.\n    So, if `s_i == s_j`:\n    *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 1` (e.g., `(1s, 2s)`): We need to draw `(n_i-1, s_i)` (if `n_i > 1`) or `(n_j+1, s_j)` (if `n_j < 9`).\n    *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 2` (e.g., `(1s, 3s)`): We need to draw `(min(n_i, n_j) + 1, s_i)`.\n\nIf any of these conditions (for any pair) is true, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, Tokitsukaze needs 2 draws.\nThis is always possible: just draw two tiles identical to any one of her current tiles to form a koutsu. For example, if she has `1m`, she can draw two `1m` tiles to form `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Parse the three input tile strings into `(number, suit)` tuples. Let them be `t1, t2, t3`.\n2.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    *   If `t1 == t2 == t3`, return 0.\n    *   Convert tiles to a list of `(number, suit)` and sort by suit then by number. This helps check shuntsu easily.\n    *   If `s1 == s2 == s3` AND `n_sorted[0] + 1 == n_sorted[1]` AND `n_sorted[1] + 1 == n_sorted[2]`, return 0.\n3.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles `(ti, tj)` from `(t1, t2, t3)`.\n    *   If `ti == tj` (e.g., `(1m, 1m)`), we can draw one `ti` to make a koutsu. Return 1.\n    *   If `si == sj`:\n        *   If `abs(ni - nj) == 1` (e.g., `(1m, 2m)`), we can draw `(min(ni, nj)-1, si)` or `(max(ni, nj)+1, si)` to make a shuntsu. Return 1.\n        *   If `abs(ni - nj) == 2` (e.g., `(1m, 3m)`), we can draw `(min(ni, nj)+1, si)` to make a shuntsu. Return 1.\n4.  **If neither 0 nor 1 draw works, return 2.**\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **Input: `1s 2s 3s`**\n    Tiles: `(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')`\n    0 Draws check:\n    *   Not all identical.\n    *   All same suit ('s'). Numbers `1, 2, 3`. Sorted: `1, 2, 3`. `1+1=2`, `2+1=3`. Yes, a shuntsu.\n    Output: 0\n\n*   **Input: `9m 9m 9m`**\n    Tiles: `(9, 'm'), (9, 'm'), (9, 'm')`\n    0 Draws check:\n    *   All identical. Yes, a koutsu.\n    Output: 0\n\n*   **Input: `3p 9m 2p`**\n    Tiles: `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')`\n    0 Draws check:\n    *   Not all identical.\n    *   Not all same suit (`p`, `m`, `p`).\n    0 Draws fails.\n\n    1 Draw check:\n    Pairs:\n    1.  `(3p, 9m)`: Different suits.\n    2.  `(3p, 2p)`: Same suit 'p'. Numbers `3, 2`. `abs(3-2) == 1`.
