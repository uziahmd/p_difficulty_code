    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on \"Gluttony\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core idea seems to be about finding a permutation of an array `a` (let's call it `b`) such that the sums of elements in any subset of `a` are *different* from the corresponding sums in `b`. The input array `a` has distinct integers, and `n` can be up to 22. This `n <= 22` makes me think, \"is there an efficient algorithm, or can I just brute-force with subsets?\" The problem is essentially asking: \"Can you create a sequence such that no two subsets add up to the same value?\"\n\nThe constraint `n <= 22` is interesting. The obvious brute-force approach would be `O(n * 2^n)` to check all the subsets.  Is there a clever way to construct `b` that guarantees the sums will be different?\n\n**Exploring Cyclic Shifts**\n\nLet's try a simple cyclic shift as a starting point. If I shift the elements of `a`, does that work? Let `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}`. With `n=2`, it works fine (simple to check). With `n=3`, it seems okay too. What about a general `n`? \n\nI need to prove that `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)` for all subsets `S` where `0 < |S| < n`.  Let's define `c_i = a_i - b_i`.  The condition becomes `sum(c_i for i in S) != 0`.\n\nIf `b` is a cyclic shift of `a`, `c_i = a_i - a_{(i+1) % n}`. The sum of all `c_i` is a telescoping sum and will be 0. This is helpful. If I can prove that `sum(c_i)` over any subset `S` is not 0, then the cyclic shift works.\n\n**Developing the Solution with Sorted Arrays**\n\nI notice that sorting `a` might be important. Let's sort `a` and see if `b` as a cyclic shift of the sorted array `a` always works. With a sorted `a`, all the `c_i`'s become negative, except one which is positive. I also have the additional info that the array has distinct elements.\n\nLet's carefully think about it.  Let `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` where `a` is sorted. Then:\n`c_i = a_i - a_{(i+1) % n}`.\n- For `i = 0 to n-2`, `c_i < 0`.\n- For `i = n-1`, `c_{n-1} > 0`.\nSo, the sums of the values cannot equal zero if only we're adding some negative numbers and one positive number. Because all `a_i` are distinct, the sum of any subset of the `c`s will be different.  I think I can prove the cyclic shift of the sorted array `a` will always work for `n > 1`. \n\nFor `n=1`, the problem condition `0 < |S| < n` is not satisfied. So I need to handle this as a special case, which is easy because any `b` equals `a` is a valid permutation. I need to output `a` itself.\n\n**Code and Implementation**\n\nThe code is pretty straightforward:\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  If `n == 1`, print `a[0]`.\n3.  Otherwise: sort `a`, apply a cyclic shift to create `b`, and print `b`. The sorting is `O(n log n)`, constructing `b` is `O(n)`, so the algorithm runs in `O(n log n)`. This also is an easy problem to implement in python.\n\nThis solution seems very elegant and it's nice that it's also fast and robust for the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nLet's define `c_i = a_i - b_i`. The condition then becomes `sum(c_i for i in S) != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nConsider the special case `n=1`. The condition `0 < k < n` (where `k = |S|`) implies `0 < k < 1`. No integer `k` satisfies this, so there are no subsets `S` to check. Thus, any permutation `b` works. For `n=1`, the only permutation of `a` is `a` itself. So, if `n=1`, we simply print `a[0]`.\n\nFor `n > 1`, let's try a specific construction for `b`. A common strategy in such problems is to sort the input array and then apply a simple permutation like a cyclic shift.\n\nLet `a_sorted` be the array `a` after sorting its elements in ascending order: `a_sorted[0] < a_sorted[1] < ... < a_sorted[n-1]`.\nNow, let's construct `b` by cyclically shifting `a_sorted` to the left by one position. That is, `b[i] = a_sorted[(i+1) % n]`.\nSo, `b` would be `[a_sorted[1], a_sorted[2], ..., a_sorted[n-1], a_sorted[0]]`.\n\nLet's analyze the `c_i` values for this construction:\n`c_i = a_sorted[i] - b[i] = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[(i+1) % n]`.\n\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-2`:\n`c_i = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i+1]`. Since `a_sorted` is sorted, `a_sorted[i] < a_sorted[i+1]`, so `c_i` will be a negative integer.\nFor `i = n-1`:\n`c_{n-1} = a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]`. Since `a_sorted[n-1] > a_sorted[0]` (because `a` contains distinct integers and `n > 1`), `c_{n-1}` will be a positive integer.\n\nSo, we have `n-1` negative `c_i` values and one positive `c_i` value (`c_{n-1}`).\nThe sum of all `c_i` values is:\n`sum(c_i for i in range(n)) = sum(a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[(i+1)%n] for i in range(n))`\nThis is a telescoping sum: `(a_sorted[0] - a_sorted[1]) + (a_sorted[1] - a_sorted[2]) + ... + (a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]) = 0`.\nSo, `sum(c_i for i in range(n)) = 0`. This implies `c_{n-1} = -sum(c_i for i in range(n-1))`.\n\nNow, we need to show that `sum(c_j for j in S) != 0` for any `S` with `0 < |S| < n`.\nThere are two cases for a given subset `S`:\n\n1.  **`n-1` is NOT in `S`**:\n    In this case, all indices `j` in `S` are from `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    For these indices, `c_j` is always negative.\n    Since `S` is non-empty, `sum(c_j for j in S)` will be a sum of one or more negative integers.\n    Therefore, `sum(c_j for j in S) < 0`, and thus it cannot be zero. This case is valid.\n\n2.  **`n-1` IS in `S`**:\n    Let `S' = S \\ {n-1}`.\n    Then `sum(c_j for j in S) = sum(c_j for j in S') + c_{n-1}`.\n    We need to show `sum(c_j for j in S') + c_{n-1} != 0`, which is equivalent to `sum(c_j for j in S') != -c_{n-1}`.\n    From `sum(c_i for i in range(n)) = 0`, we know `sum(c_i for i in range(n-1)) + c_{n-1} = 0`.\n    So, `-c_{n-1} = sum(c_i for i in range(n-1))`.\n    The condition becomes `sum(c_j for j in S') != sum(c_j for j in range(n-1))`.\n\n    Now, consider `S'`: it's a subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    Since `n-1 \\in S` and `|S| < n`, `S` cannot be the set of all indices. This implies `S'` cannot be `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    So, `S'` is a *proper* subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    Also, `S'` could be empty or non-empty.\n\n    *   If `S'` is empty, then `S = {n-1}`.\n        `sum(c_j for j in S) = c_{n-1} = a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]`.\n        Since `n > 1` and `a` has distinct elements, `a_sorted[n-1] > a_sorted[0]`, so `c_{n-1} > 0`.\n        Thus, `c_{n-1} != 0`. This case is valid.\n\n    *   If `S'` is non-empty, then `S'` is a proper non-empty subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n        All `c_j` for `j \\in S'` are negative.\n        All `c_j` for `j \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-2\\}` are negative.\n        Let `P = \\{0, 1, ..., n-2\\}`. We need to show `sum(c_j for j in S') != sum(c_j for j in P)`.\n        Since `S'` is a proper subset of `P`, `P \\ S'` is non-empty.\n        `sum(c_j for j in P) = sum(c_j for j in S') + sum(c_j for j in P \\ S')`.\n        Since `P \\ S'` is non-empty and all `c_j` are negative for `j \\in P`, `sum(c_j for j in P \\ S')` will be strictly negative.\n        Therefore, `sum(c_j for j in P)` will be strictly less than `sum(c_j for j in S')` (i.e., more negative).\n        This means `sum(c_j for j in P) != sum(c_j for j in S')`.\n        So this case is also valid.\n\nAll cases show that `sum(c_j for j in S) != 0`. Therefore, this construction always works for `n > 1`.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. If `n=1`, print `a[0]` and exit.\n4. Sort `a` to get `a_sorted`.\n5. Create `b` by taking `a_sorted[1:]` and appending `a_sorted[0]`.\n6. Print the elements of `b` space-separated.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`, and a space complexity of `O(N)`. Given `N <= 22`, this is extremely efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, the size of the array\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Read the array a of distinct integers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Edge case: If n is 1, there are no non-empty proper subsets of indices.\n    # The condition 0 < k < n cannot be satisfied.\n    # So, any permutation works.
