    "thought": "**Understanding Lexicographical Minimization with Swaps**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string problem, and the goal is clear: find the lexicographically smallest string possible after allowing specific adjacent swaps.  The allowed moves are crucial - '0' and '1' can swap, and '1' and '2' can swap, but '0' and '2' cannot.  Right off the bat, I see the immediate implications: the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. That's the core constraint.\n\nMy mind immediately starts visualizing the constraints: '0's can *move* around '1's, and '2's can also move around '1's, but '0's and '2's are essentially locked in their initial relative order.  If a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, it *must* stay before that '2' in the final string, and vice versa.  The '1's are the wildcards; they can effectively navigate through any '0' or '2'. That's the real insight here.\n\nSo, I start thinking about counts: `count0`, `count1`, and `count2`.  I'm trying to determine the *optimal* arrangement. Since we want lexicographical smallest, I want as many leading '0's as possible, then '1's, then '2's.  I realized it boils down to identifying how to preserve the order of the '0's and '2's. If I remove all the '1's, I am left with a subsequence of '0's and '2's, which determines their relative order. So, `s = \"010210\"`, gives \"0020\". This means in the final string, the '0's must be placed in that same order before the '2's and final '0'.\n\nThe '1's are the variable, and the goal is to slot them into the right places based on the initial ordering of '0's and '2's.  I need to keep the order of '0's and '2's intact while optimizing where the '1's go to minimize the resulting string lexicographically. I have to think about how to use the '1's to separate the '0's and '2's if needed.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means a '0' can move past a '1', and a '1' can move past a '0'.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means a '1' can move past a '2', and a '2' can move past a '1'.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. This implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that same '2' in the final string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must maintain that order.\n\nConsider the '1's. Since '1's can swap with both '0's and '2's, a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or any '2'. This means '1's are highly mobile. They can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's in the string. Let this be `count1`.\n\nNow, consider the string formed by removing all '1's from the original string. This new string will consist only of '0's and '2's. Because '0's and '2's cannot swap, their relative order in the original string must be preserved.\nFor example, if `s = \"010210\"`, removing '1's gives `s_no_ones = \"0020\"`. The final string must contain \"0020\" as a subsequence, in that exact order.\n\nSince '1's can move freely past '0's and '2's, we can effectively \"insert\" all the '1's anywhere into this `s_no_ones` sequence. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nSo, we should place all '1's after all '0's that appear before the first '2' in `s_no_ones`. More specifically, we should place all '1's right before the first '2' encountered in `s_no_ones`. If there are no '2's, we place all '1's at the end.\n\nLet's iterate through the original string `s`:\n1. Collect all '0's that appear before the first '2'.\n2. When we encounter the first '2', we know that all subsequent '0's (if any) cannot move before this '2'. At this point, we should insert all `count1` '1's.\n3. After inserting all '1's, we append the rest of the '0's and '2's from `s_no_ones`.\n\nA simpler approach:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `num_ones`.\n2. Construct a new string `result`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n   - If the current character `char` is '0', append '0' to `result`.\n   - If the current character `char` is '2':\n     - Append all `num_ones` '1's to `result`. This is the optimal place for '1's to make the string lexicographically smallest: after all '0's that can come before any '2', and before any '2's.\n     - Reset `num_ones` to 0 (since they have all been placed).\n     - Append '2' to `result`.\n   - If the current character `char` is '1', do nothing. We are handling all '1's in a batch.\n4. After iterating through the entire string, if `num_ones` is still greater than 0, it means there were no '2's in the string, or all '2's have been processed. In this case, append the remaining `num_ones` '1's to `result`.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2` (from the '1's at index 0 and 4).\n2. `result = \"\"`\n3. Iterate `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Do nothing.\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `result = \"0\"`\n   - `s[2] = '0'`: `result = \"00\"`\n   - `s[3] = '2'`:\n     - Append `num_ones` '1's: `result = \"0011\"`\n     - `num_ones = 0`\n     - Append '2': `result = \"00112\"`\n   - `s[4] = '1'`: Do nothing.\n   - `s[5] = '0'`: `result = \"001120\"`\n4. End of string. `num_ones` is 0.\nFinal `result = \"001120\"`.\n\nThis strategy works because:\n- All '0's appearing before the first '2' in the original string are collected at the beginning of `result`.\n- All '1's are then placed. This ensures they come after those initial '0's.\n- The first '2' is then placed.\n- Any '0's that appeared after the first '2' in the original string will be processed after the '2' has been placed. Since '0's cannot move past '2's, these '0's must appear after the '2' in the final string.\n- Any subsequent '2's are also placed in their original relative order.\n\nThis ensures that the relative order of '0's and '2's is maintained, and all '1's are grouped together and placed at the earliest possible position (after all '0's that can precede any '2', and before any '2's). This yields the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = s.count('1')\n    \n    # Build the result string\n    result_parts = []\n    \n    # Flag to track if we have encountered the first '2'\n    first_two_encountered = False\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            result_parts.append('0')\n        elif char == '2':\n            # When we encounter the first '2', all '1's should be placed before it\n            # This is the point where '0's can no longer move past '2's.\n            # All '1's can move past '0's and '2's, so they should be grouped here\n            # to make the string lexicographically smallest.\n            if not first_two_encountered:\n                result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n                num_ones = 0 # All ones have been placed\n                first_two_encountered = True\n            result_parts.append('2')\n        # If char is '1', we skip it.
