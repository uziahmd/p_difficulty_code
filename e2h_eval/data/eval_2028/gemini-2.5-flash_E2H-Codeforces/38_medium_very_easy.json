    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nMy task is to tackle a competitive programming challenge. I need to figure out two crucial things. First, what's the smallest number of nodes (`n`) needed to create a special type of directed graph called a `p`-reachable graph? And second, in all those smallest graphs, what's the biggest number of unidirectional pairs of nodes I can get?\n\nLet's break down the definitions.  A pair of nodes `(u, v)` is \"reachable from each other\" if there's a path going from `u` to `v` and another path going from `v` back to `u`.  This is the same as being in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC). A graph is `p`-reachable when it has exactly `p` of these \"reachable from each other\" pairs where `u` is less than `v`. It is important to note that the input is exactly p ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. That means that the problem is counting the number of unordered pairs of distinct nodes within an SCC. We only care about pairs where `u < v`.\n\nThe key is this: if you have a group of nodes that are all in the same SCC (let's say there are `k` nodes), the number of such `p`-reachable pairs within that SCC is calculated as `k * (k - 1) / 2`.  So if a graph has SCCs of sizes `k1, k2, ..., km`, then the total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `sum(ki * (ki - 1) / 2)`.\n\nMy initial goal is to find the *minimum* number of nodes, `n`, required. To do this, I need to make the SCCs as large as possible. This is because the `k * (k - 1) / 2` function increases quickly as `k` grows. The largest possible SCC will contain `n` nodes, in that scenario the total `p` is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. To determine the minimum number of nodes, I would need to find the smallest integer `n` such that `n * (n - 1) / 2` is greater than or equal to `p`. This means that `n * (n - 1) / 2 >= p`. I can re-write this as the quadratic `n^2 - n - 2p = 0`, then solve for the positive root and take the ceiling.\n\nLet's test this strategy with a few examples: If `p=0`, then `n=1`.  If `p=1`, then `n=2`.  If `p=3`, then `n=3`.  If `p=6`, then `n=4`.\n\nSo I've now got the minimum `n`. To find the max unidirectional pairs, I want to arrange the SCCs in a line - a chain of SCCs. With this line or chain configuration, every pair of nodes between different SCCs becomes unidirectional. To figure out the count of unidirectional pairs, I'll need to work with the sizes of each SCC.\n\nIn the first part, I created a greedy algorithm to find the value of `n` that minimizes the total number of nodes in the graph and also satisfies the condition on `p`. My strategy is to form SCCs as large as possible. If `k` is the size of the largest possible SCC such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`, then I use that value of `k`, and then iteratively repeat the process to get more SCCs.\n\nNow, my strategy is to maximize unidirectional pairs. I will arrange these SCCs in a chain structure. The number of unidirectional pairs will be the square of `n` minus the sum of the square of each SCC size, `sum(k_i^2)`. I need to minimize `sum(k_i^2)` for that to work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with `n` nodes.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is \"reachable from each other\" if `u \\neq v`, there's a path `u \\to v`, and there's a path `v \\to u`. This means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is \"unidirectional\" if `u \\neq v`, there exists a path `u \\to v`, and there are no paths `v \\to u`. This means `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC in the condensation graph.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nLet a graph consist of `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m`. The total number of nodes is `n = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i`.\nFor any SCC of size `k`, the number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u, v` are in this SCC (and thus reachable from each other) is `k \\cdot (k-1) / 2`.\nThe total `p`-reachable pairs in the graph is `p = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i \\cdot (k_i-1) / 2`.\n\nTo minimize `n` for a given `p`, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and make each SCC as large as possible. This is because `k \\cdot (k-1) / 2` grows quadratically with `k`, meaning larger SCCs are more \"efficient\" at generating `p` pairs per node.\n\nWe can use a greedy strategy:\n1. Start with `n = 0` and an empty list of SCC sizes.\n2. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k \\cdot (k-1) / 2 \\le p`.\n   b. Add `k` to `n` (representing `k` new nodes) and add `k` to our list of SCC sizes.\n   c. Subtract `k \\cdot (k-1) / 2` from `p`.\n3. The final `n` is the minimum number of nodes.\n\nTo find `k` such that `k \\cdot (k-1) / 2 \\le p`:\n`k^2 - k - 2p \\le 0`.\nThe roots of `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` are `(1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2`.\nSince `k > 0`, we are interested in `k = (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2`.\nThe largest integer `k` satisfying the inequality is `\\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. `k = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\cdot 4}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{33}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 5.74) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3.37 \\rfloor = 3`.\n   `n = 3`, `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n   `p = 4 - (3 \\cdot 2 / 2) = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n2. `p = 1`. `k = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\cdot 1}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{9}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 3) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2`.\n   `n = 3 + 2 = 5`, `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`.\n   `p = 1 - (2 \\cdot 1 / 2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\nSince `p = 0`, we stop. Minimum `n = 5`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nLet `n` be the minimum number of nodes found in Part 1, and `k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m` be the sizes of the SCCs determined by the greedy strategy.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange these `m` SCCs in a linear chain in the condensation graph: `S_1 \\to S_2 \\to \\ldots \\to S_m`. We can achieve this by adding edges from every node in `S_i` to every node in `S_{i+1}`. Within each SCC `S_i`, we add edges to make it strongly connected (e.g., a cycle).\n\nIn this chain configuration:\n- For any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` where `i=j`, `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- For any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` where `i < j`, there is a path `u \\to v` but no path `v \\to u`. These are `k_i \\cdot k_j` unidirectional pairs.\n- For any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` where `i > j`, there is a path `v \\to u` but no path `u \\to v`. These are `k_i \\cdot k_j` unidirectional pairs.\n\nIn this configuration, every pair of distinct nodes `(u, v)` is either reachable from each other (if `u, v` are in the same SCC) or unidirectional (if `u, v` are in different SCCs). There are no \"disconnected\" pairs.\nThe total number of ordered pairs of distinct nodes is `n \\cdot (n-1)`.\nThe number of pairs reachable from each other (counting both `(u,v)` and `(v,u)` for `u,v` in the same SCC) is `\\sum_{i=1}^m k_i \\cdot (k_i-1)`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `n \\cdot (n-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i \\cdot (k_i-1)`.\n\nThis can be simplified:\n`n \\cdot (n-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^m (k_i^2 - k_i)`\n`= n^2 - n - (\\sum k_i^2 - \\sum k_i)`\n`= n^2 - n - (\\sum k_i^2 - n)`\n`= n^2 - \\sum k_i^2`.\n\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `n^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i^2`.\nThe greedy strategy for minimizing `n` (which makes one `k_i` large and others smaller) also tends to minimize `\\sum k_i^2` for a fixed sum `n`, but not necessarily. However, in this problem, the `k_i` values are determined by the `p` value, and we must use these specific `k_i` values to achieve `p` with minimum `n`. The chain arrangement maximizes unidirectional pairs for any given set of `k_i` values.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n`n = 5`, `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`.\nMaximum unidirectional pairs = `n^2 - (k_1^2 + k_2^2)`\n`= 5^2 - (3^2 + 2^2)`\n`= 25 - (9 + 4)`\n`= 25 - 13 = 12`.\n\nLet's double check the example outputs:\n- `p = 3`: `n=3, unid_pairs=0`.\n  1. `k = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\cdot 3}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{25}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 5) / 2 \\rfloor = 3`.\n     `n = 3`, `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n     `p = 3 - (3 \\cdot 2 / 2) = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n  Min `n = 3`. `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n  Max unidirectional pairs = `3^2 - 3^2 = 9 - 9 = 0`. Matches example.\n- `p = 4`: `n=5, unid_pairs=12`. Matches our calculation.\n- `p = 0`: `n=0, unid_pairs=0`.\n  1. `k = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\cdot 0}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 1) / 2 \\rfloor = 1`.\n     `n = 1`, `scc_sizes = [1]`.\n     `p = 0 - (1 \\cdot 0 / 2) = 0`.\n  Min `n = 1`. `scc_sizes = [1]`.\n  Max unidirectional pairs = `1^2 - 1^2 = 1 - 1 = 0`. Matches example.\n\nThe logic seems sound.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    min_nodes = 0\n    scc_sizes = []\n\n    # Part 1: Find minimum number of nodes (n) and the sizes of SCCs\n    current_p = p\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # k^2 - k - 2*current_p <= 0\n        # Roots of k^2 - k - 2*current_p = 0 are (1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        # We need the largest integer k <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        k_float = (1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2\n        k = math.floor(k_float)\n        \n        # If k is 0, it means current_p is 0, which should stop the loop.\n        # However, for p=0, k=1.
