Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the problem and the thought process to solve it.**\n\nI'm given a range for integer sides of a triangle:  `x`, `y`, and `z`.  The sides must satisfy `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.  I need to count the non-degenerate triangles that can be formed.  A non-degenerate triangle means that the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side.  Because of the constraints on the ranges of `x`, `y`, and `z`, many of the triangle inequality conditions are automatically satisfied, and so the critical one to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought was to iterate through all possible `x` and `y` values, and then figure out the valid `z` values for each `(x, y)` pair. However, this brute-force approach would be too slow, with a time complexity of potentially O(n^2). So I need to find a more efficient strategy.\n\nSince I know that `x + y > z` is the crucial condition, my thought is to iterate by grouping values of `x+y = k`. This transforms the problem into finding combinations that yield a fixed sum. The minimum possible value for `k` is `A + B`, and the maximum is `B + C`. I can precompute the number of pairs `(x, y)` that produce each `k`.\n\nTo efficiently determine the number of valid pairs for `x + y = k`, I fix `k` and vary `x`. Knowing that `x` is between `A` and `B` and `y` must be between `B` and `C`, I can use the equation `y = k - x` to deduce the possible `x` values for any `k`. The count of such `x` values (and corresponding `y` values) that satisfy the ranges `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C` becomes `count[k]`.\n\nTo quickly compute all of the `count[k]` values, I can use a difference array approach. I pre-calculate a difference array. This is basically a technique for quickly updating a range. By prefix summing this difference array, I can build up the `counts[k]` for all possible `k` very efficiently in O(n) time.\n\nNow, for each `k` between `A+B` and `B+C`, I need to compute the number of possible `z` values. Since `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y = k`, the range is `C <= z < k` or, equivalently, `C <= z <= min(D, k - 1)`. The number of `z` values then is `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nBy iterating through possible values of `k` (from `A+B` to `B+C`) and multiplying `count[k]` by the number of possible `z` values for each `k`, I can sum this to find the total number of non-degenerate triangles. This is the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the triangle inequality conditions:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`:\n- For `y + z > x`: Since `y >= B` and `z >= C`, and `x <= B`, we have `y + z >= B + C`. Since `C >= B >= A`, `B + C >= A + A = 2A`. Also, `x <= B`. If `C >= A`, then `B + C >= A + B >= A + A >= A >= x`. More strictly, `y + z >= B + C`. Since `C >= B`, `B + C >= B + B = 2B`. If `x <= B`, then `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= B >= x` and `z >= C >= B >= 1`. So `y + z >= B + C > B >= x`. This condition is always satisfied.\n- For `x + z > y`: Since `x >= A` and `z >= C`, we have `x + z >= A + C`. Since `y <= C`, and `A >= 1`, we have `A + C > C >= y`. This condition is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`.\n\nCombining all conditions, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (or `z <= x + y - 1`)\n\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, the valid range for `z` is `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive iteration over `x` and `y` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`, which can be up to `(5*10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^11`, too slow.\n\nWe can optimize this by changing the order of summation. Let `k = x + y`.\nThe total count is `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `f(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} f(x + y)`.\n\nLet `counts[k]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = k`.\nThen the total answer is `sum_{k} counts[k] * f(k)`.\n\nThe range of `k = x + y`:\n- Minimum `k`: `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`)\n- Maximum `k`: `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`)\nThe maximum value for `B + C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`. This range for `k` is manageable.\n\nCalculating `counts[k]` efficiently:\nFor each `x` in `[A, B]`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nThis means for a fixed `x`, the sum `x + y` ranges from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nSo, for each `x` in `[A, B]`, we add 1 to `counts[k]` for all `k` in the range `[x + B, x + C]`.\nThis is a range update operation. We can use a difference array:\nInitialize `diff` array of size `B + C + 2` to all zeros.\nFor each `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `diff[x + B] += 1`\n  `diff[x + C + 1] -= 1`\nAfter processing all `x`, compute `counts` array by taking prefix sums of `diff`:\n`counts[k] = counts[k-1] + diff[k]` for `k` from `0` to `B + C + 1`.\nThis step takes `O(B - A + 1)` for updates and `O(B + C)` for prefix sums, total `O(B + C)`.\n\nCalculating the final sum:\nIterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`.\nFor each `k`, calculate `num_z = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nAdd `counts[k] * num_z` to the total.\nNote that for `num_z` to be positive, we must have `min(D, k - 1) >= C`.\nThis means `k - 1 >= C`, or `k >= C + 1`.\nSo, the loop for `k` should actually run from `max(A + B, C + 1)` to `B + C`.\nWithin this range, `k - 1 >= C`, so `min(D, k - 1)` will be at least `C`.\nThus `min(D, k - 1) - C + 1` will always be at least `1` (since `D >= C`). So `max(0, ...)` is not strictly needed in the loop, as `num_z` will always be positive.\n\nThe overall time complexity will be `O(B + C)`, which is `O(2 * max_val) = O(10^6)`. This is efficient enough.\n\nExample walkthrough (`A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`):\n1. Determine `MAX_K`: `B + C = 2 + 3 = 5`. `diff` and `counts` arrays will be sized up to `5 + 2 = 7`.\n2. Initialize `diff = [0] * 7`.\n3. Populate `diff` array:\n   - For `x=1`: `diff[1+2]` (`diff[3]`) `+= 1`, `diff[1+3+1]` (`diff[5]`) `-= 1`.\n     `diff = [0,0,0,1,0,-1,0]`\n   - For `x=2`: `diff[2+2]` (`diff[4]`) `+= 1`, `diff[2+3+1]` (`diff[6]`) `-= 1`.\n     `diff = [0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1]`\n4. Calculate `counts` array (prefix sums of `diff`):\n   `counts = [0,0,0,1,2,1,0]`\n   (e.g., `counts[3]=1`, `counts[4]=1+1=2`, `counts[5]=2-1=1`, `counts[6]=1-1=0`)\n5. Calculate total triangles:\n   `total_triangles = 0`.\n   Loop `k` from `max(A+B, C+1)` to `B+C`.\n   `A+B = 1+2 = 3`. `C+1 = 3+1 = 4`. So `k` from `max(3,4)=4` to `B+C=5`.\n   - For `k=4`:\n     `num_z = min(D, k-1) - C + 1 = min(4, 4-1) - 3 + 1 = min(4,3) - 3 + 1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`.\n     `total_triangles += counts[4] * num_z = 2 * 1 = 2`.\n   - For `k=5`:\n     `num_z = min(D, k-1) - C + 1 = min(4, 5-1) - 3 + 1 = min(4,4) - 3 + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2`.\n     `total_triangles += counts[5] * num_z = 1 * 2 = 2`.\n   Final `total_triangles = 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Maximum possible sum for x+y is B+C.\n    # A, B, C, D <= 5 * 10^5.
