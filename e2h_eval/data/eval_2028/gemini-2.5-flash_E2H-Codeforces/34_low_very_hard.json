And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time Over K-Day Weeks**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the average sleep time in this Berland scenario. I've got the parameters: `n`, the total number of days; `k`, the length of a \"week\"; and `a`, a list representing the sleep time on each day. The challenge is clear: I need to calculate the average sleep time over *all* possible `k`-day weeks, and the example is confusing.\n\nFirst, I need to define what a \"week\" actually is. A week consists of `k` consecutive days. The first week starts on day 1, the second on day 2, and so on, up to a week that starts on day `n - k + 1`. This gives me a total of `n - k + 1` weeks to consider.\n\nFor each of these weeks, I need to calculate the average sleep time. That's simply the sum of the sleep times for those `k` days, divided by `k`.  Then, I'll need to average the averages.\n\nThe confusing part comes from the example given:  `k=2, n=3, a=[3, 4, 7]`. If I follow the standard \"average of averages\" approach, I get `(3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 4.5`. The example shows `9.0`.  This tells me that I misread the specification! It must be some other calculation.\n\nNow, I think about this. The problem wants a single number as the solution. So, in the example, is it the sum of sleep hours in the weeks and then not doing any average calculations? Is it (3+4+7) as per the example. No. The example says average. I think it means sum of sleep times for all days in all weeks. Let me try this. Maybe there is something implied in the example.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible `k`-day weeks. There are `n - k + 1` such weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times for its `k` days. The final answer is the sum of all these weekly sums, divided by `n - k + 1` (the total number of weeks), and then divided by `k` (the number of days in a week).\n\nLet's denote the given sleep times as `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\nThe `j`-th week (0-indexed) consists of days `a_j, a_{j+1}, ..., a_{j+k-1}`.\nThe sum of sleep times for the `j`-th week is `S_j = a_j + a_{j+1} + ... + a_{j+k-1}`.\nThere are `N_w = n - k + 1` such weeks, starting from `j=0` up to `j=n-k`.\n\nThe overall average is `( (S_0/k) + (S_1/k) + ... + (S_{n-k}/k) ) / N_w`.\nThis can be simplified to `(S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}) / (N_w * k)`.\n\nThe sum `S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}` can be computed efficiently.\nNotice that `S_j` is a sliding window sum. We can use a prefix sum array to calculate each `S_j` in O(1) time after an initial O(n) preprocessing step.\nLet `P[i]` be the sum of `a_1` through `a_i`. `P[0] = 0`.\nThen `S_j = P[j+k] - P[j]`. (Using 1-based indexing for `P` and `a`, and 0-based for `j`).\nIf we use 0-based indexing for `a` and `P`: `P[i]` is sum of `a[0]` through `a[i-1]`. `P[0]=0`.\nThen `S_j = P[j+k] - P[j]`.\n\nThe total sum of all `S_j` values would be `sum_total = sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (P[j+k] - P[j])`.\nThe final average is `sum_total / ( (n - k + 1) * k )`.\n\nConstraints: `n <= 2 * 10^5`, `a_i <= 10^5`.\nThe maximum sum for a single week `S_j` would be `k * max(a_i) = 2 * 10^5 * 10^5 = 2 * 10^{10}`. This fits in a 64-bit integer.\nThe total sum `sum_total` would be approximately `n * k * max(a_i)`.\nMore precisely, `sum_total` is `(n - k + 1)` times the average `S_j`.\nThe maximum `sum_total` could be `(n - k + 1) * k * max(a_i)`.\nIf `k` is small, `n-k+1` is close to `n`. So `n * k * max(a_i)` could be `2 * 10^5 * 2 * 10^5 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^{15}`. This also fits within a standard 64-bit integer type (like Python's arbitrary-precision integers or `long long` in C++).\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Read the `n` sleep times into a list `a`.\n3. Create a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` of size `n+1`. `prefix_sum[0] = 0`. For `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.\n4. Initialize `total_sum_of_weeks = 0`.\n5. Iterate `j` from `0` to `n-k`:\n   a. Calculate the sum for the `j`-th week: `current_week_sum = prefix_sum[j+k] - prefix_sum[j]`.\n   b. Add `current_week_sum` to `total_sum_of_weeks`.\n6. Calculate the overall average: `result = total_sum_of_weeks / ( (n - k + 1) * k )`.\n7. Print `result` with sufficient precision.\n\nExample: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n1. `n=3, k=2`.\n2. `a = [3, 4, 7]`.\n3. `prefix_sum = [0, 3, 7, 14]`.\n4. `total_sum_of_weeks = 0`.\n5. Iterate `j` from `0` to `3-2 = 1`:\n   - `j = 0`: `current_week_sum = prefix_sum[0+2] - prefix_sum[0] = prefix_sum[2] - prefix_sum[0] = 7 - 0 = 7`.\n     `total_sum_of_weeks = 0 + 7 = 7`.\n   - `j = 1`: `current_week_sum = prefix_sum[1+2] - prefix_sum[1] = prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1] = 14 - 3 = 11`.\n     `total_sum_of_weeks = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n6. `result = 18 / ( (3 - 2 + 1) * 2 ) = 18 / (2 * 2) = 18 / 4 = 4.5`.\n   The example output is `9.0000000000`. This suggests the problem statement has a subtle interpretation. The example output `9.0000000000` is `(3+4+7)/ (2/2) * (2/2) ...`?\n   Let's re-read: \"To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n   The example output `9.0` for `[3,4,7]` with `k=2` implies the sum of all elements in all windows, divided by `n-k+1`.\n   For `[3,4,7]` and `k=2`:\n   Week 1: `[3,4]`. Sum = 7.\n   Week 2: `[4,7]`. Sum = 11.\n   Total sum of all elements in all windows = `7 + 11 = 18`.\n   Number of windows `n-k+1 = 3-2+1 = 2`.\n   Average = `18 / 2 = 9`.\n   This interpretation means we sum up all `S_j` values and divide by `n-k+1`. The individual division by `k` for each week is implicitly handled by the total count of days.\n   So the formula would be `(S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}) / (n - k + 1)`.\n   This is equivalent to `(sum of all elements in all windows) / (number of windows)`.\n   This is a common way to average averages when the denominator for each average is the same.\n\nLet's verify with the second example: `n=1, k=1, a=[10]`\n   `prefix_sum = [0, 10]`\n   `j` from `0` to `1-1 = 0`:\n   `j=0`: `current_week_sum = prefix_sum[0+1] - prefix_sum[0] = 10 - 0 = 10`.\n   `total_sum_of_weeks = 10`.\n   `result = 10 / ( (1 - 1 + 1) ) = 10 / 1 = 10.0`. This matches the example output.\n\nLet's verify with the third example: `n=8, k=2, a=[1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]`\n   `prefix_sum = [0, 1, 3, 7, 100007, 100130, 100586, 101375, 101376]`\n   `n-k+1 = 8-2+1 = 7` weeks.\n   `total_sum_of_weeks = 0`\n   `j=0`: `prefix_sum[2]-prefix_sum[0] = 3-0=3`\n   `j=1`: `prefix_sum[3]-prefix_sum[1] = 7-1=6`\n   `j=2`: `prefix_sum[4]-prefix_sum[2] = 100007-3=100004`\n   `j=3`: `prefix_sum[5]-prefix_sum[3] = 100130-7=100123`\n   `j=4`: `prefix_sum[6]-prefix_sum[4] = 100586-100007=579`\n   `j=5`: `prefix_sum[7]-prefix_sum[5] = 101375-100130=1245`\n   `j=6`: `prefix_sum[8]-prefix_sum[6] = 101376-100586=790`\n   `total_sum_of_weeks = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 202750`\n   `result = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...` This matches the example output.\n\nThe interpretation `(sum of all elements in all windows) / (number of windows)` is correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate prefix sums\n    # prefix_sum[i] will store the sum of a[0]...a[i-1]\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]\n\n    total_sum_of_all_windows = 0\n\n    # Iterate through all possible starting positions for a k-day week\n    # A week starting at index j will end at index j+k-1\n    # The last possible starting index is n-k\n    for j in range(n - k + 1):\n        # Sum for the current k-day week (from index j to j+k-1)\n        # This is prefix_sum[j+k] - prefix_sum[j]\n        current_week_sum = prefix_sum[j+k] - prefix_sum[j]\n        total_sum_of_all_windows += current_week_sum\n\n    # The total number of k-day weeks is n - k + 1\n    number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n    # Calculate the overall average\n    # This is the sum of all elements across all windows, divided by the number of windows\n    average_sleep_time = total_sum_of_all_windows / number_of_weeks\n\n    # Output the result with required precision\n    print(f\"{average_sleep_time:.10f}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
