After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this \"Marks\" problem. This seems like a straightforward competitive programming challenge, and I've got a solid plan to implement it in Python.**\n\nFirst off, I need to get the gist of the problem: there are students, subjects, and marks. A student is deemed \"successful\" if they score the highest mark in at least one subject. My goal is to count these successful students.\n\nThe input format is clear: number of students and subjects followed by the marks. The output is a single integer representing the count.  The constraints (n, m <= 100) are very friendly, which makes any O(n*m) or O(n^2*m) algorithm a viable option, avoiding worries about time complexity.\n\nThe first instinct is to build an algorithm that finds the maximum mark for each subject and then compare each student's mark with those subject maximums. This leads to a concise and efficient solution:\n\n1.  **Input Reading:** I need to grab `n` and `m` and the grades (which, in the problem, are single characters, so I will initially read as strings and then convert to integers).\n2.  **Max Mark Calculation:** A simple nested loop to scan the gradebook and find the max mark for each subject. I will store them in `max_marks_per_subject`.\n3.  **Success Determination:** I can iterate through each student and subject, comparing the student's mark with the max for that subject. If a match is found, the student is successful.\n4.  **Count and Output:** I can simply count the number of successful students.\n\nLooking at Python specifics, it is straightforward to construct this algorithm, the code will be very clean. The `max()` function will be handy. I also can use a boolean array or a set to keep track of successful students. A boolean array will be simpler in this case.\n\nI will test it on the example given to ensure everything works correctly. It is good to run through a few examples, so I will test a few other edge cases. I'll make sure there are no issues with formatting or off-by-one errors. The code I provide should then handle any valid input efficiently and be correct according to the problem description.\n\nI'm confident this solution will be fast and meet all the requirements. It's a classic example of breaking down a problem into manageable steps and then coding it up efficiently.",
