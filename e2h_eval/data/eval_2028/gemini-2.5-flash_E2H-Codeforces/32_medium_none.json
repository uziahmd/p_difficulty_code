    "thought": "**Array Stabilization: My Strategy**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"Array Stabilization\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it.  The goal is to remove *one* element from an array of integers and minimize the \"instability,\" which is just the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the *remaining* elements. The input is an array, `a`, of `n` integers. The constraint here is that `2 <= n <= 10^5`, and each element `a_i` is between `1` and `10^5`.\n\nFirst things first, I want to understand what \"instability\" really means in a simplified way.  The instability of an array is just `max(a) - min(a)`. So, the problem boils down to picking *which* element to remove such that the remaining array has the smallest possible difference between its largest and smallest elements.\n\nNow, I started thinking about the impact of removing an element. Clearly, the way to minimize the difference is to try to make the maximum as small as possible and the minimum as large as possible.\n\nHere's my key insight: *sorting* the array. If I sort the array, let's call it `a_sorted`, from smallest to largest, the original instability is just `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]`. If I remove an element, the new minimum will be either `a_sorted[0]` or `a_sorted[1]`, and the new maximum will be either `a_sorted[n-1]` or `a_sorted[n-2]`. Removing any other element in between just results in the original instability.\n\nTherefore, the only two relevant scenarios are:\n\n1.  Remove the smallest element (`a_sorted[0]`). The new instability would be `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]`.\n2.  Remove the largest element (`a_sorted[n-1]`). The new instability would be `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]`.\n\nTo find the absolute minimum instability, I would just compare the results from these two scenarios and return the smaller one.\n\nThe edge case here is when `n=2`. In this case, removing either element results in an empty array, and the instability is `0`. I have checked this logic, and it gives the right answer. I should be fine.\n\nNow for the implementation. It'll be a Python script that reads the input from `stdin`, which is standard input, and prints the result to `stdout`, the standard output. The code should be pretty straightforward. I would read the input, sort the array, calculate the instabilities for both the scenarios described above, and print the minimum instability.\n\nFinally, I checked the time and space complexity. Sorting will take `O(N log N)` time, and the rest is `O(1)`, so the overall time complexity is `O(N log N)`. Space complexity is `O(N)` for the sorted array. Given the constraints (`n <= 10^5`), this is very efficient.\n\nI am confident that the sorting-based approach will be fast enough, it's elegant, and it's easy to code. Time to write the code.\n",
