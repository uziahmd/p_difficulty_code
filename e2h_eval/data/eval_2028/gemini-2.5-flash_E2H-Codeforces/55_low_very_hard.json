    "thought": "**Deconstructing the String Rearrangement Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this string and a set of swap rules, and the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string achievable through those swaps. My initial thought is to break down the rules and see what constraints they impose.\n\nFirst, I see I can swap '0' and '1', and '1' and '2', but not '0' and '2'. This immediately suggests I need to think about how these constraints affect the relative order of the characters.\n\nI realize that '0's and '1's are essentially interchangeable within their group, as are '1's and '2's.  Essentially, '0's and '1's can be freely rearranged, and '1's and '2's can also be freely rearranged. But, crucially, '0's and '2's *cannot* change their relative positions. This is the key insight.\n\nI'm thinking, \"if I have a '0' before a '2' in the original string, they must remain in that order in the final, lexicographically smallest string.\"  The implication is that '0's and '2's act as barriers to each other. I'm essentially partitioning the string into these \"fixed\" blocks. '1's are the mobile element; they can navigate around the '0' and '2' blocks.\n\nSo, I need to focus on two things: preserving the relative order of '0's and '2's, and optimizing the placement of the '1's to make the string as small as possible. I'm essentially building a sorted list of each group and ensuring a valid configuration within each one.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and vice versa.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot directly swap. Can they swap indirectly?\nConsider a '0' and a '2'. If there are '1's between them, say \"012\".\n- \"012\" -> \"102\" (0-1 swap)\n- \"012\" -> \"021\" (1-2 swap)\nIn \"102\", the '0' is still to the left of '2'. In \"021\", the '0' is still to the left of '2'.\nIt seems that a '0' can never move past a '2', and a '2' can never move past a '0'.\nThis implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. If `s[i] == '0'` and `s[j] == '2'` with `i < j`, then in any reachable string, the '0' originally at `i` must still appear before the '2' originally at `j`. The same applies if `j < i`.\n\nThis means that '0's and '2's act as \"barriers\" to each other. However, '1's are highly mobile. A '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'. This means all '1's can effectively be grouped together and moved anywhere relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then as many '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's in the input string. Let this be `count_ones`.\nAll these `count_ones` can be moved together. Where should they be placed?\n\nConsider the original string `s`. We can iterate through it and build the resulting string.\nWe want to put '0's first. Any '0' can move past any '1'. So, all '0's can be moved to the left of all '1's.\nHowever, a '0' cannot move past a '2'.\n\nLet's process the input string `s`.\nWe will build the output string `res`.\nIterate through `s`:\n1. If `s[i]` is '0': Append '0' to `res`.\n2. If `s[i]` is '2': This '2' acts as a barrier. All '0's that appear after this '2' in `s` cannot move to the left of this '2'. All '1's that appear before this '2' can move to its right.\n   Since we want the lexicographically smallest string, we should place all '1's that can possibly move to the left of this '2' *before* this '2'.\n   All '1's are mobile. They can move past '0's and '2's. The only constraint is the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n   This means all '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as the relative order of '0's and '2's is maintained.\n\nLet's try a simpler approach based on the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n1. Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string, keeping their relative order. Let this sequence be `s_02`.\n   For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `s_02 = \"0020\"`.\n2. Count all '1's in the input string. Let this be `num_ones`.\n   For `s = \"100210\"`, `num_ones = 2`.\n\nNow, we need to insert the `num_ones` '1's into `s_02` to get the lexicographically smallest string.\nTo make a string lexicographically smallest, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nAll '0's in `s_02` must appear before any '2's that they originally preceded.\nAll '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\nTo minimize the string, we should place all '1's after all '0's and before all '2's, if possible.\n\nConsider the string `s_02`.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n`s_02 = \"0020\"`\n`num_ones = 2`\n\nWe iterate through `s_02` and build the result.\nWhen we encounter a '0', we append '0' to the result.\nWhen we encounter a '2', this is the first '2' in the `s_02` sequence. All '1's can be moved to the left of this '2', because '1's can swap with '0's and '1's can swap with '2's.\nThus, all `num_ones` should be placed right before the *first* '2' in `s_02`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_chars`.\n2. Initialize `num_ones = 0`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`:\n   - If `char` is '0', append '0' to `result_chars`.\n   - If `char` is '1', increment `num_ones`.\n   - If `char` is '2':\n     - Append all `num_ones` (as '1's) to `result_chars`.\n     - Reset `num_ones = 0`.\n     - Append '2' to `result_chars`.\n4. After iterating through `s`, if there are any remaining `num_ones` (this happens if `s` ends with '0's or '1's, or contains no '2's after the last '1'), append them to `result_chars`.\n5. Join `result_chars` to form the final string.\n\nLet's trace with examples:\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `result_chars = []`, `num_ones = 0`\n2. `s[0] = '1'`: `num_ones = 1`\n3. `s[1] = '0'`: `result_chars.append('0')` -> `['0']`\n4. `s[2] = '0'`: `result_chars.append('0')` -> `['0', '0']`\n5. `s[3] = '2'`:\n   - Append `num_ones` '1's: `result_chars.extend(['1'] * 1)` -> `['0', '0', '1']`\n   - `num_ones = 0`\n   - `result_chars.append('2')` -> `['0', '0', '1', '2']`\n6. `s[4] = '1'`: `num_ones = 1`\n7. `s[5] = '0'`: `result_chars.append('0')` -> `['0', '0', '1', '2', '0']`\n8. End of string. Remaining `num_ones = 1`.\n   - Append `num_ones` '1's: `result_chars.extend(['1'] * 1)` -> `['0', '0', '1', '2', '0', '1']`\n   Wait, this doesn't match the example output `001120`. My logic for step 8 is wrong.\n   The '1's should be inserted *before* the first '2'.\n   The '1's that appear *after* a '2' in the input string *cannot* move to the left of that '2' if that '2' is the *first* '2'.\n   The key insight is that *all* '1's can move past *any* '0' and *any* '2'. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\n   If all '1's can be grouped, where should they be placed?\n   They should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's.\n   The only constraint is the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nCorrected approach:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the string `s`. Let this be `total_ones`.\n2. Construct a new string `s_without_ones` by removing all '1's from `s`.\n3. To get the lexicographically smallest string, we want to put all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n   The relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n   So, we iterate through `s_without_ones`.\n   When we encounter a '0', we append it to the result.\n   When we encounter a '2', this is the point where we should insert all `total_ones`. Why? Because all '0's that come *before* this '2' in `s_without_ones` can be placed before the '1's. All '2's that come *after* this '2' in `s_without_ones` must come after the '1's. This single '2' acts as the first '2' that '1's cannot cross to the left of.\n   So, we append all `total_ones` '1's right before the *first* '2' encountered in `s_without_ones`. If there are no '2's, all '1's go at the end.\n\nAlgorithm (Revised):\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_chars`.\n2. Initialize `total_ones = 0`.\n3. Find the index of the first '2' in `s`. Let this be `first_two_idx`. If no '2' is present, `first_two_idx` can be considered `len(s)`.\n4. Iterate through `s`:\n   - If `char` is '1', increment `total_ones`.\n   - If `char` is '0', append '0' to `result_chars`.\n   - If `char` is '2', append '2' to `result_chars`.\n   (This step essentially reconstructs `s_without_ones` into `result_chars`)\n5. Now, `result_chars` contains all '0's and '2's in their original relative order. We need to insert `total_ones` '1's.\n   Iterate through `result_chars` to find the first occurrence of '2'.\n   If a '2' is found at index `k`, insert `total_ones` '1's at this index `k`.\n   If no '2' is found, append `total_ones` '1's at the end of `result_chars`.\n6. Join `result_chars` to form the final string.\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `total_ones = 0`\n2. `s` contains two '1's, so `total_ones = 2`.\n3. `s_without_ones` (conceptually) is \"0020\".\n4. `result_chars` will initially be `['0', '0', '2', '0']`.\n5. Find first '2' in `result_chars`: it's at index 2.\n   Insert `total_ones` (2) '1's at index 2:\n   `result_chars.insert(2, '1')` -> `['0', '0', '1', '2', '0']`\n   `result_chars.insert(2, '1')` -> `['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`\n6. Join: `\"001120\"`. This matches the example output!\n\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `total_ones = 0`\n2. `s` contains four '1's, so `total_ones = 4`.\n3. `s_without_ones` (conceptually) is \"2222\".\n4. `result_chars` will initially be `['2', '2', '2', '2']`.\n5. Find first '2' in `result_chars`: it's at index 0.\n   Insert `total_ones` (4) '1's at index 0:\n   `result_chars.insert(0, '1')` (four times) -> `['1', '1', '1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '2']`\n6. Join: `\"11112222\"`. This matches the example output!\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `total_ones = 0`\n2. `s` contains zero '1's, so `total_ones = 0`.\n3. `s_without_ones` (conceptually) is \"20\".\n4. `result_chars` will initially be `['2', '0']`.\n5. Find first '2' in `result_chars`: it's at index 0.\n   Insert `total_ones` (0) '1's at index 0. No '1's are inserted.\n6. Join: `\"20\"`. This matches the example output!\n\nExample 4: `s = \"000\"` (no '1's, no '2's)\n1. `total_ones = 0`.\n2. `result_chars` will be `['0', '0', '0']`.\n3. No '2's found. Append `total_ones` (0) '1's at the end.\n4. Join: `\"000\"`. Correct.\n\nExample 5: `s = \"111\"` (only '1's)\n1. `total_ones = 3`.\n2. `result_chars` will be `[]`.\n3. No '2's found. Append `total_ones` (3) '1's at the end.\n   `result_chars.extend(['1'] * 3)` -> `['1', '1', '1']`\n4. Join: `\"111\"`. Correct.\n\nThis revised algorithm seems correct and covers all cases.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Using a list of characters for `result_chars` and then `\"\".join()` at the end is efficient for string building in Python.\n- Finding the first '2' in `s` can be done with `s.find('2')`. If not found, it returns -1.\n- In step 5, we can find the insertion point for '1's by iterating through the `result_chars` list.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    total_ones = 0\n    # Store '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n    # This list will eventually hold '0's, then '1's, then '2's\n    # but initially, it holds '0's and '2's without '1's.\n    chars_without_ones = [] \n\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            total_ones += 1\n        else:\n            chars_without_ones.append(char_s)\n    \n    # Find the insertion point for all '1's.\n    # All '1's should be placed before the first '2' in the sequence of '0's and '2's.\n    # If there are no '2's, they go at the very end.\n    \n    insert_idx = len(chars_without_ones) # Default to end if no '2' is found\n    for i, char_c in enumerate(chars_without_ones):\n        if char_c == '2':\n            insert_idx = i\n            break\n            \n    # Construct the final result string\n    result_list = []\n    # Add '0's and '2's up to the insertion point\n    result_list.extend(chars_without_ones[:insert_idx])\n    # Add all '1's\n    result_list.extend(['1'] * total_ones)\n    # Add remaining '0's and '2's after the insertion point\n    result_list.extend(chars_without_ones[insert_idx:])\n    \n    print(\"\".join(result_list))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
