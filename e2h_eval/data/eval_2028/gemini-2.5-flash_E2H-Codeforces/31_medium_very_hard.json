Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya's Card Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this card problem. The core is straightforward: find the fewest cards to make a sum of zero. I need a Python script for this.\n\n**Breaking it Down:**\n\n1.  **Current Sum:** First, I'll calculate the sum (S) of the cards Vanya already has.\n2.  **Target Sum:** The goal is a zero sum.\n3.  **The Difference:** The cards I need must total -S.\n4.  **Minimization:** The key is using the *fewest* new cards. Each new card can be any integer from -x to x.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nTo minimize cards, make each card contribute its *maximum* possible value toward the target.\n\n*   If the target (-S) is positive, use cards with the value x.\n*   If the target (-S) is negative, use cards with the value -x.\n*   If the sum is already zero, the answer is zero.\n\n**The General Solution:**\n\nI need to add `abs(S)` to get to zero. Each card can add a maximum of `x` (in absolute terms). The minimum cards required is `ceil(abs(S) / x)`.\n\n**Math & Optimization:**\n\nIn integer arithmetic,  `ceil(a / b)` can be calculated as `(a + b - 1) // b` which gives the minimum integer result in divisions. Using `math.ceil` is also valid. Integer division avoids float overhead, so it's a good choice for this problem.\n\n**Code and Implementation:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `x`.\n2.  Read the `n` cards, calculate the sum `S`.\n3.  Calculate `abs(S)`.\n4.  If `abs(S)` is zero, the answer is 0.\n5.  Otherwise, the answer is `(abs(S) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\nThe math and logic is sound. Let's code it up and ensure the edge cases are covered. I've considered and avoided potential issues with integer overflow. The problem statement's \"very hard\" note seems misleading. The actual solution is a clear, optimized, O(n) solution.

    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found and new) is zero. Vanya can find any card with an integer value between `-x` and `x` (inclusive).\n\nHere's the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the current sum:** First, sum up all the numbers on the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `S`.\n\n2.  **Determine the target sum for new cards:** Vanya wants the final total sum to be zero. If the current sum is `S`, then the sum of the *new* cards he finds must be `-S` to make the total sum `S + (-S) = 0`.\n\n3.  **Minimize the number of new cards:** We need to achieve a target sum of `-S` using the minimum possible number of new cards. Each new card can have an integer value from `[-x, x]`. To minimize the number of cards, each card should contribute as much as possible towards the absolute value of the target sum.\n    *   If `-S` is positive, Vanya should pick cards with the value `x` as many times as possible.\n    *   If `-S` is negative, Vanya should pick cards with the value `-x` as many times as possible.\n    *   In both cases, each additional card contributes `x` to the absolute value of the sum being formed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum cards:** The absolute value of the sum that needs to be made up by new cards is `abs(-S)`, which is simply `abs(S)`. Since each new card can contribute at most `x` to this absolute sum, the minimum number of cards required is `abs(S)` divided by `x`, rounded up to the nearest whole number (ceiling division).\n\n    *   If `abs(S)` is 0, it means the current sum is already zero, so no new cards are needed. The answer is 0.\n    *   Otherwise, the number of cards is `ceil(abs(S) / x)`. In integer arithmetic, for positive integers `a` and `b`, `ceil(a / b)` can be calculated as `(a + b - 1) // b`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 3`, `x = 2`\nCards: `-1, 1, 2`\nCurrent sum `S = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\nAbsolute sum needed `abs(S) = 2`.\nMaximum value per card `x = 2`.\nMinimum cards = `(2 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`. (Vanya needs one card with -2)\n\n**Example 2:**\n`n = 2`, `x = 3`\nCards: `-2, -2`\nCurrent sum `S = -2 + (-2) = -4`.\nAbsolute sum needed `abs(S) = 4`.\nMaximum value per card `x = 3`.\nMinimum cards = `(4 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2`.
