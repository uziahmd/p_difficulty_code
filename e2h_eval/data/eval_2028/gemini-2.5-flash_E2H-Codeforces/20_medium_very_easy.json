For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding and Counting Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out how many ways we can pick `c_s` values so that the biggest possible \"beautiful multiset\" has exactly size `f`.  First, I've got to understand what a beautiful multiset actually *is*. Basically, it's a bunch of binary strings, and for any string `s`, the count of strings in the multiset that start with `s` can't go over `c_s`.\n\nThe strings form a prefix tree. The total size of the multiset is just how many strings there are in it, which can be thought of as `count('')`, where '' is the empty string at the root of the tree. The whole thing can be thought of as a min-cut or max-flow problem: I want to maximize the total number of strings while satisfying those prefix count limits.\n\nI'm thinking dynamic programming, working from the leaves of the tree up to the root. If I'm at a node, that means a string `s`, and its children are strings `s0` and `s1`. The number of strings that start with `s` is the number that start with `s0` plus the number that start with `s1`. So the idea is that `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`. And for the leaves, `dp[s] = c_s`. The size of the multiset is `dp['0'] + dp['1']`.\n\nBut then it hits me: the problem uses the phrase \"strings of length 1 to n\". So, I have to compute `dp['0'] + dp['1']` where `0` and `1` are the single characters, so I go from `L=1` to `L=n`.\n\nI'm going to set `dp[L][idx]` the total number of combinations to choose `c_s` values for all strings so that the total size of multiset rooted by string `idx` and length `L` is `val`. Base case, when `L=n`, `dp[n][idx] = c_s`. And I keep this calculation for `L = n-1` down to `L=1`. Total maximum size of multiset is `dp[1][0] + dp[1][1]`. The problem then asks for how many different choices of `c_s` would produce a `max_size` equal to `f`.\n\nThe range of `c_s` is from 0 to `k`. Each `c_s` can be chosen in `k+1` ways, so a quick calculation gives me an impossible number of choices, so I need another approach.\n\nI'm realizing there's a limit to how big `f` can get: It's `k * 2^(n-1)`. I get a pattern using dynamic programming. If I set all `c_s` values to `k`, the maximum size for each prefix is also `k`. Now the problem asks for the *number* of ways to obtain an `f`.\n\nI'm going to define a new `dp` and a new `num_ways`. `dp_val[L][idx]` as the max size, and `num_ways[L][val]` is the number of ways. It's a bit complicated, so I need to simplify.\n\nI'm going to keep it a tree DP.\nI'm going to look at each node, where `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`, and I'm going to call `N_L = 2^L` the number of nodes at level `L`. For each `dp` value, I'm going to assign the number of ways to pick `c_t` values.\n\nThis looks like a *very* standard tree DP. Now, let `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose the `c_s` values for a *single* subtree to get a `dp` of `val`.\nThe base case: If the node is a leaf, then `dp[n][val] = 1` if `val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\nRecursively, for node `s`, I compute the `ways_sum` which is a convolution of `dp[L+1]` with itself (the convolution representing all combinations for the two children), then I can find the total number of ways.\nThis gives `dp[L][val] = P[val] * max(0, k - val + 1) + suffix_sum[val+1]`.\n\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of `c_s` values.\nLet `dp[s]` be the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe base cases are for strings `s` of length `n` (the leaves of the prefix tree):\n`dp[s] = c_s` for any string `s` of length `n`.\nFor a string `s` of length `L < n`, its children are `s0` and `s1`. The number of strings prefixed by `s` is the sum of strings prefixed by `s0` and `s1`. Additionally, this count cannot exceed `c_s`. Thus, the recurrence relation is:\n`dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])` for `1 <= L < n`.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `dp['0'] + dp['1']`.\n\nNotice that all strings `s` of the same length `L` are structurally equivalent in how their `dp` values are calculated, assuming their `c_s` values and their children's `dp` values are chosen independently. This suggests a dynamic programming approach on the levels of the tree.\n\nLet `count_ways[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_t` values for all strings `t` in the subtree rooted at an arbitrary string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that `dp[s]` evaluates to `val`.\nThe maximum possible value for `dp[s]` is `k` (since `c_s <= k`). So `val` ranges from `0` to `k`.\n\nWe compute `count_ways[L]` for `L` from `n` down to `1`.\n\n**Base Case: `L = n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `dp[s] = c_s`. To make `dp[s] = val`, we must choose `c_s = val`.\nSince `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is `1` way to choose `c_s = val` if `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` ways otherwise.\nSo, `count_ways[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `L < n`**\nTo compute `count_ways[L][val_L]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`. Its `dp` value is `val_L = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nLet `v0 = dp[s0]` and `v1 = dp[s1]`. Let `S = v0 + v1`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v0` for `s0` is `count_ways[L+1][v0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v1` for `s1` is `count_ways[L+1][v1]`.\nSince the choices for `s0`'s subtree and `s1`'s subtree are independent, the number of ways to achieve `v0` and `v1` simultaneously is `count_ways[L+1][v0] * count_ways[L+1][v1]`.\n\nFirst, let's compute `ways_sum[S]`, the total number of ways to get `dp[s0] + dp[s1] = S`.\n`ways_sum[S] = sum_{v0+v1=S, 0<=v0,v1<=k} (count_ways[L+1][v0] * count_ways[L+1][v1])`.\nThis is a polynomial convolution. If `P_{L+1}(x) = sum_{val=0}^k count_ways[L+1][val] * x^{val}`, then `ways_sum[S]` is the coefficient of `x^S` in `P_{L+1}(x)^2`.\nThe maximum value `S` can take is `2k`. So `ways_sum` is an array of size `2k+1`. This convolution can be efficiently computed using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\n\nNext, for each `S` (from `0` to `2k`), we need to consider how `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) affects `val_L = min(c_s, S)`.\n1. If `val_L < S`: This implies `c_s = val_L`. There is `1` way to choose `c_s` as `val_L`. This is valid if `0 <= val_L <= k`.\n2. If `val_L = S`: This implies `c_s >= S`. There are `k - S + 1` ways to choose `c_s` (i.e., `S, S+1, ..., k`). This is valid if `0 <= S <= k`. If `S > k`, `c_s` cannot be `>= S` and `<= k`, so there are `0` ways.\n\nCombining these, for a specific `val_L` (where `0 <= val_L <= k`):\n`count_ways[L][val_L] = (ways_sum[val_L] * max(0, k - val_L + 1))`\n                      `+ sum_{S=val_L+1}^{2k} ways_sum[S]`.\nThe sum `sum_{S=val_L+1}^{2k} ways_sum[S]` can be computed efficiently using suffix sums. Let `suffix_ways_sum[x] = sum_{S=x}^{2k} ways_sum[S]`.\nThen `count_ways[L][val_L] = (ways_sum[val_L] * max(0, k - val_L + 1) + suffix_ways_sum[val_L+1]) % MOD`.\n\nWe iterate this process `n-1` times, starting with `count_ways[n]` and computing `count_ways[n-1]`, then `count_ways[n-2]`, ..., down to `count_ways[1]`.\n\n**Final Step: Total Maximum Size `f`**\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `dp['0'] + dp['1']`.\nLet `v0 = dp['0']` and `v1 = dp['1']`. We need `v0 + v1 = f`.\nThe number of ways to get `dp['0'] = v0` is `count_ways[1][v0]`.\nThe number of ways to get `dp['1'] = v1` is `count_ways[1][v1]`.\nSince the choices for the '0' subtree and '1' subtree are independent, the total number of ways is:\n`sum_{v0+v1=f, 0<=v0,v1<=k} (count_ways[1][v0] * count_ways[1][v1])`.\nThis is again a polynomial convolution: the coefficient of `x^f` in `P_1(x)^2`, where `P_1(x) = sum_{val=0}^k count_ways[1][val] * x^{val}`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- `n` is up to `15`. `k` is up to `2 * 10^5`.\n- Each step (from `L+1` to `L`) involves one NTT-based convolution. The polynomial degree is `k`, so the convolution result has degree `2k`. The NTT size will be the smallest power of 2 greater than `2k+1`. For `k=2*10^5`, `2k+1 = 400001`, so NTT size is `2^19 = 524288`.\n- An NTT takes `O(NTT_size * log(NTT_size))` time.\n- There are `n` levels, so `n-1` NTT computations.\n- Total time complexity: `O(n * k * log k)`. With `n=15, k=2*10^5`, this is roughly `15 * 2 * 10^5 * log(4*10^5) approx 15 * 2 * 10^5 * 19 approx 5.7 * 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n- Space complexity: `O(k)` for storing polynomial coefficients.\n\n**Implementation Details (NTT):**\n- Modulo `MOD = 998244353`.\n- Primitive root `PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3`.\n- `mod_pow(base, exp)` for modular exponentiation.\n- `ntt(a, invert)` function:\n    - Pads `a` to `NTT_size` (power of 2).\n    - Performs bit-reversal permutation.\n    - Iteratively applies butterfly operations.\n    - If `invert` is true, multiplies by modular inverse of `NTT_size`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Modular exponentiation\ndef mod_pow(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Inverse of a number modulo MOD\ndef mod_inv(n):\n    return mod_pow(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Butterfly operations\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_len = mod_pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half))\n        if invert:\n            w_len = mod_inv(w_len)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + len_half + j] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + len_half + j] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = mod_inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n    return a\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef multiply_polynomials(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to len_a + len_b - 1\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    ntt_size = 1\n    while ntt_size < result_len:\n        ntt_size <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials to ntt_size\n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (ntt_size - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (ntt_size - len_b)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    a_ntt = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    b_ntt = ntt(b_padded, False)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    c_ntt = [(a_ntt[i] * b_ntt[i]) % MOD for i in range(ntt_size)]\n\n    # Inverse NTT\n    c = ntt(c_ntt, True)\n    \n    # Trim result to actual length\n    return c[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp_counts[val] stores count_ways[L][val]\n    # Initially for L=n: count_ways[n][val] = 1 for 0 <= val <= k\n    dp_counts = [0] * (k + 1)\n    for val in range(k + 1):\n        dp_counts[val] = 1\n\n    # Iterate from L = n-1 down to 1\n    for L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # 1.
