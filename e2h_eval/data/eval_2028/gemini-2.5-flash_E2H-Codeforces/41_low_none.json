There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the House-Building Profit Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. I need a Python script to handle the input, crunch the numbers, and spit out the answer. Seems straightforward.\n\nThe gist of it is this: maximize profit by building houses. Each house's profit is its height squared. There are zoning restrictions that cap the maximum house height within certain ranges. Let's break this down.\n\nThe input sizes (`n`, `h`, `m`) are tiny, which usually points to a brute-force or, in this case, a slightly more clever approach.  Height is limited to integer values, and the profit is simply the square of the height. The restrictions are the interesting part: they limit the *maximum* height within a given range.\n\nSo, for each location, what's the highest I can build?  Well, globally, the height is capped at `h`. But then each zoning restriction effectively acts as a local cap. If a restriction says a range can't have a house taller than `x`, that applies to every spot within that range.  Therefore, for any given spot, the maximum height will be the minimum of `h` and the lowest `x` imposed by the restrictions that *include* that spot.\n\nI can make this a lot cleaner. Let's create an array, `max_allowed_height`, initialized to `h` for every spot. Then, iterate through the restrictions. For each restriction covering a spot `j`, update `max_allowed_height[j]` to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height. This ensures that after processing all restrictions, `max_allowed_height[j]` correctly reflects the hard limit for each spot.\n\nNow the optimization is trivial: since profit is just the square of the height, and we want to maximize *that*, the optimal solution is to set the height of each house to the maximum height allowed for that spot. This is basically a greedy approach, and it works because each spot's maximum height is *independent* of what heights are chosen at any other spot (the restrictions are upper bounds only).  It's just choosing the biggest number that doesn't break any rules!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, we can build a house with an integer height `a` between `0` and `h`, and this yields a profit of `a^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum allowed height `x_i` for any house within that range.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `j`:\n1.  **Global Maximum Height:** The height of any house must be between `0` and `h`. So, `height[j] <= h`.\n2.  **Zoning Restrictions:** For every restriction `k` such that spot `j` is within its range (`l_k <= j <= r_k`), the height of the house at spot `j` must be at most `x_k`. So, `height[j] <= x_k`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, its height `height[j]` must satisfy `height[j] <= h` and `height[j] <= x_k` for all restrictions `k` that cover spot `j`. Therefore, the absolute maximum height allowed for a house at spot `j` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_k` values from restrictions covering spot `j`.\n\nLet's define `max_possible_height[j]` as this absolute maximum allowed height for spot `j`. We can initialize `max_possible_height[j] = h` for all spots `j` from `1` to `n`. Then, for each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\nFor every spot `j` in the range `[l_i, r_i]` (inclusive), we update `max_possible_height[j] = min(max_possible_height[j], x_i)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_possible_height[j]` will hold the maximum valid height for a house at spot `j` that satisfies all conditions.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, `sum(height[j]^2)`, for each spot `j`, we should choose the largest possible height. This is because the profit function `a^2` is strictly increasing for `a >= 0`. If we can choose a height `A` or a height `B` where `B > A`, choosing `B` will always yield a greater profit (`B^2 > A^2`). Furthermore, the choice of height for one spot `j` does not affect the maximum possible height for any other spot `k`, nor does it affect the profit calculation for other spots. The restrictions only impose upper bounds, not interdependencies that would make a smaller height at one spot more beneficial for another.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to set `height[j] = max_possible_height[j]` for every spot `j`. The total maximum profit will then be `sum(max_possible_height[j]^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `l=1, r=1, x=1`\n2. `l=2, r=2, x=3`\n3. `l=3, r=3, x=2`\n\nInitialize `max_possible_height = [3, 3, 3]` (since `h=3`) for spots `1, 2, 3`.\n\nProcess restriction 1 (`1, 1, 1`):\nFor spot 1: `max_possible_height[0] = min(max_possible_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n`max_possible_height` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n\nProcess restriction 2 (`2, 2, 3`):\nFor spot 2: `max_possible_height[1] = min(max_possible_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n`max_possible_height` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n\nProcess restriction 3 (`3, 3, 2`):\nFor spot 3: `max_possible_height[2] = min(max_possible_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n`max_possible_height` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nAfter all restrictions, the optimal heights are `[1, 3, 2]`.\nThe total profit is `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- `n`, `h`, `m` are small (up to 50), so an `O(n*m)` approach for calculating `max_possible_height` is perfectly fine.\n- We can use a list (or array) of size `n` to store `max_possible_height` values. Python lists are 0-indexed, so we'll map spot `j` to index `j-1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_possible_height for each spot to h\n    # max_possible_height[i] corresponds to spot i+1\n    max_possible_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        # Convert 1-indexed l, r to 0-indexed for list access\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            max_possible_height[i] = min(max_possible_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate total profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_possible_height:\n        total_profit += height * height # height^2\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
