You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Current Thought Process for the Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the minimum edges, `t`, to make an odd cycle in a graph and the number of ways, `w`, to do it. The key is clearly to break it down into cases based on the value of `t`.\n\n**Case t=0:**  If the graph *already* has an odd cycle, we don't need to add anything. The first step, then, is to check if the graph is bipartite.  I can use BFS or DFS, assigning colors to vertices. If I find an edge that connects two vertices with the same color, I know the graph *isn't* bipartite and `t=0`.  And since there's only one way to \"add zero edges,\" which is to do nothing,  `w` is just 1.  I have to remember to check all connected components, though, because an odd cycle could be hidden in one of them.\n\n**Case t=1:** If the graph *is* bipartite, the next possibility is adding one edge to create an odd cycle. The added edge has to connect two vertices of the *same* color *within the same connected component*.  I've got this:  I'll do a 2-coloring (BFS/DFS) on each component. Then, for each component, I'll count the number of pairs of same-colored vertices (let's say `cnt0` and `cnt1` are the counts of each color), and the total number of ways to add one edge would be something like `cnt0 * (cnt0 - 1) / 2 + cnt1 * (cnt1 - 1) / 2`  -- this counts pairs of same-colored vertices that weren't already connected. If this sum is greater than zero, then `t=1`. If it's zero, it means, within each component, there can only be one color (all the same), or any pair of vertices must have different colors.\n\n**Case t=2:**  If `t` isn't 0 or 1, I need to add two edges. Here's where it gets a little trickier. If `t=1` isn't possible, it means every component is basically either an isolated vertex or a single edge. My intuition tells me that I need to somehow combine vertices of different colors in different components, forming a sort of a \"triangle.\"  Since the graph is bipartite, if I combine vertices from different components, then the resulting cycle would have an even length. So let me consider adding edges with different colors.\n\nSince each component is at most an isolated vertex or a single edge, I think I will need to consider adding a vertex and an edge into a cycle. Let's look at picking two components `C1` and `C2`: pick a vertex `u` and an edge `v-w`. Now I connect `u` with `v` and `u` with `w`. The cycle here is `u-v-w-u`, and this will always give an odd cycle! So, if I have any isolated vertices *and* any edges, I can construct an odd-length 3-cycle, and `w` will simply be the number of isolated vertices times the number of single edges!\n\nNow, what if `t=2` isn't possible? I need to look into a special condition where all the vertices form separate edges. We have a set of edges. But if there is no isolated vertex, we must add a third edge to construct a cycle.\n\nIf I'm *only* left with isolated vertices, forming a cycle of at least three vertices, I need to add three edges.  Let `n` be the number of vertices. If there are only isolated vertices and I need to add 3 edges, `t` would be 3 and the ways would be number of combinations of 3 vertices, given as `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\n\nIf I only have edges and no isolated vertices, I can pick two edges. Let one edge be `u-v`, another edge be `x-y`. I can join `u` with `x` and `u` with `y`. This will be an odd cycle: `u-x-y-u`. Since `x` is in edge `x-y`, I can have this combination. I can pick `x` or `y`. So the number of ways would be something proportional to `k_1 * (k_1 -1)`, given as `k_1 * (k_1-1)`. I will need a correction here as I can pick a point in `u-v` as start.\n\nIn summary, the core of the problem is determining the smallest",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` the number of ways to do so. A simple cycle means all vertices in the cycle are distinct. An odd cycle must have at least 3 vertices.\n\nWe can analyze the problem by considering the minimum number of edges to add, `t`:\n\n**Step 1: Check for `t = 0` (an odd cycle already exists).**\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check for bipartiteness using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal.\nWe maintain a `colors` array, initialized to -1 (uncolored). For each unvisited vertex, start a traversal, assigning it color 0. All its neighbors get color 1, their uncolored neighbors get color 0, and so on. If we ever encounter an edge `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` have the same color, then the graph is not bipartite, and we have found an odd cycle.\nIf an odd cycle is found, `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's only one way to add 0 edges). We print `0 1` and terminate.\n\n**Step 2: Check for `t = 1` (add one edge).**\nIf we reached this step, the graph is bipartite. This means all connected components are bipartite, and we have a valid 2-coloring (e.g., 0 and 1) for each component.\nTo form an odd cycle by adding one edge `(u, v)`, `u` and `v` must satisfy two conditions:\n1. They must belong to the same connected component.\n2. They must have the same color in the 2-coloring of that component.\nAdding an edge between two same-colored vertices `u` and `v` in a bipartite component creates a cycle. Since any path between `u` and `v` in a bipartite graph (where `u` and `v` have the same color) must have an even length, adding the edge `(u, v)` results in a cycle of length `(even_path_length + 1)`, which is odd.\nSince the original graph is bipartite, no existing edge connects same-colored vertices. Thus, any pair `(u, v)` satisfying the conditions will form a new odd cycle.\nTo count `w`: For each connected component `C`:\n  Let `cnt0` be the number of vertices colored 0 in `C`.\n  Let `cnt1` be the number of vertices colored 1 in `C`.\n  The number of pairs of same-colored vertices in `C` is `cnt0 * (cnt0 - 1) / 2 + cnt1 * (cnt1 - 1) / 2`.\nSum these counts over all connected components. This sum is `w`.\nIf `w > 0`, then `t = 1`. We print `1 w` and terminate.\nIf `w = 0`, it means for every connected component `C`, `cnt0 <= 1` and `cnt1 <= 1`. This implies that every connected component is either an isolated vertex (e.g., `cnt0=1, cnt1=0`) or a single edge (e.g., `cnt0=1, cnt1=1`). In this specific structure, `t=1` is not possible. We proceed to `t=2`.\n\n**Step 3: Check for `t = 2` (add two edges).**\nIf we reached this step, the graph is bipartite, and all its connected components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\nLet `k_0` be the number of isolated vertices (components of size 1).\nLet `k_1` be the number of single-edge components (components of size 2, like `u-v`).\n\nWe need to add two edges to form an odd cycle. The smallest odd cycle is a triangle (length 3).\nTo form a triangle `a-b-c-a` by adding two edges, one edge must already exist. Let `a-b` be an existing edge. We then add edges `(a,c)` and `(b,c)`.\nFor this to form a simple cycle, `c` must be a vertex not involved in the existing edge `a-b`, and `c` must not be connected to `a` or `b` already.\nIn our current graph structure (isolated vertices and single edges), if `a-b` is an existing edge, `a` and `b` have degree 1. For `c` to be connectable to both `a` and `b` without forming parallel edges, `c` must be an isolated vertex.\n\n**Scenario 3.1: Form a 3-cycle using one existing edge and two new edges.**\nThis requires:\n  - Choosing an existing edge `a-b`. There are `k_1` ways to choose such a component.\n  - Choosing an isolated vertex `c`. There are `k_0` ways to choose such a vertex.\n  - Add edges `(a,c)` and `(b,c)`. This forms the cycle `a-c-b-a`.\nThis scenario is possible if `k_1 >= 1` and `k_0 >= 1`.\nThe number of ways `w = k_1 * k_0`.\nIf this is possible, `t = 2`. We print `2 w` and terminate.\n\n**Scenario 3.2: Form a 3-cycle using two existing edges and two new edges, but sharing a vertex.**\nThis applies if `k_0 = 0` (no isolated vertices). The graph is a collection of disjoint edges.\nWe need to pick two distinct edge components, say `a-b` and `c-d`.\nWe can pick one endpoint from the first component (say `a`) and connect it to both endpoints of the second component (`c` and `d`).\n  - Choose two distinct edge components. There are `k_1 * (k_1 - 1) / 2` ways.\n  - From the first chosen component (say `a-b`), pick one vertex (say `a`). There are 2 ways (`a` or `b`).\n  - Add edges `(a,c)` and `(a,d)`. This forms the cycle `a-c-d-a`.\nThis scenario is possible if `k_1 >= 2`.\nThe number of ways `w = (k_1 * (k_1 - 1) / 2) * 2 = k_1 * (k_1 - 1)`.\nIf this is possible, `t = 2`. We print `2 w` and terminate.\n\n**Step 4: Check for `t = 3` (add three edges).**\nIf we reached this step, it means:\n  - `t=0` and `t=1` were not possible (graph is a collection of isolated vertices and single edges).\n  - `t=2` was not possible. This implies either:\n    - `k_0 = 0` AND `k_1 < 2` (i.e., `k_1 = 0` or `k_1 = 1`). This means `n <= 2`.\n    - `k_1 = 0` AND `k_0 < 1` (i.e., `k_0 = 0`). This means `n=0`.\n    - `k_0 = 0` AND `k_1 = 0`. This means `n=0`.\n    - `k_0 >= 1` AND `k_1 = 0`. This means the graph consists only of isolated vertices.\n    - `k_0 = 0` AND `k_1 = 1`. This means the graph is a single edge (e.g., 1-2).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the conditions for `t=2` not being possible:\n1. `k_0=0` and `k_1=0`: `n=0`. Not possible by problem constraints (`n>=1`).\n2. `k_0=0` and `k_1=1`: Graph is a single edge `u-v`. `n=2`. To form an odd cycle (min length 3), we need at least 3 vertices. Since `n=2`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle.\n3. `k_0>=1` and `k_1=0`: Graph consists only of isolated vertices. `m=0`.\n   We need to add 3 edges to form a 3-cycle.\n   We must pick 3 distinct vertices `u, v, x` from the `n` isolated vertices. Add `(u,v), (v,x), (x,u)`.\n   This is possible if `n >= 3`.\n   The number of ways `w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\n   If `n < 3`, it's impossible to form a 3-cycle, so `w = 0`.\n   So, if `k_1=0` (all vertices isolated): `t = 3`. `w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6`. Print `3 w`.\n\n**Final check on edge cases for `n`:**\n- If `n < 3`: An odd cycle (min length 3) cannot be formed.\n  - If `n=1, m=0`: `k_0=1, k_1=0`. `t=0, t=1` fail. `t=2` fails (needs `k_1>=1`). `t=3` fails (needs `n>=3`). So impossible. The problem statement guarantees a cycle \"consisting of more than one vertex\". The smallest odd cycle has 3 vertices. So if `n < 3`, `w` should be 0.\n  - If `n=2, m=0`: `k_0=2, k_1=0`. `t=0, t=1` fail. `t=2` fails. `t=3` fails (needs `n>=3`). Impossible.\n  - If `n=2, m=1` (`1-2`): `k_0=0, k_1=1`. `t=0, t=1` fail. `t=2` fails (needs `k_0>=1` or `k_1>=2`). `t=3` fails (needs `n>=3`). Impossible.\n\nThe problem implies that a solution always exists. This means `n` must be at least 3 for `t=3` to be a valid answer.\nIf `n < 3`, and `t=0` or `t=1` are not met, then it's impossible to form an odd cycle. This scenario implies the output should be `3 0` (or some other indication of impossibility). However, competitive programming problems usually ensure that a valid answer exists if `n` is sufficiently large. The examples show `n=3, m=0` yields `3 1`. This confirms `t=3` is the fallback when only isolated vertices exist and `n>=3`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Adjacency list for graph: `adj`.\n- `colors` array for 2-coloring: `colors = [-1] * (n + 1)`.\n- `visited` array for component traversal: `visited = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n- Use BFS for 2-coloring to avoid recursion depth issues with DFS on large graphs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    colors = [-1] * (n + 1) # -1: uncolored, 0: color A, 1: color B\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Check for t = 0 (odd cycle already exists) ---\n    is_bipartite = True\n    \n    # Store component info for t=1 and t=2 checks\n    components_info = [] # List of (cnt0, cnt1) for each component\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            colors[i] = 0\n            visited[i] = True\n            \n            component_cnt0 = 0\n            component_cnt1 = 0\n            current_component_is_bipartite = True\n\n            component_nodes = []\n            \n            head = 0\n            q_list = [i] # Use a list for BFS to avoid deque overhead if small, or just stick to deque\n            \n            while head < len(q_list):\n                u = q_list[head]\n                head += 1\n                component_nodes.append(u)\n\n                if colors[u] == 0:\n                    component_cnt0 += 1\n                else:\n                    component_cnt1 += 1\n\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if colors[v] == -1: # Uncolored\n                        colors[v] = 1 - colors[u]\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q_list.append(v)\n                    elif colors[v] == colors[u]: # Same color, odd cycle detected\n                        is_bipartite = False\n                        current_component_is_bipartite = False\n                        # No need to continue BFS for this component, but finish it to mark all nodes as visited\n                        # Or, just break and return 0 1\n                        break \n                if not current_component_is_bipartite:\n                    break\n            \n            if not current_component_is_bipartite:\n                print(\"0 1\")\n                return\n            \n            # Only add component info if it's bipartite\n            components_info.append((component_cnt0, component_cnt1))\n\n    # If we are here, the graph is bipartite.
