He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Base Conversion Script**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to convert a number from one base to another.  The input will be base `a`, base `b`, and the number itself `c`.  `b` can be either a regular integer, or the special character 'R', which means I need to convert to Roman numerals.\n\nI'm thinking I'll break this down into logical steps. First, I need to parse the input to grab the base `a`, the target base `b` (as a string, either an integer or 'R'), and the number `c` as a string.\n\nThen, the core of the problem: I'll need an intermediary conversion to decimal.  I'll convert `c` from base `a` to a decimal value. This will act as the common ground for all the other conversions.\n\nFinally, I'll need a conversion from decimal to base `b`.  If `b` is an integer, that's a straightforward base conversion. If `b` is 'R', I'll have to translate the decimal value into its Roman numeral equivalent.\n\nLet's dive into the details.\n\n### Parsing the Input\n\nThe input will come in two lines: the first line will contain `a` and `b` separated by a space, and the second line contains the number `c`. I'll need to read these lines, split them, and store the values.  `a` will be an integer, `b` will be a string (either a number or \"R\"), and `c` will be a string. For example, for \"10 2\\n1\", I'll set `a = 10`, `b = \"2\"`, and `c = \"1\"`. For \"16 R\\n5\", I'll set `a = 16`, `b = \"R\"`, and `c = \"5\"`.\n\n### Base `a` to Decimal Conversion\n\nThis is the standard base conversion algorithm. The digits in `c` can represent values from 0 to `a`-1. For bases up to 10, the characters are '0' through '9'. For bases greater than 10, I'll have to use 'A' = 10, 'B' = 11, and so on up to 'Z' = 35 (since the max base is 25+1 = 26).\n\nI'm thinking of creating a function `to_decimal(c_str, base_a)`. Inside the function:\n\n1.  I'll initialize `decimal_value = 0`.\n2.  I'll iterate through `c_str` from left to right (most significant digit to least).\n3.  For each character `digit_char`:\n    *   If it's '0'-'9', I'll convert it to an integer using `int(digit_char)`.\n    *   If it's 'A'-'Z', I'll convert it to an integer using `ord(digit_char) - ord('A') + 10`.\n    *   I'll then update `decimal_value`: `decimal_value = decimal_value * base_a + digit_value`.\n\nThe maximum size of `c_str` is 1000, and `a` can be as large as 25. The resulting decimal value could be really, really big – potentially larger than the standard 64-bit integer limit. Thankfully, Python has arbitrary-precision integers, so I don't need to worry about overflow.\n\nThe constraints are important here: the decimal value of c can be 3000 at most if b is \"R\", and 10^15 at most otherwise. Python will handle this easily.\n\n### Decimal to Base `b` Conversion\n\nNow, the final conversion.\n\n*   **If `b` is an integer:**  I can use the standard repeated division method. I'll repeatedly divide the decimal value by `b` and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, will be the digits in base `b`. I'll need to handle the case where the remainder is greater than 9 (digits 'A' through 'Z').\n*   **If `b` is 'R':** I'll convert decimal to Roman numerals. Since the input value is limited to 3000, this should be a manageable lookup or iterative approach using the standard Roman numeral symbols.\n\nOkay, that's the plan. Time to start writing some Python code!\n",
    "response": "The problem requires converting a number `c` from a given base `a` to another base `b`. The base `b` can be an integer between 2 and 25, or it can be a special Roman numeral system denoted by 'R'.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing**: Read `a` and `b_str` from the first line, and `c_str` from the second line. `a` will be an integer, `b_str` will be a string (either a number or 'R').\n\n2.  **Convert `c_str` from base `a` to decimal**:\n    This is the first crucial step. Regardless of the target base `b`, we first convert the input number `c_str` (which is in base `a`) into its decimal (base 10) representation.\n    *   We iterate through the characters of `c_str` from left to right.\n    *   For each character, we determine its integer value:\n        *   If it's a digit '0'-'9', its value is `int(char)`.\n        *   If it's a letter 'A'-'Z' (for bases > 10), its value is `ord(char) - ord('A') + 10`.\n    *   We accumulate the decimal value using the formula: `decimal_value = decimal_value * base_a + digit_value`.\n    *   Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the potentially large numbers (up to 10^15).\n\n3.  **Convert decimal to target base `b`**:\n    After obtaining the `decimal_value`, we proceed based on `b_str`:\n\n    a.  **If `b_str` is an integer (standard base conversion)**:\n        *   Convert `b_str` to an integer `base_b`.\n        *   Handle the special case where `decimal_value` is 0: the result is \"0\".\n        *   For positive `decimal_value`:\n            *   Repeatedly take the `decimal_value % base_b` to get the least significant digit.\n            *   Convert this digit to its character representation:\n                *   If `digit < 10`, it's `str(digit)`.\n                *   If `digit >= 10`, it's `chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)`.\n            *   Prepend this character to the result string.\n            *   Update `decimal_value = decimal_value // base_b`.\n            *   Continue until `decimal_value` becomes 0.\n        *   The result will be the number in base `b` without leading zeros (unless the number itself is 0).\n\n    b.  **If `b_str` is 'R' (Roman numerals conversion)**:\n        *   The problem states that if Roman numerals are involved, the number will be less than or equal to 3000. This simplifies the conversion as we don't need to handle numbers larger than 3999 (which would require symbols like V̅, X̅ for 5000, 10000, etc.).\n        *   We define a mapping of Roman numeral values to their symbols, ordered from largest to smallest. This is crucial for the greedy approach. For example: `[(1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')]`.\n        *   Initialize an empty string `roman_numeral`.\n        *   Iterate through the `value, symbol` pairs in the mapping.\n        *   For each pair, while `decimal_value` is greater than or equal to `value`:\n            *   Append `symbol` to `roman_numeral`.\n            *   Subtract `value` from `decimal_value`.\n        *   The final `roman_numeral` string is the result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (16 R, 5):**\n1.  `a = 16`, `b_str = \"R\"`, `c_str = \"5\"`.\n2.  **`to_decimal(\"5\", 16)`**: `decimal_value = 0 * 16 + 5 = 5`.\n3.  **`to_roman(5)`**:\n    *   `decimal_value = 5`. `roman_numeral = \"\"`.\n    *   Pairs: `(1000, 'M')`...`(10, 'X')`...\n    *   `(5, 'V')`: `5 >= 5` is true. `roman_numeral = \"V\"`. `decimal_value = 5 - 5 = 0`.\n    *   Loop terminates as `decimal_value` is 0.\n    *   Result: \"V\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (10 2, 1):**\n1.  `a = 10`, `b_str = \"2\"`, `c_str = \"1\"`.\n2.  **`to_decimal(\"1\", 10)`**: `decimal_value = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1`.\n3.  **`from_decimal(1, 2)`**:\n    *   `decimal_value = 1`, `base_b = 2`.\n    *   `1 % 2 = 1`. `result = \"1\"`. `decimal_value = 1 // 2 = 0`.\n    *   Loop terminates.\n    *   Result: \"1\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(c_str, base_a):\n    \"\"\"Converts a number string from base_a to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.\"\"\"\n    decimal_value = 0\n    power = 0\n    # Iterate from right to left (least significant digit to most significant)\n    # This is an alternative to the left-to-right approach (decimal_value = decimal_value * base_a + digit_value)\n    # Both are valid.
