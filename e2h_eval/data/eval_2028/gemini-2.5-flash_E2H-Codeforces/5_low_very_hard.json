Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Colored Boots\" Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The goal is to maximize the number of compatible left and right boot pairs.  The input's straightforward: a number of boots and strings representing their colors. The compatibility rules are simple, same color or a wildcard '?' works. The crucial constraint here is that 'n' can go up to 150,000.  This instantly tells me that an O(N^2) brute-force approach is a no-go; I need to think about something more efficient, probably O(N log N) or linear.\n\nMy initial instinct is to represent the boots in a structured way. I'll use dictionaries, specifically `defaultdict(list)`, to store indices for each boot color.  So, `left_boots['a']` will be a list of all the left boots that are color 'a', and similarly for the right boots.  This makes matching much easier.\n\nNow, the core of the problem is figuring out the optimal pairing strategy to maximize the total matches.  A greedy approach feels promising, and I'm going to start by matching the *most restrictive* boots first. By \"most restrictive,\" I mean boots with specific colors. Matching a specific color 'c' with another 'c' is the ideal scenario.  A specific color with a wildcard is okay, and wildcard with wildcard is the least preferable.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n**Step 1:**  I'll iterate through each specific color from 'a' to 'z'. For each color, I'll try to match as many left boots of that color with right boots of that same color. I can use the lists I created earlier, popping pairs from the lists until one list is empty. These pairings are guaranteed and optimal.\n\n**Step 2:** After step 1, any unmatched boots of a specific color must be paired with wildcard boots ('?'). I'll handle any remaining left boots of color 'c' with any right wildcard, and then any left wildcards with remaining right boots of color 'c'. This step is also straight-forward.\n\nThat's my core strategy. I think this greedy approach should work efficiently, providing the maximum number of compatible pairs, and it fits within the time complexity constraints. Now, I just need to translate this logic into code and make sure to correctly output the pairs' indices as required.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and to list these pairs. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with their colors represented by characters. A specific color (lowercase letter) is compatible only with itself. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should prioritize matches that are most restrictive. This means matching specific colors with specific colors first, as this uses up boots that have fewer potential partners. Then, we use the more flexible '?' boots.\n\nHere's a greedy strategy that works:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** First, we need to efficiently access boots of a certain color. We can use lists to store the 1-indexed original indices of boots for each color. For example, `left_boots['a']` will be a list of indices of all left boots with color 'a'. We'll do this for all specific colors ('a' through 'z') and for '?'.\n    ```python\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    left_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n    ```\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors with Identical Specific Colors:** This is the most restrictive type of match. For each specific color `c` (from 'a' to 'z'), we try to match as many `c` left boots with `c` right boots as possible.\n    ```python\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        c = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[c] and right_boots[c]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[c].pop(), right_boots[c].pop()))\n    ```\n    After this step, any remaining `c` boots (left or right) must be matched with '?' boots.\n\n3.  **Match Remaining Specific Left Boots with '?' Right Boots:** Now, we have specific left boots that couldn't find an identical specific right boot. Their only remaining compatible partners are '?' right boots. We match them greedily.\n    ```python\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        c = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[c] and right_boots['?']:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[c].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n    ```\n\n4.  **Match Remaining '?' Left Boots with Specific Right Boots:** Similarly, we have specific right boots that couldn't find an identical specific left boot. Their only remaining compatible partners are '?' left boots. We match them greedily.\n    ```python\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        c = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots['?'] and right_boots[c]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots[c].pop()))\n    ```\n\n5.  **Match Remaining '?' Left Boots with '?' Right Boots:** Finally, any '?' left boots and '?' right boots that are still available can be matched with each other. This is the least restrictive match.\n    ```python\n    while left_boots['?'] and right_boots['?']:\n        pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n    ```\n\n**Why this greedy strategy is optimal:**\nThe strategy prioritizes using specific-colored boots for specific-to-specific matches. This is crucial because specific-colored boots have limited compatibility (only with themselves or '?'). By matching 'c' with 'c' first, we ensure that these 'c' boots are used effectively. If we instead used a 'c' boot to match a '?' boot when a 'c' boot was available, we might prevent another 'c' boot from finding its only specific partner, potentially reducing the total number of pairs. The '?' boots are the most flexible and can fill in any gaps, so they are saved for last or used when no specific-to-specific match is possible. Each step consumes boots and ensures they are matched in the most restrictive way possible, leading to the maximum number of pairs.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by iterating through the input strings to populate the `defaultdict`s (O(N)) and then iterating through the characters ('a'-'z') and popping elements from lists. In the worst case, each boot index is added to a list once and popped from a list once. So, the total time complexity is O(N + 26 * N) which simplifies to O(N). This is efficient enough for N up to 150,000.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    left_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = defaultdict(list)\n\n    # Populate lists of indices for each color\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with identical specific colors\n    # Iterate through all lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        c = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[c] and right_boots[c]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[c].pop(), right_boots[c].pop()))\n\n    # Step 2: Match remaining specific left boots with '?' right boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        c = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[c] and right_boots['?']:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[c].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining '?' left boots with specific right boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        c = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots['?'] and right_boots[c]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots[c].pop()))\n\n    # Step 4: Match remaining '?' left boots with '?' right boots\n    while left_boots['?'] and right_boots['?']:\n        pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n\n    # Print the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for p_l, p_r in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{p_l} {p_r}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
