Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Longest Duplicate Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with finding the longest substring that repeats within a given string.  It's pretty straightforward: I've got a string of lowercase letters, and I need to find the longest sequence of characters that appears at least twice, even if those appearances overlap. The string's length is manageable, between 1 and 100 characters.\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle this systematically.  I'll start by considering substring lengths. The longest possible substring has a length of `n-1` where `n` is the length of the string, because a substring of length `n` would only occur once. I'll need to check lengths from 1 up to `n-1`.\n\nFor each length, I'll generate all possible substrings. Let's say I'm looking at substrings of length `L`. I'll iterate through the string, starting from index 0, and pull out substrings of length `L`. Then, the trick is going to be how to efficiently determine if these substrings appear more than once. `s.count()` is tempting, but that won't handle overlapping occurrences correctly. I need to be more precise.\n\nI think a robust way to count the occurrences of a substring is to iterate through the string and check for matches at each position. This means I'd iterate through all possible starting positions, `j`, and check if the substring starting at `j` matches my target substring.\n\nA little refinement is necessary.  Instead of checking each substring individually, maybe it's more efficient to create a data structure to store all the substrings of a given length. This way I could efficiently check for duplicates. Maybe a `set` or a `dictionary` would be ideal here.\n\nSince the goal is the *longest* substring, I need to choose an order to consider substring lengths. I'm thinking of iterating lengths in decreasing order. That way, as soon as I find a duplicate, I've got my answer, because it's the longest possible substring that repeats. I'll start with a substring length of `n-1` and work my way down to 1.\n\nFor each length, `L`, I'll iterate through the string, extracting substrings and checking for duplicates. When I find two occurrences, I'm done. I've found the longest repeating substring.\n\nLet's try an example. With the string \"ababa\", I start with a length of 4. There are no duplicates there. Moving on to length 3, I find \"aba\" appearing at index 0 and again at index 2. This is the longest repeating substring, and I'm done. This approach seems sound.\n",
