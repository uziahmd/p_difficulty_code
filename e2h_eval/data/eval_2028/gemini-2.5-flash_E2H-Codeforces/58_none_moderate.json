You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

Connect two different components (C1, C2) and add an edge within one of them (say C1).\n    #    This is not right. If we connect two components, say u in C1 and v in C2,\n    #    the whole graph becomes one component. If color[u] == color[v], then the new component is still bipartite.\n    #    If color[u] != color[v], then the new component is still bipartite.\n    #    This means adding one edge between components never creates an odd cycle.\n    #    To create an odd cycle, we need to connect two nodes of the same color.\n    #    If we connect u in C1 and v in C2, the distance between them is 1.\n    #    If color[u] == color[v], then C1 and C2 effectively merge into a single component,\n    #    and the distance between u and v is 1, which is odd.\n    #    However, if we connect u in C1 (color 0) and v in C2 (color 0), the resulting component is still bipartite.\n    #    The new component will have a 2-coloring.\n    #    Example: C1: {A(0), B(1)}, C2: {X(0), Y(1)}. Add (A,X). The new component is {A(0), B(1), X(0), Y(1)}.\n    #    If we assign colors: A(0), B(1), X(0), Y(1). This is a valid 2-coloring. No odd cycle.\n    #    Wait, this logic is incorrect.\n    #    If we add an edge (u, v) where u is from component 1 and v is from component 2,\n    #    the resulting graph is still bipartite. We need to find a path between u and v\n    #    in the original graph, and then add an edge (u, v) such that the path length + 1 is odd.\n    #    This means adding an edge (u,v) such that u and v are in the same partition of the combined graph.\n    #    This means u and v must have the same \"relative\" color.\n    #    If we fix a coloring for each component, say C_i has partitions A_i and B_i.\n    #    If we connect u in A_i and v in A_j, then the path from u to v has even length (in the merged graph).\n    #    The new edge (u,v) forms an odd cycle.\n    #    So, we need to add an edge between two nodes of the same color in different components.\n    #    If we have N_c components, and we pick one node from each of two components, say C_i and C_j.\n    #    We pick u from C_i and v from C_j.\n    #    If we connect u and v, and color[u] == color[v], then we have a path u -- v of length 1.\n    #    The path from u to v in the merged graph (if it existed) would have an even length.\n    #    This forms an odd cycle.\n    #    So, for t=1, we could also connect two nodes of the same color from different components.\n    #    The problem states \"simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex\".\n    #    Adding an edge (u,v) where u and v are in different components and color[u] == color[v]\n    #    creates a cycle of length 1 (the edge itself). This is not allowed. A cycle must have length > 1.\n    #    The definition of a simple cycle means it doesn't contain any vertex twice, except for start/end.\n    #    A cycle of length 1 (a loop) is not allowed.\n    #    A cycle of length 2 (parallel edges) is not allowed.\n    #    So, the t=1 case is only for adding an edge within a component.\n    #    This means the previous `ways_t1` calculation is correct.\n\n    # Back to t=2.\n    # We need to add two edges (u,v) and (x,y) to form an odd cycle.\n    # Case 1: Connect two different components.\n    #   Pick two components C_i and C_j.\n    #   Pick u from C_i, v from C_j. Pick x from C_i, y from C_j.\n    #   Add edges (u,v) and (x,y).\n    #   This forms a cycle u-v-y-x-u. The length is 4. This is an even cycle.\n    #   This is not what we want.\n    #   What if we add (u,v) and (v,x)?\n    #   The cycle must be simple.\n    #   The simplest odd cycle we can make with two edges is a triangle.\n    #   We need 3 vertices, say a, b, c.\n    #   If we add (a,b) and (b,c), and (c,a) is an existing edge, this is an odd cycle.\n    #   But we are adding two edges. So we need to add (a,b) and (b,c) and (c,a) is not an edge.\n    #   This would be adding 3 edges.\n    #   What if we add (u,v) and (v,w)?\n    #   The existing graph is bipartite.\n    #   Consider three distinct vertices a, b, c.\n    #   If we add edges (a,b) and (b,c).\n    #   If a, b, c are in the same component, then color[a] != color[b] and color[b] != color[c].\n    #   So color[a] == color[c].\n    #   If (a,c) is not an edge, then adding (a,b) and (b,c) does not form an odd cycle by itself.\n    #   It forms a path a-b-c.\n    #   The odd cycle must be formed by the two new edges PLUS some existing path.\n    #   Consider adding (u,v) and (x,y).\n    #   If we pick u from component C_i, and v from component C_j.\n    #   And x from C_k, and y from C_l.\n    #   This is too complex.\n\n    # A simpler way to think about t=2:\n    # We need to connect two nodes of the same color, but they are in different components.\n    # Let's say we have components C1 and C2.\n    # C1 has partitions A1, B1. C2 has partitions A2, B2.\n    # We want to connect a node from A1 to a node from A2. This requires 1 edge.\n    # But we are in t=2 case.\n    # This means we need to add two edges.\n    # The two edges must complete an odd cycle.\n    # Let the added edges be (u, v) and (x, y).\n    #\n    # Option A: Connect two components, then add an edge within one of them.\n    # This is not right. If we connect two components C_i and C_j with an edge (u, v),\n    # where u in C_i, v in C_j. The resulting graph is still bipartite.\n    # Then we add another edge (x, y).\n    # If (x,y) is within the merged component, and color[x] == color[y], this forms an odd cycle.\n    # This means we connect u in C_i, v in C_j (any u,v). This forms a new bipartite component.\n    # Then we add (x,y) within this new component such that color[x] == color[y].\n    # This is effectively choosing two nodes x, y of the same color in the same \"merged\" component.\n    # This is equivalent to picking two nodes of the same color from the original components,\n    # and adding an edge between them, and adding another edge to connect them.\n    #\n    # Let's re-evaluate. The graph is a forest of bipartite graphs.\n    # We need to add t edges to form an odd cycle.\n    #\n    # t=2:\n    # Case 1: Connect three distinct vertices a, b, c, such that (a,b) and (b,c) are new edges.\n    #   For this to form an odd cycle, (a,c) must be an existing edge.\n    #   This would form a triangle a-b-c-a.\n    #   Since the graph is bipartite, there are no odd cycles.\n    #   So, there is no existing edge (a,c) such that a and c are in the same partition.\n    #   And if (a,c) exists, then a and c are in different partitions.\n    #   If we add (a,b) and (b,c), then color[a] != color[b] and color[b] != color[c].\n    #   So color[a] == color[c].\n    #   If (a,c) is an existing edge, this means color[a] != color[c]. Contradiction.\n    #   So, this case (adding 2 edges to complete a triangle with an existing edge) is impossible.\n    #\n    # Case 2: Connect two components C_i and C_j.\n    #   Let's pick a node u from C_i and a node v from C_j.\n    #   Let's pick a node x from C_i and a node y from C_j.\n    #   We add edges (u,v) and (x,y).\n    #   For this to form an odd cycle, the path u-v-y-x-u must be an odd cycle.\n    #   Length is 4. Even.\n    #   What if u=x? Add (u,v) and (u,y).\n    #   This forms a cycle u-v-path(v,y)-y-u.\n    #   This is a \"bowtie\" shape.\n    #   If u is in C_i, v in C_j, y in C_j.\n    #   Then color[u] != color[v] and color[u] != color[y].\n    #   So color[v] == color[y].\n    #   Path from v to y in C_j has even length (since C_j is bipartite).\n    #   Cycle u-v-path(v,y)-y-u has length 1 (u,v) + even (path v-y) + 1 (y,u) = even + 2 = even.\n    #   So this doesn't create an odd cycle.\n    #\n    # This means the t=2 case must involve more than just connecting two components.\n    #\n    # Consider connecting 3 components, C1, C2, C3.\n    # Pick u1 from C1, u2 from C2, u3 from C3.\n    # Add (u1, u2) and (u2, u3).\n    # This forms a path u1-u2-u3.\n    # To make an odd cycle, we need to add a third edge (u3, u1). This would be t=3.\n    #\n    # The only way to form an odd cycle with 2 added edges is if the cycle involves\n    # 3 vertices, say A, B, C, where (A,B) and (B,C) are new edges, and (C,A) is an existing path.\n    # The path C...A must have odd length.\n    # But in a bipartite graph, any path between two nodes of the same color has even length.\n    # And any path between two nodes of different colors has odd length.\n    # If we add (A,B) and (B,C), then color[A] != color[B] and color[B] != color[C].\n    # So color[A] == color[C].\n    # Thus, any path from C to A in the existing graph must have an even length.\n    # So the total cycle length would be 1 (A,B) + 1 (B,C) + even (path C...A) = even.\n    # This implies that we cannot form an odd cycle with 2 added edges if they form a path.\n    #\n    # What if the two added edges are (u,v) and (x,y)?\n    # And u,v,x,y are distinct.\n    # And there is an existing path between v and x.\n    # Cycle: u - v - path(v,x) - x - y - u.\n    # The length of this cycle is 1 (u,v) + length(path(v,x)) + 1 (x,y) + length(path(y,u)).\n    # We need this to be odd.\n    # This is getting very complicated.\n\n    # Let's simplify.\n    # The graph is a collection of bipartite components.\n    # Each component C_k has two partitions A_k and B_k.\n    # Any edge (u,v) connects u in A_k to v in B_k (or vice versa).\n    #\n    # t=1: Add (u,v) where u,v are in the same component C_k and same partition (e.g., u,v in A_k).\n    # This creates an odd cycle. We calculated ways_t1. If > 0, done.\n    #\n    # If ways_t1 is 0, it means for every component C_k, either |A_k| <= 1 or |B_k| <= 1.\n    # This means every component is a path or a star graph where the center is degree > 1 and all leaves are degree 1.\n    # More precisely, if |A_k| <= 1, then there are no pairs in A_k.\n    # If |B_k| <= 1, then there are no pairs in B_k.\n    # So, for ways_t1 to be 0, for every component, min(|A_k|, |B_k|) must be 0 or 1.\n    # This means each component is essentially a path or a single node or two nodes connected.\n    # E.g., a path 1-2-3-4. A={1,3}, B={2,4}. |A|=2, |B|=2. ways_t1 for this is 1+1=2.\n    # So ways_t1=0 implies that for every component, one partition has at most 1 node.\n    # This means each component is a \"star\" with at most one edge.\n    # Example: 1-2. A={1}, B={2}. |A|=1, |B|=1.\n    # Example: 1-2, 1-3. A={1}, B={2,3}. |A|=1, |B|=2. ways_t1 for this is 0 + 1 = 1.\n    # So for ways_t1=0, it means for every component, one partition has 0 nodes, or one partition has 1 node.\n    # This means for every component, it's either a single node, or a pair of nodes, or a single node connected to multiple nodes (a star graph), but all these \"multiple nodes\" must be in the same partition.\n    # This implies that for any component C_k, either A_k or B_k has size at most 1.\n    # No, this is wrong.
