    "thought": "**Tackling a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out two things for a given integer `p`. First, what's the minimum number of nodes `N` needed to build a directed graph where exactly `p` pairs of nodes are \"p-reachable\"? And second, among all those minimal graphs, what's the maximum number of unidirectional pairs we can cram in?\n\nAlright, let's break down the definitions. A \"unidirectional pair\" means we can get from `u` to `v` but not the other way around.  A \"p-reachable graph\" is a bit trickier.  It means there are exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u` comes before `v` lexicographically (`u < v`), *and* `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.  \"Reachability in both directions\" screams \"strongly connected component\" (SCC) to me.  So, a p-reachable graph has exactly `p` pairs of nodes that live in the same SCC.\n\nThinking about an SCC with `k` nodes, every pair of distinct nodes is reachable from each other. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` within an SCC of size `k` is just the combination formula `k * (k - 1) / 2`.  If we have multiple SCCs, say with sizes `k1, k2, ... km`, the total number of p-reachable pairs is the sum of these contributions from each SCC.  We want this sum to equal `p`, and we want to minimize the total node count, which is just the sum of the SCC sizes.\n\nLet's call the formula `k * (k - 1) / 2` as `f(k)`.  I can see that `f(k)` is an increasing function. Since we're minimizing the total number of nodes `N` for a fixed `p`, I should focus on maximizing the size of the individual SCCs. This is because  `f(k)` is convex. Combining two SCCs into one larger SCC gives me more p-reachable pairs (meaning a larger value of `f(k)`) for the same number of nodes.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to build a few *large* SCCs, which contain as many nodes as possible, to meet the condition for `p`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `N` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable graphs with `N` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. \"Reachable from each other\" means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there is no path from `v` to `u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `N`**\n\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` be the number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` within an SCC of size `k`.\nIf a graph has multiple SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of `p`-pairs is `sum(f(k_i))`. The total number of nodes is `N = sum(k_i)`.\nTo minimize `N` for a given `p`, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and make them as large as possible. This is because `f(k)` is convex, meaning `f(k_1 + k_2) > f(k_1) + f(k_2)` for `k_1, k_2 >= 1`. A single larger SCC is more \"efficient\" at generating `p`-pairs per node.\n\nSo, we want to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`. Let this be `k_max`.\nWe can use one SCC of size `k_max`, which contributes `f(k_max)` to `p` and `k_max` to `N`.\nThe remaining `p_rem = p - f(k_max)` pairs must be formed by additional SCCs.\nIf `p_rem > 0`, we need to find the largest `k'` such that `f(k') <= p_rem`, and repeat the process.\nThis strategy is a greedy approach: always pick the largest possible SCC. This is optimal because `f(k)` is convex.\n\nThe calculation of `k_max` for a given `p` can be done by solving `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p` for `k`.\n`k^2 - k - 2p <= 0`. The positive root of `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`.\nSo, `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n\nWe can implement this by iteratively finding `k_max`, subtracting `f(k_max)` from `p`, and adding `k_max` to `N`, until `p` becomes 0.\n\nExample: `p = 3`\n1. `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*3))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(25))/2) = floor((1+5)/2) = 3`.\n   `f(3) = 3 * 2 / 2 = 3`.\n   `p = 3 - 3 = 0`. `N = 3`.\n   Minimum nodes = 3.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*4))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(33))/2) = floor((1+5.74)/2) = floor(3.37) = 3`.\n   `f(3) = 3`.\n   `p = 4 - 3 = 1`. `N = 3`.\n2. `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*1))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(9))/2) = floor((1+3)/2) = 2`.\n   `f(2) = 1`.\n   `p = 1 - 1 = 0`. `N = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   Minimum nodes = 5.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nA unidirectional pair `(u, v)` means `u -> v` but not `v -> u`. This happens when `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange the SCCs found in Part 1 into a \"chain\" or \"line\" structure.\nLet the SCCs be `S_1, S_2, ..., S_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`.\nWe can arrange them such that there's a path from `S_i` to `S_j` if and only if `i < j`. This can be achieved by adding an edge from every node in `S_i` to every node in `S_{i+1}` (or just one edge from a node in `S_i` to a node in `S_{i+1}`, then ensuring all nodes within `S_i` and `S_{i+1}` are reachable from each other).\nIn such a structure, for any `u` in `S_i` and `v` in `S_j`:\n- If `i = j`, `(u, v)` is not unidirectional (they are in the same SCC).\n- If `i < j`, there is a path `u -> v`. There is no path `v -> u` because the graph of SCCs is a DAG with edges only `S_x -> S_y` where `x < y`. So `(u, v)` is unidirectional.\n- If `i > j`, there is no path `u -> v`.\n\nThus, the number of unidirectional pairs is the sum of `k_i * k_j` for all `i < j`.\nThis sum can be calculated as `(sum(k_i))^2 - sum(k_i^2)` which is `N^2 - sum(k_i^2)`.\nAlternatively, `sum_{i=1}^{m-1} (k_i * sum_{j=i+1}^m k_j)`.\nThis can be computed efficiently: `total_unidirectional = 0`. Maintain `suffix_sum = sum_{j=i+1}^m k_j`. Iterate `i` from `1` to `m-1`. In each step, `total_unidirectional += k_i * suffix_sum`. When moving from `i` to `i+1`, `suffix_sum` decreases by `k_{i+1}`.\n\nLet's re-calculate `k_i` values and `N` for `p` and then the unidirectional pairs.\n\nExample: `p = 3`\n1. `k=3`. `p=0`. `N=3`. SCC sizes: `[3]`.\n   `k_list = [3]`.\n   `total_unidirectional = 0`.\n   `suffix_sum = 0`.\n   Maximum unidirectional pairs = 0.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. `k=3`. `p=1`. `N=3`.\n2. `k=2`. `p=0`. `N=3+2=5`. SCC sizes: `[3, 2]`.\n   `k_list = [3, 2]`.\n   `total_unidirectional = 0`.\n   `suffix_sum = 2`. (for `k_1=3`, `sum_{j=2}^2 k_j = k_2 = 2`)\n   `total_unidirectional += k_1 * suffix_sum = 3 * 2 = 6`.\n   Maximum unidirectional pairs = 6.\n\nExample: `p = 0`\n1. `k=1`. `f(1)=0`. `p=0`. `N=1`. SCC sizes: `[1]`.\n   `k_list = [1]`.\n   `total_unidirectional = 0`.\n   Maximum unidirectional pairs = 0.\n\nThe algorithm for `p=0` needs careful thought.\nIf `p=0`, `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1))/2) = 1`. `f(1)=0`.\nSo we use an SCC of size 1. `p` remains 0. `N` becomes 1.\n`k_list = [1]`. Number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\nThis is correct. A single node graph has no `p`-pairs and no unidirectional pairs.\n\nWhat if we chose `N=0`? The problem states \"ordered pair of nodes (u, v) ... u != v\". If `N=0` or `N=1`, there are no such pairs. So `p=0` results in 0 `p`-pairs. Minimum nodes `N=1` for `p=0`.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 * 10^5`.\n`sqrt(1 + 8 * 2 * 10^5) = sqrt(1600001) approx 1265`.\n`k_max` will be around `1265 / 2 = 632`.\nThe number of SCCs `m` would be at most `p` (if all SCCs are size 2, `f(2)=1`).\nSo `m` can be up to `2 * 10^5`.\nThe loop for calculating `k_list` and `N` runs `m` times.\nThe loop for calculating unidirectional pairs also runs `m` times.\nBoth are efficient enough.\n\nLet's trace `p = 200000`:\n`k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * 200000))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(1600001))/2) = floor((1 + 1264.91)/2) = 632`.\n`f(632) = 632 * 631 / 2 = 199396`.\n`p = 200000 - 199396 = 604`. `N = 632`. `k_list = [632]`.\n\n`k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * 604))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(4833))/2) = floor((1 + 69.52)/2) = 35`.\n`f(35) = 35 * 34 / 2 = 595`.\n`p = 604 - 595 = 9`. `N = 632 + 35 = 667`. `k_list = [632, 35]`.\n\n`k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * 9))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(73))/2) = floor((1 + 8.54)/2) = 4`.\n`f(4) = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6`.\n`p = 9 - 6 = 3`. `N = 667 + 4 = 671`. `k_list = [632, 35, 4]`.\n\n`k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * 3))/2) = floor((1 + sqrt(25))/2) = 3`.\n`f(3) = 3 * 2 / 2 = 3`.\n`p = 3 - 3 = 0`. `N = 671 + 3 = 674`. `k_list = [632, 35, 4, 3]`.\n\nFinal `N = 674`.\nNow calculate unidirectional pairs:\n`k_list = [632, 35, 4, 3]`\n`suffix_sum = 35 + 4 + 3 = 42`.\n`unidir = 632 * 42 = 26544`.\n`suffix_sum = 4 + 3 = 7`.\n`unidir += 35 * 7 = 245`.\n`suffix_sum = 3`.\n`unidir += 4 * 3 = 12`.\n`total_unidirectional = 26544 + 245 + 12 = 26801`.\n\nFinal answer for `p=200000`: `674 26801`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"1 0\") # Minimum 1 node for p=0.
