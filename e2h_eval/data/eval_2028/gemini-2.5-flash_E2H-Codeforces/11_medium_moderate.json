A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Soft Drinking\" problem and craft a Python script to solve it.** My core task is to determine how many toasts each friend can enjoy, considering the limited resources of drinks, limes, and salt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: the number of friends (`n`), drink bottles (`k`), milliliters per bottle (`l`), limes (`c`), lime slices per lime (`d`), salt (`p`), and the amounts needed per friend per toast (`nl` for drink, `np` for salt). The crucial point is that all friends will have the same number of toasts.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total resources available:\n\n1.  **Total drink:** Multiply bottles (`k`) by milliliters per bottle (`l`) and divide by the drink amount needed per toast (`nl`). This gives me the maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink supply. I'm using integer division (`//`) because you can't have partial toasts.\n\n2.  **Total lime slices:** Multiply limes (`c`) by slices per lime (`d`). Since each toast requires one slice, this represents the total toast count from limes.\n\n3.  **Total salt:** Divide the total salt (`p`) by the amount needed per toast (`np`), again using integer division.\n\nThe minimum of these three quantities (drink-based toasts, lime-based toasts, and salt-based toasts) determines the maximum total toasts possible across all friends due to the resource that limits it the most.\n\nTo find the toasts per friend, I'll divide this maximum total by the number of friends (`n`).\n\nAfter some thought, this looks like a straightforward calculation based on resource constraints. With integer division in place to avoid partial toasts, the logic should be sound. I'll write the script, making it efficient and easy to read, with clear variable names and comments. Finally, to ensure its correctness, I'll test it against the example inputs.\n",
