There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Housing Profit Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The core is straightforward: maximize profit from building houses, but there are these annoying height restrictions to navigate.  Let's see, the setup is simple enough: `n` spots, each with a potential height `a` between 0 and `h`, and the profit is just `a^2` for each house.\n\nMy goal is clear: maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the individual house heights. That's the objective function. But, the constraints... that's where things get interesting.  There are these zoning restrictions, `m` of them, each defining a range `[l_i, r_i]` where all houses *within* that range have to adhere to a maximum height `x_i`.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify this.  Thinking through it, the constraint within a range means that *every* house within that range is individually restricted by the max height. If the maximum height in a given range has to be `x_i` or lower, it means each house in that range can't be taller than `x_i`. That's the crucial insight.\n\nNow, for each individual spot `j`, I need to figure out its maximum allowable height, `H_j`. This is the key to solving this problem efficiently. I know it can't exceed the global max height `h`. But, for every restriction that covers spot `j` (meaning `l_i <= j <= r_i`), I have another ceiling imposed by `x_i`. So, to get `H_j`, I need the *minimum* of `h` and all the `x_i` values that apply to that spot. If there are no restrictions at all that apply to spot `j`, `H_j` defaults to `h`.\n\nSince my profit function is the sum of squares, and the square function increases with increasing height, my instinct is that I should simply maximize the height of each house independently, within the bounds I just calculated.  So, I set `h_j` to be exactly `H_j` for all spots.\n\nNow, I want to make sure my logic is airtight. Will this assignment satisfy all constraints?  If I consider any restriction, `(l_k, r_k, x_k)`, and I choose each house within the range to be `H_j`, the maximum of that will have to be at most `x_k`. But, by definition, the height chosen at spot `j` cannot exceed `x_k`. Therefore, this should be fine. It seems that this approach provides the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `j`, we can build a house of integer height `h_j` between `0` and `h`. The profit from a house of height `h_j` is `h_j^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum allowed height `x_i` for the tallest house within that range.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `j`.\n1.  **Global Maximum Height:** The height `h_j` must be at most `h`.\n2.  **Zoning Restrictions:** For each restriction `i` given by `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, if spot `j` falls within the range `[l_i, r_i]` (i.e., `l_i \\le j \\le r_i`), then the house at spot `j` must have a height `h_j \\le x_i`. This is because if any house in the range `[l_i, r_i]` exceeds `x_i`, the \"tallest house\" restriction would be violated.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, its height `h_j` must satisfy:\n*   `h_j \\le h`\n*   `h_j \\le x_i` for all restrictions `i` such that `l_i \\le j \\le r_i`.\n\nTo maximize the profit `sum(h_j^2)`, and since `f(x) = x^2` is an increasing function for `x \\ge 0`, we should choose the largest possible height for each house `h_j` independently, while satisfying all constraints.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `j` (from `1` to `n`), the maximum possible height `max_h_j` it can have is:\n`max_h_j = min(h, min(x_i for all i such that l_i \\le j \\le r_i))`\nIf there are no restrictions covering spot `j`, then `max_h_j = h`.\n\nOnce we determine `max_h_j` for each spot `j`, we set the height of the house at spot `j` to `max_h_j`. This choice maximizes `h_j^2` for each `j`. Let's verify if this configuration satisfies all restrictions:\nConsider any restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)`. We need to ensure that `max(h_j \\text{ for } j \\in [l_k, r_k]) \\le x_k`.\nFor any `j \\in [l_k, r_k]`, our chosen height `h_j` is `max_h_j`. By definition of `max_h_j`, it includes `x_k` as one of the upper bounds because `j` is within the range `[l_k, r_k]`. Thus, `h_j \\le x_k` for all `j \\in [l_k, r_k]`. Consequently, `max(h_j \\text{ for } j \\in [l_k, r_k]) \\le x_k`. All restrictions are satisfied.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize an array `house_heights` of size `n`, where each element `house_heights[j]` stores the maximum allowed height for spot `j+1`. Initially, set all elements to `h` (the global maximum height).\n2.  Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n    For each spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive):\n    Update `house_heights[j-1] = min(house_heights[j-1], x_i)`. (Using `j-1` for 0-indexed array).\n3.  Calculate the total profit:\n    Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n    For each `height` in `house_heights`:\n    `total_profit += height * height`.\n4.  Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\nInitialize `house_heights = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3)\n\nApply restriction 1 (`l=1, r=1, x=1`):\n`house_heights[0] = min(house_heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n`house_heights` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`\n\nApply restriction 2 (`l=2, r=2, x=3`):\n`house_heights[1] = min(house_heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`\n`house_heights` remains `[1, 3, 3]`\n\nApply restriction 3 (`l=3, r=3, x=2`):\n`house_heights[2] = min(house_heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`\n`house_heights` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`\n\nCalculate total profit:\n`1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Constraints:**\n`1 <= n, h, m <= 50`\nThe approach involves:\n*   Initializing an array of size `n`: O(n)\n*   Iterating `m` restrictions. For each restriction, iterating `r_i - l_i + 1` spots. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` is `n`. So, this step is O(m * n).\n*   Calculating sum of squares: O(n)\n\nTotal time complexity: O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n).\nGiven `n, m <= 50`, `m*n <= 50*50 = 2500`.
