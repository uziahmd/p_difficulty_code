Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My approach to this problem is centered around efficiently counting non-degenerate triangles.** I recognize that brute-force triple-loop iteration is far too slow, given the constraints. The key insight is that the triangle inequality simplifies dramatically because of the ordered side constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.  This leaves us with a single critical inequality: `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought was to iterate through all possible `x` and `y` values and then determine the valid `z` values for each pair.  However, even this double loop seemed inefficient. I realized that the number of valid `z` values could be calculated in a single pass if I fix `x` and `y`.\n\nTo optimize, I looked at how the valid ranges of `z` were impacted by changing `x+y`, and I recognized that I could reduce all the counts to a single sweep across the possible sums of `x` and `y`. This allowed me to precompute the frequency of each sum using a clever difference array technique.\nThe difference array method is the real magic here. It provides an `O(B+C)` solution for `freq`, allowing me to determine how many times each sum occurs.  Then, by summing up each frequency by the number of valid `z` values that apply to that sum, I can get the final result.\n\nBy analyzing the ranges, the number of valid triangles would be `sum (freq[s] * max(0, min(D, s-1) - C+1))`, where `s = x+y` for all `x` and `y`. This is implemented by taking the difference array approach, `O(B-A+1 + B+C)`, and ultimately, as C is the limiting factor the total is just `O(C)`, where `C = 5 * 10^5`\nThis provides the most efficient count. The array approach is very useful.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` satisfying the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nThis simplifies the triangle inequalities:\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= x + y > y`. So this inequality is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= C >= B >= A >= 1`, we have `y + z >= x + z > x`. So this inequality is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nCombining all conditions, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nA naive triple loop over `x`, `y`, `z` would be too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, and then counting valid `z`.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n- `C <= z <= D` (given range)\n- `z < x + y` (from triangle inequality)\n\nSo, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nIterating `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C` would still be a double loop, which is `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`. In the worst case, this is `O(D^2)`, which is `(5 * 10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}`, too slow.\n\nA more efficient approach involves iterating over the sum `s = x + y`.\nLet `freq[s]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = s`.\nThe minimum possible value for `s` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum possible value for `s` is `B + C`.\nThe maximum value for `B + C` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\n\nThe total number of triangles is `sum_{s=A+B}^{B+C} freq[s] * (number of valid z for sum s)`.\nThe `number of valid z for sum s` is `max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nWe can compute the `freq` array efficiently using a difference array (also known as a sweep line or prefix sum on differences).\nFor each `x` in the range `[A, B]`:\n- `y` can range from `B` to `C`.\n- So `x + y` can range from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nThis means for each `x`, we add `1` to `freq[s]` for all `s` in `[x + B, x + C]`.\nUsing a difference array `diff`:\n- `diff[x + B] += 1`\n- `diff[x + C + 1] -= 1`\nWe do this for all `x` from `A` to `B`. This takes `O(B - A + 1)` time.\n\nAfter populating the `diff` array, we compute `freq[s]` by taking prefix sums:\n`freq[s] = freq[s-1] + diff[s]`.\nThis takes `O(B + C)` time, as `s` goes up to `B + C`.\nThe maximum value for `B + C` is `10^6`, so `O(10^6)` is efficient enough.\n\nOnce `freq[s]` is computed for all relevant `s` values, we iterate `s` from `A + B` to `B + C` and calculate the total count:\n`total_triangles = 0`\n`for s in range(A + B, B + C + 1):`\n  `num_z = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`\n  `total_triangles += freq[s] * num_z`\n\nThis final summation also takes `O(B + C)` time.\n\nThe overall time complexity is `O((B - A + 1) + (B + C))`, which simplifies to `O(B + C)`. Given `B, C <= 5 \\cdot 10^5`, this is `O(10^6)`, which is well within typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).\nThe maximum value of `total_triangles` can be large (up to `~6 \\cdot 10^{16}`), so Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable.\n\nExample walkthrough (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4):\n1. `max_s = B+C = 2+3 = 5`.\n2. Initialize `diff` array of size `max_s + 2 = 7` with zeros.\n3. Populate `diff` array:\n   - For `x=1`: `diff[1+2]+=1` (`diff[3]+=1`), `diff[1+3+1]-=1` (`diff[5]-=1`). `diff = [0,0,0,1,0,-1,0]`\n   - For `x=2`: `diff[2+2]+=1` (`diff[4]+=1`), `diff[2+3+1]-=1` (`diff[6]-=1`). `diff = [0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1]`\n4. Compute `freq` array of size `max_s + 1 = 6`:\n   - `s=A+B=3`: `current_freq = 0 + diff[3] = 1`. `freq[3]=1`.\n   - `s=4`: `current_freq = 1 + diff[4] = 2`. `freq[4]=2`.\n   - `s=5`: `current_freq = 2 + diff[5] = 1`. `freq[5]=1`.\n   `freq` array is `[0,0,0,1,2,1]` (indices 0-5).\n5. Calculate `total_triangles`:\n   - For `s=3`: `freq[3]=1`. `num_z = max(0, min(4, 3-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4,2) - 2) = max(0, 2-2) = 0`. `total_triangles += 1*0 = 0`.\n   - For `s=4`: `freq[4]=2`. `num_z = max(0, min(4, 4-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4,3) - 2) = max(0, 3-2) = 1`. `total_triangles += 2*1 = 2`.\n   - For `s=5`: `freq[5]=1`. `num_z = max(0, min(4, 5-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4,4) - 2) = max(0, 4-2) = 2`. `total_triangles += 1*2 = 2`.\n   Total = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
