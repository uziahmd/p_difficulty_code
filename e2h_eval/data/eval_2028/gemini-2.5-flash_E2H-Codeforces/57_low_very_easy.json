His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Olympiad Ranking Scenarios**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a ranking problem for an Olympiad.  I've got `n` participants, two rounds of scores (lists `a` and `b`), and Vasya's minimum total score, `x`. The key here is that the scores are anonymous; we don't know who scored what in which round. This means I'm dealing with pairings, and there are `n!` potential pairings, which is a combinatorial explosion I need to avoid.\n\nThe core of this is finding Vasya's *best* and *worst* possible ranks. To do this, I need to understand how the unknown pairings impact his score and his position relative to others. The problem is framed that the scores are in an *arbitrary* order, implying the matching between scores from the two rounds is not fixed.\n\nTo get his *best* rank, I need to maximize his total score while minimizing everyone else's. I'll need to figure out the optimal pairing strategy to achieve this. Conversely, to get his *worst* rank, I need to minimize his score (while staying above `x`) and maximize everyone else's.  This is about strategically arranging scores to create the most favorable and least favorable scenarios for Vasya. It looks like a classic optimization problem with a bit of a twist due to the anonymity of the scores. It feels like a greedy approach might be the key, but I need to be careful to consider edge cases and ensure the approach correctly handles the \"at least x\" constraint.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` for Vasya, and two lists of `n` scores each, one for the first tour (`a`) and one for the second tour (`b`). The scores in `a` and `b` are not matched to specific participants.\n\nThe key information is:\n1. Participants are ranked by the sum of their scores from both tours. Higher total score means a better rank.\n2. If multiple participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places arbitrarily among them. This means:\n   - For the **best rank**: If Vasya has score `S` and `k` other participants also have score `S`, Vasya can be considered to have a better rank than all `k` of them. So, his rank is 1 + (number of participants with score > `S`).\n   - For the **worst rank**: If Vasya has score `S` and `k` other participants also have score `S`, Vasya can be considered to have a worse rank than all `k` of them. So, his rank is 1 + (number of participants with score > `S`) + (number of participants with score = `S`).\n\nSince we don't know the actual pairings of scores from `a` and `b`, we need to find the best possible scenario for Vasya's rank and the worst possible scenario. The problem states that \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\" and \"it is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\". This means we need to form `n` pairs `(a_k, b_l)` using each score from `a` and `b` exactly once.\n\nLet's sort both arrays `a` and `b` in non-decreasing order.\n`a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`\n`b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`\n\n### Best Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the best rank, Vasya wants to maximize his own score and minimize the scores of other participants.\nTo maximize Vasya's score, he should take the highest possible `a_i` and `b_j` that sum up to at least `x`. Since we want to maximize his score, he should take `a_n` (the highest score in tour 1) and `b_n` (the highest score in tour 2). His score would be `a_n + b_n`. This is the maximum possible score any participant can get.\nIf Vasya gets `a_n + b_n`, what about other participants? To minimize their scores, we should pair the remaining highest `a` scores with the remaining lowest `b` scores, and vice versa. Specifically, to minimize the sums for other participants, we can pair `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}` (if `a` is sorted ascending, `b` is sorted descending). Or, if both are sorted ascending, we can pair `a_i` with `b_j` such that the sums are small.\n\nConsider the pairing strategy to maximize one person's score and minimize others. If Vasya takes `a_n` and `b_n`, his score is `a_n + b_n`. The remaining `n-1` scores in `a` are `a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` and in `b` are `b_1, ..., b_{n-1}`. To minimize the scores of others, we would match `a_i` with `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j` is small. The smallest possible sum for any pair is `a_1 + b_1`.\nHowever, the problem is simpler: to maximize Vasya's rank, we want him to have the highest possible score. The highest possible score any participant can get is `max(a_i) + max(b_j)`. Let's assume Vasya gets this score, `S_max = a_n + b_n`.\nThen, we need to count how many *other* participants could possibly get a score *greater than* `S_max`. This is impossible, as `S_max` is the absolute maximum. So, no one can have a score greater than `S_max`.\nTherefore, Vasya's best rank is 1. He can always achieve the maximum possible score (`a_n + b_n`), and by jury's decision, he can be placed first among all participants who also achieve `a_n + b_n`. The problem guarantees that `a_i + b_j >= x` for some `i, j`. This implies that Vasya can always achieve a score that is at least `x`. If `a_n + b_n < x`, this would contradict the guarantee, so `a_n + b_n >= x` must hold.\n\nSo, the best rank is always 1.\n\n### Worst Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the worst rank, Vasya wants to minimize his own score (while keeping it at least `x`) and maximize the scores of other participants.\nThis requires a specific pairing strategy.\nLet's sort `a` in non-decreasing order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in non-decreasing order: `b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`.\n\nConsider pairing `a_i` with `b_{n-i+1}` (i.e., `a_1` with `b_n`, `a_2` with `b_{n-1}`, ..., `a_n` with `b_1`). This pairing strategy is known to equalize sums as much as possible, or rather, to make the sums `a_i + b_{n-i+1}` as close to each other as possible. If we want to maximize the scores of *others*, this strategy is good because it prevents any single person from getting a very low score.\n\nLet's form the `n` pairs `(a_i, b_{n-i+1})` for `i = 1, ..., n`.\nThe sums will be `S_i = a_i + b_{n-i+1}`.\nLet these sums be `P = {S_1, S_2, ..., S_n}`.\nNow, Vasya is one of these participants. We know his score `S_Vasya` must be at least `x`.\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we assume he gets the smallest possible score `S_Vasya` from `P` such that `S_Vasya >= x`. Let this be `S_min_valid`.\nThen, Vasya's worst rank would be 1 + (count of scores in `P` strictly greater than `S_min_valid`) + (count of scores in `P` equal to `S_min_valid`).\n\nLet's make this more concrete.\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Create `n` pairs `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})` for `i` from `0` to `n-1` (using 0-based indexing).\n   This means `(a[0], b[n-1])`, `(a[1], b[n-2])`, ..., `(a[n-1], b[0])`.\n4. Calculate the sum for each pair: `sum_k = a[k] + b[n-1-k]`.\n5. Collect these `n` sums into a list `scores`.\n6. Sort `scores` in descending order.\n7. Iterate through the `scores` list to find Vasya's worst rank:\n   Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n   For each `score_val` in `scores`:\n     If `score_val >= x`:\n       `worst_rank += 1`\n     Else (`score_val < x`):\n       Break (because `scores` is sorted descending, all subsequent scores will also be `< x`).\n   This `worst_rank` is the number of participants whose score is at least `x` under this specific pairing. Since Vasya is one of them, and the jury can place him last among those with score `S_Vasya`, this count represents his worst possible rank.\n\nLet's verify this pairing strategy for worst rank.\nSuppose Vasya gets `a_k + b_{n-1-k}`. We want to maximize the number of people who score `S >= x`.\nBy pairing `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}`, we are essentially trying to make the sums as \"middle-ish\" as possible.\nConsider an alternative pairing: `(a_0, b_0), (a_1, b_1), ...`. This would create very low sums and very high sums. If Vasya gets a high sum, his rank is good. If he gets a low sum (but still `>= x`), then many others might get even lower sums, improving his rank.\nThe `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}` pairing (also known as the \"min-max\" pairing or \"opposite sort\" pairing) is a standard technique in competitive programming to find the maximum number of pairs satisfying a condition, or to find the minimum/maximum of a specific element under certain constraints. In this case, it helps to maximize the number of participants who score at least `x`.\n\nLet's test with the example:\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nBest rank: 1 (as discussed).\nWorst rank:\n1. Sort `a`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n2. Sort `b`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n3. Pair `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})`:\n   `(a[0], b[4]) = (1, 1) -> sum = 2`\n   `(a[1], b[3]) = (1, 1) -> sum = 2`\n   `(a[2], b[2]) = (1, 1) -> sum = 2`\n   `(a[3], b[1]) = (1, 1) -> sum = 2`\n   `(a[4], b[0]) = (1, 1) -> sum = 2`\n4. `scores = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n5. Sort `scores` descending: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n6. Iterate:\n   `score_val = 2`. `2 >= x` (which is 2). `worst_rank = 1`.\n   `score_val = 2`. `2 >= x`. `worst_rank = 2`.\n   `score_val = 2`. `2 >= x`. `worst_rank = 3`.\n   `score_val = 2`. `2 >= x`. `worst_rank = 4`.\n   `score_val = 2`. `2 >= x`. `worst_rank = 5`.\nResult: `1 5`. Matches example output.\n\nSecond example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\nBest rank: 1 (as discussed).\nWorst rank:\n1. Sort `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n2. Sort `b`: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n3. Pair `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})`:\n   `(a[0], b[5]) = (3, 8) -> sum = 11`\n   `(a[1], b[4]) = (4, 6) -> sum = 10`\n   `(a[2], b[3]) = (4, 4) -> sum = 8`\n   `(a[3], b[2]) = (4, 4) -> sum = 8`\n   `(a[4], b[1]) = (5, 3) -> sum = 8`\n   `(a[5], b[0]) = (6, 0) -> sum = 6`\n4. `scores = [11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\n5. Sort `scores` descending (already sorted from step 3 if we add them in this order): `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\n6. Iterate, `x=7`:\n   `score_val = 11`. `11 >= 7`. `worst_rank = 1`.\n   `score_val = 10`. `10 >= 7`. `worst_rank = 2`.\n   `score_val = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `worst_rank = 3`.\n   `score_val = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `worst_rank = 4`.\n   `score_val = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `worst_rank = 5`.\n   `score_val = 6`. `6 < 7`. Break.\nResult: `1 5`.
