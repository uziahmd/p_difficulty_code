Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to find the longest substring that repeats at least twice within a given string. The input string will only contain lowercase Latin letters and have a maximum length of 100. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, which is important to remember.\n\nGiven the constraints (string length at most 100), a brute-force approach seems perfectly viable and probably the easiest to implement.  Here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\n1.  **Iterate Through Substrings:** I'll need to generate all possible substrings of the input string.\n2.  **Count Occurrences:** For each generated substring, I'll count how many times it appears in the original string.\n3.  **Check for Duplicates:** If the count for a particular substring is 2 or more, I'll consider its length as a potential maximum.\n4.  **Track Maximum:** I'll maintain a variable to store the longest substring length found so far, updating it whenever I find a longer repeating substring.\n\n**The Algorithm in Detail**\n\nLet's nail down the algorithm I'll use:\n\n1.  Initialize `max_len = 0`. This will store the length of the longest repeating substring.\n2.  Iterate through the string with nested loops. The outer loop will start at index `i` from `0` up to `N-1` (where N is the string's length), representing the starting point of the substring.\n3.  The inner loop will start at index `j` from `i` up to `N-1`, representing the ending point of the substring.  This defines a substring `sub = s[i:j+1]`.\n4.  For each `sub`, I'll count its occurrences within the original string. A straightforward way to do this is to iterate through the string again (with another loop with index `k`), checking if `s[k:k+len(sub)]` is equal to `sub`.\n5.  If the `count` is greater than or equal to 2, I'll update `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the current substring (`len(sub)`).\n\n**Illustrative Example: \"ababa\"**\n\nThinking through an example helps clarify. Let's use the string \"ababa\":\n\n*   `N = 5` and `max_len = 0` initially.\n*   `i = 0`:\n    *   `j = 0`: `sub = \"a\"`. Count of \"a\" in \"ababa\" is 3. `max_len` becomes 1.\n    *   `j = 1`: `sub = \"ab\"`. Count of \"ab\" is 2. `max_len` becomes 2.\n    *   `j = 2`: `sub = \"aba\"`. Count of \"aba\" is 2. `max_len` becomes 3.\n    *   `j = 3`: `sub = \"abab\"`. Count of \"abab\" is 1. No change.\n    *   `j = 4`: `sub = \"ababa\"`. Count of \"ababa\" is 1. No change.\n*   `i = 1`:\n    *   `j = 1`: `sub = \"b\"`. Count of \"b\" is 2. `max_len` remains 3.\n    *   `j = 2`: `sub = \"ba\"`. Count of \"ba\" is 2. `max_len` remains 3.\n    *   ...and so on...\n\nFollowing this process, eventually, I will find that the longest repeating substring is \"aba\" (or \"ba\" which is same length) with a length of 3.  The example reinforces that the algorithm covers all possible substrings.  Alright, let's code this up!\n",
