    "thought": "**Algorithm Design for Minimizing LCM(a+k, b+k)**\n\nAlright, here's my strategy for tackling this competitive programming problem. The core of it revolves around a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM). We're given two integers, `a` and `b`, and we need to find a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes `lcm(a+k, b+k)`.\n\nFirst, I define `D = abs(b-a)`. A key observation is that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` *must* be a divisor of `D`. This stems from the Euclidean algorithm and the fact that `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`. This means that we don't have to check *every* possible GCD; we only need to consider the divisors of `D`. This reduces the search space significantly.\n\nNow, for each divisor `d` of `D`, I'll attempt to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `d`.  The formula for this smallest `k` is `k = (d - (a % d)) % d`. This choice guarantees that both `a+k` and `b+k` are divisible by `d`. The beauty of this is that it ensures we're exploring all possible GCD values (divisors of D).\n\nFor each `k` derived from the divisors, I calculate the `lcm(a+k, b+k)`. To compute the LCM efficiently, I use the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. Calculating the GCD involves the `math.gcd` function. Now, it's crucial here to use integer division with the `//` operator to avoid potential floating-point errors. This ensures precision.\n\nThe goal is to iterate through *all* divisors of `D` with this method, keeping track of the best `k` that yielded the *smallest* LCM. I'll also manage the case where the calculated LCMs are equal; then I will choose the smallest `k`.\n\nSo, here's the detailed breakdown, for each divisor:\n1.  Calculate `k` such that both numbers are a multiple of `d`.\n2.  Calculate the `lcm` with `k`.\n3.  Store the minimum `lcm` and respective `k`.\n\nFor edge cases where `D = 0` (meaning `a == b`), the optimal `k` is simply `0`. The final `k` that gives us the smallest LCM will be returned.\n\nTo optimize the divisor finding, a function is used that iterates from 1 to the square root of `D`. For each divisor `i`, both `i` and `D/i` are considered to be a divisor.\n\nThis systematic approach minimizes the computational cost, allowing us to find the optimal `k` efficiently, without any nasty surprises.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If there are multiple `k` values that yield the same minimum `lcm`, we should choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of the greatest common divisor is `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`.\nApplying this, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nLet `D = abs(b-a)`. Then `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, D)`.\nThis implies that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `D`.\n\nThis observation is crucial: for any `k`, the `gcd(a+k, b+k)` value must be one of the divisors of `D`.\nLet `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Then `g` must divide `D`.\nAlso, `a+k` must be a multiple of `g`.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible values of `g`. Since `g` must be a divisor of `D`, we can find all divisors of `D`. For each divisor `d` of `D`, we consider it as a potential `gcd` value.\n\nFor a fixed divisor `d` of `D`:\nWe need `a+k` to be a multiple of `d`. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this condition is `k_cand = (d - (a % d)) % d`.\nWith this `k_cand`, `a+k_cand` is a multiple of `d`.\nSince `b+k_cand = (a+k_cand) + D`, and `d` divides `D` (by definition of `d`), `b+k_cand` will also be a multiple of `d`.\nSo, for this `k_cand`, `d` is a common divisor of `a+k_cand` and `b+k_cand`.\nThe actual `gcd(a+k_cand, b+k_cand)` might be greater than `d` (it will be a multiple of `d` and also a divisor of `D`). Let `g_actual = gcd(a+k_cand, b+k_cand)`.\nThe `lcm` for this `k_cand` will be `(a+k_cand)(b+k_cand) / g_actual`.\n\nWhy is it sufficient to only consider `k_cand = (d - (a % d)) % d` for each divisor `d`?\nSuppose the optimal `k_opt` yields `gcd(a+k_opt, b+k_opt) = g_opt`. We know `g_opt` is a divisor of `D`.\nThe value `k_cand` we find for `d = g_opt` is `k_{g_opt} = (g_opt - (a % g_opt)) % g_opt`. This `k_{g_opt}` is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g_opt`.\nAny other `k'` that makes `a+k'` a multiple of `g_opt` must be of the form `k_{g_opt} + M \\cdot g_opt` for some integer `M \\ge 0`.\nFor any such `k'`, `gcd(a+k', b+k') = gcd(a+k_{g_opt} + M \\cdot g_opt, b+k_{g_opt} + M \\cdot g_opt)`.\nSince `g_opt` divides `D`, we have `gcd(a+k', D) = gcd(a+k_{g_opt} + M \\cdot g_opt, D) = gcd(a+k_{g_opt}, D)`.\nSo, `gcd(a+k', b+k')` will be the same as `gcd(a+k_{g_opt}, b+k_{g_opt})`.\nLet this common `gcd` be `g_val`.\nThen `lcm(a+k', b+k') = (a+k')(b+k') / g_val`.\nSince `a+k'` and `b+k'` are increasing functions of `k'`, `(a+k')(b+k')` is minimized when `k'` is minimized. Thus, for a fixed `g_val`, `k_{g_opt}` will yield the smallest `lcm`.\nTherefore, we only need to check the `k_cand` values derived from each divisor `d` of `D`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Handle the edge case `a=b`: If `a=b`, then `D=0`. `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. `lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k` for `k \\ge 0`, we choose `k=0`. The result is `0`.\n2. Calculate `D = abs(b-a)`.\n3. Find all divisors of `D`. This can be done by iterating from `1` up to `sqrt(D)`. If `i` divides `D`, then `i` and `D/i` are both divisors. Store them in a list.\n4. Initialize `min_lcm = infinity` and `best_k = 0`.\n5. For each divisor `d` in the list of divisors of `D`:\n    a. Calculate `k_cand = (d - (a % d)) % d`. This is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `d`.\n    b. Let `num1 = a + k_cand` and `num2 = b + k_cand`.\n    c. Calculate `current_gcd = gcd(num1, num2)`.\n    d. Calculate `current_lcm = (num1 // current_gcd) * num2`. (Using integer division first `num1 // current_gcd` prevents potential overflow if `num1 * num2` is very large, although Python's arbitrary precision integers make this less critical.)\n    e. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n        Update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_cand`.\n    f. If `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n        Update `best_k = min(best_k, k_cand)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k`.\n6. Print `best_k`.\n\nExample `a=6, b=10`:\n`D = abs(10-6) = 4`.\nDivisors of `4`: `1, 2, 4`.\n- `d=1`: `k_cand = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = 0`. `num1=6, num2=10`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm=(6//2)*10=30`. `min_lcm=30, best_k=0`.\n- `d=2`: `k_cand = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = 0`. `num1=6, num2=10`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm=(6//2)*10=30`. `min(0,0)=0`. `best_k=0`.\n- `d=4`: `k_cand = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = 2`. `num1=8, num2=12`. `gcd(8,12)=4`. `lcm=(8//4)*12=24`. `24 < 30`, so `min_lcm=24, best_k=2`.\nResult: `2`.\n\nThe maximum value for `D` is `10^9 - 1`. Finding divisors up to `sqrt(10^9)` (`~31622`) is efficient. The number of divisors for `N <= 10^9` is at most `1344`. For each divisor, `gcd` calculation is logarithmic. This approach is well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    diff = abs(b - a)\n\n    # Function to find all divisors of a number\n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divs = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divs.add(i)\n                divs.add(n // i)\n        return sorted(list(divs))\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(diff)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        # k_cand is the smallest non-negative k such that a+k is a multiple of d\n        k_cand = (d - (a % d)) % d\n        \n        num1 = a + k_cand\n        num2 = b + k_cand\n        \n        current_gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n        \n        # Calculate LCM: (num1 * num2) // current_gcd\n        # Use (num1 // current_gcd) * num2 to avoid potential overflow if num1*num2 is very large,\n        # though Python handles large integers automatically.\n        current_lcm = (num1 // current_gcd) * num2\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_cand\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            # If LCMs are equal, choose the smallest k\n            best_k = min(best_k, k_cand)\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
