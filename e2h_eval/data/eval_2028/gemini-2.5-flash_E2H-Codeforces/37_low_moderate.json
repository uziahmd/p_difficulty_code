    "thought": "**Gluttony Problem - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem. Seems straightforward on the surface, but there's a specific constraint about subset sums that I need to be careful with. The goal is to rearrange an array `a` into a new array `b`, making sure that no non-empty proper subset of indices in `a` has the same sum as the corresponding subset in `b`. And `b` *must* be a permutation of `a`.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand this subset sum condition. I have to make sure the sums of every possible non-empty, proper subset of indices in `a` is different from the sum of the corresponding subsets in `b`. That's the crux.\n\nThe problem also hints that this is solvable for up to n=22. That probably means the solution doesn't have an exponential runtime complexity - I don't need to try every single permutation.  I might be able to find a pattern or use some kind of clever ordering.\n\nLet's break it down to see if there's an obvious starting point.\n\nWhen `n=1`, there's no way to create a non-empty proper subset, so any `b` works, and because `b` must be a permutation of `a`, it's just `b=a`.\n\nFor `n=2`, I have two elements.  I need to ensure the sum of the first element in `a` is different from the sum of the first element in `b`, and same for the second elements.  A simple swap works here: `b = [a[1], a[0]]`.\n\nWith these small examples in mind, let me see if I can find a general solution approach. I'll focus on finding a pattern or algorithm that avoids excessive computation, possibly using bit manipulation or ordering the elements carefully.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a[i]` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b[i]` for `i` in `S`. The constraints are `n <= 22` and `a_i <= 10^9`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)`.\nThe total sum of elements in `a` and `b` is the same, since `b` is a permutation of `a`. Let this sum be `TOTAL_SUM`.\nIf `S` is a non-empty proper subset of indices, then its complement `S'` (indices not in `S`) is also a non-empty proper subset of indices.\nThe condition `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)` is equivalent to:\n`TOTAL_SUM - sum(a[i] for i in S') != TOTAL_SUM - sum(b[i] for i in S')`\nwhich simplifies to `sum(a[i] for i in S') != sum(b[i] for i in S')`.\nThis means that if the condition holds for a subset `S`, it also holds for its complement `S'`. So we only need to consider subsets `S` with `0 < |S| <= n/2`.\n\nConsider the simplest non-trivial permutation: cyclically shifting the elements.\nLet `a` be sorted: `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nLet `b` be `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nThis means `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}`.\nSo, `b_i` is never equal to `a_i` unless `n=1` (where `(i+1)%1 == i`).\nFor `n=1`, `a=[x]`, `b=[x]` is the only permutation. There are no subsets `S` with `0 < |S| < 1`. So `b=a` works.\n\nFor `n > 1`, `a_i != b_i` for all `i`. This ensures that for any singleton subset `{i}`, `a_i != b_i`.\n\nLet's check if this cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` always works.\nSuppose for some subset `S`, `sum(a[i] for i in S) == sum(b[i] for i in S)`.\nSubstituting `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}`:\n`sum(a[i] for i in S) == sum(a_{(i+1)%n} for i in S)`.\n\nLet's try the example `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\nSorted `a`: `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\nCyclic shift `b`: `[10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\nThis is a valid answer according to the example output (up to reordering the output elements). The example output `100 1 1000 10` is a cyclic shift of `1 10 100 1000` starting from `100`.\n\nConsider the sum `sum(a[i] - b[i] for i in S) = 0`.\nThis is `sum(a[i] - a_{(i+1)%n} for i in S) = 0`.\nIf `a` is sorted, `a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}` is generally negative, except for `a_{n-1} - a_0` which is positive.\nFor example, if `S = {0, 1, ..., k-1}` for `k < n`:\n`sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{k-1} - a_k) = a_0 - a_k`.\nThis sum is `0` only if `a_0 = a_k`, which is impossible since `a` has distinct elements and `k > 0`.\nThis argument works for `S` being a prefix of indices (after sorting `a`).\n\nWhat if `S` is not a prefix?\nLet `P_S = sum_{i in S} a_i` and `Q_S = sum_{i in S} a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nWe want `P_S != Q_S`.\nConsider the values `a_i`. If they are very spread out (e.g., powers of 2, or values with large differences), then sums tend to be unique.\nThe maximum value of `n` is `22`. This often hints at exponential time complexity solutions like `O(n * 2^n)` or `O(n^2 * 2^{n/2})`.\nHowever, the cyclic shift approach is `O(N log N)` (for sorting) or `O(N)` if `a` is already sorted. This is much faster.\n\nLet's prove that `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}` (after sorting `a`) always works.\nSort `a` in ascending order: `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nDefine `b` as `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nAssume for contradiction that there exists a non-empty proper subset `S` of indices such that `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} b_i`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a_i - b_i) = 0`.\nSubstituting `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}`:\n`sum_{i in S} (a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}) = 0`.\n\nLet `d_i = a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nFor `0 <= i < n-1`, `a_i < a_{i+1}`, so `d_i = a_i - a_{i+1} < 0`.\nFor `i = n-1`, `d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`.\n\nSo we have:\n`d_0 = a_0 - a_1 < 0`\n`d_1 = a_1 - a_2 < 0`\n...\n`d_{n-2} = a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} < 0`\n`d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`\n\nThe sum of all `d_i` is `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_0) = 0`.\n\nNow we are looking for a subset `S` (where `0 < |S| < n`) such that `sum_{i in S} d_i = 0`.\nSince `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i = 0`, this means `sum_{i in S} d_i = -sum_{i not in S} d_i`.\nIf `sum_{i in S} d_i = 0`, then `sum_{i not in S} d_i = 0` as well.\nThis means if such a subset `S` exists, its complement `S'` also satisfies the condition.\nSince `0 < |S| < n`, `S'` is also a non-empty proper subset.\nTherefore, we can assume without loss of generality that `n-1` is in `S` (otherwise, consider `S'`).\nIf `n-1` is not in `S`, then all `d_i` for `i` in `S` are negative. The sum of negative numbers cannot be zero.\nSo `n-1` must be in `S`.\nIf `n-1` is in `S`, then `d_{n-1} > 0` contributes a positive value to the sum.\nFor the sum `sum_{i in S} d_i` to be zero, `S` must contain at least one `i < n-1` such that `d_i < 0`.\nSo `S` must contain `n-1` and at least one `i < n-1`.\nThis means `S` contains both positive and negative `d_i` terms.\n\nThis is a known property for cyclic shifts of sorted arrays. The condition `sum_{i in S} (a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}) = 0` implies `S` must be empty or contain all indices.\nA formal proof of this property:\nAssume `sum_{i in S} (a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}) = 0`.\nLet `A_S = {a_i | i \\in S}` and `A_{S'} = {a_i | i \\in S'}` where `S'` is the set of indices `{(i+1)%n | i \\in S}`.\nThe equation is `sum_{x \\in A_S} x = sum_{y \\in A_{S'}} y`.\nSince `a` is sorted and distinct, the only way for this equality to hold for `0 < |S| < n` is if `S` is empty or `S` contains all indices. This is a subtle point related to the structure of `a_i` and `a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nThe elements `a_i` are distinct. The set of elements `{a_i | i \\in S}` must be equal to the set of elements `{a_{(i+1)%n} | i \\in S}` for the sums to be equal.\nThis is because if `sum(X) = sum(Y)` for two sets of distinct numbers `X` and `Y`, and `X` is not equal to `Y`, then `X` and `Y` must differ by at least two elements. For example, `X = {1, 4}, Y = {2, 3}`.\nHowever, in our case, the elements `a_{(i+1)%n}` are just a permutation of `a_i`.\nIf `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_{(i+1)%n}`, this means that the multiset `{a_i | i \\in S}` is equal to the multiset `{a_{(i+1)%n} | i \\in S}`. Since all `a_i` are distinct, this implies the sets are equal.\nSo, `\\{a_i | i \\in S\\} = \\{a_{(i+1)%n} | i \\in S\\}`.\nLet `f(i) = (i+1)%n`. Then we need `\\{a_i | i \\in S\\} = \\{a_{f(i)} | i \\in S\\}`.\nThis means that the mapping `i -> f(i)` restricted to `S` must be a permutation of `S`.\nThe permutation `f` on `{0, ..., n-1}` consists of a single cycle `0 -> 1 -> ... -> n-1 -> 0`.\nIf `S` is a non-empty proper subset of `{0, ..., n-1}`, then `f` restricted to `S` cannot map `S` to itself.\nIf `f(S) = S`, then `S` must be a union of cycles of `f`. Since `f` has only one cycle, `S` must be the entire set `{0, ..., n-1}` (or empty).\nThis contradicts `0 < |S| < n`.\nTherefore, `\\{a_i | i \\in S\\} != \\{a_{(i+1)%n} | i \\in S\\}` for any non-empty proper subset `S`.\nSince the sets are not equal, and their elements are distinct, their sums cannot be equal.\nThis proves that the cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}` of the sorted array `a` always satisfies the condition.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Store pairs `(a_i, i)` to remember original indices.\n4. Sort these pairs based on `a_i`. Let the sorted values be `sorted_a_values` and their original indices be `sorted_a_original_indices`.\n   `sorted_a = [(value_0, orig_idx_0), (value_1, orig_idx_1), ..., (value_{n-1}, orig_idx_{n-1})]`\n   where `value_0 < value_1 < ... < value_{n-1}`.\n5. Construct the result array `b` of size `n`.\n6. For each `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   The element at `sorted_a[k]` (which is `value_k` at `orig_idx_k`) should be replaced by the element `value_{(k+1)%n}` (which is `sorted_a[(k+1)%n][0]`).\n   So, `b[sorted_a[k][1]] = sorted_a[(k+1)%n][0]`.\n7. Print the elements of `b`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n\n1. `n = 4`\n2. `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n3. Pairs `(value, original_index)`: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n4. Sort by value:\n   `sorted_a = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   `value_0=1, orig_idx_0=3`\n   `value_1=10, orig_idx_1=2`\n   `value_2=100, orig_idx_2=1`\n   `value_3=1000, orig_idx_3=0`\n5. `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (initialized)\n6. Construct `b`:\n   `k = 0`: `sorted_a[0]` is `(1, 3)`. Original index is `3`.\n     `b[3] = sorted_a[(0+1)%4][0] = sorted_a[1][0] = 10`.\n     `b = [0, 0, 0, 10]`\n   `k = 1`: `sorted_a[1]` is `(10, 2)`. Original index is `2`.\n     `b[2] = sorted_a[(1+1)%4][0] = sorted_a[2][0] = 100`.\n     `b = [0, 0, 100, 10]`\n   `k = 2`: `sorted_a[2]` is `(100, 1)`. Original index is `1`.\n     `b[1] = sorted_a[(2+1)%4][0] = sorted_a[3][0] = 1000`.\n     `b = [0, 1000, 100, 10]`\n   `k = 3`: `sorted_a[3]` is `(1000, 0)`. Original index is `0`.\n     `b[0] = sorted_a[(3+1)%4][0] = sorted_a[0][0] = 1`.\n     `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`\n7. Print `b`: `1 1000 100 10`.\nThis is a valid answer. The example output was `100 1 1000 10`, which is also a cyclic shift of the sorted array `[1, 10, 100, 1000]` but shifted differently. The specific cyclic shift does not matter as long as it's a cyclic shift. The one implemented here is `a_i` maps to `a_{(i+1)%n}` based on sorted order.\n\nThe time complexity will be `O(N log N)` due to sorting, which is efficient enough for `N=22`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Edge case n=1: The condition 0 < k < n means no subsets are checked.\n    # Any permutation works, and only b=a is possible.\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Store (value, original_index) pairs\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort based on values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Create the result array b\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Apply the cyclic shift: b[original_index_of_a_k] = value_of_a_{k+1}\n    # where a_k is the k-th smallest element in the original array.\n    for k in range(n):\n        current_val, original_idx = indexed_a[k]\n        \n        # The value that replaces current_val is the next value in sorted order\n        # (or the smallest value if current_val is the largest).\n        next_val_in_sorted_order = indexed_a[(k + 1) % n][0]\n        \n        # Place this next_val at the original position of current_val\n        b[original_idx] = next_val_in_sorted_order\n\n    print(*(b))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
