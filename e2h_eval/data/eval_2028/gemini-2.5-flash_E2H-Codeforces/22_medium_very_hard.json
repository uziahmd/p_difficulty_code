After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's the plan for solving the \"Marks\" problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to read the input: the number of students (`n`) and subjects (`m`), and then their marks, which I'll store as a list of lists of integers for easy access.\n\nNext, I need to find the maximum mark for each subject. I'll iterate through each subject (column) and keep track of the highest mark seen so far. I'll store these maximum marks in a separate list.\n\nThen, I'll go through each student (row) and check if they are best at *any* subject.  For each student, I'll compare their mark in each subject to the maximum mark for that subject. If they match, the student is successful, and I mark them as such. Once I find one such subject, I can skip checking the rest for that student.\n\nFinally, I'll just count how many students are marked as successful.  That's my answer! The complexity of this should be O(n*m), which is good enough, since n and m are limited to 100. Let's get to coding!\n",
