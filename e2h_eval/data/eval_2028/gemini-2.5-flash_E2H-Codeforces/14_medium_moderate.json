    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands. The goal is to find all positive integers 'n' whose factorial, n!, ends with exactly 'm' zeroes. We need to output the count of these 'n' values and list them. The core challenge is efficiently calculating the number of trailing zeroes in n!. That's directly linked to the number of factors of 5 in n! (since there will always be more factors of 2 than 5).\n\n**Deconstructing Trailing Zeroes**\n\nTo count trailing zeroes, I'm thinking of Legendre's formula. It says the number of trailing zeroes is the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...  This sums up the contributions from powers of 5. Let's represent this function as Z(n). We're looking for n values where Z(n) equals the given 'm'.\n\n**Analyzing the Function Z(n)**\n\nZ(n) is a non-decreasing function; as 'n' increases, Z(n) either stays the same or increases. It only jumps when 'n' is a multiple of 5. For example, Z(4) = 0, Z(5) = 1, Z(9) = 1, Z(10) = 2. These jumps happen because multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., add factors of 5 to the factorial. The jumps can be by more than one when 'n' is a multiple of a higher power of 5, like 25, which contributes an extra factor of 5.\n\n**Problem Range and Search Strategy**\n\nThe constraint on 'm' is important: 1 <= m <= 100000.  If Z(n) = m, then n/5 is roughly 'm', so 'n' should be roughly 4m to 5m. For example, when m = 100000, 'n' would be around 400000 to 500000. The key strategy is to use binary search because Z(n) is non-decreasing. I'll search for the smallest 'n' where Z(n) >= m. The search space would be from 1 to 5 * m, which should be sufficient.\n\n**Implementation with Binary Search and Function**\n\nI'll write a Python function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` to calculate Z(n) efficiently. This function will use Legendre's formula in an iterative manner.\n\nBinary search will then be used to find the smallest 'n', say `n_start`, such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n_start) >= m`. I'll set low = 1, high = 5 * m, and repeatedly refine the search range based on comparisons with m.\n\n**Finding the Exact Solutions**\n\nOnce the binary search is complete, there are two scenarios.\n\nIf `count_trailing_zeroes(n_start)` is exactly 'm', we've found a valid solution. I know that because the trailing zeros jump when n is a multiple of 5. `n_start` will then be a number that is a multiple of 5. All n in the range of `n_start` to `n_start + 4` will have the same trailing zeroes (equal to 'm') - because each value will equal m and the the next 5 after those will equal the next power.\nThis means there are exactly 5 solutions (`n_start`, `n_start + 1`, `n_start + 2`, `n_start + 3`, and `n_start + 4`). I can print \"5\" followed by these 5 values.\n\nIf `count_trailing_zeroes(n_start)` is greater than 'm', this means that there's no integer 'n' whose factorial has exactly m zeros. In that case, I will print \"0\".\n\nI will be careful about integer overflow when calculating Z(n) (powers of 5).\n\nAfter doing all this, I'll have a complete solution, and my confidence is high!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is solely determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nThe number of factors of 5 in `n!` can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n**Properties of Z(n)**\n\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. For example, `Z(4) = 0`, `Z(5) = 1`, `Z(9) = 1`, `Z(10) = 2`.\n3.  If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) = Z(n-1)`.\n4.  If `n` is a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) > Z(n-1)`. Specifically, `Z(n)` increases by at least 1. If `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`, it increases by `k` compared to `Z(n-1)`.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nWe are looking for `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\n\n1.  **Estimate the range for `n`**: `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`. So, if `Z(n) = m`, then `n` is approximately `4m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` could be around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for `n` would be `5m`. So, `n` can range from 1 up to `5 * 100,000 = 500,000`.\n\n2.  **Binary Search**: Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n_start` such that `Z(n_start) >= m`.\n    *   Initialize `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m`.\n    *   In each step, calculate `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n    *   If `Z(mid) < m`, we need a larger `n`, so set `low = mid + 1`.\n    *   If `Z(mid) >= m`, `mid` is a potential candidate for `n_start` (or a larger `n` than `n_start`), so we store `mid` as `n_start` and try to find an even smaller `n` by setting `high = mid - 1`.\n\n3.  **Analyze `n_start`**: After the binary search, `n_start` will hold the smallest integer `n` for which `Z(n) >= m`.\n    *   **Case 1: `Z(n_start) == m`**\n        If `Z(n_start) = m`, and `n_start` is the *smallest* such `n`, then `Z(n_start - 1)` must be less than `m`. This implies that `n_start` *must* be a multiple of 5. (If `n_start` were not a multiple of 5, then `Z(n_start) = Z(n_start - 1)`, which would contradict `Z(n_start - 1) < m`.)\n        Since `n_start` is a multiple of 5 and `Z(n_start) = m`, then `Z(n_start + 1)`, `Z(n_start + 2)`, `Z(n_start + 3)`, `Z(n_start + 4)` will all also be `m` (because none of `n_start+1` through `n_start+4` are multiples of 5).\n        However, `Z(n_start + 5)` will be strictly greater than `m` (since `n_start + 5` is the next multiple of 5).\n        Therefore, there are exactly 5 such values of `n`: `n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`.\n        We print `5` and then these 5 integers.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `Z(n_start) > m`**\n        This means that `m` falls into a \"gap\" where `Z(n)` jumps over `m`. For example, if `Z(24) = 4` and `Z(25) = 6`, and `m = 5`, then `n_start` would be 25, and `Z(25) = 6 > 5`. In this situation, there is no `n` for which `Z(n) = m`.\n        We print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1)**\n\n1.  `m = 1`.\n2.  `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function:\n    ```python\n    def count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n        count = 0\n        power_of_5 = 5\n        while n >= power_of_5:\n            count += n // power_of_5\n            power_of_5 *= 5\n        return count\n    ```\n3.  Binary search for smallest `n_start` where `Z(n_start) >= 1`:\n    *   `low = 1`, `high = 5 * 1 = 5`. `n_start = -1`.\n    *   `mid = (1+5)//2 = 3`. `Z(3) = 0`. `0 < 1`. `low = 4`.\n    *   `low = 4`, `high = 5`. `mid = (4+5)//2 = 4`. `Z(4) = 0`. `0 < 1`. `low = 5`.\n    *   `low = 5`, `high = 5`. `mid = (5+5)//2 = 5`. `Z(5) = 1`. `1 >= 1`. `n_start = 5`. `high = 4`.\n    *   `low = 5`, `high = 4`. Loop terminates.\n4.  `n_start = 5`. `count_trailing_zeroes(5) = 1`. This is equal to `m`.\n5.  Output `5` and then `5 6 7 8 9`.\n\nThis matches the example output and covers the logic for all cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.\n    This is equivalent to the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n    Uses Legendre's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    power_of_5 = 5\n    while n >= power_of_5:\n        count += n // power_of_5\n        power_of_5 *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n_start such that count_trailing_zeroes(n_start) >= m.\n    # The number of trailing zeroes Z(n) is roughly n/4.\n    # So, if Z(n) = m, then n is roughly 4m.\n    # A safe upper bound for n is 5m (e.g., for m=100_000, n can be around 400_000).\n    low = 1\n    high = 5 * m \n    n_start = -1 # This variable will store the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        \n        if zeroes < m:\n            # mid is too small; we need a larger n to get at least m zeroes.\n            low = mid + 1\n        else: # zeroes >= m\n            # mid might be the smallest n that gives at least m zeroes,\n            # or we might find an even smaller n.\n            n_start = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # After the binary search, n_start holds the smallest integer n\n    # such that n! has at least m trailing zeroes.\n\n    # Now, check if this n_start actually produces exactly m zeroes.\n    if n_start != -1 and count_trailing_zeroes(n_start) == m:\n        # If count_trailing_zeroes(n_start) == m, and n_start is the smallest n\n        # for which Z(n) >= m, then Z(n_start - 1) must be strictly less than m.\n        # This implies that n_start must be a multiple of 5.
