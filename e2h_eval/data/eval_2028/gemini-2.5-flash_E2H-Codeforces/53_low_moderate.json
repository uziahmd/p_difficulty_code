Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Longest Repeating Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this string, and I need to find the longest substring that repeats itself at least twice. The constraints are pretty straightforward: lowercase letters, length up to 100. That means I can probably get away with a brute-force approach, which is often a good starting point.\n\nFirst, I need to define the search space. The longest a repeating substring can be is one character shorter than the input string (`n-1`), and the shortest is just a single character. If no substring repeats, then the answer is zero.\n\nMy strategy will be to work from the longest possible length down to the shortest. For each length, I'll systematically look for substrings of that length within the string. If I find a substring that appears at least twice, I've got my answer. Because I'm going in descending order, the *first* such length I find will be the *longest* possible one. I can stop there.\n\nHere's the plan in more detail:\n\n1.  I'll start by checking the input string's length, if it's 1 or less, then it is impossible to have repeated substrings, and I'll return 0, no matter what.\n2.  I'll initialize `max_len` to 0. This variable will store the length of the longest repeating substring.\n3.  I'll iterate through possible lengths, `L`, from `n-1` down to 1.\n    a.  For each length `L`, I'll iterate through all possible starting positions `i` within the string.\n        i.  At each position `i`, I'll extract a substring `sub` of length `L`.\n        ii. I need to figure out if `sub` appears at least twice. I can use the string's `count()` method to do this, efficiently. If `s.count(sub)` is greater than or equal to 2, I've found a repeating substring of length `L`.\n        iii. As soon as I find *any* substring that repeats, I know `L` is my answer, and I can return it immediately. I don't need to continue checking shorter lengths.\n\nEssentially, I am trading some time complexity for simplicity. While this is not the most optimized solution, it is straightforward and efficient enough given the problem's constraints.\n",
