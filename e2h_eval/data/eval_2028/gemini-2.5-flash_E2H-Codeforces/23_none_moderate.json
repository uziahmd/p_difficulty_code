In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

Now we have [3p, 3p, 3p].\n    #   This means the answer is always at most 2.\n\n    # This seems to be the key insight.\n    # With 2 draws, we can always pick any of our existing 3 tiles, say `T = (num, suit)`.\n    # Then we draw `T` twice. Our hand becomes `[t1, t2, t3, T, T]`.\n    # Since `T` is one of `t1, t2, t3`, let's say `T = t1`.\n    # Then our hand is `[t1, t2, t3, t1, t1]`. This hand contains the koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`.\n    # Therefore, 2 draws are always sufficient.\n\n    # So the possible answers are 0, 1, or 2.\n    # We already checked 0 and 1.

The \"something_else\" must be an original tile or D1/D2 itself.\n    #    If D_something_else is D1 or D2, it means we form a koutsu like (D1, D1, D1) or (D1, D1, D2).\n    #    If it's (D1, D1, D1), we need 3 identical tiles. This means D1 is drawn twice, and a third D1 is drawn.\n    #    This is essentially drawing 3 tiles. But we are only allowed 2 draws.\n    #    The problem says \"She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\"\n    #    \"After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one.\"\n    #    This means if we draw 2 tiles, we have 5 tiles total.\n    #    If we draw '1m' twice, we have (t1, t2, t3, 1m, 1m).\n    #    If we draw '1m', '2m', we have (t1, t2, t3, 1m, 2m).\n\n    # Let's consider the possible \"patterns\" among the initial 3 tiles that need 2 draws to complete a mentsu.\n    # A mentsu needs 3 tiles.\n    # If we have 3 initial tiles, and 0 or 1 draw doesn't work, it means:\n    # - No koutsu or shuntsu among the initial 3 tiles.\n    # - For any single drawn tile D, (t1, t2, t3, D) does not contain a mentsu.\n    #   This implies that no pair (t_i, t_j) can form a mentsu with a single drawn tile D.\n    #   And no single tile t_i can form a koutsu with two drawn tiles (t_i, D, D).\n    #   And no single tile t_i can form a shuntsu with two drawn tiles (t_i, D1, D2).\n    #   And no three tiles (D1, D2, D3) can form a mentsu where D3 is one of t1, t2, t3.\n\n    # This is getting too complicated. Let's re-read the problem carefully.\n    # \"minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win\"\n    # \"win\" = \"at least one mentsu\".\n\n    # Let's re-examine the conditions for 2 draws.\n    # If 0 or 1 draw doesn't work, we need to add 2 tiles (D1, D2) to (t1, t2, t3)\n    # such that the set {t1, t2, t3, D1, D2} contains a mentsu.\n    # The mentsu can be:\n    # 1. {t_i, t_j, t_k} (0 draws) - already ruled out.\n    # 2. {t_i, t_j, D1} (1 draw) - already ruled out.\n    # 3. {t_i, D1, D2} (2 draws, using one original tile)\n    # 4. {D1, D2, D_x} where D_x is another drawn tile. This would mean 3 draws.\n    #    Wait, D_x could be D1 or D2, if we draw the same tile multiple times.\n    #    So {D1, D1, D1} is a koutsu. This requires drawing D1 three times. Not 2 draws.\n    #    {D1, D1, D2} is a koutsu if D1=D2. But then it's {D1, D1, D1}.\n    #    {D1, D1, D2} is not a koutsu if D1 != D2.\n    #    {D1, D2, D3} where D3 is a tile drawn from the infinite supply.\n    #    If we draw D1 and D2, we have 5 tiles: {t1, t2, t3, D1, D2}.\n    #    A mentsu can be formed by any 3 of these 5 tiles.\n\n    # What if the mentsu is (D1, D2, D3_from_initial_set)? This is case 3.\n    # What if the mentsu is (D1, D2, D_new_tile)? This means we need 3 draws.\n    # The only way 2 draws work is if one of the following is true:\n    # A) A mentsu can be formed using one original tile and two drawn tiles (D1, D2).\n    #    Example: t1, D1, D2 form a mentsu.\n    # B) A mentsu can be formed using two original tiles and one drawn tile. (This is covered by 1-draw case).\n    # C) A mentsu can be formed using three original tiles. (This is covered by 0-draw case).\n\n    # So, we only need to consider case A for 2 draws.\n    # For each original tile `t_i`, can we find two drawn tiles `D1, D2` such that `{t_i, D1, D2}` forms a mentsu?\n    # This means:\n    # 1. Koutsu: `t_i, t_i, t_i`. This means `D1 = t_i` and `D2 = t_i`.\n    # 2. Shuntsu: `t_i, D1, D2` forms a sequence.\n    #    - `D1 = t_i - 1, D2 = t_i - 2` (if numbers are valid)\n    #    - `D1 = t_i - 1, D2 = t_i + 1` (if numbers are valid)\n    #    - `D1 = t_i + 1, D2 = t_i + 2` (if numbers are valid)\n\n    # Let's iterate through each initial tile and see if it can be part of a mentsu with 2 draws.\n    # For each tile (num, suit) in `tiles`:\n    #   Koutsu possibility: If we draw (num, suit) twice, we get [(num, suit), (num, suit), (num, suit)]. This is a koutsu.\n    #   This always works. So, we can always form a koutsu by drawing two copies of an existing tile.\n    #   Example: initial [3p, 9m, 2p]. Draw '3p' twice. Hand becomes [3p, 9m, 2p, 3p, 3p]. Now we have [3p, 3p, 3p].\n    #   This means the answer is always at most 2.\n\n    # This seems to be the key insight.\n    # With 2 draws, we can always pick any of our existing 3 tiles, say `T = (num, suit)`.\n    # Then we draw `T` twice. Our hand becomes `[t1, t2, t3, T, T]`.\n    # Since `T` is one of `t1, t2, t3`, let's say `T = t1`.\n    # Then our hand is `[t1, t2, t3, t1, t1]`. This hand contains the koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`.\n    # Therefore, 2 draws are always sufficient.\n\n    # So the possible answers are 0, 1, or 2.\n    # We already checked 0 and 1. If neither works, the answer must be 2.\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()",
