The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem.  The goal is to efficiently count the losses (red spots) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over a massive number of rounds, 'n'.  The challenge is that 'n' can be ridiculously large (up to 2 billion), meaning a naive round-by-round simulation is out of the question. I need to leverage the cyclic nature of their strategies to optimize the process.\n\nI've got the core elements: standard RPS rules, cyclic player strategies (Nikephoros with sequence 'A', Polycarpus with 'B'), and the definition of a 'loss' (red spot). The real hurdle is that constraint on 'n'.  That's where the cyclic nature is key!\n\nMy thinking is that since both sequences are cyclic, the overall pattern of wins/losses/draws will also cycle. The length of this combined cycle is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of Nikephoros's sequence ('m') and Polycarpus's sequence ('k'). Calculating the LCM efficiently is vital. Luckily, since m and k are relatively small (at most 1000), even calculating the LCM directly or using `gcd` should be fast enough.\n\nI need a winning strategy function to determine the outcome of each round. I can use a dictionary to make this faster. If one player chooses `R` and the other `S` the first player wins. This will allow for the most efficient comparison.\n\nThe algorithm itself is now clear: compute the LCM of m and k to find the cycle length. Simulate the RPS game for one full cycle to figure out how many losses each player incurs per cycle. Finally, I can divide 'n' by the cycle length to find how many full cycles are played and multiply the losses per cycle by the number of cycles, and handle any remaining rounds. This approach transforms an O(n) problem into a manageable O(LCM(m, k)) one. I'm confident this solution will be fast enough, even for such a large input 'n'.\n",
