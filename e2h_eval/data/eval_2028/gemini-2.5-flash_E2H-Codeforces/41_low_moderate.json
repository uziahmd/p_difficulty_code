There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Optimal Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to maximize profit from building houses, and the profit is directly related to the square of each house's height. I have a set of `n` spots, and I can build a house of height `a_i` at spot `i`, where `0 <= a_i <= h`. The profit is simply `a_i^2`. There are constraints though, represented by `m` restrictions, where a range of spots `[l_j, r_j]` must have a maximum house height of at most `x_j`.\n\nLet's break this down. My objective is to maximize the sum of squared heights, `sum(H[i]^2)`. I know that each `H[i]` has to be within the bounds `0 <= H[i] <= h`. But, these range constraints are key. For each spot `i`, I need to identify which restrictions apply. Basically, I have to ensure `H[i]` doesn't violate any restriction covering it. That boils down to figuring out the minimum of all the `x_j` values where the restriction's range includes `i`.\n\nSo, for each spot `i`, I can maintain a `max_allowed_height[i]` value. I'll initialize it to `h`, the global maximum. Then, I iterate through the restrictions. For each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, I update `max_allowed_height[k] = min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)` for every `k` within the range.\n\nNow, because I want to maximize the sum of squares, and the square function is monotonically increasing, I want the largest possible `H[i]` for each `i`. That's precisely `max_allowed_height[i]`. Thus, my strategy is simple: set `H[i] = max_allowed_height[i]` for all `i`. This inherently satisfies all constraints. Each height will be within bounds, initialized to `h` and updated only to smaller values. I'm pretty confident this is the optimal approach, time to code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, we can build a house of integer height `a_i` between `0` and `h`. The profit from a house of height `a_i` is `a_i^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house in a given range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nLet `H[i]` be the height of the house at spot `i`. Our goal is to maximize `sum(H[i]^2)` for `i` from `1` to `n`.\n\nFor each spot `i`, its height `H[i]` is subject to the following constraints:\n1. Global maximum height: `0 <= H[i] <= h`.\n2. Zoning restrictions: For every restriction `j` (`l_j, r_j, x_j`), if spot `i` is within the range `[l_j, r_j]` (i.e., `l_j <= i <= r_j`), then `H[i] <= x_j`.\n\nTo satisfy all these constraints simultaneously, the height `H[i]` for each spot `i` must be less than or equal to `h`, and also less than or equal to `x_j` for all restrictions `j` that cover spot `i`. This implies that `H[i]` must be at most the minimum of `h` and all relevant `x_j` values.\n\nLet's define `max_possible_height[i]` as the maximum allowed height for a house at spot `i`.\nInitially, without any specific restrictions, every house can be built up to height `h`. So, we can initialize `max_possible_height[i] = h` for all `i` from `1` to `n`.\n\nThen, we process each of the `m` zoning restrictions. For a restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\nThis restriction states that all houses in the range `[l_j, r_j]` must have a height of at most `x_j`. Therefore, for every spot `k` from `l_j` to `r_j` (inclusive), we must update its `max_possible_height[k]` to be `min(max_possible_height[k], x_j)`. This ensures that `max_possible_height[k]` correctly reflects all constraints applied to spot `k`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_possible_height[i]` will hold the absolute maximum height that a house at spot `i` can have while satisfying all given conditions.\n\nSince the profit `a^2` is an increasing function for non-negative heights `a`, to maximize the total profit, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. Thus, for each spot `i`, we should set `H[i] = max_possible_height[i]`.\n\nThe total maximum profit will then be `sum(max_possible_height[i]^2)` for `i` from `1` to `n`.\n\nLet's walk through an example:\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\nInitialize `max_possible_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n\n1. Process `(1, 1, 1)`:\n   Spot 1: `max_possible_height[0] = min(max_possible_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n   `max_possible_height` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n\n2. Process `(2, 2, 3)`:\n   Spot 2: `max_possible_height[1] = min(max_possible_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n   `max_possible_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n\n3. Process `(3, 3, 2)`:\n   Spot 3: `max_possible_height[2] = min(max_possible_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n   `max_possible_height` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nAfter all restrictions, the optimal heights are `[1, 3, 2]`.\nThe total profit is `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThe constraints `n, h, m <= 50` are very small.\nInitializing `max_possible_height` takes `O(n)` time.\nProcessing `m` restrictions: each restriction iterates over a range of spots. In the worst case, a range can cover all `n` spots. So, each restriction takes `O(n)` time. Total for restrictions: `O(m*n)`.\nCalculating final profit: `O(n)` time.\nOverall time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\nWith `n, m <= 50`, `m*n <= 50*50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_possible_height for each spot to h\n    # We use 0-indexed array for convenience, so spots 1 to n map to indices 0 to n-1\n    max_possible_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Adjust l and r to be 0-indexed\n        # Restriction applies to spots from l-1 to r-1 (inclusive)\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            max_possible_height[i] = min(max_possible_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_possible_height:\n        total_profit += height * height\n    \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
