There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the House-Building Profit Maximization Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. I need to figure out how to maximize profit from building houses.  We've got `n` spots, each can have a height from `0` to `h`. Profit is a simple `a^2` for a house of height `a`.  The tricky part is these `m` zoning restrictions. Each `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` means the *tallest* house between spots `l_i` and `r_i` can't exceed `x_i`.\n\nMy thinking is to break this down. First, determine the maximum possible height, let's call it `H_j`, for each spot `j`. Initially, without any restrictions, that would just be the maximum height `h`. But, each restriction impacts things. If spot `j` is within the range of a restriction, the maximum height has to be the minimum of its current max height and the restriction's height. This means `H_j` for a spot is determined by the intersection of height restrictions that impact it.\n\nSo, let's create a `max_allowed_height` array for each spot `j` and initialize its `h`. Then, I'll go through the restrictions. For each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, I need to update the `max_allowed_height` for all spots within that restriction's range. Effectively, I'll have `max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x_i)`.  If no restriction affects a specific spot, it will remain `h` because of the initialization.\n\nAfter going through all the restrictions, this `max_allowed_height` array should tell me the maximum allowed height for each spot *while* respecting all the zoning rules.\n\nNow, since profit is simply `h_j^2`, and this is always maximized by taking the maximum possible value for `h_j` within its constraints, my final answer should just be the sum of squares of the values in the `max_allowed_height` array.\n\nI've checked the constraints (`n, h, m <= 50`), which are conveniently small. This is going to be a straightforward implementation. I can initialize the array, iterate through the restrictions, update the `max_allowed_height` array, and then calculate the final sum. The overall time complexity should be manageable.  This is a good, clean solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house of integer height `a` between `0` and `h`, earning `a^2` dollars. There are `m` restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's determine the maximum possible height for each individual house. For a house at spot `j`, its height `h_j` must satisfy two conditions:\n1. `0 <= h_j <= h` (general height constraint).\n2. For every restriction `i` such that spot `j` is within its range `[l_i, r_i]` (i.e., `l_i <= j <= r_i`), `h_j` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nCombining these, the maximum possible height for a house at spot `j`, let's call it `H_j`, is `h` initially, and then it must be reduced by any applicable restriction. Specifically, `H_j` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`.\n\nWe can compute `H_j` for each spot `j` as follows:\n1. Create an array, say `max_heights`, of size `n`. Initialize all elements to `h`. This represents the initial maximum allowed height for each spot without considering specific restrictions.\n2. Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n   For every spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive):\n   Update `max_heights[j-1]` (using 0-based indexing for the array) to `min(max_heights[j-1], x_i)`. This ensures that the height at spot `j` respects the current restriction `i`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_heights[j-1]` will store the actual maximum height that can be built at spot `j` while satisfying all given constraints.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, which is `sum(h_j^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. This is because `a^2` is an increasing function for non-negative `a`. Therefore, for each spot `j`, we should build a house of height `max_heights[j-1]`.\n\nThe total maximum profit will then be `sum(max_heights[j-1]^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\nLet's walk through an example: `n=3, h=3, m=3`. Restrictions: `(1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2)`.\n\n1. Initialize `max_heights = [h, h, h] = [3, 3, 3]`. (Using 0-based indexing for spots 0, 1, 2 corresponding to 1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - Restriction `(1,1,1)`: `l=1, r=1, x=1`.\n     For spot `j=1`: `max_heights[0] = min(max_heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n     `max_heights` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - Restriction `(2,2,3)`: `l=2, r=2, x=3`.\n     For spot `j=2`: `max_heights[1] = min(max_heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n     `max_heights` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - Restriction `(3,3,2)`: `l=3, r=3, x=2`.\n     For spot `j=3`: `max_heights[2] = min(max_heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n     `max_heights` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3. After all restrictions, the optimal heights are `[1, 3, 2]`.\n   The total profit is `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output. The constraints `n, h, m <= 50` are very small, so this approach is efficient enough. The time complexity would be O(N + M*N) in the worst case (if each restriction covers all N spots), which is O(N*M). Given N, M <= 50, N*M <= 2500 operations, which is very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_allowed_height for each spot to h\n    # We use 0-based indexing for the array, so spot j (1-based) corresponds to index j-1\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply the restriction to all spots in the range [l, r]\n        # For each spot j from l to r (inclusive), its height must be at most x\n        for i in range(l - 1, r): # Convert 1-based l, r to 0-based indices\n            max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed_height:\n        total_profit += height * height # Profit for height 'a' is a^2\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
