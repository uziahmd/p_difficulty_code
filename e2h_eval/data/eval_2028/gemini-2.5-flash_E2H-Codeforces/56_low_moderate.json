Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need a Python script to solve this. First, I have to understand the problem. I'm given Rebel spaceships (`R`) and bases (`B`). The goal is to find a perfect matching, meaning each spaceship gets one base, and each base gets one spaceship.  This immediately means `R` has to equal `B`, otherwise, it's impossible.  If they're not equal, I can just output \"No\" right away.\n\nThe core constraint is the \"non-intersecting\" segments.  Each spaceship-base pair forms a line segment, and no two of these segments can cross each other.  I'm dealing with 2D integer coordinates, and no two points are the same, and no three points are on the same line. The constraints on `R` and `B` are small, at most 10.\n\nNow, about the non-intersecting condition - this is where my computational geometry knowledge kicks in. This is a classic geometric matching problem.  I know sorting is often key here.  I'm thinking about the convex hull of all the points, but that seems a bit overkill given the small constraints.\n\nThe intersection condition can be rephrased:  if you have four points, A, B, C, and D, the segments AB and CD intersect *if and only if* A and B are on opposite sides of the line CD, AND C and D are on opposite sides of the line AB.  There's a well-known result from computational geometry that says you can often sort the points by, say, x-coordinate or angularly around a central point, to avoid intersections.\n\nGiven the small problem size, brute force with permutations seems like a viable strategy.  I'm thinking:\n\n1.  Read `R` and `B`. Check if `R != B`.  If so, print \"No\" and quit.\n2.  Store the spaceship and base coordinates.\n3.  Iterate through every possible permutation of the bases. For each permutation:\n    a.  Pair up the spaceships with the bases according to this permutation.\n    b.  For this matching, I need to check for intersections:\n        *   Take every pair of segments and test if they intersect.\n        *   If any two segments intersect, this permutation fails.  Move on to the next one.\n    c.  If I find a permutation with no intersecting segments, I can print \"Yes\" and stop.\n\nThis approach will be inefficient for larger inputs, but the constraints make it perfectly acceptable here.  I can definitely write a Python script for this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a perfect matching exists between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two segments connecting a spaceship to its assigned base intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching is only possible if the number of Rebel spaceships `R` is equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, we can immediately say \"No\".\n\nGiven that `R` and `B` are small (up to 10), we can try all possible matchings. If `R = B = N`, there are `N!` ways to assign `N` Rebel spaceships to `N` bases. For each assignment, we form `N` segments and then check if any two of these segments intersect.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read the coordinates of `B` bases into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  Let `N = R`. Iterate through all permutations of the `bases` list.\n    a.  For each permutation `p_bases`, create a set of `N` segments: `(rebels[i], p_bases[i])` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n    b.  Check for intersections: For every distinct pair of segments `s1 = (R_i, B_{p_i})` and `s2 = (R_j, B_{p_j})` (where `i != j`):\n        i.  Determine if `s1` and `s2` intersect.\n        ii. If an intersection is found, this permutation is invalid. Stop checking this permutation and move to the next one.\n    c.  If no intersections are found after checking all pairs of segments for the current permutation, then a valid matching has been found. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n6.  If all permutations have been checked and none resulted in a valid matching, print \"No\".\n\n**Intersection Check (Geometric Primitives):**\nTo check if two segments `p1-p2` and `p3-p4` intersect, we use the concept of the cross product (or orientation test).\nThe cross product `(p2 - p1) x (p3 - p1)` tells us the orientation of `p3` with respect to the vector `p1-p2`.\n`cross_product(A, B, C) = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)`\n-   If `cross_product(A, B, C) > 0`, `C` is to the left of `AB`.\n-   If `cross_product(A, B, C) < 0`, `C` is to the right of `AB`.\n-   If `cross_product(A, B, C) = 0`, `A, B, C` are collinear.\n\nTwo segments `p1-p2` and `p3-p4` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `p1` and `p2` are on opposite sides of the line `p3-p4`, AND\n2.  `p3` and `p4` are on opposite sides of the line `p1-p2`.\n\nThis can be checked using cross products:\n-   `cross_product(p3, p4, p1)` and `cross_product(p3, p4, p2)` must have opposite signs (or one is zero).\n-   `cross_product(p1, p2, p3)` and `cross_product(p1, p2, p4)` must have opposite signs (or one is zero).\n\nThe problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\" and \"no two points coincide\". This simplifies the collinearity checks. If `cross_product` is 0, it means the points are collinear. Since no three points are collinear, a `cross_product` of 0 for `(A, B, C)` implies `C` lies on the line `AB`. If `C` is also *between* `A` and `B`, it's an endpoint intersection. However, the \"no three points collinear\" guarantee means that if `p1, p2, p3` are collinear, then `p3` must be one of `p1` or `p2`, which is excluded by the definition of distinct segments in a matching (a spaceship cannot be a base). So, we only care about strict intersections.\nFor strict intersection, we need:\n-   `cross_product(p3, p4, p1) * cross_product(p3, p4, p2) < 0`\n-   `cross_product(p1, p2, p3) * cross_product(p1, p2, p4) < 0`\n\nThis logic will correctly identify intersections without endpoints touching or overlapping.\n\n**Complexity:**\n-   `N!` permutations.\n-   For each permutation, `N choose 2` pairs of segments.\n-   Each intersection check is constant time.\nTotal complexity: `O(N! * N^2)`.\nFor `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`. `10^2 = 100`. `3.6 * 10^6 * 100 = 3.6 * 10^8`, which might be too slow.\nHowever, `N` is small, and the constant factor for cross product is very small. In competitive programming, `10^8` operations can pass if the operations are simple integer arithmetic. Let's re-evaluate.\nA typical modern CPU can do about `10^8` operations per second. `3.6 * 10^8` arithmetic operations might be pushing it, but it's often acceptable for simple integer math. The actual number of operations in a cross product and multiplication is small.\n\nLet's verify the constraints again. `R, B <= 10`. This indicates `N!` solutions are usually intended.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Helper function to compute the cross product (orientation test)\n# Returns > 0 if C is to the left of vector AB\n# Returns < 0 if C is to the right of vector AB\n# Returns 0 if A, B, C are collinear\ndef cross_product(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Function to check if two segments p1p2 and p3p4 intersect\n# Assumes no three points are collinear and no two points coincide.\n# This means we don't need to handle collinear cases like segments sharing an endpoint\n# or overlapping segments.
