He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Python String Verification Logic**\n\nAlright, I'm working on a Python script to validate a string `S` against a specific set of rules. Here's how I'm approaching this:\n\nFirst, the string needs to follow a precise structure: It has to start with one or more 'a's (let's call that count `count_a`), followed by one or more 'b's (`count_b`), and then zero or more 'c's (`count_c`). So, the general form is `a...ab...bc...c`.\n\nI'm starting by assuming `count_c` could be zero, but with the specific condition provided, I'm realizing I can assume it's one or more. The crucial rule is that `count_c` has to be equal to either `count_a` or `count_b`. Since both `count_a` and `count_b` are guaranteed to be at least one, that makes `count_c` at least one as well.\n\nSo, the definitive conditions are: `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, `count_c >= 1`, and the number of 'c's has to be the same as the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This means the string has to be neatly divided into these three blocks: all 'a's, all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n\nI need to write a script that can:\n1.  Parse through the string and identify the boundaries of each block of characters.\n2.  Determine the counts for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3.  Then verify that these counts meet all the specified requirements, specifically `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`.\n\nI'll need to write some test cases to ensure the implementation is right, for example on `aaabccc` and other inputs.\n",
