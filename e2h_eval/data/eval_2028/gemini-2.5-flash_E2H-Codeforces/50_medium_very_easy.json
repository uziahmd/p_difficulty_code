    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this competitive programming challenge. The core task is to figure out the sum of  `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, with the result taken modulo 998244353. \"Good\" trees are edge-weighted trees (with edge weights of either 1 or -1) where the product of edge weights at each vertex equals -1.  A crucial early insight is that *n* must be even for a good tree to exist. This follows from considering the product of edge weights around each vertex, and simplifying the product. If *n* is odd, the answer is 0.\n\n**Counting Good Trees and Edge Weight Assignment**\n\nThe focus shifts to counting the possible ways to assign edge weights, given a tree structure, to satisfy this \"good\" condition.  The key observation here is, that if *n* is even, given any tree structure, the edge weights are *uniquely determined* up to weight selection for an arbitrary edge.  This simplifies the problem immensely!  I can choose any one edge weight. If I pick an arbitrary edge and set its weight, then the rest is determined because of the condition on vertex products. This leads to the conclusion that if *n* is even, there is exactly one way to assign weights to a fixed tree structure to make it \"good\". This means I need to count the number of tree structures.\n\n**Path Length and Edge Contributions**\n\nThe next step is to calculate  `d(1, n)`, which is the sum of the weights of edges along the unique path from vertex 1 to vertex *n*.  The value can be positive or negative, so modular arithmetic is critical. For any edge, it contributes to `d(1,n)` only if it appears on the path between nodes 1 and *n*. It seems, that the weights are determined by the size of the subtree. An edge's weight `w(u,v)` is determined by the size of the smaller component when `e` is removed from the graph. The smaller component should be the one containing u or v. Therefore, `w(u,v) = (-1)^(size of that smaller component)`.\n\n**Summing Over Trees and Final Calculation**\n\nNow, the total sum `sum d(1,n)` is calculated over all  `n^(n-2)` possible tree structures. This means I need to calculate, for each edge, the number of trees it appears on the path between 1 and *n*. The main challenge is figuring out the weights of edges given the size of the subtrees.\n\nAfter some careful thought and simplifying things, it appears that the edge weight's value is dependent on the size of a subtree (or components formed when an edge is removed) connected to the path nodes. This reveals an easier path to determine what needs to be calculated in the total sum.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. An edge-weighted tree is \"good\" if the weight of each edge is either `1` or `-1`, and for each vertex `i`, the product of the weights of all edges incident to `i` is `-1`. `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique simple path from `u` to `v`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for a tree to be \"good\".\nLet `w(e)` be the weight of an edge `e`. For each vertex `i`, we are given `P_i = product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1`.\nConsider the product of `P_i` over all vertices `i`:\n`product_{i=1 to n} P_i = product_{i=1 to n} (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the other hand, each edge `e=(u,v)` is incident to exactly two vertices, `u` and `v`. So `w(e)` appears twice in the product `product_i P_i`.\nThus, `product_{i=1 to n} P_i = product_{e in tree} (w(e)^2)`.\nSince `w(e)` is either `1` or `-1`, `w(e)^2` is always `1`.\nSo, `product_{e in tree} (w(e)^2) = 1^(n-1) = 1`.\nCombining these, we get `1 = (-1)^n`. This implies that `n` must be an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, `(-1)^n = -1`, which means `1 = -1`, a contradiction.\nTherefore, if `n` is odd, there are no good trees, and the sum of `d(1,n)` is `0`. This matches the example for `n=1`.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nLet's represent `w(e)` as `(-1)^{x_e}` where `x_e in {0,1}`. `x_e=0` for `w(e)=1` and `x_e=1` for `w(e)=-1`.\nThe condition `P_i = -1` becomes `sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1` (mod 2).\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `F_2` with `n-1` variables (the `x_e` values).\nIt's a known result that for a connected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, the rank of its incidence matrix over `F_2` is `n-1`. For a tree, `m=n-1`.\nSince `n` is even, the system is consistent (as shown above, `sum_i (sum_{e incident to i} x_e) = sum_i 1` implies `0 = n` (mod 2), which is true for even `n`).\nA consistent system of `n` equations and `n-1` variables with rank `n-1` has a unique solution.\nThis means that for any fixed tree structure, if `n` is even, there is exactly one way to assign weights `1` or `-1` such that the tree is good.\n\nNext, let's determine the unique weights `w(e)` for an edge `e=(u,v)` in a good tree.\nIf we remove `e=(u,v)`, the tree splits into two connected components, say `C_u` (containing `u`) and `C_v` (containing `v`). Let `s_u = |C_u|` and `s_v = |C_v|`. We have `s_u + s_v = n`.\nConsider the product of `P_x` for all vertices `x` in `C_u`:\n`product_{x in C_u} P_x = product_{x in C_u} (-1) = (-1)^{s_u}`.\nIn this product, any edge `e' != e` within `C_u` has its weight `w(e')` appear twice (once for each endpoint in `C_u`), so `w(e')^2 = 1`.\nThe edge `e=(u,v)` is incident to `u` (in `C_u`) but not `v` (not in `C_u`). So `w(u,v)` appears exactly once in `product_{x in C_u} P_x`.\nTherefore, `product_{x in C_u} P_x = w(u,v) * product_{e' in C_u, e'!=e} w(e')^2 = w(u,v)`.\nThus, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{s_u}`.\nSimilarly, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{s_v}`.\nSince `n` is even, `s_u + s_v = n` implies `s_u` and `s_v` have the same parity. So `(-1)^{s_u} = (-1)^{s_v}` is consistent.\nThis means the weight of an edge `e=(u,v)` is `(-1)^k` where `k` is the size of either component formed by removing `e`.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{T good} d(1,n) = sum_{T good} sum_{e=(u,v) on P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)`.\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{T: e on P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)`.\nAn edge `e=(u,v)` is on the path `P_{1,n}` if and only if removing `e` separates `1` and `n`.\nLet `C_u` be the component containing `u` and `C_v` be the component containing `v` after removing `e`.\nThen either (`1 in C_u` and `n in C_v`) or (`1 in C_v` and `n in C_u`).\nIn either case, the weight `w(u,v)` is `(-1)^{|C_u|}` (or `(-1)^{|C_v|}`).\n\nLet's fix `u` and `v`. We want to sum `w(u,v)` over all trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` and `1 \\in C_u`, `n \\in C_v`, and `|C_u|=k` (so `|C_v|=n-k`) can be found using a generalization of Cayley's formula (or by Prufer sequences).\nThis is equivalent to choosing `k-2` vertices (from `n-2` available) to be in `C_u` along with `1` and `u`, and `n-k-2` vertices to be in `C_v` along with `n` and `v`. Then forming trees on these two sets of vertices.\nThe number of such trees is `binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\n(Here, `k^{k-2}` is the number of trees on `k` vertices. If `k=1`, it's `1`. If `k=2`, it's `1`).\nThis formula is for specific `u,v`. We need to sum over all possible `u,v`.\n\nA more direct approach is to use a result from \"Counting Labeled Trees\" by Moon (1967).\nThe sum of `d(1,n)` over all trees where `w(u,v) = 1` for all edges is `sum_{T} path_length(1,n)`. This is `n^{n-2} * (n-1) * (n-2) / n` for `n >= 2`.\nThis problem is more complex due to the weights.\n\nLet's use the property `w(u,v) = (-1)^{s_u}`.\nThe total sum is `sum_{T} sum_{e=(u,v) on P_{1,n}} (-1)^{s_u}`.\nWe can iterate over possible sizes `k` for the component `C_u` that contains `1` (and `u`).\nIf `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}`, then `1` and `n` must be in different components.\nLet `1` be in `C_u` and `n` be in `C_v`. So `|C_u|=k` and `|C_v|=n-k`.\nThe weight of `e=(u,v)` is `(-1)^k`.\nThe number of trees where edge `(u,v)` separates `1` and `n` into components of size `k` and `n-k` (with `1 \\in C_u, n \\in C_v`) is:\nChoose `k-2` vertices from `n-2` to be with `1` and `u`: `binom(n-2, k-1)` ways.\nForm a tree on these `k` vertices (`1`, `u`, and `k-2` chosen ones): `k^{k-2}` ways.\nForm a tree on the remaining `n-k` vertices (`n`, `v`, and `n-k-2` chosen ones): `(n-k)^{n-k-2}` ways.\nSo, for a fixed pair `u,v` and fixed `k`, the number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge, `1 \\in C_u`, `n \\in C_v` and `|C_u|=k` is `binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nThe edge `(u,v)` contributes `(-1)^k` to `d(1,n)`.\nThe sum of `d(1,n)` over all good trees is:\n`sum_{k=1}^{n-1} sum_{u,v: u!=v} I(u,v,k) * (-1)^k`\nwhere `I(u,v,k)` is the number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge, `1 \\in C_u`, `n \\in C_v` and `|C_u|=k`.\nNote that `u` and `v` are specific vertices. `1` and `n` are fixed.\nIf `u=1` and `v!=n`: `k=1`. Choose `0` vertices from `n-2` to be in `C_u`. `1^{1-2}` and `(n-1)^{n-1-2}`.\nNumber of trees where `(1,v)` is an edge, `n \\in C_v`, `|C_1|=1`: `1 * 1^{1-2} * (n-1)^{n-1-2}`.\nThis is `(n-1)^{n-3}`.\nThis happens for each of `n-2` choices for `v` (since `v!=1, n`).\nIf `u!=1, n` and `v!=1, n`:\nNumber of ways to choose `k-1` vertices for `C_u` (including `u` but not `1`) from `n-2` is `binom(n-2, k-1)`.\nThis is `binom(n-2, k-1)` ways to choose the set of vertices for `C_u` (excluding `u` and `1`).\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's use a known result for the sum of path lengths:\nThe sum of `d(1,n)` over all `n^{n-2}` trees, where `w(e)=1` for all edges, is `(n-1) * n^{n-3}` for `n >= 2`.\nThis is `(n-1) * n^(n-3)` if `n >= 2`.\nFor `n=2`: `1 * 2^(-1) = 1/2`. This is incorrect.\nFor `n=2`, there is 1 tree: `1-2`. Path length is 1. Formula gives `2^(2-3) * (2-1) = 1/2`.\nThe sum of `d(u,v)` over all trees for fixed `u,v` is `n^{n-3} * (n-1)`.\nThis is for `n >= 2`.\nFor `n=2`, `1 * 2^(2-3) * (2-1) = 1/2`.\nThe sum of `d(u,v)` over all trees for fixed `u,v` is `(n-1) * n^{n-3}` for `n>=2`.\nFor `n=2`, `(2-1) * 2^(2-3) = 1/2`.\nThe number of edges on path `P_{u,v}` for a random tree is `(n-1) / n * (n-1)`. No.\nAverage path length between two fixed vertices `u,v` is `2(n-1)/n`.\nThe sum of path lengths is `n^{n-2} * 2(n-1)/n = 2(n-1)n^{n-3}`.\nFor `n=2`, `2(1)2^(-1) = 1`. This is correct.\n\nLet `S = sum_{T good} d(1,n)`.\nIf `n` is odd, `S=0`.\nIf `n` is even:\nThe sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * N(k)`, where `N(k)` is the number of pairs `(T, e)` such that `T` is a tree, `e=(u,v)` is an edge in `T`, `e` is on the path `P_{1,n}`, `1` is in `C_u`, `n` is in `C_v`, and `|C_u|=k`.\nWe can use the result from a paper by J. W. Moon (1967), \"The Number of Paths of Given Length in a Random Tree\".\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices in which `u` and `v` are in different components of sizes `k` and `n-k` respectively, when an edge `(u,v)` is removed, is `n^{n-2} * (k/n) * ((n-k)/n)`.\nThis is the number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge, and `|C_u|=k` (where `u` is connected to `1`) and `|C_v|=n-k` (where `v` is connected to `n`).\nThis formula is `binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nThis is exactly `N(k)`.\nSo, `S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nThe terms `k^{k-2}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-2}` are defined as `1` if the exponent is `-1` (i.e., `k=1` or `n-k=1`).\nSpecifically, `1^{1-2} = 1`. `k^{k-2}` is `1` for `k=1` or `k=2`.\nLet's check `k=1`: `(-1)^1 * binom(n-2, 0) * 1^{1-2} * (n-1)^{n-1-2} = -1 * 1 * 1 * (n-1)^{n-3} = -(n-1)^{n-3}`.\nLet's check `k=n-1`: `(-1)^{n-1} * binom(n-2, n-2) * (n-1)^{n-1-2} * 1^{1-2} = (-1)^{n-1} * 1 * (n-1)^{n-3} * 1`.\nSince `n` is even, `n-1` is odd, so `(-1)^{n-1} = -1`. The term is `-(n-1)^{n-3}`.\nThe sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nThis sum is `-(n-1)^{n-3}` for `k=1` and `k=n-1`.\nFor `n=2`:\n`k=1`: `(-1)^1 * binom(0,0) * 1^{1-2} * 1^{1-2} = -1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = -1`.\nThe formula gives `-1`. Example output for `n=2` is `998244352` (which is `-1 mod 998244353`). This matches.\n\nFor `n=4`:\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k * binom(2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (4-k)^{4-k-2}`\n`k=1`: `(-1)^1 * binom(2,0) * 1^{1-2} * 3^{3-2} = -1 * 1 * 1 * 3^1 = -3`.\n`k=2`: `(-1)^2 * binom(2,1) * 2^{2-2} * 2^{2-2} = 1 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 2`.\n`k=3`: `(-1)^3 * binom(2,2) * 3^{3-2} * 1^{1-2} = -1 * 1 * 3^1 * 1 = -3`.\n`S = -3 + 2 - 3 = -4`.\nExample output for `n=4` is `998244343` (which is `-10 mod 998244353`). My calculation is `-4`.\nThere is a discrepancy.\n\nThe definition of `N(k)` must be wrong.\nThe formula `binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}` counts trees where `1` and `n` are in different components of size `k` and `n-k` respectively, *and* `u` and `v` are specific vertices such that `u` is in the `1`-component and `v` is in the `n`-component.\nHowever, `u` and `v` are not fixed. The sum is over all edges `e=(u,v)`.\nIf `1 \\in C_u` and `n \\in C_v`, then `u` must be `1` or a neighbor of `1` in `C_u`, etc.\nThe number of choices for `u` in `C_u` (where `1 \\in C_u`) is `k`.\nThe number of choices for `v` in `C_v` (where `n \\in C_v`) is `n-k`.\nSo for a fixed `k`, there are `k * (n-k)` choices for the specific endpoints `u,v` of the edge `e`.\nTherefore, `N(k) = k * (n-k) * binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\n`N(k) = binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\n\nLet's recheck for `n=4`:\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k * binom(2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (4-k)^{4-k-1}`.\n`k=1`: `(-1)^1 * binom(2,0) * 1^{1-1} * 3^{3-1} = -1 * 1 * 1 * 3^2 = -9`.\n`k=2`: `(-1)^2 * binom(2,1) * 2^{2-1} * 2^{2-1} = 1 * 2 * 2^1 * 2^1 = 8`.\n`k=3`: `(-1)^3 * binom(2,2) * 3^{3-1} * 1^{1-1} = -1 * 1 * 3^2 * 1 = -9`.\n`S = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10`.\nThis matches the example output for `n=4`!\n\nSo the final formula for even `n` is:\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\pmod{998244353}`.\nThe term `x^{x-1}` is `x` for `x=1` (since `1^0=1`, not `1/1`). `k^{k-1}` is `1` for `k=1`. `(n-k)^{n-k-1}` is `1` for `n-k=1`.\n`k^{k-1}` should be interpreted as `k * k^{k-2}`.\nIf `k=1`, `1 * 1^{1-2} = 1 * 1 = 1`.\nIf `n-k=1`, `1 * 1^{1-2} = 1 * 1 = 1`.\nThis definition makes sense.\n\nWe need to compute binomial coefficients `binom(n-2, k-1)` and powers `k^{k-1}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-1}` modulo `998244353`.\n`998244353` is a prime number.\nWe need factorials and inverse factorials for `binom(N,K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)`.\nThe maximum value for `n` is `5 * 10^5`.

Factorials up to `0!` are `1`.\nFactorial array `fact[0]=1`, `invFact[0]=1`.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\nMAX_N = 5 * 10**5\nfact = [1] * (MAX_N + 1)\ninvFact = [1] * (MAX_N + 1)\n\ndef precompute_factorials(max_val):\n    for i in range(1, max_val + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    invFact[max_val] = inv(fact[max_val])\n    for i in range(max_val - 1, -1, -1):\n        invFact[i] = (invFact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\ndef nCr_mod_p(n_val, r_val):\n    if r_val < 0 or r_val > n_val:\n        return 0\n    num = fact[n_val]\n    den = (invFact[r_val] * invFact[n_val - r_val]) % MOD\n    return (num * den) % MOD\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if n == 1: # n is odd, but just in case\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorials up to n-2\n    # For n=2, n-2=0.
