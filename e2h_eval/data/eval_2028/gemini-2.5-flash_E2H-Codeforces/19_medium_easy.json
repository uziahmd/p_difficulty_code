The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Fan Count in a Tree: A Greedy Approach**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got this competitive programming problem where we need to figure out which districts to eliminate to maximize the fans of the remaining contestants. The key here is that the graph is a tree, meaning there's a unique path between any two districts. Since the fan count is `2^i` for district `i`, it's clear we want to keep districts with larger indices because of the exponential growth. So, naturally, the goal is to grab those larger-indexed districts, as long as they stay connected, right?\n\nWe need to pick `n-k` districts that are still connected in the graph, with `n` being the total district count and `k` the ones we're removing. Because we want a connected set with a maximized fan total, the problem is essentially about minimizing the sum of the indices we *do* remove. Ideally, we want to remove the districts with the *smallest* indices because that'll let us keep the districts with the largest indices to max our sum of `2^i`. This suggests a greedy strategy.\n\nThe initial hunch is, let's keep district `n`. And if we are keeping `n`, then we need to add `n-k-1` more. And ideally, we include `n-1`, `n-2`... and so on until it is `n-k`. So our goal will always be forming a connected set with our highest number indices.  I'm thinking about a greedy approach: Iterate from `n` down to `1`. If adding a district doesn't break the connectivity of the districts we already included and `num_kept < n-k`, add it, keep going until you've reached `n-k` districts.\n\nTo connect them, we must prioritize keeping the large-indexed nodes, then making sure that the set remains connected. So we can build our connected sub-graph up from that largest indexed node.\n\nSo, we can build a connected component by greedily adding nodes. We start with the largest index node, `n`. Then, add the next largest node that's a neighbor of our current set (and we check connectivity). If not, move onto lower indices, until we've included `n-k` nodes.\n\nSo, here's my plan. I'll maintain a set of nodes we're *keeping*, start with `n` in that set. From there, I'll have a priority queue – a max-heap of sorts – to keep track of the neighbors of my kept nodes, sorted by their index. The strategy is: pull the node with the highest index from the priority queue, and add it to the kept set. Update the priority queue with any new neighbors that this newly added node introduces. And we stop when we've got `n-k` nodes selected. The excluded nodes would then be the `k` we remove.\n\nLet's implement this. I think the time complexity of building the adjacency list is `O(n)`. The heap ops are `O(log N)` or `O(log deg)` where deg is degree. Since we have at most `O(n)` node additions or extractions to the heap, the overall time complexity would be `O(N log N)`. This will be an efficient way to solve this problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the total number of fans of these `n-k` districts is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *not* selected (i.e., removed), in increasing order.\n\nThe number of fans for a contestant from district `i` is `2^i`. Since `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i` (specifically, `2^i > \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^j`), to maximize the total sum of fans, we should always prioritize including districts with larger indices. This means we want to keep the `n-k` districts with the largest possible indices that can form a connected component.\n\nThis is a classic problem of finding a maximum-weight connected subgraph of a fixed size. The greedy approach works for this specific type of problem:\n\n1.  **Anchor Node:** The district with the largest index, `n`, has the most fans (`2^n`). Any optimal solution must include district `n`. If an optimal solution `S_O` did not include `n`, we could potentially replace some district `j \\in S_O` with `n` to get a strictly higher total fan count, provided connectivity is maintained. A more rigorous proof shows that `n` must be part of an optimal solution.\n\n2.  **Greedy Expansion:** Start with district `n` as our initial connected component. Then, repeatedly add `n-k-1` more districts to this component. At each step, among all districts that are adjacent to our current component but not yet part of it, we select the one with the largest index. This ensures we always add the district that contributes the most to the total fan count while maintaining connectivity.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Create an adjacency list `adj` to represent the tree.\n    *   Initialize an empty set `nodes_to_keep` to store the districts we choose.\n    *   Initialize a max-priority queue `pq` (using Python's `heapq` as a min-heap by storing `(-index, index)` tuples) to store candidate districts to add.\n    *   Initialize a set `visited_for_pq` to keep track of districts that are either in `nodes_to_keep` or have been added to `pq`. This prevents duplicate entries in the `pq` and ensures each district is processed once.\n    *   Set `num_kept = 0`.\n\n2.  **Start with District `n`:**\n    *   Add `n` to `nodes_to_keep`.\n    *   Increment `num_kept` to 1.\n    *   Add `n` to `visited_for_pq`.\n    *   For each neighbor `v` of `n`:\n        *   If `v` is not in `visited_for_pq`:\n            *   Push `(-v, v)` to `pq`.\n            *   Add `v` to `visited_for_pq`.\n\n3.  **Greedy Expansion Loop:**\n    *   While `num_kept < n - k` (we still need to select more districts) and `pq` is not empty:\n        *   Extract the district `u` with the largest index from `pq` (i.e., `u = heapq.heappop(pq)[1]`).\n        *   Add `u` to `nodes_to_keep`.\n        *   Increment `num_kept`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `v` is not in `visited_for_pq`:\n                *   Push `(-v, v)` to `pq`.\n                *   Add `v` to `visited_for_pq`.\n\n4.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   After the loop, `nodes_to_keep` contains the `n-k` districts with the maximum total fan count that form a connected component.\n    *   Create a list `removed_districts`. Iterate from `1` to `n`. If a district `i` is not in `nodes_to_keep`, add it to `removed_districts`.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print the `removed_districts` in increasing order, separated by spaces.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Building the adjacency list: `O(N)` since there are `N-1` edges.\n*   The greedy expansion uses a priority queue. Each district is added to the priority queue at most once and extracted at most once. Each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint).\n*   A priority queue operation (push or pop) takes `O(log N)` time.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is approximately `10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`, which is efficient enough for typical time limits (1-2 seconds).\n*   Identifying removed districts: `O(N)`.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   Adjacency list: `O(N)`.\n*   `nodes_to_keep`, `pq`, `visited_for_pq`: `O(N)`.\n*   Total space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    nodes_to_keep = set()\n    # Max-priority queue: store (-node_id, node_id) to simulate max-heap with heapq\n    pq = [] \n    \n    # visited_for_pq tracks nodes that are either in nodes_to_keep or have been added to pq\n    visited_for_pq = set()\n\n    # Start with the largest node (n) as it contributes the most fans\n    nodes_to_keep.add(n)\n    num_kept = 1\n    visited_for_pq.add(n)\n\n    # Add neighbors of n to the priority queue\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        if neighbor not in visited_for_pq:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n            visited_for_pq.add(neighbor)\n\n    # Greedily add (n-k-1) more nodes\n    while num_kept < n - k and pq:\n        # Get the node with the largest index (highest priority)\n        neg_u, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        \n        nodes_to_keep.add(u)\n        num_kept += 1\n\n        # Add neighbors of u to the priority queue\n        for neighbor in adj[u]:\n            if neighbor not in visited_for_pq:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n                visited_for_pq.add(neighbor)\n\n    # Collect the districts to be removed\n    removed_districts = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in nodes_to_keep:\n            removed_districts.append(i)\n    \n    # Print the removed districts in increasing order\n    print(*(removed_districts))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
