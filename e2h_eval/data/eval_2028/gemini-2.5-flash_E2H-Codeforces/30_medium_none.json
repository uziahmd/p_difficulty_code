Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"TV Game\" problem into a Python script.**\n\nThe core idea is this: we've got two players, Homer and Marge, and a long number `A` made of digits. They're going to take turns grabbing digits from the left of `A` and building their own numbers, `S1` and `S2`, with the goal of maximizing the sum of these two numbers.  The tricky part is figuring out the *best* sequence of moves to achieve this maximum sum.\n\nThe key insight is recognizing the *value* of a digit depends heavily on its *position* within the player's number. Earlier digits contribute significantly more to the final sum because they are multiplied by higher powers of ten.  This makes it a perfect candidate for a dynamic programming approach.\n\nI'll define a DP state `dp(idx, count_H, count_M)`. This represents the maximum achievable sum, given the digits `a_idx` onward, with Homer having taken `count_H` digits and Marge having taken `count_M`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** When `idx` reaches the end (all digits processed), the sum is 0.\n*   **Transitions:** At each state, we have two choices: Homer takes the digit, or Marge takes it. We calculate the contribution of the digit to the respective number (using the precomputed powers of ten) and recursively call the DP function for the next state. We'll pick the choice that results in the larger sum.\n\nTo optimize, I'll use memoization (caching) with `@functools.lru_cache(None)` to avoid redundant computations.  I also plan to reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves by storing the 'H' or 'M' choice at each DP state.  I'll also precompute the powers of ten to speed things up.\nI'll also precompute powers of 10 (`powers[i] = 10^i`, or `pow10[k] = 10^(k)` where k goes from `0` to `n-1` to represent each digit added.\n\nAfter tracing with an example, I feel confident this approach should work correctly and efficiently within the problem's constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') to maximize their total prize (S1 + S2). There are `2n` digits in total. Each player makes `n` moves. When a player takes a digit, it is appended to their number. Digits taken earlier by a player contribute more to their final number because they are multiplied by higher powers of 10. Specifically, if a digit `d` is the `k`-th digit (0-indexed) taken by a player, it contributes `d * 10^(n - 1 - k)` to that player's total score.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\n\n**State Definition:**\nLet `dp(idx, count_H, count_M)` be the maximum possible sum `S1 + S2` that can be achieved considering the digits from `A[idx]` to `A[2n-1]`, given that Homer has already taken `count_H` digits and Marge has already taken `count_M` digits.\n\n**Base Case:**\nIf `idx == 2n`, all digits have been processed. The remaining sum is 0. So, `dp(2n, count_H, count_M) = 0`.\n\n**Transitions:**\nFor a state `(idx, count_H, count_M)`, we consider the digit `A[idx]`. There are two possible moves:\n\n1.  **Homer takes `A[idx]`:**\n    This move is valid only if `count_H < n` (Homer hasn't taken all his `n` digits yet).\n    If Homer takes `A[idx]`, its contribution to `S1` will be `A[idx] * 10^(n - 1 - count_H)`.\n    The new state will be `(idx + 1, count_H + 1, count_M)`.\n    The total value for this option is `A[idx] * 10^(n - 1 - count_H) + dp(idx + 1, count_H + 1, count_M)`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes `A[idx]`:**\n    This move is valid only if `count_M < n` (Marge hasn't taken all her `n` digits yet).\n    If Marge takes `A[idx]`, its contribution to `S2` will be `A[idx] * 10^(n - 1 - count_M)`.\n    The new state will be `(idx + 1, count_H, count_M + 1)`.\n    The total value for this option is `A[idx] * 10^(n - 1 - count_M) + dp(idx + 1, count_H, count_M + 1)`.\n\n`dp(idx, count_H, count_M)` will be the maximum of the values from these valid options. We also need to store which choice ('H' or 'M') led to this maximum value to reconstruct the path later.\n\n**Memoization:**\nWe use a dictionary or `functools.lru_cache` to store the results of `dp` calls to avoid redundant computations. The number of states is `(2n + 1) * (n + 1) * (n + 1)`. For `n=18`, this is `37 * 19 * 19 = 13369` states, which is well within typical limits for competitive programming.\n\n**Path Reconstruction:**\nAfter the `dp` function is called for the initial state `(0, 0, 0)`, we can reconstruct the sequence of moves by iterating from `idx = 0` to `2n-1`. At each step `(idx, current_count_H, current_count_M)`, we look up the stored choice ('H' or 'M') and append it to our result string, then update `current_count_H` or `current_count_M` accordingly before moving to `idx + 1`.\n\n**Precomputation:**\nThe powers of 10 (`10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^(n-1)`) can be precomputed to speed up calculations.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=2, A=1234):**\n`N=2`, `A_digits = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `powers = [10^0, 10^1] = [1, 10]`\n\n`solve(0, 0, 0)`: current digit `A[0]=1`\n*   **Homer takes 1**: `1 * powers[2-1-0] = 1 * 10 = 10`. Recurse `solve(1, 1, 0)`.\n    `solve(1, 1, 0)`: current digit `A[1]=2`\n    *   **Homer takes 2**: `2 * powers[2-1-1] = 2 * 1 = 2`. Recurse `solve(2, 2, 0)`.\n        `solve(2, 2, 0)`: current digit `A[2]=3`. Homer cannot take (`count_H=2=N`).\n        *   **Marge takes 3**: `3 * powers[2-1-0] = 3 * 10 = 30`. Recurse `solve(3, 2, 1)`.\n            `solve(3, 2, 1)`: current digit `A[3]=4`. Homer cannot take (`count_H=2=N`).\n            *   **Marge takes 4**: `4 * powers[2-1-1] = 4 * 1 = 4`. Recurse `solve(4, 2, 2)`.\n                `solve(4, 2, 2)`: `idx=4=2N`. Returns `0`.\n            Value: `4 + 0 = 4`. Store 'M'.\n        Value: `30 + 4 = 34`. Store 'M'.\n    Value: `2 + 34 = 36`. Store 'H'. (Path so far: HHMM, S1=12, S2=34, sum=46)\n    *   **Marge takes 2**: `2 * powers[2-1-0] = 2 * 10 = 20`. Recurse `solve(2, 1, 1)`.\n        `solve(2, 1, 1)`: current digit `A[2]=3`\n        *   **Homer takes 3**: `3 * powers[2-1-1] = 3 * 1 = 3`. Recurse `solve(3, 2, 1)` (returns 4).\n            Value: `3 + 4 = 7`.\n        *   **Marge takes 3**: `3 * powers[2-1-1] = 3 * 1 = 3`. Recurse `solve(3, 1, 2)`.\n            `solve(3, 1, 2)`: current digit `A[3]=4`. Marge cannot take (`count_M=2=N`).\n            *   **Homer takes 4**: `4 * powers[2-1-1] = 4 * 1 = 4`. Recurse `solve(4, 2, 2)` (returns 0).\n                Value: `4 + 0 = 4`. Store 'H'.\n            Value: `3 + 4 = 7`. Store 'H'.\n        Comparing 7 (Homer takes 3) and 7 (Marge takes 3). Let's say we pick 'H'. Store 'H'.\n        Value: `20 + 7 = 27`. Store 'M'. (Path so far: HMHM, S1=13, S2=24, sum=37)\n    Comparing 36 (from Homer taking 2) and 27 (from Marge taking 2). 36 is greater. Store 'H'.\n    Value: `36`.\n*   **Marge takes 1**: `1 * powers[2-1-0] = 1 * 10 = 10`. Recurse `solve(1, 0, 1)`.\n    (Similar calculations, this path will yield a smaller total sum, e.g., MHHM, S1=14, S2=13, sum=27)\n\nComparing `10 + 36 = 46` (from Homer taking 1) and `10 + 27 = 37` (from Marge taking 1). `46` is greater. Store 'H'.\nThe initial call `solve(0,0,0)` returns 46, and the stored choices will reconstruct `HHMM`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    a_digits = [int(d) for d in a_str]\n\n    # Precompute powers of 10\n    # powers[k] will be 10^k\n    # The (k)-th digit a player takes (0-indexed) contributes digit * powers[n - 1 - k]\n    powers = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\n    # choices[(idx, count_H, count_M)] stores 'H' or 'M' for path reconstruction\n    choices = {}\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(None)\n    def dp(idx, count_H, count_M):\n        if idx == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n\n        current_digit = a_digits[idx]\n        max_val = -1  # Use -1 to indicate no valid path found yet (or a very small number)\n        best_choice = ''\n\n        # Option 1: Homer takes the digit\n        if count_H < n:\n            homer_contribution = current_digit * powers[n - 1 - count_H]\n            val_if_homer_takes = homer_contribution + dp(idx + 1, count_H + 1, count_M)\n            max_val = val_if_homer_takes\n            best_choice = 'H'\n\n        # Option 2: Marge takes the digit\n        if count_M < n:\n            marge_contribution = current_digit * powers[n - 1 - count_M]\n            val_if_marge_takes = marge_contribution + dp(idx + 1, count_H, count_M + 1)\n            \n            # If Marge's option is better, or if Homer's option was not available\n            if val_if_marge_takes > max_val:\n                max_val = val_if_marge_takes\n                best_choice = 'M'\n            elif best_choice == '' and count_H == n: # Only Marge can take, Homer already took N digits\n                max_val = val_if_marge_takes\n                best_choice = 'M'\n            # If both are valid and equal, prefer 'H' (as per problem statement, any solution is fine)\n\n        choices[(idx, count_H, count_M)] = best_choice\n        return max_val\n\n    # Call the DP function to populate memoization table and choices\n    dp(0, 0, 0)\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result_path = []\n    current_idx = 0\n    current_count_H = 0\n    current_count_M = 0\n\n    while current_idx < 2 * n:\n        choice = choices[(current_idx, current_count_H, current_count_M)]\n        result_path.append(choice)\n        if choice == 'H':\n            current_count_H += 1\n        else: # choice == 'M'\n            current_count_M += 1\n        current_idx += 1\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_path) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
