He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to String Validation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string validation problem. The goal is to determine if a given string `S` adheres to a specific set of rules. Let me lay out my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The string is formed in three steps: a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, and finally, a block of 'c's. There has to be at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.  This means the string will always be of the form  `aaa...abbb...bccc...c`, but with potentially varying counts for each character.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the string's structure. It must strictly follow the `a-b-c` order. Any deviation, like characters out of sequence, immediately invalidates the string. For example, `'abac'` is not valid.\n\nBased on this, I'm thinking of how to perform the actual validation. I have a couple of options:\n\n1.  I could scan the string and track the end indices of each character block. First find the last 'a', last 'b', and last 'c'.\n\n2.  Alternatively, I can iterate through the string and maintain counts for `a`, `b`, and `c` as I encounter them. This feels cleaner to me because I can track the order more explicitly.  I'll initialize `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c` to zero. As I iterate:\n    *   If I see an 'a', I check that neither 'b' nor 'c' have appeared yet. Then, I increment `count_a`.\n    *   If I see a 'b', I check that 'c' hasn't appeared yet. I increment `count_b`.\n    *   If I see a 'c', I increment `count_c`.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. I need to make sure `count_a` and `count_b` are each greater than or equal to 1, and also ensure that `count_c` matches either `count_a` or `count_b`, or both. I can code this up quite efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific sequence of operations:\n1.  **A's step**: Starts with some number of 'a's. Let this be `num_a`. `num_a >= 1`.\n2.  **B's step**: Appends some number of 'b's. Let this be `num_b`. `num_b >= 1`. At this point, the string has `num_a` 'a's followed by `num_b` 'b's.\n3.  **C's step**: Appends some number of 'c's. Let this be `num_c`. `num_c` must be equal to `num_a` OR `num_b` (or both).\n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce several necessary conditions for a string `S` to be valid:\n\n1.  **Order of characters**: The string must consist of a contiguous block of 'a's, followed by a contiguous block of 'b's, followed by a contiguous block of 'c's. Any other arrangement (e.g., 'abac', 'bca') is invalid.\n2.  **Minimum counts**:\n    *   There must be at least one 'a' (`num_a >= 1`).\n    *   There must be at least one 'b' (`num_b >= 1`).\n    *   Since `num_c` must be equal to `num_a` or `num_b`, and both `num_a` and `num_b` are at least 1, `num_c` must also be at least 1.\n3.  **C's rule**: The final count of 'c's (`num_c`) must be equal to the count of 'a's (`num_a`) or the count of 'b's (`num_b`).\n\nWe can implement this check by iterating through the string `S` once to verify the order and count the characters.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `num_a = 0`, `num_b = 0`, `num_c = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through the string `S` using an index `i`:\n    *   **Counting 'a's**: While `i` is within bounds and `S[i]` is 'a', increment `num_a` and `i`.\n    *   **Counting 'b's**: While `i` is within bounds and `S[i]` is 'b', increment `num_b` and `i`.\n    *   **Counting 'c's**: While `i` is within bounds and `S[i]` is 'c', increment `num_c` and `i`.\n3.  **Check for invalid characters**: After the loops, if `i` has not reached the end of the string (`i < len(S)`), it means there's an character that is not 'a', 'b', or 'c' in the expected sequence (e.g., 'd' or an 'a' after a 'b'). In this case, the string is invalid.\n4.  **Final conditions check**:\n    *   `num_a` must be greater than 0.\n    *   `num_b` must be greater than 0.\n    *   `num_c` must be greater than 0.\n    *   `num_c` must be equal to `num_a` OR `num_c` must be equal to `num_b`.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (aaabccc):**\n\n1.  `num_a = 0, num_b = 0, num_c = 0, i = 0`\n2.  `S[0] = 'a', S[1] = 'a', S[2] = 'a'`: `num_a` becomes 3, `i` becomes 3.\n3.  `S[3] = 'b'`: `num_b` becomes 1, `i` becomes 4.\n4.  `S[4] = 'c', S[5] = 'c', S[6] = 'c'`: `num_c` becomes 3, `i` becomes 7.\n5.  `i` (7) is equal to `len(S)` (7). No invalid characters or out-of-order blocks.\n6.  Conditions check:\n    *   `num_a` (3) > 0: True\n    *   `num_b` (1) > 0: True\n    *   `num_c` (3) > 0: True\n    *   (`num_c` (3) == `num_a` (3)) OR (`num_c` (3) == `num_b` (1)): True (because 3 == 3)\n7.  All conditions met. Print \"YES\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (bbacc):**\n\n1.  `num_a = 0, num_b = 0, num_c = 0, i = 0`\n2.  `S[0] = 'b', S[1] = 'b'`: Since `num_a` is 0, these 'b's are not preceded by 'a's. This violates the order. The loop for 'a's will not run, `num_a` remains 0. The loop for 'b's will run, `num_b` becomes 2, `i` becomes 2.\n3.  `S[2] = 'a'`: This 'a' appears after 'b'. This violates the order. The loop for 'c's will not run. `i` becomes 2.\n4.  `i` (2) is not equal to `len(S)` (5). This indicates invalid characters or order.\n5.  The condition `num_a > 0` fails (0 is not > 0). The string is invalid. Print \"NO\".\n\nThe provided solution implements this logic efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    n = len(s)\n    \n    num_a = 0\n    num_b = 0\n    num_c = 0\n    \n    i = 0\n    \n    # Count 'a's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        num_a += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Count 'b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        num_b += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Count 'c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        num_c += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # After counting, if i has not reached the end of the string,\n    # it means there are characters other than 'a', 'b', 'c' or they are out of order.\n    if i < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check the conditions:\n    # 1.
