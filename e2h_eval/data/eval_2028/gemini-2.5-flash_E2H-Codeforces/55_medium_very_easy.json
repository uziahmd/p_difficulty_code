    "thought": "**Solving a String Reordering Problem**\n\nMy goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, and adjacent '1's and '2's. The key is that '0's and '2's cannot swap directly, which means their relative positions are fixed. I figured out that '0's can effectively \"bubble\" to the left past '1's, and '2's can \"bubble\" to the right past '1's. This means that I should aim to arrange the string with all '0's at the beginning, then '1's, and finally '2's.\n\nHowever, the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's prevents a simple sort. I realized that the \"2\" acts as an anchor for ordering. For any substring \"0...2\" the 0 must always stay before the 2. So the process is.\n\n1.  I identify the index of the first '2'.\n2.  I collect all the '0's appearing *before* that '2', as they can be moved to the beginning of the string because a '0' can swap through '1's.\n3.  I then append all the '1's together, because they can be moved around '0's and '2's freely.\n4.  Finally, I preserve the original relative order of all the '0's and '2's *from* the first index of the original string. The rest is appended. This keeps all the chars in proper relative order.\n\nBy following this strategy, I ensure that all '0's that *can* move to the front *are* moved, that '1's occupy the best positions, and that the fixed '0'-'2' order is maintained. The final output is the lexicographically smallest possible string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' can swap with '1': \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means a '0' can effectively move past any '1' to its left, and a '1' can move past any '0' to its right.\n2. '1' can swap with '2': \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means a '1' can effectively move past any '2' to its left, and a '2' can move past any '1' to its right.\n3. '0' cannot swap with '2'. This is the crucial constraint.\n\nThe constraint that '0' and '2' cannot swap means that their relative order is fixed. If we consider only the '0's and '2's in the original string (ignoring '1's), their sequence must be preserved in the final string. For example, if the original string is \"01210\", the sequence of '0's and '2's is \"020\". In the final string, the first '0' must be before the '2', and that '2' must be before the second '0'.\n\nThe '1's are \"flexible\". From rules 1 and 2, a '1' can move past any '0' (to its right) and any '2' (to its left). This means all '1's can effectively be grouped together and placed anywhere in the string, as long as they don't violate the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nConsider the first occurrence of a '2' in the original string `s`. Let its index be `first_two_idx`.\n- If there are no '2's in the string (`first_two_idx` would be `len(s)`): All '0's can move to the left of all '1's. So, the result will be all '0's followed by all '1's.\n- If there is at least one '2':\n    - Any '0' that appears before `first_two_idx` in the original string can be moved to the very beginning of the string. This is because it only needs to swap with '1's to its left, which is allowed.\n    - Any '1' from anywhere in the string can be moved to a block after these initial '0's. '1's before `first_two_idx` can move past '0's to their right. '1's after `first_two_idx` can move past '2's to their left (and '0's if any). Thus, all '1's can coalesce into a single block.\n    - Any '0' or '2' that appears from `first_two_idx` onwards must maintain its relative order. These characters will form the suffix of our string, after the block of '1's.\n\nThis leads to the following strategy:\n1. Find the index of the first '2' in the input string `s`. If no '2' exists, set this index to `len(s)`.\n2. Initialize an empty list of characters, `result_chars`, to build the output string.\n3. Iterate through `s` from the beginning up to (but not including) `first_two_idx`. If a character is '0', append it to `result_chars`. (Any '1's in this prefix are skipped for now).\n4. Count all '1's in the entire string `s`. Append this many '1's to `result_chars`.\n5. Iterate through `s` from `first_two_idx` to the end of the string. If a character is '0' or '2', append it to `result_chars`. (Any '1's in this suffix are skipped, as they were already collected in step 4).\n6. Join `result_chars` to form the final string and print it.\n\nThis strategy ensures that:\n- All '0's that can be moved to the very beginning are placed there.\n- All '1's are grouped together immediately after these '0's, which is their lexicographically optimal position.\n- The fixed relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved for all characters from `first_two_idx` onwards.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `first_two_idx = 3` (index of '2').\n2. `result_chars = []`\n3. Iterate `i` from 0 to 2:\n   - `s[0] = '1'` (skip)\n   - `s[1] = '0'` (append '0'). `result_chars = ['0']`\n   - `s[2] = '0'` (append '0'). `result_chars = ['0', '0']`\n4. Count '1's in `s`: `s.count('1')` is 2. Append two '1's. `result_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1']`\n5. Iterate `i` from 3 to 5:\n   - `s[3] = '2'` (append '2'). `result_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2']`\n   - `s[4] = '1'` (skip, it's a '1')\n   - `s[5] = '0'` (append '0'). `result_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`\n6. Join: `\"001120\"`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(N) because we iterate through the string a constant number of times (finding `first_two_idx`, counting '1's, and two loops for building the result). The space complexity is O(N) for storing the result string. N is up to 10^5, so this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    result_chars = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Find the index of the first '2'.\n    # If no '2' is found, first_two_idx will remain len(s).\n    first_two_idx = len(s) \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n            \n    # Step 2: Collect '0's that appear before the first '2'.\n    # If first_two_idx is 0 (string starts with '2'), this loop is empty.\n    # If first_two_idx is len(s) (no '2's), this loop collects all '0's.\n    for i in range(first_two_idx):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            result_chars.append('0')\n    \n    # Step 3: Collect all '1's from the entire string.\n    # All '1's can be moved to this position, after the initial '0's.\n    num_ones = s.count('1')\n    result_chars.extend(['1'] * num_ones)\n    \n    # Step 4: Collect '0's and '2's that appear from the first '2' onwards.\n    # These characters maintain their relative order.\n    # If first_two_idx is len(s) (no '2's), this loop is empty.\n    for i in range(first_two_idx, len(s)):\n        if s[i] != '1': # This means it's '0' or '2'\n            result_chars.append(s[i])\n                \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
