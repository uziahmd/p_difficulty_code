Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Gluttony Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem, and the goal is to permute an array `a` into a new array `b` such that the sums of elements in any non-empty, non-full subset of `a` are different from the sums of those same elements in `b`.  It's a classic permutation puzzle with a bit of a twist. The constraint on subset sums makes it interesting. The small array size, specifically `n <= 22`, is intriguing and suggests a possible brute-force approach.\n\nI'm thinking about the implications of permutations. Since `b` is just a rearrangement of `a`, the total sum of `a` and `b` will always be the same. That's a key observation, and the problem statement explicitly acknowledges this by only considering subsets that aren't the whole array.\n\nMy initial line of thought is to check small cases. With `n=1`, the condition is automatically satisfied because there's no subset to compare.  `b` simply equals `a`. When it comes to the n=2 case, I see that the only possible permutation that is different from `a` is the reversal.  It has to be the case that, if `a = [a_0, a_1]`, then `b = [a_1, a_0]`. However, for this to work, it has to be the case that `a_0 != a_1`.\n\nSo far, I'm thinking the core of the problem lies in strategically choosing elements' new positions to ensure distinct subset sums.  I'll need to explore different permutation strategies and see how these compare for the more complex conditions as n grows.\n",
