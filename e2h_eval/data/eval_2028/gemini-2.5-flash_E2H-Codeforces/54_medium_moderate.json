Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Finding the Optimal Angle in a Regular Polygon**\n\nI'm tackling a problem where I need to find three vertices (v1, v2, v3) of a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given angle 'a'.  The key is to understand that the angle v1-v2-v3 is an inscribed angle, and its measure is half the central angle subtended by the arc v1-v3 (excluding v2).\n\nI've determined that the central angle for each edge in the n-gon is 360/n degrees. Now, I need to figure out how many edges are on the arc between v1 and v3. Let's fix v2 as vertex number 2 (we can pick any vertex for v2, and 2 is safe). Let's let v1 = 1. Then v3 is some vertex 'j'. The number of edges on the arc between v1 and v3 (excluding v2) will dictate the angle.  Since v1, v2, and v3 must be different, the number of edges on that arc ranges from 1 to n-2. For each possible number of edges 'k' on the arc, the angle is k * 180/n.\n\nTo find the best angle, I'll loop through each possible value of 'k' (from 1 to n-2), calculate the corresponding angle, and see how close it is to the target angle 'a'. I'll keep track of the 'k' that gives the smallest difference. This simple search will be very fast enough because of the constraints.\n\nOnce I have the best 'k', I just need to choose v1 and v3 so that the arc between them (excluding v2) has 'k' edges. Fixing v2 as the 2nd vertex, I can select v1 as the 1st vertex.  Then, v3 should simply be k + 2. In this way, I can ensure they're distinct and valid. Now, I have my three vertices ready, and my script should produce the right result.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1`, `v2`, `v3` of a regular convex `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to print these three vertex numbers.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** All vertices of a regular convex `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1`, `v2`, `v3` (an inscribed angle) is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n2.  **Central Angle:** In a regular `n`-gon, the central angle subtended by one edge is `360/n` degrees.\n3.  **Possible Angles:** Let `v2` be the vertex of the angle. The angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1-v3` (the arc that does not contain `v2`). If this arc consists of `k` edges of the `n`-gon, then the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees. Therefore, the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is `(k * 360/n) / 2 = k * 180/n` degrees.\n4.  **Range of `k`:** Since `v1`, `v2`, `v3` must be distinct vertices, the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) must have at least one edge (`k >= 1`). Also, this arc cannot be the entire circle (it must exclude `v2`). The maximum number of edges on such an arc is `n-2`. For example, if `v2` is vertex 2, `v1` is vertex 1, and `v3` is vertex `n`, the arc `v1-v3` (from 1 to `n` clockwise, not containing 2) consists of `n-2` edges (vertices `1, n, n-1, ..., 3`). So, `k` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Iterate through possible `k` values:** We will iterate `k` from `1` to `n-2`.\n2.  **Calculate angle and difference:** For each `k`, calculate the `current_angle = k * 180 / n`. Then, calculate the absolute difference `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n3.  **Find best `k`:** Keep track of the `k` that yields the minimum `current_diff`. If multiple `k` values result in the same minimum difference, any of them is acceptable (the problem states \"If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them\"). Our approach will naturally pick the smallest `k` in such a scenario.\n4.  **Construct vertices `v1, v2, v3`:** Once the `best_k` is found, we need to choose three distinct vertices. A simple and valid choice is:\n    *   `v2 = 2` (the vertex of the angle)\n    *   `v1 = 1` (one side of the angle)\n    *   `v3 = best_k + 2` (the other side of the angle)\n\n    Let's verify this choice:\n    *   **Distinctness:** `v1=1`, `v2=2`. Since `best_k >= 1`, `v3 = best_k + 2 >= 3`. Thus, `v1`, `v2`, `v3` are always distinct.\n    *   **Validity (within 1 to `n`):** `v1=1` and `v2=2` are valid. Since `best_k <= n-2`, `v3 = best_k + 2 <= (n-2) + 2 = n`. So `v3` is also a valid vertex number.\n    *   **Angle:** With `v2=2`, `v1=1`, `v3=best_k+2`, the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) is the arc from vertex 1 to vertex `best_k+2`. This arc consists of `(best_k+2) - 1 = best_k+1` vertices, meaning it has `best_k` edges. This correctly corresponds to the `best_k` we found.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=67)**\n\n1.  `n=4`, `a=67`. Possible `k` values are `1` to `n-2 = 4-2 = 2`.\n2.  **For `k=1`:**\n    *   `current_angle = 1 * 180 / 4 = 45` degrees.\n    *   `current_diff = abs(45 - 67) = 22`.\n    *   `min_diff = 22`, `best_k = 1`.\n3.  **For `k=2`:**\n    *   `current_angle = 2 * 180 / 4 = 90` degrees.\n    *   `current_diff = abs(90 - 67) = 23`.\n    *   Since `23` is not less than `min_diff` (`22`), `min_diff` and `best_k` remain unchanged.\n4.  **Result:** `best_k = 1`.\n5.  **Output Vertices:** `v1=1`, `v2=2`, `v3=best_k+2 = 1+2 = 3`. Print `1 2 3`.\n\nThis matches the logic and produces one of the valid outputs shown in the example.\n\n**Complexity**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** The loop runs `n-2` times. Inside the loop, operations are constant time. So, the time complexity is O(N). Given `N <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n*   **Space Complexity:** We only store a few variables, so the space complexity is O(1).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # Iterate through possible values for k.\n    # k represents the number of edges on the arc subtended by the angle.\n    # The angle formed by three vertices (v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex)\n    # is k * 180 / n degrees.\n    # k can range from 1 (for adjacent vertices on the arc) to n-2 (maximum possible distinct vertices).\n    for k in range(1, n - 1): # k goes from 1 to n-2 inclusive\n        current_angle = k * 180 / n\n        current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        # If this difference is smaller, update our best choice.\n        # If differences are equal, we keep the smaller k, which is fine as any optimal solution is accepted.\n        if current_diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_k = k\n\n    # Now that we have the best_k, we need to choose three distinct vertices.\n    # A simple way to do this is:\n    # Let v2 be vertex 2.\n    # Let v1 be vertex 1.\n    # To form an angle that subtends an arc of 'best_k' edges, v3 should be vertex (best_k + 2).\n    #\n    # Verification of chosen vertices (1-indexed):\n    # v1 = 1\n    # v2 = 2\n    # v3 = best_k + 2\n    #\n    # 1.
