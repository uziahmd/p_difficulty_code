Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's essentially a graph traversal disguised as a geometric problem. My goal is a Python script to solve it.\n\nHere's the breakdown: I have coordinates for my home and the university, along with a bunch of lines representing roads. The challenge is to figure out the fewest \"steps\" to get from home to the university. A \"step\" means crossing a road. Touching at a point doesn't count, it has to be a segment.\n\nThe key insight is that these roads are dividing the plane into distinct regions, or \"blocks.\" To get from one block to an adjacent block, you need to cross a road.  Crucially, since I know the home and university aren't *on* any roads, I can determine on which side of each road they lie.\n\nFor each road defined by `aix + biy + ci = 0`, I calculate `aix1 + biy1 + ci` for my home and `aix2 + biy2 + ci` for the university. If those results have opposite signs, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of that road, and any path between them must cross that road.\n\nIf the signs are the same, they're on the same side, and that road doesn't *necessarily* need to be crossed.  (Other roads might still be in the way). So, to minimize the steps, I just need to count the number of roads that separate the home and the university -- the number of roads that have different signs for home and university. That's the core of the solution, the solution should be to loop through the roads and for each road, do the necessary calculations, and increment a count if a road has different signs for the home and university. That's it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing your home) to a target block (containing the university). A step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a common border segment of non-zero length. This implies crossing exactly one road.\n\nThe key insight is to determine how many roads separate the home coordinates `(x1, y1)` from the university coordinates `(x2, y2)`.\n\nFor any given line `ax + by + c = 0`, a point `(x, y)` lies on one side if `ax + by + c > 0` and on the other side if `ax + by + c < 0`. Since it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on any road, `ax + by + c` will never be zero for these points.\n\nIf the home point `(x1, y1)` and the university point `(x2, y2)` are on *opposite* sides of a particular line `ax + by + c = 0`, then any path from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` must cross this line. This means that if we are in the block containing `(x1, y1)`, we must cross this specific road to reach a block on the other side of it, eventually making progress towards `(x2, y2)`.\n\nConversely, if `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on the *same* side of a line `ax + by + c = 0`, then it's possible to travel from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` without crossing this specific line. This line does not act as a barrier between the home and university blocks.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required is simply the count of roads for which the home point and the university point lie on opposite sides. We can determine this by checking the sign of `ax + by + c` for both points for each road. If `(ax1 + by1 + c)` and `(ax2 + by2 + c)` have different signs, we increment our counter.\n\nThe product `(ax1 + by1 + c) * (ax2 + by2 + c)` will be negative if and only if the two terms have different signs.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `x1, y1`.\n2.  Read `x2, y2`.\n3.  Read `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read `a, b, c`.\n    b.  Calculate `val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val1 * val2 < 0`, increment `steps`.\n6.  Print `steps`.\n\nThis approach correctly counts the minimum number of \"crossings\" required, which directly translates to the minimum number of steps between blocks.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for the home point\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for the university point\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have different signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n        # This can be checked by multiplying them: if the product is negative, they have different signs.\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            steps += 1\n    \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
