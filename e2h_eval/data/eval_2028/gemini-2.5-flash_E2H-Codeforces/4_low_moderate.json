The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in this Rock-Paper-Scissors scenario. The key challenge here is the massive number of rounds, `n`, up to 2 billion!  Brute-force simulation is clearly out of the question. I need a more efficient, mathematical solution.\n\nMy immediate thought is the cyclical nature of the players' strategies. Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing repeating sequences. Nikephoros has a sequence of length `m`, and Polycarpus has a sequence of length `k`. This repetition is the key.\n\nSince both sequences are cyclic, the combined pattern will also be cyclic, repeating every `lcm(m, k)` rounds. The `lcm` or least common multiple will provide me with the cycle length. Given the constraints, `m` and `k` are at most 1000, and thus the `lcm` should also be manageable.\n\n**My Strategy**\n1.  **Calculate the LCM**: I'll start by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `m` and `k` using `math.gcd` from the Python library. I can then use the formula `lcm(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)` to get the cycle length.\n\n2.  **Simulate One Cycle**: I'll create a simulation for just one full cycle. I'll iterate through `lcm` rounds, figuring out the winner for each round (using a helper function `get_winner`). If Nikephoros loses, I'll increment a counter, and if Polycarpus loses, I'll increment another. After this, I'll have the losses for both in one cycle.\n\n3.  **Scale for n Rounds**: Since I know the losses in one cycle, and I know how many cycles are in `n` rounds ( `n // lcm`), I can multiply. There might be a few remaining rounds ( `n % lcm`) at the end, so I'll need to run those remaining rounds too.\n\nThis cyclical approach is crucial. By working with the cycle length, I can avoid simulating all two billion rounds. I am confident that this approach will be efficient.  Let's code it!\n",
