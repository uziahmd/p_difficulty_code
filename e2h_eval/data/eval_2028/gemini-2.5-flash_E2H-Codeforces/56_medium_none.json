            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thinking for this Guard Duty problem.**\n\nFirst things first, I've analyzed the problem. It seems straightforward: we've got spaceships and bases, we need to connect them with non-intersecting lines. The key here is the small scale of the problem. With a maximum of 10 spaceships and bases, an exponential-time algorithm is within the realm of possibility. I'm thinking, \"permutation is the way to go!\"\n\nSo, my strategy is clear:\n\n1.  **Equal Count Check:** Ensure the number of spaceships (`R`) equals the number of bases (`B`). If not, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n2.  **Represent the Galaxy:** Store the spaceship and base coordinates. I'm thinking of using tuples for the coordinates (x, y) for efficiency.\n3.  **The Permutation Trick:** Since the numbers are small, I'll try all possible assignments of bases to spaceships. This involves generating permutations of the bases. I can fix the order of the spaceships and find a valid base order.  I'll use `itertools.permutations` to do the heavy lifting of generating all the base order possibilities.\n4.  **Intersection Detection:** The crucial part! For each permutation, I'll check if any of the line segments (spaceship-base connections) intersect. This is where the cross-product magic comes in.  I'll use the orientation of three points to determine if segments intersect. The problem statement makes this easier: \"no three points on the same line\". I don't have to worry about collinear cases. Two segments intersect if and only if their cross-products have different signs.\n\nI'll build my code piece by piece. First, I'll make an `orientation` function, taking three points as input.  Then, I'll use it to create a `segments_intersect` function to determine if two line segments cross each other.  I'll use the result of these functions in the main part of the program. I'll read in the input, check if the counts are equal, iterate through all permutations, generate the line segments, and check for intersections.\n\nIf I find a permutation with no intersections, I can print \"Yes\" and stop.  Otherwise, if I try all possible assignments and find no valid matching, I'll print \"No\".\n\nThe Python implementation is pretty standard.  The problem gives input as strings, so I'll need to use `sys.stdin` to handle this.  I'll read the input, parse it to extract the coordinates, and then follow the plan to find the solution.\n\nAnd, of course, I have to be ready to address any edge cases, like the case when there is only one spaceship and one base! It will always produce a valid solution. I am ready to go!\n",
