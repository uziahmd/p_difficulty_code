You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Plan to Tackle the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about maximizing a number by replacing its digits with others from a given set, and I need a Python script to do it. Let's break this down. First, the core concept is to think about place value – maximizing the leftmost digits has the most impact.  I've got a number `a` (a string of digits) that I need to make as large as possible. I can swap out digits in `a` with digits from another string `s`, but I have to use each digit in `s` at most once. I don't even have to use all the digits in `s`, which is interesting.\n\nThe fundamental strategy is clear: I have to iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I want to find the largest digit in `s` that is bigger than the current digit in `a`. If I find one, I swap them.\n\nTo make things efficient, I need to think about the data structures and algorithm details.  I'm thinking I'll represent `a` as a mutable list of characters, because I'll need to modify it. Sorting `s` in descending order is critical. That way, I can just scan through `s` and grab the first digit that is greater than the digit I'm examining in `a`. Once I use a digit from `s`, I need to keep track of it so it's not reused. A frequency map or, given the context, a simple \"used\" boolean array will do.\n\nSo the algorithm I'm settling on is:\n\n1.  **Prepare `a`**:  Convert `a` to a list of characters.\n2.  **Sort `s`**: Sort `s` in descending order.\n3.  **Iterate and Replace**: Loop through the digits in `a`:\n    *   For each digit in `a`, iterate through the sorted digits in `s`.\n    *   If a digit in `s` is bigger, make the swap, mark the digit in `s` as used, and go to the next digit in `a`.\n4.  **Finalize**: Join the modified list of characters back into a string and that's my answer.\n\nI think this approach will result in an efficient solution because it focuses on the most significant digits first and avoids unnecessary searching.  I'm ready to start coding this up.\n",
