String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Beautiful String Reduction**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem about \"beautiful strings\". The core of it is understanding how this reduction operation works on strings of '0's and '1's.  I need to count the strings that can be reduced to a single character `g`, given the constraints on the number of '0's and '1's they must contain.\n\nMy initial thought is that since the operation always reduces the string length by one, the final character is determined by the initial string.  The order of the reductions matters for intermediate strings, but not for the final outcome.  My intuition tells me I should be able to characterize this reduction process mathematically.\n\nI started by looking at the operation `f(c1, c2)` where `c1` is the second-to-last character, and `c2` is the last character.  I tried to map it to a simple Boolean logic operation like XOR.  It *almost* works with a modification, but I couldn't quite get the formula right.  I quickly realized that a naive XOR approach wasn't going to be sufficient.  I need a better characterization.\n\nNow I'm focusing on the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of '1's in the initial string.  I have a feeling there might be a connection between the final character and this parity.  Let me try a few examples to see if a pattern emerges.  I'm exploring the behavior of the operation on different strings to see if the parity of the ones has an impact on the final single character outcome.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones such that after repeatedly applying a specific modification operation, the string reduces to a single character `g`. The modification operation replaces the two last characters `c_k-1 c_k` with a new character: '1' if `c_k-1 c_k` is \"00\", and '0' otherwise.\n\nLet's analyze the modification operation. If we represent '0' as 0 and '1' as 1, the operation `f(c_1, c_2)` can be described as:\n`f(0, 0) = 1`\n`f(0, 1) = 0`\n`f(1, 0) = 0`\n`f(1, 1) = 0`\n\nNotice that the result is '1' if and only if both input characters are '0'. Otherwise, the result is '0'.\n\nConsider the parity of the number of '1's in the string.\nLet `N_1` be the number of '1's in a string.\nWhen we replace `c_1 c_2` with `f(c_1, c_2)`:\n1. `00` -> `1`: `N_1` increases by 1 (or changes from even to odd, or odd to even).\n2. `01` -> `0`: `N_1` decreases by 1 (or changes from odd to even, or even to odd).\n3. `10` -> `0`: `N_1` decreases by 1 (or changes from odd to even, or even to odd).\n4. `11` -> `0`: `N_1` decreases by 2 (or changes from odd to odd, or even to even).\n\nIn all cases, the parity of `N_1` flips if `f(c_1, c_2)` is different from `c_1 XOR c_2`.\n`c_1 XOR c_2`: `00`->`0`, `01`->`1`, `10`->`1`, `11`->`0`.\n`f(c_1, c_2)`: `00`->`1`, `01`->`0`, `10`->`0`, `11`->`0`.\n\nThe key observation is how the *parity* of the number of '1's changes.\nLet `S` be the sum of characters if '0' is 0 and '1' is 1. `S` is just the count of '1's.\nWhen `c_1 c_2` is replaced by `f(c_1, c_2)`:\n- `00` -> `1`: `S` changes by `1 - (0+0) = 1`.\n- `01` -> `0`: `S` changes by `0 - (0+1) = -1`.\n- `10` -> `0`: `S` changes by `0 - (1+0) = -1`.\n- `11` -> `0`: `S` changes by `0 - (1+1) = -2`.\n\nIn all cases, the change in `S` is `f(c_1, c_2) - (c_1 + c_2)`.\nThe parity of `S` changes by `(f(c_1, c_2) - (c_1 + c_2)) mod 2`.\nThis is `(f(c_1, c_2) + c_1 + c_2) mod 2`.\n- `00` -> `1`: `(1 + 0 + 0) mod 2 = 1`. Parity flips.\n- `01` -> `0`: `(0 + 0 + 1) mod 2 = 1`. Parity flips.\n- `10` -> `0`: `(0 + 1 + 0) mod 2 = 1`. Parity flips.\n- `11` -> `0`: `(0 + 1 + 1) mod 2 = 0`. Parity stays same.\n\nThis is not simple. Let's look at the final character.\nThe operation always replaces the two *last* characters. This means the reduction process is unique for a given string.\nConsider the string `s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\n`s_1 ... s_{L-2} f(s_{L-1}, s_L)`\n`s_1 ... s_{L-3} f(s_{L-2}, f(s_{L-1}, s_L))`\nAnd so on. This is equivalent to evaluating an expression tree where `f` is an associative operation, but it's not.\nHowever, if we consider `s_i` as a value, the final character `R` depends on the initial string.\nA crucial property for this operation is that the final character `R` is '1' if and only if the number of '0's in the string is odd AND the number of '1's in the string is even.\nOtherwise, `R` is '0'.\n\nLet's prove this property.\nLet `N_0` be the count of '0's and `N_1` be the count of '1's.\nThe operation `f(c_1, c_2)` is '1' iff `c_1=0` and `c_2=0`.\nThis means the final character is '1' iff the string can be reduced to `00...00` (an even number of '0's) which then reduces to `1`.\nLet's consider the state `(N_0, N_1)` for the current string.\n- `00` -> `1`: `(N_0, N_1)` changes to `(N_0-2, N_1+1)`.\n- `01` -> `0`: `(N_0, N_1)` changes to `(N_0-1, N_1)`.\n- `10` -> `0`: `(N_0, N_1)` changes to `(N_0-1, N_1)`.\n- `11` -> `0`: `(N_0, N_1)` changes to `(N_0, N_1-2+1) = (N_0, N_1-1)`.\n\nThis is still complex. A simpler approach is to focus on the parity of `N_0` and `N_1`.\nLet's observe the property:\nThe final character is 1 if and only if there's an odd number of 0s and an even number of 1s.\nOtherwise, the final character is 0.\n\nLet's verify this claim:\n- If `N_1 > 0` and `N_1` is odd:\n  - If `N_0` is odd: `(odd, odd)`. Example: \"01\", \"10\", \"001\", \"010\", \"100\".\n    \"01\" -> 0. \"10\" -> 0. \"001\" -> \"00\" `f(0,1)` = \"000\" -> \"0\" `f(0,0)` = \"01\" -> 0.\n    \"001\" -> \"000\" -> \"01\" -> 0.\n  - If `N_0` is even: `(even, odd)`. Example: \"1\", \"00111\".\n    \"1\" -> 1. (This is a base case, string length 1, no modification. But the problem implies L>=2 for modification, so L=1 strings are not considered for reduction. If L=1, the character IS the result.)\n    If `n=0, m=1`, string \"1\". `g=1`. `N_0=0` (even), `N_1=1` (odd). This matches `g=0` in the claim.\n    The problem states `n+m >= 1`.\n    If `n=0, m=1`, string is \"1\". Final char is '1'. `(N_0=0, N_1=1)`. Claim says `0`. This is a contradiction.\n    The claim must apply to strings of length >= 2.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `n=1, m=1, g=0`. Output `2`. Strings \"01\", \"10\".\n\"01\" -> `f(0,1)` = 0. `N_0=1, N_1=1`.\n\"10\" -> `f(1,0)` = 0. `N_0=1, N_1=1`.\nIn this case, `N_0` is odd, `N_1` is odd. The result is 0. This matches `g=0`.\n\nExample `n=2, m=2, g=0`. Output `4`. Strings \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n`N_0=2, N_1=2`.\n\"0011\" -> \"0\" `f(0,1)` = \"00\" -> `f(0,0)` = 1. Result 1. This should be 0.\nThis contradicts the observation. The claim is incorrect.\n\nLet's trace \"0011\" carefully:\n\"0011\" -> \"00\" + `f(1,1)` = \"000\"\n\"000\" -> \"0\" + `f(0,0)` = \"01\"\n\"01\" -> `f(0,1)` = \"0\"\nSo \"0011\" reduces to \"0\". This matches `g=0`. My manual trace was wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the claim with `N_0=2, N_1=2`: `(even, even)`. Claim says `0`. This matches.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `n=1, m=1, g=1`. Output `0`.\n`N_0=1, N_1=1`. `(odd, odd)`. Claim says `0`. This matches.\n\nThe claim seems to be:\nThe final character is '1' if `N_0` is odd and `N_1` is even.\nThe final character is '0' otherwise.\nThis applies for strings of length `L >= 2`.\n\nLet's prove this claim.\nLet `R(s)` be the character that string `s` reduces to.\nBase cases:\n- `R(\"00\") = 1` (`N_0=2` even, `N_1=0` even). Claim: 0. Contradiction.\n- `R(\"01\") = 0` (`N_0=1` odd, `N_1=1` odd). Claim: 0. Match.\n- `R(\"10\") = 0` (`N_0=1` odd, `N_1=1` odd). Claim: 0. Match.\n- `R(\"11\") = 0` (`N_0=0` even, `N_1=2` even). Claim: 0. Match.\n\nThe claim is wrong for `R(\"00\") = 1`.\nThe claim is wrong for `R(\"11\") = 0`.\nThe claim is wrong for `R(\"00\") = 1`.\n\nLet's trace the values `N_0` and `N_1` modulo 2.\nLet `(n_0, n_1)` be `(N_0 mod 2, N_1 mod 2)`.\n`c_1 c_2` -> `f(c_1, c_2)`\n- `00` -> `1`: `N_0` decreases by 2, `N_1` increases by 1. `(n_0, n_1)` becomes `(n_0, n_1+1)`.\n- `01` -> `0`: `N_0` decreases by 1, `N_1` stays same. `(n_0, n_1)` becomes `(n_0+1, n_1)`.\n- `10` -> `0`: `N_0` decreases by 1, `N_1` stays same. `(n_0, n_1)` becomes `(n_0+1, n_1)`.\n- `11` -> `0`: `N_0` stays same, `N_1` decreases by 1. `(n_0, n_1)` becomes `(n_0, n_1+1)`.\n\nThis means `n_0` changes if one of the last two characters is '0' and the other is '1'.\n`n_1` changes if both are '0' or both are '1'.\n\nThis is the key insight: The final character `R` is '1' if and only if `m=0` and `n` is even and `n>=2`.\nOtherwise, `R` is '0'.\n\nLet's test this new claim:\n- If `m=0`: The string is `00...0`.\n  - If `n=0`: (Empty string, not allowed as `n+m>=1`).\n  - If `n=1`: \"0\". `R=0`. Claim: `m=0`, `n` is odd. Result `0`. Match.\n  - If `n=2`: \"00\". `R=1`. Claim: `m=0`, `n` is even. Result `1`. Match.\n  - If `n=3`: \"000\". \"000\" -> \"01\". \"01\" -> \"0\". `R=0`. Claim: `m=0`, `n` is odd. Result `0`. Match.\n  - If `n=4`: \"0000\". \"0000\" -> \"001\". \"001\" -> \"00\" `f(0,1)` = \"000\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". `R=0`.\n    Wait, \"0000\" -> \"00\" `f(0,0)` = \"001\". \"001\" -> \"0\" `f(0,1)` = \"00\" -> `f(0,0)` = \"1\". `R=1`.\n    Claim: `m=0`, `n` is even. Result `1`. Match.\n    It seems that for `m=0`, `R=1` if `n` is even and `n>=2`. Otherwise `R=0`.\n    This is because `00...0` (n zeros) reduces to `1` if `n` is even and `n>=2`.\n    If `n=1`, `R=0`. If `n=2`, `R=1`. If `n=3`, `R=0`. If `n=4`, `R=1`.\n    This pattern is `R = (n % 2 == 0 && n >= 2) ? 1 : 0` for `m=0`.\n\n- If `m > 0`: The string contains at least one '1'.\n  Any operation `01`->`0`, `10`->`0`, `11`->`0` reduces the number of ones or preserves it (if a 0 replaces a 1).\n  Crucially, if a '1' is involved in the last two characters, the result is always '0'.\n  This means that if there is at least one '1' in the string, and it reaches the last position, it will likely turn into a '0'.\n  Consider the rightmost '1'. Let the string be `...c_k 1 0...0` (with `j` zeros after the '1').\n  `...c_k 1 0...0` -> `...c_k 1 0...0` (j-1 zeros) `f(0,0)` if `j>=2`.\n  `...c_k 1 0...0` -> `...c_k 1` `f(1,0)` if `j=1`.\n  `...c_k 1` `f(1,0)` = `...c_k 0`.\n  `...c_k 1 0` -> `...c_k 0`. The rightmost '1' gets turned into '0'.\n  What if the rightmost '1' is `s_L` or `s_{L-1}`?\n  If `s_L = 1`: `...s_{L-1} 1`.\n    If `s_{L-1}=0`: `...01` -> `...0`. The '1' is gone.\n    If `s_{L-1}=1`: `...11` -> `...0`. The '1's are gone.\n  If `s_L = 0` and `s_{L-1} = 1`: `...10` -> `...0`. The '1' is gone.\n  In all cases where a '1' is among the last two characters, the replacement character is '0'.\n  This means that any '1' that reaches the end of the string will be converted to a '0'.\n  The only way to get a '1' as a result is if `00` -> `1`.\n  This implies that for the final character to be '1', all '1's must have been eliminated, and then the remaining '0's must form `00` at some point.\n  If `m > 0`, the final character is always '0'.\n  This is because any '1' will eventually be at `s_k` or `s_{k-1}` for some `k`.\n  If `s_k=1` or `s_{k-1}=1`, then `f(s_{k-1}, s_k)` is '0'.\n  So, if there is at least one '1' in the string, the final character will be '0'.\n  This is a very strong claim. Let's test it.\n  `n=1, m=1, g=0`. Output `2`. (Strings \"01\", \"10\"). `m>0`, so `R=0`. Matches.\n  `n=2, m=2, g=0`. Output `4`. (`m>0`, so `R=0`). Matches.\n  `n=1, m=1, g=1`. Output `0`. (`m>0`, so `R=0`. We need `g=1`, so 0 strings). Matches.\n\nThis seems to be the correct logic:\n1. If `m > 0`, the final character is '0'.\n2. If `m = 0`: The string consists only of '0's.\n   - If `n = 0`: Not possible (`n+m >= 1`).\n   - If `n = 1`: String \"0\". Final char '0'.\n   - If `n` is even and `n >= 2`: String \"0...0\" (`n` times). Final char '1'.\n   - If `n` is odd and `n >= 3`: String \"0...0\" (`n` times). Final char '0'.\n\nCombining this with the target `g`:\n- If `g = 1`:\n  - We need `m=0` AND `n` is even AND `n >= 2`.\n  - If these conditions are met, there is 1 such string (the string of `n` zeros).\n  - Otherwise, there are 0 such strings.\n- If `g = 0`:\n  - If `m > 0`: Any string with `n` zeros and `m` ones will reduce to '0'.\n    The number of such strings is `C(n+m, n)` (choose positions for `n` zeros out of `n+m` total positions).\n  - If `m = 0`:\n    - If `n = 1`: String \"0\". Reduces to '0'. Count is 1.\n    - If `n` is even and `n >= 2`: String \"0...0\". Reduces to '1'. Not a desired string. Count is 0.\n    - If `n` is odd and `n >= 3`: String \"0...0\". Reduces to '0'. Count is 1.\n\nLet's summarize the logic for `g=0`:\nIf `m > 0`: `C(n+m, n)` strings.\nIf `m = 0`:\n  If `n` is odd: 1 string (the string of `n` zeros). (This covers `n=1,3,5,...`)\n  If `n` is even: 0 strings. (This covers `n=2,4,6,...`)\n\nConsider edge cases: `n=0, m=1, g=0`.\n`m=1 > 0`. So `C(0+1, 0) = C(1,0) = 1`. String \"1\". Reduces to \"1\".\nBut my logic says `m>0` means `R=0`. Contradiction.\n\nThe problem statement: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.\"\nThis means if `L=1`, the character *is* `s_1`.\nSo for `n=0, m=1`, the string is \"1\". Its length is 1. No modifications are possible. The resulting character is '1'.\nIf `g=0`, then `n=0, m=1` should yield `0` strings.\nIf `g=1`, then `n=0, m=1` should yield `1` string.\n\nMy claim \"If `m > 0`, the final character is '0'\" is only true for strings of length `L >= 2`.\nWe need to handle `L=1` strings separately.\n`n+m` is the length `L`.\n\nCase 1: `L = 1` (i.e., `n+m = 1`)\n   - If `n=1, m=0`: String is \"0\". Result is '0'.\n     - If `g=0`: Count is 1.\n     - If `g=1`: Count is 0.\n   - If `n=0, m=1`: String is \"1\". Result is '1'.\n     - If `g=0`: Count is 0.\n     - If `g=1`: Count is 1.\n\nCase 2: `L >= 2` (i.e., `n+m >= 2`)\n   Subcase 2.1: `m = 0` (string is `0...0` of length `n`)\n     - If `n` is even: Result is '1'. (e.g., \"00\" -> 1, \"0000\" -> 1).\n     - If `n` is odd: Result is '0'. (e.g., \"0\" -> 0, \"000\" -> 0).\n     Note: This pattern holds for `n>=1`. But `L>=2` means `n>=2` here.\n     So if `n` is even and `n>=2`, result is '1'.\n     If `n` is odd and `n>=3`, result is '0'.\n     - If `g=0`:\n       - If `n` is odd (`n>=3`): Count is 1.\n       - If `n` is even (`n>=2`): Count is 0.\n     - If `g=1`:\n       - If `n` is even (`n>=2`): Count is 1.\n       - If `n` is odd (`n>=3`): Count is 0.\n   Subcase 2.2: `m > 0` (string contains at least one '1')\n     - The result is always '0'.\n     - If `g=0`: Count is `C(n+m, n)`.\n     - If `g=1`: Count is 0.\n\nLet's combine everything into a single logic structure.\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n`n, m, g = map(int, input().split())`\n\n`total_length = n + m`\n\n`ans = 0`\n\nIf `total_length == 1`:\n  If `n == 1` (string \"0\"):\n    If `g == 0`: `ans = 1`\n    Else (`g == 1`): `ans = 0`\n  Else (`m == 1`, string \"1\"):\n    If `g == 0`: `ans = 0`\n    Else (`g == 1`): `ans = 1`\nElse (`total_length >= 2`):\n  If `m == 0`: # String is all zeros\n    If `n % 2 == 0`: # n is even (e.g., \"00\", \"0000\").

My logic is wrong for `m>0`.\n\nMy claim \"If `m > 0`, the final character is '0'\" is incorrect.\nThe initial proof attempt for `m > 0` was: \"any '1' that reaches the end of the string will be converted to a '0'\".\nThis is true, but it doesn't mean the final character is '0'. A '1' can be generated by `00 -> 1`.\nExample: \"0011\" -> \"000\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". Result is '0'. (Matches `g=0`).\nExample: \"0100\" -> \"011\" -> \"00\" -> \"1\". Result is '1'. (`n=2, m=2`).\nThis string \"0100\" has `n=3, m=1`.\n`n=2, m=2` strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\nLet's check them:\n\"0011\" -> \"000\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". (g=0)\n\"0101\" -> \"010\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". (g=0)\n\"0110\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". (g=0)\n\"1001\" -> \"100\" -> \"11\" -> \"0\". (g=0)\n\"1010\" -> \"101\" -> \"10\" -> \"0\". (g=0)\n\"1100\" -> \"110\" -> \"11\" -> \"0\". (g=0)\nAll 6 strings reduce to '0'. So `C(4,2)=6` should be the answer for `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\nThe example output for `n=2, m=2, g=0` is `4`. Why?\n\nThe example output `4` implies that two specific strings from `C(4,2)` are excluded.\nWhat could be special about these strings?\nThe problem text: \"The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement very carefully.\n\"The character g equals either zero or one.\"\n\"A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nWhat if the final character is determined by the number of ones modulo 2?\nLet `S` be the sum of characters (0 for '0', 1 for '1'). `S = m`.\n`f(c1, c2)`:\n`f(0,0)=1`. Change in `S` is `1 - (0+0) = 1`.\n`f(0,1)=0`. Change in `S` is `0 - (0+1) = -1`.\n`f(1,0)=0`. Change in `S` is `0 - (1+0) = -1`.\n`f(1,1)=0`. Change in `S` is `0 - (1+1) = -2`.\n\nThe parity of `S` changes by `1` in the first three cases, and by `0` in the last case.\nThis depends on `c1, c2`. This doesn't simplify to a simple parity rule.\n\nLet's use the property from a known problem: the final character is '1' if and only if the number of '1's in the string is odd.\nThis is for `XOR` operation. `0 XOR 0 = 0`, `0 XOR 1 = 1`, `1 XOR 0 = 1`, `1 XOR 1 = 0`.\nOur operation is `f(c1,c2)`: `00->1`, `01->0`, `10->0`, `11->0`.\n\nLet's consider the number of '1's at odd positions and even positions.\nThis seems like a very specific operation `f(c1,c2) = (c1 == 0 && c2 == 0) ? 1 : 0`.\nThis is `1 - (c1 OR c2)`.\nNo, `1 - (0 OR 0) = 1`. `1 - (0 OR 1) = 0`. `1 - (1 OR 0) = 0`. `1 - (1 OR 1) = 0`.\nThis is exactly `1 - (c1 OR c2)`.\nSo `R(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = R(s_1 ... s_{L-2} (1 - (s_{L-1} OR s_L)))`.\nLet's use `x_i` for `s_i`.\n`R(x_1 ... x_L) = R(x_1 ... x_{L-2} (1 - (x_{L-1} OR x_L)))`.\nThis is equivalent to `1 - (x_1 OR (1 - (x_2 OR (1 - (...))))`. This is not easy to analyze.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the example `n=2, m=2, g=0`. Output `4`.\nStrings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\nWhat about \"0101\" and \"0110\"?\n\"0101\" -> \"010\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". This is one of the 6 strings that reduces to '0'.\n\"0110\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". This is one of the 6 strings that reduces to '0'.\n\nThe example output `4` for `n=2,m=2,g=0` means that exactly two strings among the `C(4,2)=6` strings must reduce to '1'.\nWhich ones?\nMy traces for all 6 strings \"0011\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\" all result in '0'.\nThis suggests my reduction logic is wrong or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet's re-trace \"0100\" -> \"1\".\n`n=3, m=1`.\n\"0100\" -> \"01\" `f(0,0)` = \"011\"\n\"011\" -> \"0\" `f(1,1)` = \"00\"\n\"00\" -> `f(0,0)` = \"1\".\nSo \"0100\" reduces to '1'. This string has `n=3, m=1`.\n\nThe rule \"If `m > 0`, the final character is '0'\" is definitely wrong.\nThe rule \"If `m = 0`, `n` even, `n>=2` -> '1'; else '0'\" is consistent with my traces.\nSo the problem is when `m > 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the `1-(c1 OR c2)` operation.\n`R(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = s_1 \\text{ op } s_2 \\text{ op } ... \\text{ op } s_L` where `op` is `1 - (A OR B)`.\nThis operation is not associative from left to right or right to left.\nIt's always `s_1 s_2 ... s_{k-2} f(s_{k-1}, s_k)`. So it's a right-associative operation.\nLet `F(s_1, s_2, ..., s_L)` be the result.\n`F(s_1, ..., s_L) = F(s_1, ..., s_{L-2}, f(s_{L-1}, s_L))`.\nThis is `s_1 \\text{ op } (s_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } (s_{L-1} \\text{ op } s_L)...))`.\nLet `s_1 \\text{ op } s_2 = 1 - (s_1 \\text{ OR } s_2)`.\n`s_1 \\text{ op } s_2 \\text{ op } s_3 = s_1 \\text{ op } (1 - (s_2 \\text{ OR } s_3))`.\n`= 1 - (s_1 \\text{ OR } (1 - (s_2 \\text{ OR } s_3)))`.\n\nConsider the final character `g`.\nIf `g=1`:\n  We need `1 - (X OR Y) = 1` which implies `X OR Y = 0`. This means `X=0` and `Y=0`.\n  So the final operation must be `f(0,0)=1`.\n  This means the string must reduce to `00` at the very last step.\n  This implies `s_1 \\text{ op } (s_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } s_{L-2}...)) = 0` and `s_{L-1} \\text{ op } s_L = 0`.\n  No, this is wrong. The expression is `1 - (s_1 OR (1 - (s_2 OR (...))))`.\n  Let `A_k` be the result of reducing the suffix `s_k ... s_L`.\n  `A_L = s_L` (if `L=1`)\n  `A_k = 1 - (s_k \\text{ OR } A_{k+1})`.\n  So we want `A_1 = g`.\n\nLet's compute `A_k` for some examples.\nString \"01010\" (`n=3, m=2`). `L=5`.\n`A_5 = 0`\n`A_4 = 1 - (s_4 \\text{ OR } A_5) = 1 - (1 \\text{ OR } 0) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n`A_3 = 1 - (s_3 \\text{ OR } A_4) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 0) = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n`A_2 = 1 - (s_2 \\text{ OR } A_3) = 1 - (1 \\text{ OR } 1) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n`A_1 = 1 - (s_1 \\text{ OR } A_2) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 0) = 1 - 0 = 1`.\nResult is '1'. This matches my initial trace.\n\nSo the problem is to count strings `s` with `n` zeros and `m` ones such that `A_1 = g`.\nWhere `A_L = s_L` and `A_k = 1 - (s_k \\text{ OR } A_{k+1})` for `k < L`.\n\nLet's analyze `A_k` values.\n`A_k` can be 0 or 1.\n`A_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` AND `A_{k+1}=0`.\n`A_k = 0` otherwise.\n\nWe want `A_1 = g`.\nIf `g=1`: We need `s_1=0` AND `A_2=0`.\n  If `A_2=0`: We need `s_2=1` OR `A_3=1`.\n  If `s_2=1`: This path yields `A_2=0`.\n  If `A_3=1`: We need `s_3=0` AND `A_4=0`.\n\nThis is a dynamic programming approach.\nLet `dp[k][zeros][ones][last_val]` be the number of ways to form a suffix `s_k...s_L` using `zeros` '0's and `ones` '1's such that `A_k = last_val`.\n`L = n+m`.\nWe want `dp[1][n][m][g]`.\n\nThe state `k` goes from `L` down to `1`.\n`dp[k][num_0][num_1][val]`\nBase case: `k = L`.\n`dp[L][0][1][1] = 1` (for `s_L = 1`)\n`dp[L][1][0][0] = 1` (for `s_L = 0`)\nAll other `dp[L][...] = 0`.\n\nTransitions for `k < L`:\nTo compute `dp[k][num_0][num_1][val]`:\n  Consider `s_k = 0`:\n    Requires `num_0 >= 1`.\n    `A_k = 1` if `A_{k+1}=0`.\n      Add `dp[k+1][num_0-1][num_1][0]` to `dp[k][num_0][num_1][1]`.\n    `A_k = 0` if `A_{k+1}=1`.\n      Add `dp[k+1][num_0-1][num_1][1]` to `dp[k][num_0][num_1][0]`.\n  Consider `s_k = 1`:\n    Requires `num_1 >= 1`.\n    `A_k = 0` always (since `s_k=1`).\n      Add `dp[k+1][num_0][num_1-1][0]` to `dp[k][num_0][num_1][0]`.\n      Add `dp[k+1][num_0][num_1-1][1]` to `dp[k][num_0][num_1][0]`.\n\nThe state `k` is the length of the remaining suffix.

So my `A_k` definition and calculation is correct.\n\nThe DP state needs to be `dp[remaining_zeros][remaining_ones][result_val]`.\n`dp[i][j][val]` means count of strings with `i` zeros and `j` ones that reduce to `val`.\nThe strings are built from left to right.\n`F(s_1 ... s_L) = 1 - (s_1 \\text{ OR } F(s_2 ... s_L))`.\nThis is exactly what the DP computes.\n\nLet's re-trace `dp[2][1][...]` (`n=2, m=1`).\n`dp[2][1][0]=0, dp[2][1][1]=0`.\n\n  # Strings starting with '0': `0` + string with `1` zero and `1` one (`dp[1][1]`).\n  # `F(rest)` can be `dp[1][1][0]` (2 strings) or `dp[1][1][1]` (0 strings).\n  # If `F(rest)=0` (2 strings): `1 - (0 OR 0) = 1`. Add `2` to `dp[2][1][1]`.\n  `dp[2][1][1] = (dp[2][1][1] + dp[1][1][0]) % MOD = (0 + 2) = 2`.\n  # If `F(rest)=1` (0 strings): `1 - (0 OR 1) = 0`. Add `0` to `dp[2][1][0]`.\n  `dp[2][1][0] = (dp[2][1][0] + dp[1][1][1]) % MOD = (0 + 0) = 0`.\n\n  # Strings starting with '1': `1` + string with `2` zeros and `0` ones (`dp[2][0]`).\n  # `F(rest)` can be `dp[2][0][0]` (0 strings) or `dp[2][0][1]` (1 string).\n  # Result is `1 - (1 OR F(rest)) = 0`.\n  `dp[2][1][0] = (dp[2][1][0] + dp[2][0][0]) % MOD = (0 + 0) = 0`.\n  `dp[2][1][0] = (dp[2][1][0] + dp[2][0][1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) = 1`.\n\nTotal: `dp[2][1][0]=1`, `dp[2][1][1]=2`.\nThis means 1 string reduces to '0' and 2 strings reduce to '1'.\nStrings with `n=2, m=1`: \"001\", \"010\", \"100\".\n\"001\" -> \"000\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". This is one string reducing to '0'.\n\"010\" -> \"01\" -> \"0\". This is one string reducing to '0'.\n\"100\" -> \"11\" -> \"0\". This is one string reducing to '0'.\nAll 3 strings reduce to '0'. My DP is still wrong. It says 2 reduce to '1'.\n\nThe issue is that `dp[i][j][val]` counts *strings* of `i` zeros and `j` ones.\nThe `F(s_2 ... s_L)` is calculated from `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]`.\nThese counts are for all possible strings with those counts, not for a specific suffix.\n\nThe problem is that the `A_k` definition and the DP state definition are fundamentally different.\n`A_k` is the result of reducing the *suffix* `s_k ... s_L`. This is a fixed suffix.\nThe DP `dp[i][j][val]` is the count of *all possible strings* with `i` zeros and `j` ones that reduce to `val`.\nThe `F(s_2 ... s_L)` depends on `s_2`, `s_3`, etc.\nThe DP transitions implicitly assume that any string of `i-1` zeros and `j` ones can follow the `s_1=0`. This is where the issue lies.\n\nThe problem is that the order of characters matters.\n`s_1 s_2 ... s_L`\n`A_L = s_L`\n`A_{L-1} = 1 - (s_{L-1} \\text{ OR } s_L)`\n`A_{L-2} = 1 - (s_{L-2} \\text{ OR } A_{L-1})`\n...\n`A_1 = 1 - (s_1 \\text{ OR } A_2)`\n\nThis means `A_1` depends on `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_L`.\nThe values `A_k` are computed from right to left.\nWe need to count strings `s_1 ... s_L` with `n` zeros and `m` ones such that `A_1 = g`.\nThis is a standard combinatorics problem where we iterate through the number of '0's and '1's in the suffix `s_k...s_L`.\n\nLet `f[k][zeros][ones][val]` be the number of strings of length `k` with `zeros` '0's and `ones` '1's, such that `A_1 = val`.\nThis `f[k]` would be `dp[zeros][ones][val]` from before. This is the one that's too big.\n\nWhat if we analyze the sequence of `A_k` values?\n`A_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` and `A_{k+1}=0`.\n`A_k = 0` otherwise.\n\nWe want `A_1 = g`.\nIf `g=1`: We need `s_1=0` and `A_2=0`.\n  If `A_2=0`: We need `s_2=1` OR `A_3=1`.\n  This is still a recursive definition.\n\nConsider the parity of `m`.\nIf `m` is odd, then `g=0`.\nIf `m` is even, then `g=1` if `n` is even, `g=0` if `n` is odd.\nThis is a common pattern for operations like XOR. But our operation is `1 - (c1 OR c2)`.\n\nLet's test this pattern on the examples:\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`: `m` is odd. Pattern says `g=0`. Matches. Output `2`.\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`: `m` is even. `n` is even. Pattern says `g=1`. We need `g=0`. So `0` strings.\n  But output is `4`. This pattern is wrong.\n\nThe example output `n=2, m=2, g=0` is `4`.\nThe example output `n=1, m=1, g=1` is `0`.\nThis implies that for `n=1, m=1`, result is always `0`.\nFor `n=2, m=2`, result is always `0`.\nThis aligns with my initial (wrong) claim that `m>0` implies `R=0`.\nBut \"0100\" (`n=3, m=1`) reduces to `1`. This means `m>0` can result in `1`.\n\nThis problem is very tricky. The specific operation `1 - (c1 OR c2)` is the source of complexity.\nLet's consider the number of `1`s from the right side.\n`A_L = s_L`.\n`A_{L-1} = 1 - (s_{L-1} OR s_L)`.\n`A_{L-2} = 1 - (s_{L-2} OR (1 - (s_{L-1} OR s_L)))`.\n`A_{L-3} = 1 - (s_{L-3} OR (1 - (s_{L-2} OR (1 - (s_{L-1} OR s_L)))))`.\n\nLet `x_i` be the character at index `i` (1-indexed).\n`A_k` is the value of `1 - (x_k \\text{ OR } (1 - (x_{k+1} \\text{ OR } (...))))`.\n`A_k` is `1` if and only if `x_k=0` and `(1 - (x_{k+1} \\text{ OR } (...))) = 0`.\nThis means `x_k=0` and `x_{k+1} \\text{ OR } (1 - (x_{k+2} \\text{ OR } (...))) = 1`.\nThis implies `x_k=0` and (`x_{k+1}=1` OR `1 - (x_{k+2} \\text{ OR } (...)) = 1`).\nWhich means `x_k=0` and (`x_{k+1}=1` OR (`x_{k+2}=0` AND `1 - (x_{k+3} \\text{ OR } (...)) = 0`)).\n\nThis is equivalent to `A_k = 1` iff `x_k=0` and `A_{k+1}=0`.\n`A_k = 0` iff `x_k=1` OR `A_{k+1}=1`.\n\n`A_1 = g`.\nIf `g=1`:\n  `x_1=0` and `A_2=0`.\n  `A_2=0` means `x_2=1` OR `A_3=1`.\n  `A_3=1` means `x_3=0` and `A_4=0`.\n  `A_4=0` means `x_4=1` OR `A_5=1`.\n  ...\n  This forms a pattern: `x_1=0, x_3=0, x_5=0, ...` and `x_2=1` or `x_4=1` or `x_6=1` ...\n  Specifically, `A_1=1` implies `x_1=0`.\n  `A_2=0` implies `x_2=1` OR `A_3=1`.\n  If `x_2=1`: `A_1=1` requires `x_1=0, x_2=1`. The rest `s_3...s_L` can be anything. `A_3` doesn't matter.\n  If `A_3=1`: `A_1=1` requires `x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=0`. The rest `s_4...s_L` can be anything. `A_4` doesn't matter.\n\nThis structure suggests that the result `A_1` depends on the first '1' encountered from the left, or if there are no '1's.\nIf `s_1=1`, then `A_1=0`.\nIf `s_1=0`:\n  If `s_2=1`, then `A_2=0` (since `s_2=1`). So `A_1=1-(0 OR 0)=1`.\n  If `s_2=0`:\n    If `s_3=1`, then `A_3=0` (since `s_3=1`). So `A_2=1-(0 OR 0)=1`. So `A_1=1-(0 OR 1)=0`.\n    If `s_3=0`:\n      If `s_4=1`, then `A_4=0`. So `A_3=1-(0 OR 0)=1`. So `A_2=1-(0 OR 1)=0`. So `A_1=1-(0 OR 0)=1`.\n\nPattern for `A_1`:\n- If `s_1=1`: `A_1=0`.\n- If `s_1=0, s_2=1`: `A_1=1`.\n- If `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=1`: `A_1=0`.\n- If `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=0, s_4=1`: `A_1=1`.\n- If `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=0, s_4=0, s_5=1`: `A_1=0`.\n\nGeneralizing:\nLet `k` be the index of the first '1' in the string (`s_k=1`, and `s_1...s_{k-1}` are all '0's).\nIf `s_1=1` (i.e. `k=1`): `A_1=0`.\nIf `s_1=0, s_2=0, ..., s_{k-1}=0, s_k=1`:\n  `A_k=0` (since `s_k=1`).\n  `A_{k-1} = 1 - (s_{k-1} \\text{ OR } A_k) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 0) = 1`.\n  `A_{k-2} = 1 - (s_{k-2} \\text{ OR } A_{k-1}) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 1) = 0`.\n  `A_{k-3} = 1 - (s_{k-3} \\text{ OR } A_{k-2}) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 0) = 1`.\n  `A_{k-4} = 1 - (s_{k-4} \\text{ OR } A_{k-3}) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 1) = 0`.\n  The result `A_1` depends on `k-1` (the number of leading zeros before the first '1').\n  `A_1 = 1` if `k-1` is even.\n  `A_1 = 0` if `k-1` is odd.\n  (This is for `k >= 1`. If `k=1`, `k-1=0` (even), so `A_1=1`. But `s_1=1` gives `A_1=0`. This is the exception.)\n\nSo the logic is:\n1. If `m = 0`: (String of all '0's)\n   - If `n = 0`: (Not allowed, `n+m >= 1`)\n   - If `n = 1`: String \"0\". Result is '0'.\n   - If `n` is even and `n >= 2`: String \"00...0\". Result is '1'.\n   - If `n` is odd and `n >= 3`: String \"00...0\". Result is '0'.\n   This is `A_1 = (n % 2 == 0 && n >= 2) ? 1 : 0`. (This pattern is for `m=0` only).\n2. If `m > 0`: (String contains at least one '1')\n   Let `k` be the index of the first '1' from the left.\n   - If `k=1` (i.e., `s_1=1`): Result is `0`.\n   - If `k > 1` (i.e., `s_1...s_{k-1}` are '0's, `s_k=1`):\n     - Result is `1` if `k-1` is even.\n     - Result is `0` if `k-1` is odd.\n\nLet's verify this `m>0` logic with `n=2, m=2, g=0`. Expected `4`.\nTotal strings `C(4,2)=6`.\nStrings:\n- \"0011\": `k=3`. `k-1=2` (even). Result `1`. (This should be `0` for `g=0`).\n- \"0101\": `k=2`. `k-1=1` (odd). Result `0`.

Result `0`. (Matches `g=0`).\n\nAccording to this logic, \"0011\" reduces to '1'. All others to '0'.\nSo for `g=0`, we should count 5 strings.\nFor `g=1`, we should count 1 string (\"0011\").\nThis still doesn't match the example output `4` for `g=0`.\n\nThis means my `A_k` calculation or the interpretation of `k` is wrong.\nLet's re-trace \"0011\" with `A_k`:\n`s = \"0011\"`. `L=4`.\n`A_4 = s_4 = 1`.\n`A_3 = 1 - (s_3 \\text{ OR } A_4) = 1 - (1 \\text{ OR } 1) = 0`.\n`A_2 = 1 - (s_2 \\text{ OR } A_3) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 0) = 1`.\n`A_1 = 1 - (s_1 \\text{ OR } A_2) = 1 - (0 \\text{ OR } 1) = 0`.\nSo \"0011\" reduces to '0'. My manual trace was correct.\nThis means the pattern for `m>0` is completely wrong.\n\nThe property `A_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` AND `A_{k+1}=0` is correct.\nThis is the only way to get a '1'.\n`A_1 = 1` means `s_1=0` and `A_2=0`.\n`A_2 = 0` means `s_2=1` OR `A_3=1`.\n`A_3 = 1` means `s_3=0` and `A_4=0`.\n`A_4 = 0` means `s_4=1` OR `A_5=1`.\n...\n\nSo `A_1=1` implies a sequence like `0 (1 OR (0 (1 OR (0 (...))))`.\n`A_1=1` means `s_1=0`.\nThen `A_2=0`.\n`A_2=0` means `s_2=1` OR (`s_2=0` AND `A_3=1`).\nIf `s_2=1`: String starts `01...`. `A_1=1`.\nIf `s_2=0` and `A_3=1`: String starts `00...`.\n  `A_3=1` means `s_3=0` and `A_4=0`.\n  If `s_4=1`: String starts `0001...`. `A_1=0`.\n  If `s_4=0` and `A_5=1`: String starts `0000...`. `A_1=1`.\n\nThis pattern is: `A_1=1` if the first '1' is at an even position, OR if there are no '1's and `n` is even (`n>=2`).\nLet `p` be the position of the first '1'.\nIf `m=0`: `A_1=1` iff `n` is even and `n>=2`.\nIf `m>0`:\n  If `p` is even: `A_1=1`.\n  If `p` is odd: `A_1=0`.\n\nLet's test this pattern on `n=2, m=2, g=0`.
