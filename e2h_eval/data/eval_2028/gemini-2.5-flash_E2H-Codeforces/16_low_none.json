Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Crazy Town\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem. It seems straightforward at first glance, but I need to make sure I don't miss any nuances. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to get from a home block to a university block. The core concept here is that each \"step\" involves crossing a single road, effectively moving from one connected region (or block) to an adjacent one.\n\nThe input gives me the home and university coordinates, the number of roads, and the equation for each road. The critical constraint is that neither the home nor the university lies directly on any road. This is a very helpful simplification.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the geometry. Each road essentially divides the plane into two half-planes.  A block is essentially the intersection of these half-planes (or their complements, depending on which side of the line is defined as \"inside\").  To move from one block to another, I need to cross a road. So, the problem is rephrased: how many roads must I cross to move from the home's block to the university's block?\n\nNow, how do I efficiently determine if two points (home and university) are separated by a given road?  The key is to evaluate the equation of the line for both points. Let's call the road equation `ai*x + bi*y + ci = 0`.  I'll calculate `val1 = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci` and `val2 = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci` for the home and university coordinates, respectively.\n\nIf `val1` and `val2` have different signs, the points lie on opposite sides of the line, meaning this road is a \"barrier\" between the home and the university. If the signs are the same, they're on the same side, and I don't need to count that road.  Since neither point is on the line, these values will *never* be zero.\n\nThe solution is becoming clear now. I can just iterate through each road. For each road, I calculate the two `val` values and check their signs. If the signs differ, I increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, the counter will represent the minimum number of roads I need to cross.  It's a simple, elegant solution based on a solid geometric understanding of the problem. Time to write some Python!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to move from a block containing your home to a block containing the university. A \"step\" is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent one, meaning they share a common border of non-zero length. This implies crossing exactly one road.\n\nEach road, defined by the equation `aix + biy + ci = 0`, divides the plane into two half-planes. Your home and the university are located in specific blocks, which are regions bounded by these roads. To move from your home's block to the university's block, you must cross any road that separates them.\n\nConsider a single road `aix + biy + ci = 0`.\n1.  If your home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` lie on the *same side* of this road, then this road does not separate them. You don't need to cross this particular road to get from one to the other.\n2.  If your home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` lie on *opposite sides* of this road, then this road *does* separate them. You must cross this road (or another road that also separates them) to reach the university's side of this particular line.\n\nThe value of `f(x, y) = ax + by + c` determines which side of the line `ax + by + c = 0` a point `(x, y)` lies on. If `f(x, y) > 0`, it's on one side. If `f(x, y) < 0`, it's on the other. Since it's guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lies on any road, `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` will never be zero.\n\nTherefore, for each road, we can check if `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides by evaluating `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)`. If these two values have different signs (i.e., one is positive and the other is negative), then the road separates the two points. The total number of such roads is the minimum number of steps required. This is because each such road *must* be crossed, and each crossing counts as one step.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)`.\n2. Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n3. Read the number of roads `n`.\n4. For each of the `n` roads:\n    a. Read the coefficients `a, b, c`.\n    b. Calculate `val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c`.\n    c. Calculate `val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c`.\n    d. If `val1` and `val2` have different signs (i.e., `val1 > 0` and `val2 < 0`, or `val1 < 0` and `val2 > 0`), increment `steps`. A concise way to check for different signs is `val1 * val2 < 0`.\n5. Print `steps`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have different signs, it means the home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this line.\n        # This can be checked by multiplying them: if the product is negative,\n        # they have different signs.\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
