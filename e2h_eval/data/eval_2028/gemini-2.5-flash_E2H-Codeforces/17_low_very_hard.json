He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Prefix/Suffix Puzzle**\n\nAlright, I'm facing a competitive programming challenge. I've got a problem where I need to figure out which of the provided $2n-2$ strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string *s* of length *n*.  Crucially, I'm given all *improper* prefixes and suffixes, meaning those with lengths from 1 to *n-1*, and I know there are exactly two strings for each of these lengths.  My goal is to produce a string of 'P's and 'S's to indicate whether each input string is a prefix or a suffix.\n\nLet's break this down. The prefixes of *s* would be $p_1 = s_1$, $p_2 = s_1s_2$, and so on up to $p_{n-1} = s_1s_2...s_{n-1}$.  The suffixes are similar: $suf_1 = s_n$, $suf_2 = s_{n-1}s_n$, all the way to $suf_{n-1} = s_2s_3...s_n$.  For each length *k* (from 1 to *n-1*), I'll have one prefix ($p_k$) and one suffix ($suf_k$).\n\nThe key seems to be the strings of length *n-1*. There are only two of them. Let's call them $L_1$ and $L_2$. One must be $p_{n-1}$ and the other $suf_{n-1}$. Let's consider the two possibilities for $L_1$ and $L_2$: if $L_1$ is the prefix $s_1s_2...s_{n-1}$ and $L_2$ is the suffix $s_2s_3...s_n$.\n\nIf that's the case, I can reconstruct the full string *s* in two ways: $s = L_1 + s_n$ and $s = s_1 + L_2$.  This means $s = L_1[0...n-2] + L_2[n-2]$ and I can check if $L_1[1...n-2]$ is equal to $L_2[0...n-3]$.  Also, I know $s_1 = L_1[0]$ and $s_n = L_2[n-2]$, so the full string s is $L_1[0...n-2] + L_2[n-2]$. It's equivalent to $s = L_1[0] + L_2[0...n-2]$ where $L_1[1...n-1]$ equals $L_2[0...n-2]$. Let's verify that. If $p_{n-1} = L_1$ and $suf_{n-1} = L_2$, then $s = L_1[0] + L_2$.\nThen $p_{n-1} = L_1[0] + L_2[0...n-3]$, and that must equal to $L_1$. That means $L_1[0] = L_1[0]$ and $L_2[0...n-3] = L_1[1...n-1]$. The full string *s* is just $L_1[0...n-2] + L_2[n-2]$ which is equivalent to $L_1[0] + L_2[0...n-1]$. This is it! This is how I can build the final string *s*.\n\nI think I have a solid strategy brewing here!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify $2n-2$ given strings as either prefixes or suffixes of an unknown string $s$ of length $n$. We are told that these strings are all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths $1$ to $n-1$), and for each length $k \\in [1, n-1]$, there are exactly two strings: one is the prefix of length $k$ and the other is the suffix of length $k$.\n\nLet the unknown string be $s = s_1s_2...s_n$.\nThe prefixes are $p_k = s_1...s_k$ for $k=1, ..., n-1$.\nThe suffixes are $suf_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$ for $k=1, ..., n-1$.\n\nCrucially, there are exactly two strings of length $n-1$. These must be $p_{n-1}$ and $suf_{n-1}$.\nLet's denote the two strings of length $n-1$ as $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n\nThere are two possibilities for assigning $L_1$ and $L_2$:\n\n**Possibility 1:** $L_1$ is $p_{n-1}$ and $L_2$ is $suf_{n-1}$.\nIf $p_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1} = L_1$ and $suf_{n-1} = s_2...s_n = L_2$.\nThen the full string $s$ can be reconstructed as $s = L_1 + L_2[n-2]$ (where $L_2[n-2]$ is the last character of $L_2$).\nAlternatively, $s = L_1[0] + L_2$ (where $L_1[0]$ is the first character of $L_1$).\nFor these two forms to be consistent, the middle part must match: $L_1[1...n-1]$ must be equal to $L_2[0...n-2]$.\nIf this condition holds, we can form a candidate string $s_{cand1} = L_1[0] + L_2$.\nThen we check if all other given strings can be formed as prefixes or suffixes of $s_{cand1}$.\nSpecifically, for each length $k \\in [1, n-1]$:\nThe prefix $p_k$ of $s_{cand1}$ is $s_{cand1}[0...k-1]$.\nThe suffix $suf_k$ of $s_{cand1}$ is $s_{cand1}[n-k...n-1]$.\nWe need to verify that for each $k$, the two given strings of length $k$ are exactly $p_k$ and $suf_k$.\n\n**Possibility 2:** $L_2$ is $p_{n-1}$ and $L_1$ is $suf_{n-1}$.\nIf $p_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1} = L_2$ and $suf_{n-1} = s_2...s_n = L_1$.\nSimilarly, the full string $s$ can be reconstructed as $s = L_2 + L_1[n-2]$.\nOr $s = L_2[0] + L_1$.\nFor consistency, $L_2[1...n-1]$ must be equal to $L_1[0...n-2]$.\nIf this condition holds, we can form a candidate string $s_{cand2} = L_2[0] + L_1$.\nThen we check if all other given strings can be formed as prefixes or suffixes of $s_{cand2}$, in the same way as for $s_{cand1}$.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read $n$ and all $2n-2$ strings. Store them along with their original indices.\n2.  Identify the two strings of length $n-1$. Let them be `str_n_minus_1_a` and `str_n_minus_1_b`.\n3.  **Attempt 1: Assume `str_n_minus_1_a` is $p_{n-1}$ and `str_n_minus_1_b` is $suf_{n-1}$.**\n    *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_a[1:] == str_n_minus_1_b[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, form candidate string `s_candidate = str_n_minus_1_a[0] + str_n_minus_1_b`.\n    *   Generate all prefixes and suffixes of `s_candidate`:\n        `expected_prefixes = {s_candidate[:k] for k in range(1, n)}`\n        `expected_suffixes = {s_candidate[n-k:] for k in range(1, n)}`\n    *   Create a multiset (or frequency map) of all given strings.\n    *   For each string in `expected_prefixes`, try to remove it from the multiset of given strings.\n    *   For each string in `expected_suffixes`, try to remove it from the multiset of given strings.\n    *   If all removals are successful (i.e., the multiset becomes empty), then `s_candidate` is a valid string.\n        *   Construct the answer string: Iterate through the original input strings. If an input string is `s_candidate[:len(input_string)]`, mark it as 'P'. Otherwise, it must be `s_candidate[n-len(input_string):]`, so mark it as 'S'. Handle duplicates carefully: if both a prefix and a suffix are identical for a given length, we need to assign 'P' to one and 'S' to the other. A simple way to do this is to keep track of which specific string objects have been used. A `collections.defaultdict(list)` mapping strings to their original indices can help.\n        *   Print the answer and exit.\n\n4.  **Attempt 2: Assume `str_n_minus_1_b` is $p_{n-1}$ and `str_n_minus_1_a` is $suf_{n-1}$.**\n    *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_b[1:] == str_n_minus_1_a[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, form candidate string `s_candidate = str_n_minus_1_b[0] + str_n_minus_1_a`.\n    *   Repeat the verification process from step 3.\n    *   If valid, print the answer and exit.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that there is at least one consistent string, one of these two attempts will succeed.\n\nLet's refine the answer construction.\nTo handle identical prefixes and suffixes (e.g., $s_1...s_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$), we need to map the input strings to their original indices.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Store strings with their original indices and group by length\n    all_strings_with_indices = []\n    strings_by_length = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        all_strings_with_indices.append((s, i))\n        strings_by_length[len(s)].append((s, i))\n        \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    str_n_minus_1_candidates = strings_by_length[n-1]\n    \n    # Try the first possibility: first candidate is prefix, second is suffix\n    # (str_n_minus_1_candidates[0] as p_n-1, str_n_minus_1_candidates[1] as suf_n-1)\n    \n    # Extract the actual string values\n    L1 = str_n_minus_1_candidates[0][0]\n    L2 = str_n_minus_1_candidates[1][0]\n\n    # Check consistency for L1 being p_n-1 and L2 being suf_n-1\n    if L1[1:] == L2[:-1]:\n        s_candidate = L1[0] + L2\n        if check_and_print_solution(n, s_candidate, all_strings_with_indices):\n            return\n\n    # Try the second possibility: second candidate is prefix, first is suffix\n    # (str_n_minus_1_candidates[1] as p_n-1, str_n_minus_1_candidates[0] as suf_n-1)\n    \n    # Check consistency for L2 being p_n-1 and L1 being suf_n-1\n    if L2[1:] == L1[:-1]:\n        s_candidate = L2[0] + L1\n        if check_and_print_solution(n, s_candidate, all_strings_with_indices):\n            return\n\ndef check_and_print_solution(n, s_candidate, all_strings_with_indices):\n    # Generate expected prefixes and suffixes\n    expected_prefixes = [s_candidate[:k] for k in range(1, n)]\n    expected_suffixes = [s_candidate[n-k:] for k in range(1, n)]\n    \n    # Create a frequency map of all expected strings\n    expected_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for p in expected_prefixes:\n        expected_counts[p] += 1\n    for suf in expected_suffixes:\n        expected_counts[suf] += 1\n\n    # Create a frequency map of the input strings\n    input_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for s_val, _ in all_strings_with_indices:\n        input_counts[s_val] += 1\n\n    # Check if the counts match\n    if expected_counts != input_counts:\n        return False # This candidate string does not produce the given set of strings\n\n    # If counts match, this is a valid s_candidate.
