Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the \"Feed the Golorp\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and I need to write a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, I'm given a string representing the golorp's diet (the \"Golorp Name\"), and I have to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of values (0-9) for its variables that satisfies the diet. If no solution exists, I need to return \"false\". The input string's length is constrained between 13 and 1024 characters.\n\n**Deconstructing the Golorp Name:**\n\nThe Golorp Name has a specific format. It seems to start and end with `?(` and `):-`.  Inside, there are two key parts: an *expression* and *conditions*.  The *expression* uses arithmetic operations and underscores (`_`) representing variables, and the goal is to evaluate to zero. The *conditions* part, also with underscores and comparison operators (`>`, `<`), imposes constraints on these variables.\n\n**Variable Interpretation is Key:**\n\nThe most crucial aspect is understanding how the variables are defined. It's not as straightforward as I initially thought. It turns out that *every* `_` character within the entire Golorp Name string (between `?(` and `):-`) represents a unique variable.  These variables are numbered sequentially starting from `x0`, going up to `xN-1`, based on their left-to-right appearance. This interpretation unifies the variables used in the *expression* and the *conditions*. So, the `_` characters are not distinct in the *expression* and *conditions*, but rather a single set of variables that are constrained by both.\n\nLet's use the Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` to cement my understanding: The first `_` is `x0`, the second is `x1`, the third is `x2`, the fourth is `x3`, the fifth is `x4`, and the sixth is `x5`.\n\nI need to parse both the *expression* and the *conditions* parts. The *expression* will involve operator precedence with `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, and must evaluate to 0. The *conditions* will be a set of comparisons, evaluating to `True` for each comparison. Time to start coding.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that satisfies a given golorp's diet. The diet is defined by a string, which consists of an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to 0, and a set of comparison conditions that must all be true. All `_` characters in the input string represent distinct variables, assigned values `x0, x1, ...` in order of their appearance.\n\nThe solution involves several steps:\n\n1.  **Parsing the Golorp Name:**\n    *   Identify the total number of variables (`N`) by counting all `_` characters.\n    *   Separate the string into the `expression` part and the `conditions` part. The format is `?(` *expression* `):-` *conditions*.\n    *   Parse the `expression`: Replace each `_` with its corresponding variable name (e.g., `x0`, `x1`). The expression can contain `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators.\n    *   Parse the `conditions`: These are comma-separated comparisons. Each comparison involves two operands and an operator (`<` or `>`). Operands can be variables (`_`) or integer literals. Replace `_` with variable names.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Expression:**\n    *   The expression is an infix arithmetic expression. We need to evaluate it given specific values for `x0, ..., xN-1`.\n    *   The problem statement implies standard operator precedence (`*`, `/` before `+`, `-`).\n    *   Division by zero must be handled: if it occurs, the expression is invalid for that set of variable values.\n    *   The final result of the expression must be 0.\n\n3.  **Checking Conditions:**\n    *   For each condition (e.g., `x0 > 5`), substitute the variable values and check if the comparison holds true. All conditions must be true.\n\n4.  **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence:**\n    *   Since we need the lexicographically smallest sequence of `N` digits (0-9), this is a search problem. A brute-force approach would try all `10^N` combinations, which is too slow for `N` up to ~100.\n    *   This suggests a backtracking search (or depth-first search). We try to assign values to `x0, x1, ..., xN-1` one by one.\n    *   When assigning a value to `xi`, we iterate `d` from 0 to 9. For each `d`, we:\n        *   Assign `xi = d`.\n        *   Check if any *partial* conditions involving only `x0, ..., xi` are violated. If so, this `d` is not valid for `xi`, so we skip it.\n        *   If `d` is valid, recursively call the function for `xi+1`.\n        *   If the recursive call finds a solution, we've found the lexicographically smallest one (due to iterating `d` from 0 to 9), so we return immediately.\n\n**Detailed Implementation Steps:**\n\n*   **Variable Mapping:** Create a list `var_values` of size `N`.\n*   **Expression Evaluation Function:** A helper function `eval_expr(expr_str, var_values_map)` that takes the expression string (with `x0`, `x1`, etc.) and a dictionary mapping variable names to their current values. This function can use Python's `eval()` for convenience, but `eval()` needs variable names to be actual Python variables or looked up in a dictionary. A safer approach is to parse the expression into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or use a custom shunting-yard algorithm. Given the constraints and the problem type, `eval()` is often tolerated in competitive programming if the input is guaranteed to be safe (which it is here, as it only contains digits, variables, and basic arithmetic ops). We need to handle `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   **Condition Checking Function:** A helper function `check_conditions(conditions_list, var_values_map)` that iterates through all conditions, substitutes variable values, and evaluates them.\n*   **Backtracking Function (`solve(k)`):**\n    *   `k`: The index of the variable we are currently trying to assign (`xk`).\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k == N`, all variables have been assigned. Now, evaluate the full expression and all conditions. If both pass, we've found a solution. Store `var_values` and return `True`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `d` from 0 to 9:\n        *   `var_values[k] = d`.\n        *   **Pruning (Early Exit):** Check all conditions that *only* involve variables `x0, ..., xk`. If any of these conditions are violated, this `d` is invalid for `xk`. Continue to the next `d`. This is crucial for performance.\n        *   If `solve(k + 1)` returns `True`, then a solution was found. Return `True`.\n    *   If no `d` leads to a solution, return `False`.\n\n**Considerations for `eval()`:**\nTo use `eval()` safely and correctly with variable names like `x0`, `x1`, etc., we can pass a dictionary as the `globals` argument to `eval()`.\n`eval(expr_str, {}, var_values_map)` where `var_values_map` maps `x0` to `var_values[0]`, etc.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n\n1.  **Parsing:**\n    *   `N = 6` (variables `x0` through `x5`)\n    *   Expression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4`\n    *   Conditions: `x2 > x3` (Wait, this is `x2 > x3` for the *first* `_` in the condition section, which is the 3rd `_` overall, and the *second* `_` in the condition section, which is the 4th `_` overall)\n        *   Let's re-check variable mapping from the problem description: \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This means ALL `_`s in the name define the variables.\n        *   `?(` `_` `_` `/` `_` `_` `_` `*` `_` `_` `)` `:` `-` `_` `_` `_` `>` `_` `_` `.`\n        *   `x0`: 1st `_`\n        *   `x1`: 2nd `_`\n        *   `x2`: 3rd `_`\n        *   `x3`: 4th `_`\n        *   `x4`: 5th `_`\n        *   `x5`: 6th `_`\n        *   `x6`: 7th `_`\n        *   `x7`: 8th `_`\n        *   `x8`: 9th `_`\n        *   `x9`: 10th `_`\n        *   `x10`: 11th `_`\n        *   `x11`: 12th `_`\n        *   `x12`: 13th `_`\n        *   `N = 13`\n    *   Corrected Expression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4` (This is still based on the first 5 `_`s in the expression part)\n    *   The variables are assigned in order of appearance.\n        *   `?(` `_` `_` `/` `_` `_` `_` `*` `_` `_` `)` `:` `-` `_` `_` `_` `>` `_` `_` `.`\n        *   Expr: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4`\n        *   Cond: `x5 > x6`\n        *   This seems to be the intended interpretation from examples.\n        *   `N = 7` (for `_-_/___*__` and `___>__`)\n        *   `_` (1st): `x0`\n        *   `_` (2nd): `x1`\n        *   `_` (3rd): `x2`\n        *   `_` (4th): `x3`\n        *   `_` (5th): `x4`\n        *   `_` (6th): `x5` (in condition)\n        *   `_` (7th): `x6` (in condition)\n        *   So, `N=7`.\n        *   Expression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4`\n        *   Condition: `x5 > x6`\n\n2.  **Backtracking `solve(0)`:**\n    *   Try `x0=0`, `x1=0`, `x2=1`, `x3=0`, `x4=0`.\n    *   `x5=0`, `x6=0` (violates `x5 > x6`).\n    *   ... many trials ...\n    *   Eventually, `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0, x4=0, x5=1, x6=0`\n        *   `var_values = [0,0,1,0,0,1,0]`\n        *   Expression: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 - 0 = 0` (valid)\n        *   Condition: `1 > 0` (valid)\n        *   Solution: `0010010`. Wait, the example output is `0010`. This means my variable counting is still off.\n\n**Re-evaluating Variable Counting based on Example Output `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`.**\n\nIf the output is `0010`, it implies `N=4`. This means:\n*   The `_`s in the expression part define the variables *used in the expression*.\n*   The `_`s in the conditions part define *additional* variables.\n*   The output sequence length is the maximum of the number of variables in the expression and the number of variables in the conditions. This is highly unusual for competitive programming.\n\nLet's assume the most standard interpretation: all `_`s are distinct variables, `x0, x1, ... xN-1`, assigned in order of appearance. The output is the sequence of values for `x0, ..., xN-1`.\n\nLet's re-examine `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n`_` (1st) -> `x0`\n`_` (2nd) -> `x1`\n`/`\n`_` (3rd) -> `x2`\n`_` (4th) -> `x3`\n`_` (5th) -> `x4`\n`*`\n`_` (6th) -> `x5`\n`_` (7th) -> `x6`\nExpression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4` should be `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4` where `x0` is the first `_`, `x1` is the second `_`, `x2` is the third `_`, `x3` is the fourth `_`, `x4` is the fifth `_`. This means the variables in the expression are `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4`. The `_`s for `x5` and `x6` are unused in the expression.\n\nThen the condition: `x5 > x6` (using the 6th and 7th `_`s).\nSo, `N = 7` variables: `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6`.\nOutput `0010` has length 4. This strongly contradicts the `N=7` interpretation.\n\nThe only way `0010` makes sense for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` is if the `_`s in the expression and conditions are *re-used* or *refer to the same pool of variables, but only the first few are actually used/outputted*.\n\nLet's try the interpretation:\n*   Count all unique `_`s in the expression. Let this be `N_expr`.\n*   Count all unique `_`s in the conditions. Let this be `N_cond`.\n*   The total number of variables `N` is `max(N_expr, N_cond)`.\n*   The variables are `x0, x1, ..., xN-1`.\n*   The `k`-th `_` in the input string refers to `xk`. This is the *most standard* interpretation.\n\nLet's try to match `0010` to `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` with `N=4`.\nThis would mean:\n`x0 - x1 / x2 * x3` (the `_`s in `___*__` are ignored or map to `x0,x1,x2,x3` in some complex way)\nCondition `x? > x?`\n\nThis problem statement is notoriously vague about variable assignment.\n\"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n\"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n\nLet's try the interpretation that makes the example output `0010` work for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`.\nIf `N=4`, then `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\nExpression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3`\nCondition: `x2 > x3` (using the 3rd and 4th `_`s in the string)\nLet's see if `0010` works:\n`x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0`\nExpression: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0` (True)\nCondition: `1 > 0` (True)\nThis works! This means the `_`s are assigned to `x0, x1, ...` *up to the maximum index needed across both expression and conditions*. And the `_` characters in the problem string are essentially placeholders. The `k`-th `_` in the string refers to `x_k_prime` where `k_prime` is its index among *all* `_`s.\n\n**Revised Variable Assignment Strategy:**\n\n1.  Find all `_` characters in the entire string.\n2.  Map the `j`-th `_` to the variable `x_j`.\n3.  The total number of variables `N` is the count of all `_`s.\n4.  Replace all `_`s in the expression and conditions with their corresponding `x_j` names.\n\nLet's re-parse `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`. with this strategy:\n`_` (1st) -> `x0`\n`_` (2nd) -> `x1`\n`_` (3rd) -> `x2`\n`_` (4th) -> `x3`\n`_` (5th) -> `x4`\n`_` (6th) -> `x5`\n`_` (7th) -> `x6`\n\n`N = 7`.\nExpression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4`\nCondition: `x5 > x6`\n\nIf output `0010` is correct, then this interpretation is still wrong. The output length is 4, not 7.\nThis implies that variables *not used* in the expression or conditions are not part of the output. But the problem says \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" and \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This suggests that all variables defined by `_`s are part of the output.\n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. Let's consider the most common interpretation in competitive programming:\n*   All `_`s in the input string, in order of appearance, define the variables `x0, x1, ..., xN-1`.\n*   The output must be `N` digits.\n\nIf this is true, the example `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__` is confusing.\nLet's check the other examples.\n`?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n`_` (1st) -> `x0`\n`_` (2nd) -> `x1`\n`_` (3rd) -> `x2`\n`_` (4th) -> `x3`\n`_` (5th) -> `x4`\n`_` (6th) -> `x5`\n`_` (7th) -> `x6`\n`_` (8th) -> `x7`\n`_` (9th) -> `x8`\n`_` (10th) -> `x9`\n`_` (11th) -> `x10`\n`_` (12th) -> `x11`\n`_` (13th) -> `x12`\n`_` (14th) -> `x13`\n`_` (15th) -> `x14`\n`_` (16th) -> `x15`\n`_` (17th) -> `x16`\n`_` (18th) -> `x17`\n`_` (19th) -> `x18`\n`_` (20th) -> `x19`\n`N=20`.\nExpression: `x0 - x1 + x2 / x3` (from `__-_+_/`)\nCondition 1: `x4 > x5` (from `__>__`)\nCondition 2: `x6 < x7` (from `_____<__`)\nThis gives `N=20` variables. The output for this is `false`. This doesn't help clarify the `N` length.\n\nLet's assume the simplest interpretation that matches the first example:\nThe variables are `x0, x1, ..., xN-1`.\n`N` is the total count of `_` characters in the string.\nThe example output `0010` is given for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`\nThis means the input string is `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\nCount `_`: 1 (`x0`), 1 (`x1`), 3 (`x2, x3, x4`), 2 (`x5, x6`) -> 7 `_`s.\nExpression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4`\nCondition: `x5 > x6`\nIf `0010` is the output, then `N=4`. This means the `_`s in the string are *not* all distinct variables.\nThis means variables are assigned *based on their position in the expression/condition structure*, not their global order in the string.\n\nThis is the most plausible interpretation given the examples:\n*   The expression part `_-_/___*__` uses 5 `_`s. Let's call them `e0, e1, e2, e3, e4`.\n*   The condition part `___>__` uses 2 `_`s. Let's call them `c0, c1`.\n*   The actual variables are `x0, x1, ..., xN-1`.\n*   `N` is the total number of *unique* `_`s across the expression and conditions, when considering their position.\n*   For `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`:\n    *   Expression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3 - x4` (uses 5 variables `x0` to `x4`)\n    *   Condition: `x2 > x3` (uses `x2` and `x3` from the expression variables)\n    *   Total unique variables needed: `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4`. So `N=5`. Output length should be 5.\n    *   Example output `0010` has length 4. This is a huge discrepancy.\n\nThis problem is extremely ambiguous about variable mapping. Given \"Note that this is a very hard question\", this ambiguity might be part of the difficulty.\nThe only way `0010` makes sense for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__` is if the variables are mapped like this:\n`_` -> `x0`\n`_` -> `x1`\n`_` -> `x2`\n`_` -> `x3`\nAnd the expression is `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3`.\nAnd the condition is `x2 > x3`.\nThis means:\n*   The first `_` in the expression maps to `x0`.\n*   The second `_` in the expression maps to `x1`.\n*   The third `_` in the expression maps to `x2`.\n*   The fourth `_` in the expression maps to `x3`.\n*   Any subsequent `_`s in the expression are ignored or map to existing variables in some way.\n*   `_`s in conditions map to variables already defined in the expression based on their relative position. E.g., the `k`-th `_` in the conditions maps to `x_k_prime` where `k_prime` is the index of the `k`-th `_` in the expression. This is very non-standard.\n\nLet's test this interpretation on `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` (output `false`)\nExpression: `__-_+_/_____`\nConditions: `__>__,_____<__`\n\nVariable mapping based on this \"relative position\" interpretation:\n*   Expression `__-_+_/_____`:\n    *   1st `_` -> `x0`\n    *   2nd `_` -> `x1`\n    *   3rd `_` -> `x2`\n    *   4th `_` -> `x3`\n    *   5th `_` -> `x4`\n    *   `N=5` variables are defined by the expression.\n    *   Expr string becomes: `x0 x1 - x2 + x3 / x4` (assuming spaces are removed)\n*   Conditions `__>__,_____<__`:\n    *   1st `_` in conditions -> `x0` (maps to 1st `_` in expression)\n    *   2nd `_` in conditions -> `x1` (maps to 2nd `_` in expression)\n    *   3rd `_` in conditions -> `x2` (maps to 3rd `_` in expression)\n    *   4th `_` in conditions -> `x3` (maps to 4th `_` in expression)\n    *   5th `_` in conditions -> `x4` (maps to 5th `_` in expression)\n    *   Condition 1: `x0 > x1`\n    *   Condition 2: `x2 < x3`\n*   Total variables: `N=5`.\n\nThis interpretation seems consistent with the *output length* of the first example. Let's proceed with this.\n\n**Finalized Variable Mapping and Parsing Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Split the input string:** `body = input_string[2:-1]` (remove `?(`, `).`)\n    `expr_str, cond_str = body.split('):-')`\n2.  **Process Expression:**\n    *   Count `_` in `expr_str`. Let `N_expr` be this count.\n    *   Replace `_` with `x0, x1, ..., x(N_expr-1)` in order.\n3.  **Process Conditions:**\n    *   Split `cond_str` by `,` to get individual conditions.\n    *   For each condition string:\n        *   Count `_`. Let `N_cond_curr` be this count.\n        *   Replace `_` with `x0, x1, ..., x(N_cond_curr-1)` in order.\n        *   **Crucial assumption:** The `_`s in conditions refer to the same set of variables `x0, x1, ...` as the expression, *based on their relative position*. So the `k`-th `_` in a condition refers to `xk`.\n4.  **Determine `N`:** `N = max(N_expr, max(N_cond_curr for all conditions))` (This is the maximum index needed).\n    This means `N` is the maximum `_` index used in *either* the expression or any condition.\n    Example `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`:\n    Expr: `_-_/___*__` has 7 `_`s. If we map these to `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6`.\n    Conditions: `___>__` has 5 `_`s. If we map these to `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4`.\n    So, `N = 7`. This still doesn't match the `0010` output length of 4.\n\nThe example output `0010` must mean that `_`s in the expression are `x0, x1, x2, x3` and the `_`s in the conditions are *also* `x0, x1, x2, x3` based on their *relative position in their own sub-string*.\n\n**Revised, and hopefully final, interpretation of variable mapping:**\n\n1.  **Extract `expr_part` and `cond_part`:**\n    `expr_part = input_string[2:input_string.find('):-')]`\n    `cond_part = input_string[input_string.find('):-') + 3:-1]` (remove `):-` and trailing `.`)\n2.  **Map variables for expression:**\n    *   Iterate through `expr_part`. Replace the `k`-th `_` with `x{k}`.\n    *   Count total `_`s in `expr_part`. Let this be `num_expr_vars`.\n3.  **Map variables for conditions:**\n    *   Split `cond_part` by `,`.\n    *   For each individual condition string `c_str`:\n        *   Iterate through `c_str`. Replace the `k`-th `_` with `x{k}`.\n    *   Count total `_`s in `cond_part`. Let this be `num_cond_vars`.\n4.  **Total `N`:** `N = max(num_expr_vars, num_cond_vars)`. This `N` is the length of the output sequence.\n\nLet's test this on `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`.\n`expr_part = \"_-_/___*__\"`\n`cond_part = \"___>__\"`\n\n*   **Expression processing:**\n    `_` (1st) -> `x0`\n    `_` (2nd) -> `x1`\n    `_` (3rd) -> `x2`\n    `_` (4th) -> `x3`\n    `_` (5th) -> `x4`\n    `_` (6th) -> `x5`\n    `_` (7th) -> `x6`\n    `num_expr_vars = 7`.\n    `expr_parsed = \"x0-x1/x2*x3-x4\"` (The extra `_`s `x5, x6` are ignored because the expression structure doesn't use them. This is a key insight for the output length to match.)\n*   **Conditions processing:**\n    `cond_part = \"___>__\"`\n    `_` (1st) -> `x0`\n    `_` (2nd) -> `x1`\n    `_` (3rd) -> `x2`\n    `_` (4th) -> `x3`\n    `_` (5th) -> `x4`\n    `num_cond_vars = 5`.\n    `cond_parsed = [\"x0>x1\"]` (No, this is wrong. It should be `x2 > x3` based on `0010` output)\n\nThe problem statement is truly terrible. The only way to match the example `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__` is if the variables are mapped to `x0, x1, x2, x3` and the expression is `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3` and the condition is `x2 > x3`. This means that the `_`s are counted *only up to the point they are actually used in the expression/condition structure*. And the *number of variables in the output* is the maximum index actually used.\n\nLet's assume this:\n1.  **Parse Expression:** Replace `_` with `x0, x1, ...` as they appear. Store the maximum index used in the expression.\n2.  **Parse Conditions:** For each condition, replace `_` with `x0, x1, ...` as they appear. Store the maximum index used in conditions.\n3.  **Total `N`:** The maximum index used across *all* parsed expressions and conditions + 1.\n\nExample `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`:\n*   Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n    `_` (1st) -> `x0`\n    `-`\n    `_` (2nd) -> `x1`\n    `/`\n    `_` (3rd) -> `x2`\n    `*`\n    `_` (4th) -> `x3`\n    The remaining `_`s in the expression are ignored. So, `expr_parsed = \"x0-x1/x2*x3\"`. Max index used: 3.\n*   Conditions: `___>__`\n    `_` (1st) -> `x2` (matching `x2` from expression)\n    `>`\n    `_` (2nd) -> `x3` (matching `x3` from expression)\n    The remaining `_`s in the conditions are ignored. So, `cond_parsed = [\"x2>x3\"]`. Max index used: 3.\n*   `N = max(3, 3) + 1 = 4`. This matches the output length `0010`.\n\nThis interpretation seems to be the most consistent with the examples, despite being highly non-standard.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    input_string = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # 1.
