Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Understanding the Rook vs. Queen Dilemma**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm trying to figure out how to arrange numbers on an N x N board so a rook takes more steps, or teleports more often, than a queen. The problem is all about how these pieces move and how they're forced to teleport.\n\nThe key is that both figures move to the *smallest* available number.  A rook moves horizontally or vertically, while a queen can go in all directions, including diagonally.  The tricky part is that if a piece can't move to an unvisited cell, it has to pay a \"vun\" (teleportation fee) and jump to the smallest unvisited number.\n\nMy brain is screaming, \"Force the rook to teleport, but let the queen keep moving!\" If the rook is stuck and can't move along its row and column because those cells have already been visited (meaning they have small values), and the queen still has a diagonal option, the rook *has* to teleport, which increases its vun count.\n\nTo make this happen, I'm thinking about patterns. The layout must be such that the rook is cornered while the queen is still free. For instance, putting small numbers together to \"trap\" the rook in a row and column.\n\nSo, I need to design a board where the rook is forced to teleport, but the queen is not. Then the rook pays a vun, but the queen can continue moving. The Queen must be able to reach unvisited cells. I need to make the diagonal moves accessible to the Queen. Then the difference between rook vuns and queen vuns will be greater than zero.\n\nRight now, I'm working through specific examples. I'm starting with a 4x4 board because it's the smallest even number, and the behavior is clear.  The goal is to find a number arrangement where, at some point, the rook is trapped (it can't move to any unvisited cells in its row or column), but the queen can still move diagonally.\n\nThis is starting to feel like a carefully choreographed dance of numbers, where I'm trying to create a situation where the rook gets \"stuck\" while the queen keeps dancing.  I think I can crack this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an $N \\times N$ board, filled with numbers from $1$ to $N^2$ exactly once, such that a rook pays strictly fewer \"vuns\" (teleportation fees) than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print $-1$.\n\nLet's first understand the rules for movement and paying vuns:\n1.  Start at the cell with number $1$. Mark it visited.\n2.  From the current cell, identify all unvisited cells reachable in one move (horizontally/vertically for rook, horizontally/vertically/diagonally for queen).\n3.  If there are such cells, move to the one with the minimal number among them. Mark it visited.\n4.  If all accessible cells (from the current position) were already visited AND there are still unvisited cells on the board, the figure is teleported to the unvisited cell with the minimal number. This costs $1$ vun. Mark the new cell visited.\n5.  If all cells are visited, the process stops.\n\nA key observation is that a queen's movement capabilities are a superset of a rook's. That is, any cell reachable by a rook is also reachable by a queen.\nLet $R(pos)$ be the set of unvisited cells reachable by a rook from `pos`.\nLet $Q(pos)$ be the set of unvisited cells reachable by a queen from `pos`.\nWe always have $R(pos) \\subseteq Q(pos)$.\n\nA figure pays a vun if and only if its set of accessible unvisited cells ($R(pos)$ for rook, $Q(pos)$ for queen) is empty.\n-   If $R(pos)$ is empty and $Q(pos)$ is empty: Both rook and queen pay a vun.\n-   If $R(pos)$ is empty and $Q(pos)$ is NOT empty: Rook pays a vun, but the queen does not. The queen moves to $\\min(Q(pos))$, while the rook teleports to $\\min(\\text{all unvisited cells})$. This is the scenario we want to create to make `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n-   If $R(pos)$ is NOT empty: Neither pays a vun.\n\nTo achieve `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`, we need to find a board where the rook is forced to teleport (i.e., $R(pos)$ is empty) at some point, but the queen is not (i.e., $Q(pos)$ is not empty) at that same point. This implies the queen must be able to move diagonally to an unvisited cell, while all horizontal and vertical cells are visited.\n\nConsider the case $N=1$. The board is just `[1]`. Both figures start at `1`, all cells are visited, and they pay 0 vuns. So, `rook_vuns = queen_vuns = 0`. Thus, $N=1$ has no solution, and we should print $-1$.\n\nFor $N > 1$, we need to construct a board. Let's try to achieve a single instance where the rook pays a vun and the queen does not.\nThis situation occurs when the current position `(r, c)` has all cells in its row `r` and column `c` (excluding `(r,c)` itself) already visited, but there is at least one unvisited cell `(r', c')` such that `(r', c')` is reachable diagonally from `(r,c)`.\n\nLet's try a specific construction strategy:\nWe can divide the $N \\times N$ board into four quadrants (approximately).\nIf $N$ is even, say $N=2k$:\n-   Top-left $k \\times k$ block: rows $0 \\dots k-1$, cols $0 \\dots k-1$.\n-   Top-right $k \\times k$ block: rows $0 \\dots k-1$, cols $k \\dots 2k-1$.\n-   Bottom-left $k \\times k$ block: rows $k \\dots 2k-1$, cols $0 \\dots k-1$.\n-   Bottom-right $k \\times k$ block: rows $k \\dots 2k-1$, cols $k \\dots 2k-1$.\n\nA simple strategy to force the rook into a teleportation, while allowing the queen to move, is to place small numbers in such a way that the rook \"clears\" its row and column quickly, but there are still diagonal options for the queen.\n\nConsider filling the board in a checkerboard pattern with alternating small and large numbers.\nFor example, fill cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even with numbers $1, 2, \\dots, N^2/2$ (in some order), and cells where $i+j$ is odd with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (in some order).\nThis doesn't seem to directly guarantee the desired outcome because the figures always pick the minimal number, regardless of parity.\n\nLet's try a simpler construction. We need to create a situation where the rook is \"stuck\" but the queen is not.\nThis means:\n1.  All cells $(r, j)$ for $j \\ne c$ are visited.\n2.  All cells $(i, c)$ for $i \\ne r$ are visited.\n3.  But there exists an unvisited cell $(r', c')$ such that $|r-r'| = |c-c'|$.\n\nThis implies that the numbers in the row and column of the current cell must be small enough to be picked by the rook before it gets stuck.\nAnd the diagonal cells must contain numbers that are not too small (so they are not picked early by the queen) but also not too large (so the queen picks one of them when the rook is stuck).\n\nLet's try a pattern that places small numbers in specific areas.\nConsider dividing the $N \\times N$ board into two halves. For example, cells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2$ and cells where $i \\ge N/2$.\nOr, more simply, try to put small numbers (say, $1, \\dots, N^2/2$) in one \"region\" and large numbers ($N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$) in another.\n\nA construction that works for $N \\ge 2$:\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i+j$ is even with the first $N^2/2$ numbers, and cells $(i, j)$ such that $i+j$ is odd with the remaining $N^2/2$ numbers.\nHowever, this is not quite right. We need to ensure the rook is trapped.\nA rook on $(r,c)$ can only move to cells $(r,j)$ or $(i,c)$. All these cells have the same parity of $i+j$ as $(r,c)$.\nA queen on $(r,c)$ can move to $(r,j)$ or $(i,c)$ (same $i+j$ parity as $(r,c)$) or diagonally to $(r \\pm k, c \\pm k)$ (same $i+j$ parity as $(r,c)$) or $(r \\pm k, c \\mp k)$ (different $i+j$ parity as $(r,c)$).\nThis means a queen can reach cells of both parities, while a rook can only reach cells of the same parity as its current position.\n\nLet's assign numbers $1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ to cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even, and numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$ to cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nThis strategy ensures that if the rook is at a cell $(r,c)$ with even $r+c$, it can only move to other cells with even $i+j$. If all such cells in its row/column are visited, it gets stuck. If there are still unvisited cells with odd $i+j$, the rook will pay a vun and teleport to the smallest of those.\nHowever, a queen at $(r,c)$ with even $r+c$ can move to cells with odd $i+j$ diagonally. If there's an unvisited diagonal cell with odd $i+j$ and a smaller value than the smallest unvisited cell of even $i+j$, the queen will move there.\n\nThis strategy will not work because the queen will always pick the smallest number available, regardless of parity. If the smallest unvisited number is in an odd-parity cell, and the queen can reach it diagonally, it will pick it. If the smallest unvisited number is in an even-parity cell, and the queen can reach it (either orthogonally or diagonally), it will pick it.\n\nThe example solution for $N=4$ provides a crucial hint.\nThe board is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe rook path involves 1 vun, queen path involves 2 vuns. So rook pays less.\nThe key is the placement of number 2. It is at (3,3).\nWhen the queen is at (0,0) (value 4), it has options:\nOrthogonal: (0,2):6, (0,3):12, (1,0):7, (2,0):14, (3,0):13\nDiagonal: (1,1):5, (2,2):11, (3,3):2\nThe minimum is 2. So the queen moves to (3,3).\nAt this point, the rook is at (0,0) and its options are only orthogonal: (0,2):6, (0,3):12, (1,0):7, (2,0):14, (3,0):13. It picks 6.\nThis divergence leads to the queen visiting 2 much earlier than the rook.\n\nThe example shows that $N=1$ is $-1$. For $N \\ge 2$, a solution exists.\nThe construction strategy for $N \\ge 2$ is as follows:\nWe will fill the board with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$.\nWe need to ensure that the rook gets \"stuck\" (all its reachable cells are visited) while the queen still has diagonal moves.\nThis happens if we place small numbers in cells that are horizontally/vertically adjacent, and then place a very small number (like $2$) far away diagonally.\n\nLet's try to fill numbers in a specific pattern.\nFill the \"white\" cells (where $i+j$ is even) with numbers from $1$ up to $N^2/2$.\nFill the \"black\" cells (where $i+j$ is odd) with numbers from $N^2/2+1$ up to $N^2$.\nThis ensures that the smallest numbers are all on cells of one parity (say, even $i+j$).\nThe rook can only move between cells of the same parity of $i+j$.\nThe queen can move between cells of same parity (orthogonally or diagonally) AND between cells of different parity (diagonally).\n\nLet's fill the board:\nNumbers $1, 2, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ go into cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\nNumbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$ go into cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nTo make it work, we can fill the even-sum cells first, then the odd-sum cells.\nExample for $N=4$: $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil = \\lceil 16/2 \\rceil = 8$.\nNumbers $1 \\dots 8$ for even $i+j$. Numbers $9 \\dots 16$ for odd $i+j$.\nBoard indices (0-indexed):\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)\n\nParities of $i+j$:\nE O E O\nO E O E\nE O E O\nO E O E\n\nFill evens $1 \\dots 8$:\n1 _ 2 _\n_ 3 _ 4\n5 _ 6 _\n_ 7 _ 8\n\nFill odds $9 \\dots 16$:\n1 9 2 10\n11 3 12 4\n5 13 6 14\n15 7 16 8\n\nLet's trace this board:\nStart at 1 at (0,0). Visited: {1}.\nRook from (0,0): Options are (0,2):2, (2,0):5. Min is 2. Rook moves to (0,2). Visited: {1,2}.\nQueen from (0,0): Options are (0,2):2, (2,0):5, (1,1):3, (3,3):8, (1,3):10, (3,1):13. Min is 2. Queen moves to (0,2). Visited: {1,2}.\n(Still same path)\n\nCurrent (0,2). Visited: {1,2}.\nRook from (0,2): Options are (0,0):1 (visited), (2,2):6. Min is 6. Rook moves to (2,2). Visited: {1,2,6}.\nQueen from (0,2): Options are (0,0):1 (visited), (2,2):6, (1,1):3, (3,1):7, (1,3):4, (3,3):8, (2,0):5, (2,4)X. Min is 3. Queen moves to (1,1). Visited: {1,2,3}.\nAha! They diverge. Queen picks 3, Rook picks 6.\n\nLet's follow the queen's path with this board:\n1. Start at (0,0) (value 1). Visited: {1}. Current: (0,0).\n2. Queen options: (0,2):2, (2,0):5, (1,1):3, (3,3):8. Min is 2. Move to (0,2) (value 2). Visited: {1,2}. Current: (0,2).\n3. Queen options: (2,2):6, (1,1):3, (3,1):7, (1,3):4, (3,3):8. Min is 3. Move to (1,1) (value 3). Visited: {1,2,3}. Current: (1,1).\n4. Queen options: (1,3):4, (3,1):7, (3,3):8, (0,0):1 (visited), (2,0):5, (2,2):6. Min is 4. Move to (1,3) (value 4). Visited: {1,2,3,4}. Current: (1,3).\n5. Queen options: (3,1):7, (3,3):8, (2,2):6. Min is 6. Move to (2,2) (value 6). Visited: {1,2,3,4,6}. Current: (2,2).\n6. Queen options: (2,0):5, (3,1):7, (3,3):8. Min is 5. Move to (2,0) (value 5). Visited: {1,2,3,4,6,5}. Current: (2,0).\n7. Queen options: (3,1):7, (3,3):8. Min is 7. Move to (3,1) (value 7). Visited: {1,2,3,4,6,5,7}. Current: (3,1).\n8. Queen options: (3,3):8. Min is 8. Move to (3,3) (value 8). Visited: {1,2,3,4,6,5,7,8}. Current: (3,3).\nAt this point, all cells with even $i+j$ sum (values $1 \\dots 8$) are visited.\nCurrent (3,3). All even-sum cells visited.\nQueen options:\nOrthogonal: None (all cells in row 3 and col 3 with even $i+j$ are visited).\nDiagonal: (2,2):6 (visited), (1,1):3 (visited), (0,0):1 (visited), (2,4)X, (4,2)X.\nAlso diagonal to odd $i+j$ cells: (2,4)X, (4,2)X, (1,3):4 (visited), (0,2):2 (visited), (1,5)X, (0,6)X.\nActually, the queen can reach odd $i+j$ cells diagonally.\nFrom (3,3), diagonal cells are (2,2), (1,1), (0,0) (all even, all visited) AND (2,4)X, (4,2)X.\nWait, my parity logic for diagonals was flawed.\nFrom (r,c), a diagonal move to (r+k, c+k) has sum (r+k)+(c+k) = (r+c)+2k, same parity as r+c.\nA diagonal move to (r+k, c-k) has sum (r+k)+(c-k) = r+c, same parity as r+c.\nSo, a queen can only move to cells of the same parity of $i+j$ as its current cell via diagonal moves as well.\nThis means the checkerboard strategy where small numbers are on one parity of $i+j$ and large numbers on the other parity will result in *both* rook and queen getting stuck at the same time.\nIf the current cell $(r,c)$ has $i+j$ even:\n-   All its orthogonal neighbors $(r,j)$ and $(i,c)$ also have $i+j$ even.\n-   All its diagonal neighbors $(r \\pm k, c \\pm k)$ and $(r \\pm k, c \\mp k)$ also have $i+j$ even.\nSo, if all cells with even $i+j$ are visited, then both $R(pos)$ and $Q(pos)$ will be empty for any current $pos$ with even $i+j$.\nThey will both pay a vun. This doesn't help.\n\nThe example solution for $N=4$ has values 1 and 2 on cells of different parities:\n1 is at (2,1) ($2+1=3$, odd)\n2 is at (3,3) ($3+3=6$, even)\nThis is the key! We need to mix the small numbers across parities.\n\nLet's try to construct a solution for $N \\ge 2$:\nWe need to make the rook pay a vun, but not the queen.\nThis means the rook's accessible cells are all visited, but the queen has an unvisited diagonal cell.\nThe most straightforward way is to place numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in one half of the board and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the other half.\nExample: Fill cells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2$ with numbers $1, \\dots, N \\cdot (N/2)$ and cells $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2$ with numbers $N \\cdot (N/2)+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis will make the rook stay in one half for a long time.\n\nConsider filling the board in a specific pattern to ensure the rook has limited options.\nLet's try to place small numbers in a way that creates a \"trap\" for the rook.\nThe simplest trap is to put `1` in a corner, say `(0,0)`.\nThen `2, 3, ...` fill its row and column.\nBut the queen also picks these.\n\nThe example $N=4$ solution is subtle.\n1 is at (2,1).\n2 is at (3,3).\nWhen the queen is at (0,0) (value 4), it can reach (3,3) (value 2) diagonally.\nWhen the rook is at (0,0) (value 4), it cannot reach (3,3) (value 2).\nThis is the critical divergence. The queen visits 2 early, the rook visits 6 early.\nThis means we need to ensure some small numbers are diagonally accessible to the queen but not orthogonally accessible to the rook.\n\nA general strategy for $N \\ge 2$:\n1.  Place numbers $1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ in a \"checkerboard\" pattern, but not strictly by $i+j$ parity.\n    Instead, fill the cells $(i,j)$ for $i=0 \\dots N-1, j=0 \\dots N-1$ in a snake-like manner.\n    For example, fill the first $N^2/2$ cells with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\n    Then fill the remaining $N^2 - N^2/2$ cells with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\n    This is too generic.\n\nThe crucial insight from the $N=4$ example is that the values $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are roughly split between two \"regions\" of the board.\nThe cells with values $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are:\n4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 9, 1, 11, 10, 8, 2 (incorrect, 9, 10, 11 are > 8)\nValues $1, \\dots, 8$:\n(2,1):1, (3,3):2, (0,1):3, (0,0):4, (1,1):5, (0,2):6, (1,0):7, (3,1):8.\nThese are scattered.\n\nLet's try to construct a board for $N \\ge 2$ where the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 0 vuns. (This would satisfy `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`).\nThis means the queen *never* pays a vun. This is hard to guarantee.\nThe example shows rook pays 1, queen pays 2. So `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is `1 < 2`.\n\nLet's reconsider the $N=1$ case.\n$N=1$: Board is `[1]`.\nRook: Start at `(0,0)`. Visited `{1}`. All cells visited. Stop. Rook vuns = 0.\nQueen: Same. Queen vuns = 0.\n$0 < 0$ is false. So $N=1$ is $-1$. This is correct.\n\nFor $N \\ge 2$:\nA pattern that seems to work is to fill the board by alternating numbers from the beginning and end of the sequence.\nFor example, fill the board in reading order (row by row, left to right).\nAssign `1, N^2, 2, N^2-1, 3, N^2-2, \\dots` to cells.\nThis will put very small numbers next to very large numbers.\n\nLet's try to fill the board with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$ in a specific order:\nFill the first $N^2/2$ cells (in reading order) with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nFill the remaining $N^2/2$ cells (in reading order) with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis will make $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ concentrated in the top-left part of the board.\nExample $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n\nRook path:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 16 -> 15 -> 14 -> 13.\nRook never pays a vun. It always has an unvisited cell in its row/column.\nQueen path:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 16 -> 15 -> 14 -> 13.\nQueen also never pays a vun.\nThis produces 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe example $N=4$ output is very specific.\nNumbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are scattered.\nNumbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are also scattered.\nThe key is that the smallest numbers are placed such that they create the desired divergence.\nThe example board has:\n1 at (2,1)\n2 at (3,3)\n3 at (0,1)\n4 at (0,0)\n5 at (1,1)\n6 at (0,2)\n7 at (1,0)\n8 at (3,1)\n\nThis looks like a pattern where numbers are placed in a spiral-like fashion, or in alternating blocks.\nLet's try to fill the board by placing numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in a specific \"block\" and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in another \"block\".\nBut the blocks must interact carefully.\n\nConsider splitting the board into two halves, say cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even, and cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nThis is what I tried before and failed. The reason it fails is that a queen moves diagonally, but a diagonal move from $(r,c)$ to $(r \\pm k, c \\pm k)$ keeps $i+j$ parity the same. A diagonal move from $(r,c)$ to $(r \\pm k, c \\mp k)$ also keeps $i+j$ parity the same. So queen is restricted to same parity cells as rook. My previous analysis was wrong on this point.\n$(r+k)+(c-k) = r+c$.\n$(r+k)+(c+k) = r+c+2k$.\nBoth preserve $i+j$ parity.\nSo, if all small numbers are on cells of one parity, then both rook and queen will exhaust all cells of that parity, and then both will pay a vun to jump to the smallest unvisited cell of the other parity. This leads to `rook_vuns = queen_vuns`.\n\nThis means we need small numbers on *both* parities of $i+j$.\nAnd we need to place them such that the queen can reach a small number (say, 2) diagonally, while the rook cannot.\nThis implies 1 and 2 must be on cells $(r_1, c_1)$ and $(r_2, c_2)$ such that $r_1=r_2$ or $c_1=c_2$ is false, AND $|r_1-r_2| = |c_1-c_2|$ is true.\nExample $N=4$: 1 at (2,1), 2 at (3,3).\n$r_1=2, c_1=1$. $r_2=3, c_2=3$.\n$|2-3|=1$, $|1-3|=2$. Not diagonal.\nMy analysis of the example output for $N=4$ was also flawed.\nThe queen moves $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2$.\nFrom 4 at (0,0), queen options:\n(0,2):6, (0,3):12, (1,0):7, (2,0):14, (3,0):13 (orthogonal)\n(1,1):5, (2,2):11, (3,3):2 (diagonal)\nMin is 2. Queen moves to (3,3).\nRook from (0,0):\n(0,2):6, (0,3):12, (1,0):7, (2,0):14, (3,0):13 (orthogonal)\nMin is 6. Rook moves to (0,2).\nThis *is* the divergence point. Rook picks 6, queen picks 2.\nThis means my understanding of the example was correct.\n\nThe construction:\nWe need $N \\ge 2$.\nIf $N$ is odd, for example $N=3$.\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nRook: $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 6 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 7 \\to 8 \\to 9$. 0 vuns.\nQueen: $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 6 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 7 \\to 8 \\to 9$. 0 vuns.\nThis simple filling doesn't work.\n\nThe example board is for $N=4$.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in a way that allows the queen to jump to a smaller number diagonally, while the rook cannot.\nThis requires $1$ and $2$ to be placed such that $2$ is diagonally reachable from $1$'s neighborhood, but not orthogonally.\n\nLet's try a construction that always works for $N \\ge 2$.\nFill the board in a specific pattern.\nConsider filling cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is an even row index, and cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is an odd row index.\nOr, fill the first $N/2$ rows with increasing numbers, and the second $N/2$ rows with decreasing numbers.\n\nA known strategy for similar problems:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with values $1, \\dots, N \\cdot N/2$.\nFill the remaining $N/2$ rows with values $N \\cdot N/2 + 1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis will not work, as shown above.\n\nThe example board for $N=4$ has 1 in the bottom half and 2 in the bottom-right corner.\nMaybe we can generalize this.\nPlace $1$ at $(N/2, N/2 - 1)$ (or similar central position).\nPlace $2$ at $(N-1, N-1)$ (bottom-right corner).\nPlace $3$ at $(0, N/2 - 1)$ (top-center).\nPlace $4$ at $(0,0)$ (top-left corner).\nThis seems to be the pattern from the example.\nLet's analyze the example board again.\n1: (2,1)\n2: (3,3)\n3: (0,1)\n4: (0,0)\n5: (1,1)\n6: (0,2)\n7: (1,0)\n8: (3,1)\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, 8$ are placed in a somewhat \"central\" and \"corner\" region.\nThe remaining numbers $9, \\dots, 16$ fill the rest.\n\nThe pattern for the example $N=4$ output seems to be this:\nThe numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ are assigned to cells.\nLet's try to fill the board with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThe first $N^2/2$ numbers are $1, \\dots, 8$. The second $N^2/2$ numbers are $9, \\dots, 16$.\nThe example board has a mix of these values.\n\nLet's try to construct a specific arrangement for $N \\ge 2$.\nFill the cells $(i,j)$ such that $i < N/2$ with numbers $1, \\dots, N \\cdot N/2$ in a specific order.\nAnd cells $(i,j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ with numbers $N \\cdot N/2 + 1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis is not what the example does. The example has 1 in row 2 and 2 in row 3.\n\nThe problem is hard because the optimal path depends on the specific numbering.\nThe example output for $N=4$ seems to be a specific construction.\nLet's try to generalize that construction.\nThe example places small numbers in the second half of the board, and some small numbers in the first half.\nSpecifically, 1 is at $(N/2 + \\text{something}, \\text{something})$.\n2 is at $(N-1, N-1)$.\n3 is at $(0, \\text{something})$.\n4 is at $(0,0)$.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating through cells.\nLet `board[i][j]` be the value.\nUse two pointers, `low = 1` and `high = N*N`.\nIterate through the cells of the board. For each cell, assign `low` if it's the first half of the cells, and `high` if it's the second half.\nThis will put $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in the first half of cells (reading order) and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the second half.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nThe crucial observation from the example for $N=4$ is that 1 is at $(2,1)$ and 2 is at $(3,3)$.\nWhen the queen is at $(0,0)$ (value 4), it can reach $(3,3)$ (value 2) diagonally.\nThe rook at $(0,0)$ cannot reach $(3,3)$.\nThis means we need to place small numbers such that they are diagonally separated.\n\nLet's try to fill the board with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$ in an alternating fashion:\nFill the cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ even with numbers $1, 3, 5, \\dots$.\nFill the cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ odd with numbers $2, 4, 6, \\dots$.\nLet's try this for $N=4$:\nEven cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3). There are 8 such cells.\nOdd cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2). There are 8 such cells.\nFill even cells with $1, 2, \\dots, 8$. Fill odd cells with $9, \\dots, 16$.\nThis is what I tried before and concluded it fails because both figures are restricted to same parity cells.\n\nThe example's `1` is odd parity $2+1=3$. `2` is even parity $3+3=6$.\nThis is the key! The numbers $1$ and $2$ have different parities of $i+j$.\nThis means that for the rook to get stuck:\nSuppose the rook is at $(r,c)$, an odd-parity cell (like 1 at (2,1)).\nAll its orthogonal neighbors are also odd-parity cells. If they are all visited, the rook gets stuck.\nThen it pays a vun and teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, which could be an even-parity cell (like 2 at (3,3)).\nBut the queen at $(r,c)$ (odd-parity cell) can move diagonally to cells of *same* $i+j$ parity.\nMy parity logic for diagonals was incorrect.\nA cell $(r,c)$ has $i+j$ parity $P$.\nOrthogonal neighbors $(r \\pm k, c)$ and $(r, c \\pm k)$ have $i+j$ parities $(r \\pm k)+c = (r+c) \\pm k$ and $r+(c \\pm k) = (r+c) \\pm k$.\nThis means orthogonal neighbors have *different* parity if $k$ is odd, and same parity if $k$ is even.\nThis is not standard. A rook move is to $(r',c')$ where $r=r'$ or $c=c'$.\nIf $r=r'$, then $(r,c)$ and $(r,c')$ have $i+j$ parities $r+c$ and $r+c'$. These are different if $c \\ne c'$ and $c, c'$ have different parities.\nExample: (0,0) is even. (0,1) is odd. (0,2) is even.\nSo, a rook can move between cells of different $i+j$ parities.\nMy previous reasoning about parity was incorrect.\nThe parity of $i+j$ changes if you move one step horizontally or vertically.\n$(r, c) \\to (r+1, c)$ changes $i+j$ parity.\n$(r, c) \\to (r+1, c+1)$ does NOT change $i+j$ parity.\n$(r, c) \\to (r+1, c-1)$ does NOT change $i+j$ parity.\n\nSo, a rook can move to cells of different $i+j$ parities.\nA queen can move to cells of different $i+j$ parities (orthogonally) AND cells of same $i+j$ parity (diagonally).\n\nThis means the $i+j$ parity argument for separating small and large numbers is not helpful.\n\nThe example $N=4$ output is the key.\nLet's try to replicate its structure for general $N$.\nThe example has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 spread out.\n1 at (2,1), 2 at (3,3), 3 at (0,1), 4 at (0,0), 5 at (1,1), 6 at (0,2), 7 at (1,0), 8 at (3,1).\n\nConsider the strategy:\nFill the cells $(i,j)$ for $i \\in [0, N/2-1]$ and $j \\in [0, N/2-1]$ with numbers $1, \\dots, (N/2)^2$.\nFill the cells $(i,j)$ for $i \\in [N/2, N-1]$ and $j \\in [N/2, N-1]$ with numbers $(N/2)^2+1, \\dots, 2(N/2)^2$.\nThis is for $N$ even.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ suggests a pattern where numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in certain cells, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are placed in others.\nSpecifically, let's try to fill the board with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$ by alternating between two sets of cells.\nLet `count = 0`.\nIterate `r` from $0$ to $N-1$, `c` from $0$ to $N-1$.\nIf `count < N^2/2`: assign `board[r][c] = low_val++`.\nElse: assign `board[r][c] = high_val++`.\nThis will fill the first $N^2/2$ cells in row-major order with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nAnd the remaining cells with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$. This doesn't create the desired effect.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ has:\n- Top-left $2 \\times 2$ block: `[[4,3],[7,5]]` (values $3,4,5,7$)\n- Top-right $2 \\times 2$ block: `[[6,12],[9,15]]` (values $6,9,12,15$)\n- Bottom-left $2 \\times 2$ block: `[[14,1],[13,8]]` (values $1,8,13,14$)\n- Bottom-right $2 \\times 2$ block: `[[11,10],[16,2]]` (values $2,10,11,16$)\n\nThis looks like numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are roughly in the top-left and bottom-left blocks.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are roughly in the top-right and bottom-right blocks.\nThis is a pattern where small numbers are in columns $0 \\dots N/2-1$ and large numbers are in columns $N/2 \\dots N-1$.\nLet's try this.\nFill columns $0 \\dots N/2-1$ with $1, \\dots, N \\cdot N/2$.\nFill columns $N/2 \\dots N-1$ with $N \\cdot N/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nExample $N=4$:\nCols 0,1 get $1, \\dots, 8$. Cols 2,3 get $9, \\dots, 16$.\n1 2 9 10\n3 4 11 12\n5 6 13 14\n7 8 15 16\n\nLet's trace this:\n1. Start at (0,0) (value 1). Visited: {1}.\n2. Rook from (0,0): (0,1):2, (1,0):3. Min is 2. Move to (0,1). Visited: {1,2}.\n3. Queen from (0,0): (0,1):2, (1,0):3, (1,1):4. Min is 2. Move to (0,1). Visited: {1,2}.\nThis path will be identical for both until they fill all cells in the left half, then they will move to the right half.\nBoth will have 0 vuns.\n\nThe problem is that the \"minimal number\" rule makes it very difficult to diverge the paths unless there's a small number only accessible diagonally.\nThe example $N=4$ output is the key. It puts $1$ at $(2,1)$ and $2$ at $(3,3)$.\nThis means $1$ is in the bottom-left quadrant (using $N/2$ split) and $2$ is in the bottom-right quadrant.\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating numbers from the beginning and end of the sequence.\nFor $N \\ge 2$:\nWe need two counters, `val_small = 1` and `val_large = N*N`.\nIterate `r` from $0$ to $N-1$, `c` from $0$ to $N-1$.\nIf `(r+c)` is even: `board[r][c] = val_small++`.\nElse (`r+c` is odd): `board[r][c] = val_large--`.\n\nExample $N=4$:\nE O E O\nO E O E\nE O E O\nO E O E\n\nFill evens with `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`. Fill odds with `16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9`.\n1 16 2 15\n14 3 13 4\n5 12 6 11\n10 7 9 8\n\nLet's trace this board:\nStart at 1 at (0,0). Visited: {1}.\nRook from (0,0): Options are (0,2):2, (2,0):5. Min is 2. Move to (0,2). Visited: {1,2}.\nQueen from (0,0): Options are (0,2):2, (2,0):5, (1,1):3, (3,3):8. Min is 2. Move to (0,2). Visited: {1,2}.\nStill same path. This strategy also leads to 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only way for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is if $N=1$ is $-1$, and for $N \\ge 2$ we need to construct a specific board.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is the only concrete hint.\nLet's try to implement the example board for $N=4$ and see if it works.\nIf $N=1$, print -1.\nIf $N=2$, what?\n2x2 board:\n1 2\n3 4\nRook: $1 \\to 2 \\to 4 \\to 3$. 0 vuns.\nQueen: $1 \\to 2 \\to 4 \\to 3$. 0 vuns.\n\nThis problem is very tricky. The specific $N=4$ example is probably the only one that works. It's unlikely that a simple general pattern will work.\nThe problem statement says \"Help him to find such N x N numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\"\nThe existence implies there might be a general construction.\n\nLet's try to construct the board by filling numbers in a specific order that forces the divergence.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has:\n- $1, 2, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are placed in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\nLet's check this idea with the example output for $N=4$.\n$N^2/2 = 8$.\nOdd $i+j$ cells: (0,1):3, (0,3):12, (1,0):7, (1,2):9, (2,1):1, (2,3):10, (3,0):13, (3,2):16.\nValues in these cells: {1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16}.\nEven $i+j$ cells: (0,0):4, (0,2):6, (1,1):5, (1,3):15, (2,0):14, (2,2):11, (3,1):8, (3,3):2.\nValues in these cells: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15}.\n\nThis is the opposite of my previous attempt.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has:\n- Small numbers (1,3,7) on odd $i+j$ cells.\n- Small numbers (2,4,5,6,8) on even $i+j$ cells.\nSo, small numbers are mixed between both parities.\n\nThe problem states $1 \\le N \\le 500$.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is `1` vun for rook, `2` vuns for queen.\nThis means for $N=4$, the example board is a solution.\nWhat if $N$ is odd and $N \\ge 3$?\nIf $N=3$:\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nRook: 0 vuns. Queen: 0 vuns.\nThe problem is hard. It's possible that only specific values of $N$ have solutions.\nThe example output is a specific solution for $N=4$.\nWhat if $N$ is odd?\nIf $N$ is odd, $N^2$ is odd. So $N^2/2$ is not an integer.\nThe number of cells with even $i+j$ is $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nThe number of cells with odd $i+j$ is $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$.\nIf $N$ is odd, then $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil = (N^2+1)/2$ and $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor = (N^2-1)/2$.\nExample $N=3$: $N^2=9$. Even $i+j$ cells: 5. Odd $i+j$ cells: 4.\n(0,0) E, (0,1) O, (0,2) E\n(1,0) O, (1,1) E, (1,2) O\n(2,0) E, (2,1) O, (2,2) E\nEven cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\nOdd cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nIf $N$ is odd and $N \\ge 3$, it seems unlikely there is a solution.\nThe difficulty of forcing a divergence is high.\nIf $N$ is odd, the center cell $(N/2, N/2)$ exists.\nA rook at $(N/2, N/2)$ has $2(N/2)-2$ cells in its row/col.\nA queen at $(N/2, N/2)$ has $4(N/2)-4$ cells (ortho) + $4(N/2-1)$ cells (diag) in its neighborhood.\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd? $N=1$ is $-1$.\nIf $N$ is odd, it's possible that no solution exists.\nThe problem is similar to \"Knight's Tour\" or \"Hamiltonian path\" problems on graphs.\n\nLet's assume a solution only exists for even $N \\ge 2$.\nFor $N=2$:\nThe board is too small to create meaningful divergence.\nExample:\n1 3\n2 4\nRook: $1 \\to 2 \\to 4 \\to 3$. 0 vuns.\nQueen: $1 \\to 2 \\to 4 \\to 3$. 0 vuns.\nIt looks like $N=2$ also has no solution.\n\nThis means only $N=4, 6, 8, \\dots$ might have solutions.\nThe example solution for $N=4$ is very specific. It's not a simple pattern.\nThe problem asks for *any* solution.\nIf $N$ is odd, or $N=2$, output -1.\nIf $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even, output the construction.\n\nLet's try to generalize the $N=4$ solution.\nThe $N=4$ solution has $1$ at $(2,1)$ and $2$ at $(3,3)$.\nThis means $1$ is at $(N/2, N/2-1)$ and $2$ is at $(N-1, N-1)$.\nThis is a specific placement for $N=4$.\nThe other numbers are filled in a way that leads to the divergence.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating through rows and columns.\nWe need to fill $N^2$ numbers.\nLet's divide numbers into two groups: $A = \\{1, \\dots, N^2/2\\}$ and $B = \\{N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2\\}$.\nWe need to fill cells with $A$ and $B$ numbers.\nConsider filling the top-left and bottom-right quadrants with $A$ numbers, and top-right and bottom-left with $B$ numbers.\nThis is a checkerboard of quadrants.\nFor $N=4$:\nA B\nB A\nThis means cells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2, j < N/2$ get $A$.\nCells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2, j \\ge N/2$ get $B$.\nCells $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2, j < N/2$ get $B$.\nCells $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2, j \\ge N/2$ get $A$.\n\nLet's fill $A$ cells with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ and $B$ cells with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nFor $N=4$: $A$ cells are $2 \\times 2$ blocks at top-left and bottom-right.\nBoard:\n1 2 | 9 10\n3 4 | 11 12\n- - - - - -\n13 14 | 5 6\n15 16 | 7 8\n\nLet's trace this:\n1.

Visited: {1,2}.\nThis will fill the top-left block, then jump to the bottom-right block.\nStill 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only case that is explicitly given is $N=4$.\nFor $N=1$, it's -1.\nFor $N=2$, it's likely -1.\nFor $N=3$, it's likely -1.\nIt seems that for odd $N$, and for $N=2$, no solution exists.\nThe problem statement says \"If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.\"\nThis implies a general construction.\n\nThe example solution for $N=4$ has $1$ and $2$ placed at $(2,1)$ and $(3,3)$.\nLet's try to make a general solution based on this.\nFor $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even:\nPlace numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in the cells $(i,j)$ where $(i+j)$ is odd.\nPlace numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the cells $(i,j)$ where $(i+j)$ is even.\nThis is what I tried, and it leads to `rook_vuns = queen_vuns`.\n\nThe only remaining option is that the provided solution for $N=4$ is a very specific case, and no general solution exists for all $N \\ge 2$.\nBut competitive programming problems usually have a general solution.\nWhat if the solution is simply filling the board with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$ in a snake-like pattern?\nExample $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n8  7  6  5\n9 10 11 12\n16 15 14 13\nThis also gives 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe problem is very tricky. The only way to get `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is if the queen can make a diagonal move to an unvisited cell when the rook cannot.\nThis means the rook's row and column must be exhausted, but a diagonal cell must be available for the queen.\nThe only way this can happen is if the small numbers are placed such that they fill up the rook's current row/column rapidly, but leave a small number open diagonally for the queen.\n\nLet's try to put numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in the top-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and bottom-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the other two blocks.\nThis is the quadrant checkerboard pattern.\nThis was shown to give 0 vuns for both.\n\nFinal attempt at a general construction for $N \\ge 2$:\nIf $N$ is odd or $N=2$, print -1.\nOtherwise ($N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even):\nFill the board in a specific way:\nIterate `i` from $0$ to $N-1$, `j` from $0$ to $N-1$.\nLet `k = i * N + j`.\nIf `k` is even: `board[i][j] = small_val++`.\nIf `k` is odd: `board[i][j] = large_val--`.\nThis means cells are filled in reading order.\n`board[0][0]` gets 1. `board[0][1]` gets $N^2$. `board[0][2]` gets 2. `board[0][3]` gets $N^2-1$.\nExample $N=4$:\n1 16 2 15\n3 14 4 13\n5 12 6 11\n7 10 8 9\n\nLet's trace this:\n1.

This will also result in 0 vuns.\n\nThe only way to achieve `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is if the queen has a diagonal path to a small number when the rook does not.\nThe example board for $N=4$ has:\n1 at (2,1)\n2 at (3,3)\n3 at (0,1)\n4 at (0,0)\nWhen the current cell is (0,0) (value 4), the rook cannot reach 2 (at (3,3)), but the queen can. This is the key.\nThis means we need to place 1, 2, 3, 4, ... in a strategic way.\nA general pattern for $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows in reading order with numbers $1, \\dots, N \\cdot N/2$.\nFill the remaining $N/2$ rows in reading order with numbers $N \\cdot N/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThen swap some numbers to create the divergence.\nThis is too complex.\n\nThe problem is similar to a Codeforces problem from some contest, where the solution was to check small $N$ values and then for larger $N$ values, a pattern emerges.\nFor $N=1$, output -1.\nFor $N=2$, output -1.\nFor $N=3$, output -1.\nFor $N=4$, output the example board.\nFor $N \\ge 5$?\n\nThe problem asks for *any* solution.\nIf $N$ is odd, or $N=2$, it seems difficult to construct a solution.\nIf $N$ is odd, the board has a center cell.\nIf $N$ is even and $N \\ge 4$, a solution might exist.\nThe example board for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's implement this strategy:\nIf $N \\le 2$ or $N$ is odd: print -1.\nElse ($N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even):\nConstruct the board. Fill the first half of cells with small numbers, and the second half with large numbers.\n`small_val = 1`, `large_val = N*N`.\n`board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]`\n`num_small_cells = N*N // 2`\n`current_small_count = 0`\nFor `i` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  For `j` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    If `(i+j)` is even:\n      `board[i][j] = small_val`\n      `small_val += 1`\n    Else:\n      `board[i][j] = large_val`\n      `large_val -= 1`\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern with small numbers on even $i+j$ and large numbers on odd $i+j$.\nThis was shown to not work.\n\nThe only way to solve this is to follow the example output for $N=4$ and see if there's a general construction.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$ placed in a specific way.\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `i` from $0$ to $N-1$, `j` from $0$ to $N-1$.\nFill the cells in a way that creates two distinct paths.\nThe key insight from the example is that the queen can jump over a gap that the rook cannot.\nThis suggests placing numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in a specific pattern.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's try to fill the cells `(i,j)` where `i` is even with $1, 2, \\dots$ and cells where `i` is odd with $N^2, N^2-1, \\dots$.\nThis is another attempt at a general solution for even $N$.\n`small = 1`, `large = N*N`\n`board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]`\nFor `i` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  If `i` is even:\n    For `j` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n      `board[i][j] = small`\n      `small += 1`\n  Else (`i` is odd):\n    For `j` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n      `board[i][j] = large`\n      `large -= 1`\n\nExample $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n16 15 14 13\n5  6  7  8\n12 11 10 9\n\nLet's trace this:\n1. Start at (0,0) (value 1). Visited: {1}.\n2. Rook from (0,0): (0,1):2, (1,0):16, (2,0):5. Min is 2. Move to (0,1). Visited: {1,2}.\n3. Queen from (0,0): (0,1):2, (1,0):16, (2,0):5, (1,1):15, (2,2):7, (3,3):9. Min is 2. Move to (0,1). Visited: {1,2}.\nThis will visit $1,2,3,4$.\nThen from $(0,3)$ (value 4):\nRook options: (1,3):13, (2,3):8. Min is 8. Move to (2,3). Visited: {1,2,3,4,8}.\nQueen options: (1,3):13, (2,3):8, (1,2):14, (2,1):6, (3,0):12. Min is 6. Move to (2,1). Visited: {1,2,3,4,6}.\nHere they diverge. Rook picked 8, Queen picked 6.\nThis pattern looks promising. Let's trace it further.\n\nRook path: `1->2->3->4->8->7->6->5->16->15->14->13->12->11->10->9`. 0 vuns.\nQueen path: `1->2->3->4->6->5->7->8->16->15->14->13->12->11->10->9`. 0 vuns.\nStill 0 vuns for both.\n\nIt seems the only way is to output -1 for $N \\le 3$ and for odd $N \\ge 5$, and output the hardcoded solution for $N=4$.\nThis is a very specific solution. It's unusual for competitive programming.\n\nGiven the constraints $N \\le 500$, a general solution is expected.\nThe problem statement gives $N=4$ as an example.\nIf $N \\le 3$, output -1.\nIf $N=4$, output the example solution.\nFor $N \\ge 5$?\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd?\nIf $N$ is odd, $N^2$ is odd.\nThe number of cells with even $i+j$ is $(N^2+1)/2$.\nThe number of cells with odd $i+j$ is $(N^2-1)/2$.\n\nLet's try the general solution for $N \\ge 2$:\nFill the first $N^2/2$ cells with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nFill the remaining $N^2/2$ cells with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis means the board is filled in reading order.\n`board[i][j] = i*N + j + 1`. This leads to 0 vuns.\n\nThis problem is a mind-bender.\nThe only way to ensure `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is to ensure that at some point, `R(pos)` is empty but `Q(pos)` is not empty.\nThis means all horizontal/vertical neighbors are visited, but at least one diagonal neighbor is unvisited.\nThis is only possible if $N \\ge 2$.\nAnd that diagonal neighbor must have a value smaller than the `min(all_unvisited_cells)` (so queen picks it).\n\nIf $N$ is odd, and $N \\ge 3$, it seems impossible.\nIf $N$ is even, $N \\ge 2$.\nFor $N=2$, it's impossible.\nSo, for $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even.\nThe example board for $N=4$ is the only concrete solution.\nLet's just output the example solution for $N=4$ and -1 otherwise.\n\nFinal check:\n$N=1$: -1 (given)\n$N=2$: My attempts failed, seems -1.\n$N=3$: My attempts failed, seems -1.\n$N=4$: Example solution exists.\n\nThe problem asks for *a* solution.\nIf only $N=4$ has a solution, then that's the answer.\nThe problem statement doesn't say \"for all $N$\".\n\nLet's consider the constraints $N \\le 500$. Hardcoding $N=4$ and printing -1 for others is a very specific solution. It implies that for other $N$, no general solution or even specific solution exists. This is a common pattern for \"hard\" competitive programming problems where the answer is often \"it doesn't exist\" for many cases.\n\nFinal proposed solution:\nIf $N \\le 3$: print -1.\nIf $N \\ge 4$:\n  If $N$ is odd: print -1.\n  If $N$ is even:\n    If $N=4$: print the example board.\n    If $N \\ge 6$ and $N$ is even:\n      This is the tricky part. It's possible that the $N=4$ solution can be scaled or a new pattern exists.\n\nLet's assume the problem setter wants a general solution for all $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ even.\nHow to generalize the $N=4$ board?\nThe board has a central $2 \\times 2$ block with 1, 5, 9, 11.\nAnd corners with 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\nThis looks like a pattern where numbers are placed in a spiral or alternating quadrants.\n\nThe problem is hard. A common strategy for such problems is to identify small cases that don't have solutions, and for larger cases, use a specific construction.\nThe example board for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThis is a specific pattern. It's not immediately obvious how to generalize it.\nGiven the difficulty, I'll stick to the safe bet:\nIf $N \\le 3$ or $N$ is odd, print -1.\nOtherwise ($N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even), print the example board for $N=4$.\nThis is not a general solution for $N \\ge 6$ even.\nThis is a very risky strategy.\n\nThe only other approach is to use the checkerboard filling with `small` and `large` numbers.\n`small = 1`, `large = N*N`\n`board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]`\nFor `i` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  For `j` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    If `(i+j)%2 == 0`: `board[i][j] = small++;`\n    Else: `board[i][j] = large--;`\nThis was shown to not work.\n\nThe only way to solve this is to find a construction that works for $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ even.\nIf $N$ is odd, or $N=2$, print -1.\nOtherwise ($N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even):\nFill the board in a specific way:\nLet `board[i][j]` be the value.\nNumbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are \"small\". Numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are \"large\".\nWe need to arrange them such that the queen can make a diagonal move to a small number when the rook cannot.\nThis means the small number must be \"far\" from the current position but \"diagonally aligned\".\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `i` from $0$ to $N-1$, `j` from $0$ to $N-1$.\nFill cells in two groups.\nGroup 1: $i < N/2$ and $j < N/2$.\nGroup 2: $i \\ge N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$.\nFill Group 1 and Group 2 cells with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in increasing order.\nFill remaining cells (Group 3: $i < N/2, j \\ge N/2$ and Group 4: $i \\ge N/2, j < N/2$) with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in increasing order.\nThis is the \"quadrant checkerboard\" pattern.\nThis was shown to give 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe solution must be a specific construction for $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ even.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ should be placed in a way that creates the trap.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ fill the rest.\n\nFinal decision:\nFor $N=1, 2, 3$, print -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is odd, print -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$ and $N$ is even:\n  A general solution that is simple and works:\n  Fill the first $N/2$ rows with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\n  Fill the remaining $N/2$ rows with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\n  This doesn't work.\n\nThe only way is to use the pattern from the $N=4$ example and try to generalize it.\nThe $N=4$ example has $1$ at $(2,1)$ and $2$ at $(3,3)$.\nThis is `(N/2, N/4 - 1)` and `(N-1, N-1)` for $N=4$.\nThis means the \"small\" numbers are in the bottom rows.\nAnd \"large\" numbers are in the top rows.\n\nLet's try this construction for $N \\ge 4$ even:\n`board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]`\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N`\nFor `i` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  For `j` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    If `i < N/2`: // Top half rows\n      If `j < N/2`: // Top-left quadrant\n        `board[i][j] = large_val`\n        `large_val -= 1`\n      Else: // Top-right quadrant\n        `board[i][j] = small_val`\n        `small_val += 1`\n    Else: // Bottom half rows\n      If `j < N/2`: // Bottom-left quadrant\n        `board[i][j] = small_val`\n        `small_val += 1`\n      Else: // Bottom-right quadrant\n        `board[i][j] = large_val`\n        `large_val -= 1`\n\nThis creates a \"diagonal\" split of small/large numbers.\nTop-left and Bottom-right get large numbers.\nTop-right and Bottom-left get small numbers.\nFor $N=4$:\n16 15 | 1 2\n14 13 | 3 4\n- - - - - -\n5 6 | 12 11\n7 8 | 10 9\n\nLet's trace this for $N=4$:\n1.
