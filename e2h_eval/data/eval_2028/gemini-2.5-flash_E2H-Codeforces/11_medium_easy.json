A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Soft Drinking Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Soft Drinking\" problem, and it's pretty straightforward.  The goal is to calculate the maximum number of toasts friends can have, given limited resources. It's a classic resource allocation problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. There are `n` friends, and they each need drink, lime, and salt. I'm given the total drink (`k` bottles with `l` ml each), lime slices (`c` limes with `d` slices each), and salt (`p` grams). There's also how much each friend needs per toast (`nl` ml drink, 1 slice of lime, `np` grams of salt).  The key is that all friends have to make the same number of toasts.\n\nMy approach will be this:\n\n1. **Calculate Available Resources:** Figure out the *total* amount of each resource I have available, like total drink ( `k * l` ), total lime slices ( `c * d` ), and total salt ( `p` ).\n2. **Calculate Toasts per Resource:** Determine how many *individual* toasts I can make with each resource. I'll divide the total amount of each resource by the amount needed *per toast*. Since you can't have a partial toast, I'll use integer division ( `//` ).  For example, with the drink, that's `(k * l) // nl`.\n3. **Find the Limiting Factor:** The total number of toasts I can make is limited by the resource that runs out first.  I need to find the minimum of the toasts I can make based on drink, limes, and salt:  `min((k * l) // nl, (c * d), p // np)`. This gives me the maximum number of *total* toasts possible.\n4. **Divide for Each Friend:** Since all friends make the same number of toasts, I need to divide this total number of toasts by the number of friends, `n`. That final answer is `min((k * l) // nl, (c * d), p // np) // n`.\n\nI've tested this logic with a couple of example test cases from the problem description, and it works as expected. The time and space complexity are both O(1), as I'm just doing a few arithmetic calculations. No tricky algorithms needed. Now, I will translate this into a Python script and submit the solution.\n",
