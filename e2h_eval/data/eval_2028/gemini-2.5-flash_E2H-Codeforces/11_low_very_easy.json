A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve the \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's about maximizing toasts given limited resources. Let me break down my thought process.\n\nI've got `n` friends, `k` bottles of drink, `l` ml per bottle, `c` limes, `d` slices per lime, and `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `nl` ml of drink, 1 slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per toast. The goal is to figure out the maximum number of toasts *each* friend can make, ensuring they all drink the same amount.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total available resources: total drink (`k * l`), total lime slices (`c * d`), and total salt (`p`).  Then, the key is to see how many *toasts per friend* are possible, considering that everyone needs the same amount of each resource.\n\nInitially, I considered total resources for all the `n` friends and this was a bit off. Reading again, the problem wants the amount for *each* friend. So let `T` be the toasts that *each* friend makes. So, for `T` toasts for each friend, they would need `n * T * nl`, `n * T * 1` (lime slice) and `n * T * np`. Given the total resources, I can figure out the maximum toasts from each resource:\n\n*   **Drink:** `n * T * nl <= k * l`, which means `T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)`\n*   **Limes:** `n * T <= c * d`, which means `T <= (c * d) / n`\n*   **Salt:** `n * T * np <= p`, which means `T <= p / (n * np)`\n\nSince `T` must be an integer (you can't make fractions of toasts!), I'll use the floor function for each of these: `T_drink`, `T_limes`, and `T_salt`. The maximum number of toasts *each* friend can make is then simply the minimum of those three values, because they are limited by the *scarcest* resource. I need to make sure my code reflects this logic.\n",
