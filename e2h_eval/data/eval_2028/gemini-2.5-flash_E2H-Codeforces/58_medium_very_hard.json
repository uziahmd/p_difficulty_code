You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on Competitive Programming: A Cycle-Finding Expedition**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with finding the minimum number of edges, `t`, and the number of ways, `w`, to create an odd-length cycle in a graph.  The key is to remember the graph has no loops and no parallel edges. It can be disconnected, which makes things interesting.\n\nFirst, the core insight is that an odd cycle can only exist if the graph *isn't* bipartite. So, the first step is always to check if the input graph is bipartite. We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with a two-coloring approach. If we find any edge where both ends have the same color, *boom*, odd cycle found. In this scenario `t` is 0 and `w` is 1 because the cycle exists already. The graph is not bipartite, and we are done.\n\nIf the graph *is* bipartite, we have to add edges. Now, each connected component is also bipartite. Each component can be divided into two sets, say 'L' and 'R', with all edges going from L to R. To form an odd cycle, we need an edge to connect two vertices within the same partition within any connected component, which effectively forms an odd cycle, if it's not already there.\n\nLet's assume the graph is bipartite. Let's start with `t=1`. If we can add one edge to create an odd cycle, we need to count the pairs of vertices, `u` and `v`, that are in the *same* partition within any connected component.  For example if both `u` and `v` are both in L, then adding this edge `(u,v)` will form an odd cycle. If the graph has `N_0` vertices in color 0 and `N_1` vertices in color 1 for a connected component, the number of ways is then `N_0 * (N_0-1)/2` plus `N_1 * (N_1 -1)/2` for each such component. We're effectively counting pairs.\n\nIf t=1 is possible, we have our answer: `t = 1` and `w` is the sum of those combinations across all connected components. And we are done.\n\nNow, if `t=1` is not possible, it means no connected component has enough same-colored vertices to make that work. That would mean each component is either an isolated vertex (N0=1 or N1=1) or a single edge connecting two nodes in opposite partitions. In this scenario, we need at least `t=2` to get an odd cycle.  In this case, we have a bunch of isolated vertices and a number of single edge connected pairs.\n\nAdding two edges at `t=2` requires us to connect two components and make sure that we get an odd cycle. It looks like we have to pick one isolated vertex, say `u`, which must be a node of an isolated component and pick an existing single edge from a different component, `v` and `x`. Connect `u` with both `v` and `x`. It would create a 3 cycle, `u-v-x-u`. The answer would be, `t=2`, and `w` would be the product of number of isolated vertices with a single edge, which is `num_isolated_vertices * num_single_edges`.\n\nNow, if even that isn't possible, then all we have are isolated vertices. Then we have to connect three vertices to form a 3-cycle. `t = 3`, and the number of ways is `n choose 3`, or `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`, where `n` is the number of vertices. That's the final answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so. The graph can be disconnected and has no loops or parallel edges initially. We cannot add loops or parallel edges.\n\nA graph contains an odd-length cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. This is the key property we will use.\n\nWe can solve this problem by considering cases for `t`:\n\n**Case 0: `t = 0` (Graph already contains an odd cycle)**\nFirst, we check if the given graph already contains an odd-length cycle. We can do this using a 2-coloring algorithm (BFS or DFS).\n1.  Initialize all vertices as uncolored.\n2.  For each uncolored vertex, start a BFS/DFS:\n    *   Assign it color 0.\n    *   Add it to a queue/stack.\n    *   While the queue/stack is not empty, pop a vertex `u`.\n    *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        *   If `v` is uncolored, assign it the opposite color of `u` and add it to the queue/stack.\n        *   If `v` is already colored and has the same color as `u`, we have found an odd-length cycle. The graph is not bipartite.\n3.  If an odd-length cycle is found anywhere in the graph, then `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's one way to add zero edges: do nothing).\n\n**Case 1: `t = 1` (Add one edge to form an odd cycle)**\nIf the graph is bipartite (no odd cycle found in Case 0), we need to add at least one edge.\nTo form an odd cycle by adding a single edge `(u, v)`, `u` and `v` must belong to the same connected component and have the same color in the 2-coloring.\nThis is because any path between `u` and `v` in a bipartite graph must have an even length if `u` and `v` have the same color. Adding the edge `(u, v)` would then create a cycle of length `(path_length + 1)`, which would be odd. Since the graph is bipartite, no existing edge connects vertices of the same color, so adding such an edge `(u,v)` will always be a new edge.\n\nTo count `w` for `t=1`:\n1.  During the 2-coloring process (if no odd cycle is found), for each connected component, count the number of vertices assigned color 0 (`N_0`) and color 1 (`N_1`).\n2.  The number of ways to choose two distinct vertices of color 0 within a component is `N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2`.\n3.  Similarly, for color 1, it's `N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2`.\n4.  Sum these counts over all connected components. This sum is `w`.\n5.  If `w > 0`, then `t = 1` and we print `1 w`.\n\n**Case 2: `t = 2` (Add two edges to form an odd cycle)**\nIf `t=1` is not possible (i.e., `w` from Case 1 is 0), it implies that for every connected component, `N_0 <= 1` and `N_1 <= 1`. This means each connected component is either:\n*   An isolated vertex (e.g., `N_0=1, N_1=0` or `N_0=0, N_1=1`).\n*   A single edge (e.g., `N_0=1, N_1=1` for an edge `u-v` where `u` has color 0 and `v` has color 1).\n\nIn this scenario, to form an odd cycle, we must connect different components. The shortest possible odd cycle is a 3-cycle.\nWe can form a 3-cycle `u-v-x-u` by adding two edges if we have:\n1.  An isolated vertex `u`.\n2.  A component consisting of a single edge `v-x`.\nWe then add edges `(u, v)` and `(u, x)`. This forms a 3-cycle.\n\nTo count `w` for `t=2`:\n1.  While processing components (if `t=1` was not possible), count the total number of isolated vertices (`num_isolated_vertices`).\n2.  Count the total number of components that are a single edge (`num_single_edges`).\n3.  The number of ways `w` to form a 3-cycle this way is `num_isolated_vertices * num_single_edges`.\n4.  If `w > 0`, then `t = 2` and we print `2 w`.\n\n**Case 3: `t = 3` (Add three edges to form an odd cycle)**\nIf `t=2` is not possible (i.e., `w` from Case 2 is 0), it implies that either `num_isolated_vertices` is 0 or `num_single_edges` is 0.\nSince `t=1` was not possible, all components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\nIf `num_single_edges` is 0, it means all `m` initial edges must be 0, and all `n` vertices are isolated.\nIn this case, we need to add three edges to form the smallest possible odd cycle (a 3-cycle). We can pick any three distinct vertices `u, v, x` and add edges `(u, v)`, `(v, x)`, and `(x, u)`.\nThis requires `n >= 3`.\nThe number of ways `w` is the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\nThis will be `t = 3` and we print `3 w`.\nNote: The problem constraints `1 <= n <= 10^5` guarantee that if `n < 3`, `n * (n-1) * (n-2)` would be 0 or negative, so `w` would be 0, implying this case isn't met. However, the problem implies a solution always exists. If `n < 3`, it's impossible to form a 3-cycle, so `t` would be infinite. Given the problem structure, we assume `n >= 3` if we reach this case.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n*   **Input 1:** `4 4`, edges `(1,2), (1,3), (4,2), (4,3)`\n    *   Component 1: `1-2-4-3-1`.
