She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this competitive programming problem:**\n\nThe objective is to figure out the least amount of time, in seconds, it takes to close all the tabs outside a specified range [l, r]. We're given the total number of tabs (n), the current cursor position (pos), and that we must keep the tabs from l to r open.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nFirst, I identified four key scenarios:\n\n1.  **All tabs needed:** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, we need all tabs, so no time is spent (0 seconds).\n\n2.  **Only right tabs to close:** If `l` is 1 (and `r < n`), we just have to close the tabs from `r + 1` to `n`.  The time is the absolute difference between `pos` and `r` (moving the cursor) plus 1 (for the closing operation).\n\n3.  **Only left tabs to close:** If `r` is `n` (and `l > 1`), it's the same logic but flipped.  The time is the absolute difference between `pos` and `l` (moving the cursor) plus 1 (for the closing).\n\n4.  **Both sides to close:** If both `l > 1` and `r < n`, we must close tabs on both sides of the window.  This requires moving to `l` and closing, OR moving to `r` and closing. Then we must move to the other end. So the cost is the minimum time to reach l or r, plus the distance between l and r, plus 2 for the closing actions.\n\n**In essence, the core idea is this:** Figure out the minimum movement and closing operations needed, considering the cursor's initial position and the boundaries we need to close around.  This is a straightforward optimization problem with a clear solution in the form of conditional time calculations, based on where the desired tabs are relative to the current cursor.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the current cursor position `pos`, and the desired range `[l, r]`.\n\nThere are four types of operations, each taking 1 second:\n1. Move cursor left.\n2. Move cursor right.\n3. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (i.e., `[a, i-1]` if cursor is at `i`).\n4. Close all tabs to the right of the cursor (i.e., `[i+1, b]` if cursor is at `i`).\nHere, `a` and `b` are the minimum and maximum indices of currently unclosed tabs.\n\nWe need to close tabs in the range `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs in the range `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`).\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: `l = 1` and `r = n`**\nIn this case, all tabs are within the desired range `[1, n]`. There are no tabs to close.\nMinimum time: `0`\n\n**Scenario 2: `l = 1` and `r < n`**\nOnly tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (i.e., `[r+1, n]`).\nTo perform the \"close right\" operation for `[r+1, n]`, the cursor must be at tab `r`.\n- First, move the cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n- Then, perform the \"close right\" operation. This takes `1` second.\nMinimum time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n\n**Scenario 3: `l > 1` and `r = n`**\nOnly tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (i.e., `[1, l-1]`).\nTo perform the \"close left\" operation for `[1, l-1]`, the cursor must be at tab `l`.\n- First, move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n- Then, perform the \"close left\" operation. This takes `1` second.\nMinimum time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`\n\n**Scenario 4: `l > 1` and `r < n`**\nBoth tabs to the left of `l` (`[1, l-1]`) and tabs to the right of `r` (`[r+1, n]`) need to be closed.\nThis requires two closing operations: one at `l` (to close left) and one at `r` (to close right). The cursor must visit both `l` and `r`.\nThere are two possible strategies:\n\n*   **Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (cursor at `l`): `1` second. (After this, the leftmost open tab is `l`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `r - l` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (cursor at `r`): `1` second.\n    Total time for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (cursor at `r`): `1` second. (After this, the rightmost open tab is `r`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `r - l` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (cursor at `l`): `1` second.\n    Total time for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\nThe minimum time for Scenario 4 is `min(Strategy A, Strategy B)`.\nThis simplifies to: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n\nThe `a` and `b` parameters for movement and closing operations correctly track the boundaries of currently open tabs, but this does not affect the calculation of `abs(x-y)` for moving between `pos`, `l`, and `r` because `l` and `r` are always within the initially open range `[1, n]` and subsequent ranges `[l, n]` or `[1, r]` or `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's combine these conditions for implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are needed, no action required.\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Only right side needs closing (l=1, r<n).\n    if l == 1:\n        # Move to r, then close right.\n        time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(time)\n        return\n\n    # Case 3: Only left side needs closing (l>1, r=n).\n    if r == n:\n        # Move to l, then close left.\n        time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(time)\n        return\n\n    # Case 4: Both left and right sides need closing (l>1, r<n).\n    # We need to visit both l and r.\n    # Option 1: pos -> l (close left) -> r (close right)\n    # Cost: abs(pos - l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) (move l to r) + 1 (close right)\n    # Option 2: pos -> r (close right) -> l (close left)\n    # Cost: abs(pos - r) + 1 (close right) + (r - l) (move r to l) + 1 (close left)\n    \n    # The common part is (r - l) + 2 (for moves between l and r, and two close operations)\n    # The variable part is the initial move to either l or r.\n    time_to_l_first = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n    time_to_r_first = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    \n    print(min(time_to_l_first, time_to_r_first))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
