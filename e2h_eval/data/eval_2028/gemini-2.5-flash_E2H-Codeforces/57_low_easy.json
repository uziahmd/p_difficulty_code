His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Olympiad Ranking Conundrum**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Olympiad ranking problem. I've got `n` participants, and I know Vasya's total score is at least `x`. The goal is to determine the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya based on the sum of his scores from two rounds. The twist is that the scores from the two rounds are unassigned; I don't know which score in the `a` list corresponds to which score in the `b` list for each participant. It's all about finding the optimal pairings.\n\nTo find Vasya's *best* rank, I need to maximize his total score while simultaneously minimizing the scores of everyone else. I know Vasya's total score (`a_i + b_j`) is at least `x` for *some* `i` and `j`.  Essentially, I'm trying to arrange the pairings so that Vasya has a very high score compared to the others.  Initially, my thinking was to pair Vasya with the maximum scores from both lists. But it's not quite that simple, since the pairings impact everyone.\n\nI need a way to strategically pair the scores. Sorting the `a` and `b` lists is crucial. If I can pair the *largest* scores in `a` with the *largest* in `b`, and so on, I can simulate how other participants' scores might compare to Vasya's total. The best-case scenario for Vasya is when he can get the maximum score possible with a combination where it is a total score `>= x` and other participants' scores are low. I'm trying to figure out the specific pairings to secure Vasya the best rank.\n",
    "response": "To find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, we need to consider how the scores from the first and second tours can be paired to form participant totals. Vasya's total score is guaranteed to be at least `x`.\n\nLet `a` be the list of scores from the first tour and `b` be the list of scores from the second tour. Both lists have `n` elements.\n\n### Best Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and, if possible, minimize the scores of other participants. However, the problem statement implies that we are looking for a *specific pairing* of `a` and `b` scores that results in Vasya getting the best rank.\n\nThe best rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. Here's why:\n1. Find the maximum possible sum a participant could achieve: `max(a) + max(b)`.\n2. Let `a_max = max(a)` and `b_max = max(b)`.\n3. If `a_max + b_max >= x`, then it's possible that Vasya scored `a_max + b_max`.\n4. We can construct a pairing where Vasya gets `a_max + b_max`. The remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` can be paired arbitrarily among the other `n-1` participants. For example, pair the remaining largest `a` with the smallest `b`, etc., to minimize other scores, or simply pair them up in any way.\n5. Since `a_max + b_max` is the highest possible sum any participant can get, if Vasya gets this sum, he will be tied for first place (or be the sole first place). Due to the rule \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice,\" the jury can assign Vasya the first place.\n6. The problem guarantees that \"there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\". This means there's at least one valid combination for Vasya's score. The maximum possible sum `max(a) + max(b)` will always satisfy this condition if `x` is achievable. If `max(a) + max(b) < x`, it would contradict the guarantee, meaning `x` must be achievable by some `ai + bj`, and we can always pick `max(a) + max(b)` as Vasya's score if it's `>=x`. But even if `max(a) + max(b)` is not Vasya's score, he can still get rank 1 if his score is the highest among all participants in some configuration. The simplest way to ensure rank 1 is for Vasya to achieve the highest possible score.\n\nTherefore, the best rank Vasya can achieve is 1.\n\n### Worst Rank for Vasya\n\nTo find the worst rank for Vasya, we need to construct a pairing of scores `(a_p1, b_q1), ..., (a_pn, b_qn)` such that:\n1. One of these pairs, say `(a_pk, b_qk)`, is Vasya's score, and `a_pk + b_qk >= x`.\n2. Vasya's rank is as low as possible. This means we want to maximize the number of participants who score *strictly more* than Vasya, and maximize the number of participants who score *equal to* Vasya (so the jury can place them ahead of Vasya).\n\nTo achieve this, we should try to:\n*   Make Vasya's score `a_pk + b_qk` as small as possible, while still satisfying `a_pk + b_qk >= x`.\n*   Make other participants' scores as large as possible.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\n`a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\n`b = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`\n\nConsider pairing `a_i` with `b_j`. To maximize the sums for other participants, we should try to pair large `a` values with large `b` values. This suggests pairing `a_i` with `b_{n-i+1}` (i.e., `a_1` with `b_n`, `a_2` with `b_{n-1}`, etc.) or `a_i` with `b_i`.\n\nLet's use a greedy strategy. We want to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that it satisfies `a_i + b_j >= x`, and there are as many other pairs `(a_k, b_l)` with `a_k + b_l >= a_i + b_j` as possible.\n\nConsider sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.\n`a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` (sorted ascending)\n`b = [b'_1, b'_2, ..., b'_n]` (where `b'` is `b` sorted descending)\n\nNow, if we pair `a_i` with `b'_i`, these sums `a_i + b'_i` represent a set of `n` participant scores. This pairing strategy (sorting one ascending, the other descending, and pairing corresponding elements) is known to minimize the maximum sum and maximize the minimum sum among all pairings. However, it's not directly what we need.\n\nA better approach for the worst case:\nWe want to find a pairing of all `n` scores such that Vasya's total score `S_Vasya` is minimized (but `S_Vasya >= x`), and for this `S_Vasya`, the number of participants with total score `>= S_Vasya` is maximized.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in ascending order: `b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`.\n\nIf we pair `a_i` with `b_j`, Vasya's score is `a_i + b_j`.\nWe need to find a pairing of all `n` scores.\nConsider the `n` pairs `(a_i, b_{n-i+1})` for `i=1...n`. These sums are `a_1+b_n, a_2+b_{n-1}, ..., a_n+b_1`.\nThis pairing is formed by taking the smallest `a` with the largest `b`, the second smallest `a` with the second largest `b`, and so on. This particular pairing strategy tends to make the sums `a_i + b_{n-i+1}` relatively \"even\" or \"balanced\".\n\nLet's calculate all possible `n` sums `s_i = a_i + b_{n-i+1}` for `i=1...n`.\nThese `n` sums represent one possible configuration of total scores for the `n` participants.\nNow, for each `s_i`, if `s_i >= x`, it's possible that `s_i` is Vasya's score.\nIf Vasya's score is `s_i`, then his rank would be `1 + (number of participants whose score is > s_i) + (number of participants whose score is = s_i and jury places them ahead)`. To find the worst rank, we assume all participants with score `>= s_i` are placed ahead of Vasya.\nSo, if Vasya's score is `s_i`, his rank would be `count(s_j >= s_i)`.\n\nWe iterate through all `i` from `1` to `n`. For each `i`:\n1. Calculate `current_vasya_score = a_i + b_{n-i+1}`.\n2. If `current_vasya_score >= x`:\n   This is a valid score for Vasya in this specific pairing.\n   Count how many participants in this pairing have a score greater than or equal to `current_vasya_score`. Let this be `k`.\n   Vasya's rank in this scenario would be `k`.\n   We want the maximum `k` among all valid `i`.\n\nSo, the algorithm for worst rank is:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n4. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1` (using 0-based indexing):\n   a. Let `vasya_score = a[i] + b[n-1-i]`.\n   b. If `vasya_score >= x`:\n      c. Count how many participants `j` (from `0` to `n-1`) have `a[j] + b[n-1-j] >= vasya_score`.\n      d. Update `worst_rank = max(worst_rank, count)`.\n5. Print `worst_rank`.\n\nLet's trace with an example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]` -> sorted `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]` -> sorted `b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\nPairing `a[i]` with `b[n-1-i]`:\ni=0: `a[0]+b[5] = 3+8 = 11`. Scores: `[11, 10, 8, 8, 7, 4]`\ni=1: `a[1]+b[4] = 4+6 = 10`.\ni=2: `a[2]+b[3] = 4+4 = 8`.\ni=3: `a[3]+b[2] = 4+4 = 8`.\ni=4: `a[4]+b[1] = 5+3 = 8`. (Wait, 5+3=8 is wrong, 5+3=8. Example says 5+3=7. Oh, `b[1]` is 3, so `5+3=8`. The example output for worst case says {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, Vasya 4+3=7. This pairing is different.)\n\nThe example's worst case pairing is not `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}`.\nExample's worst case: `a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`, `b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\nExample pairing: `{4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}`\nScores are: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\nSorted scores: `[3, 7, 9, 10, 10, 12]`.\nVasya's score is `4+3=7`.\nParticipants with score `>= 7`: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7`. There are 5 such participants. So Vasya's rank is 5.\n\nThe crucial observation is that we are looking for the maximum possible count of people whose score is `>= Vasya's score`. This is equivalent to finding a pairing where Vasya's score `S_v` is as low as possible (but `>=x`), and then counting how many people have scores `>= S_v`.\n\nLet's sort `a` and `b` in ascending order.\n`a = [a_1, ..., a_n]`\n`b = [b_1, ..., b_n]`\n\nWe want to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nFor this specific `a_i` and `b_j` chosen for Vasya, the remaining `n-1` elements of `a` and `n-1` elements of `b` must be paired among the other `n-1` participants. To maximize the number of people scoring `>= a_i + b_j`, we should try to make the other `n-1` sums as large as possible.\n\nThis becomes a matching problem. Consider all possible `n^2` pairs `(a_i, b_j)`. For each such pair, if `a_i + b_j >= x`, this could be Vasya's score. Let this score be `S_v`.\nThen we need to pair the remaining `n-1` `a` values and `n-1` `b` values such that as many of *those* sums are `>= S_v` as possible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\nThe problem essentially asks: \"What is the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that could end up with a score of at least `S_v` (where `S_v >= x`) in *some* valid pairing?\"\n\nConsider the `n` scores `a_i` and `n` scores `b_j`. We want to find a threshold `T`.\nWe want to find a pairing such that `k` participants have total score `>= T`, and `n-k` participants have total score `< T`.\nVasya is one of the `k` participants, and `T >= x`.\nWe want to maximize `k`.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved with a greedy approach.\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in ascending order.\n\nTo maximize the number of people who score at least `T`:\nWe pair `a_i` with `b_j`. If `a_i + b_j >= T`, this pair contributes to the count.\nWe want to find the largest `k` such that we can find `k` pairs `(a_{p_1}, b_{q_1}), ..., (a_{p_k}, b_{q_k})` with distinct `p` and `q` indices, where each sum `a_{p_m} + b_{q_m} >= x`.\nAnd then Vasya is one of these `k` people.\n\nLet `a` be sorted ascending, `b` be sorted ascending.\nWe want to find the maximum `k` such that we can pick `k` elements from `a` and `k` elements from `b`, say `a_{i_1}, ..., a_{i_k}` and `b_{j_1}, ..., b_{j_k}`, and form `k` pairs `(a_{i_m}, b_{j_m})` such that `a_{i_m} + b_{j_m} >= x` for all `m`.\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum `k` such that we can match `k` elements from `a` with `k` elements from `b` to satisfy the sum condition.\n\nConsider a two-pointer approach for this.\nInitialize `count = 0`.\nUse two pointers: `ptr_a` for `a` (starting at 0, smallest `a` values) and `ptr_b` for `b` (starting at `n-1`, largest `b` values).\nWhile `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n  If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n    This means we can form a pair that satisfies Vasya's minimum score condition.\n    We \"use up\" `a[ptr_a]` and `b[ptr_b]`. Increment `count`, move `ptr_a` forward, move `ptr_b` backward.\n  Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n    The current `a[ptr_a]` (smallest available `a`) is too small to combine with `b[ptr_b]` (largest available `b`) to reach `x`.\n    This `a[ptr_a]` cannot form a pair `>= x` with any `b` element if `b[ptr_b]` is the largest available. So, `a[ptr_a]` cannot contribute to such a pair.\n    We must discard `a[ptr_a]` for the purpose of forming sums `>= x` with the remaining `b`s. Move `ptr_a` forward.\n    (Alternatively, if `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`, it means `b[ptr_b]` is not large enough to pair with `a[ptr_a]`. But `a[ptr_a]` is the smallest `a`. So if `a[ptr_a]` with `b[ptr_b]` is too small, then `a[ptr_a]` with any smaller `b` will also be too small. This logic is correct. We must advance `ptr_a`.)\n\nLet's re-verify the two-pointer logic for the worst case.\nWe want to maximize the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\nLet `left_a = 0`, `right_b = n-1`. `k = 0`.\nWhile `left_a < n` and `right_b >= 0`:\n  If `a[left_a] + b[right_b] >= x`:\n    This pair satisfies the condition. We count it.\n    `k += 1`\n    `left_a += 1` (use smallest available `a`)\n    `right_b -= 1` (use largest available `b`)\n  Else (`a[left_a] + b[right_b] < x`):\n    The smallest `a` (`a[left_a]`) cannot form a sum `>= x` even with the largest `b` (`b[right_b]`).\n    Therefore, `a[left_a]` cannot be part of *any* pair that sums to `>= x`.\n    So, we discard `a[left_a]` and move to the next smallest `a`.\n    `left_a += 1`\n\nThis `k` is the maximum number of participants who *could* score at least `x` in *some* pairing. If Vasya is one of these `k` participants, and the other `k-1` participants also score `>= x`, and the remaining `n-k` participants score `< x`, then Vasya's worst rank would be `k`.\n\nLet's test this logic with Example 2:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]` (sorted ascending)\n`b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]` (sorted ascending)\n\n`left_a = 0`, `right_b = 5`, `k = 0`\n\n1. `a[0]+b[5] = 3+8 = 11`. `11 >= 7`. Yes.\n   `k = 1`. `left_a = 1`, `right_b = 4`.\n2. `a[1]+b[4] = 4+6 = 10`. `10 >= 7`. Yes.\n   `k = 2`. `left_a = 2`, `right_b = 3`.\n3. `a[2]+b[3] = 4+4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. Yes.\n   `k = 3`. `left_a = 3`, `right_b = 2`.\n4. `a[3]+b[2] = 4+4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. Yes.\n   `k = 4`. `left_a = 4`, `right_b = 1`.\n5. `a[4]+b[1] = 5+3 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. Yes.\n   `k = 5`. `left_a = 5`, `right_b = 0`.\n6. `a[5]+b[0] = 6+0 = 6`. `6 >= 7`. No.\n   `left_a = 6`.\nLoop terminates because `left_a = 6` is not `< n`.\n\nThe calculated `k` is 5. This matches the example's worst rank.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because:\n- When `a[left_a] + b[right_b] >= x`: We successfully formed a pair. To maximize `k`, we should always take such a pair. We use the smallest available `a` (`a[left_a]`) and the largest available `b` (`b[right_b]`) to satisfy the condition. This leaves larger `a` values and smaller `b` values for future pairings, which is beneficial. Using `a[left_a]` is optimal because if it can form a pair `>= x` with `b[right_b]`, it's the \"cheapest\" `a` to satisfy the condition with the \"most powerful\" `b`.\n- When `a[left_a] + b[right_b] < x`: The smallest `a` cannot combine with the largest `b` to reach `x`. This `a[left_a]` cannot form a pair `>= x` with *any* remaining `b` (since all other `b`s are smaller than `b[right_b]`). So, `a[left_a]` cannot contribute to `k` and must be discarded.\n\nThis logic seems sound for finding the maximum number of participants who can score at least `x`. Vasya would be one of them, and if all `k` participants score `>= x`, the jury could assign Vasya the `k`-th place.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Read `n`, `x`.\n2. Read `a` and `b`.\n3. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n4. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n5. `best_rank = 1`.\n6. `worst_rank = 0`.\n7. `ptr_a = 0` (for `a` array, starting from smallest).\n8. `ptr_b = n - 1` (for `b` array, starting from largest).\n9. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n   If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n     `worst_rank += 1`\n     `ptr_a += 1`\n     `ptr_b -= 1`\n   Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n     `ptr_a += 1`\n10.
