Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Flawed Flow Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and my initial thoughts are around the key constraints and how they interact. We're given an undirected graph, edge capacities, and the goal is to direct the edges to satisfy flow conservation and acyclicity.  The size of the graph is significant, so we have to be efficient.\n\nFirst thing that jumps out is the *no cycles* condition.  That's huge. That screams Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and suggests a topological sort will be crucial.  If it's a DAG, there *must* be a topological ordering. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, so it has to be first in this ordering, and presumably, the sink (vertex *n*, which I'm inferring from typical max-flow setups), would be last.  While it doesn't explicitly state that n is a sink, the no cycles condition and flow conservation suggest that all flow ends at *n*. If *n* had outgoing edges, the problem becomes considerably more complex, or the problem statement must be incomplete.\n\nThe flow conservation at intermediate vertices (2 to *n*-1) is also critical. Total incoming flow has to equal total outgoing flow at each of these vertices. We have to decide, for each undirected edge, which direction the flow goes.  This is where the topological sort becomes super relevant.\n\nMy plan:  If we can somehow find a topological ordering, then for an edge (u, v), if `u` comes before `v` in the ordering, then the flow has to go from `u` to `v`. If `v` comes before `u`, it's `v` to `u`.  I can't directly find the topological ordering, because I don't know the edge directions, but I have a strong feeling that I can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to build one. I'll need to figure out how to modify DFS, so it results in a topological sort that satisfies the no cycles condition. I have a hunch that I might be able to assign the direction during the DFS traversal. Let me brainstorm...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge in a given undirected graph, which already has flow volumes `c_i` associated with its edges, such that:\n1.  For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the sum of incoming flow equals the sum of outgoing flow.\n2.  Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  The resulting directed graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\nThe \"no cycles\" constraint is crucial. If the graph is a DAG, there exists a topological ordering of its vertices. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges, it must be the first vertex in any topological ordering. This implies that all edges connected to vertex 1 must be directed *away* from 1.\n\nConsider the \"flow conservation\" property for intermediate vertices. For each vertex `v`, we need to ensure that `in_flow[v] == out_flow[v]`.\nLet `current_net_flow[v]` be the sum of flow volumes of edges directed *into* `v` minus the sum of flow volumes of edges directed *out of* `v`. Initially, `current_net_flow[v]` is 0 for all `v`.\nWhen we direct an edge `u -> v` with capacity `c`, we increase `current_net_flow[v]` by `c` and decrease `current_net_flow[u]` by `c`.\n\nThe problem can be solved by a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1. Since we need to avoid cycles, a common approach for constructing DAGs or finding topological orderings is to process vertices in an order that respects dependencies.\n\nLet's maintain for each vertex `v` the `net_flow_balance[v]`, which represents the sum of flow volumes of edges directed *into* `v` minus the sum of flow volumes of edges directed *out of* `v` *among edges whose directions have already been determined*. Initially, all `net_flow_balance[v]` are 0.\n\nWe can use a DFS approach:\n1.  Start a DFS from vertex 1.\n2.  Maintain a `visited` array to track visited vertices and a `path_visited` array (or similar mechanism) to detect cycles during DFS, though with this approach, cycles won't be formed by construction.\n3.  For each vertex `u` visited by DFS:\n    *   Iterate through all its neighbors `v` via an undirected edge `(u, v)` with flow `c`.\n    *   If `v` has not been visited yet, this means `v` is \"further\" from the source in the DFS tree. We can tentatively direct the edge `u -> v`. This choice is consistent with building a DAG where `u` comes before `v`.\n        *   Record the direction `u -> v`.\n        *   Add `c` to `net_flow_balance[v]`.\n        *   Subtract `c` from `net_flow_balance[u]`.\n        *   Recursively call DFS on `v`.\n    *   If `v` has already been visited, this means `v` is \"closer\" to the source or in a different branch. To avoid cycles, we must direct the edge `v -> u`.\n        *   Record the direction `v -> u`.\n        *   Add `c` to `net_flow_balance[u]`.\n        *   Subtract `c` from `net_flow_balance[v]`.\n\nAfter the DFS completes, we will have directed all edges. Let's verify the conditions:\n*   **No cycles:** By always directing edges away from the current vertex to unvisited neighbors, and directing edges towards the current vertex from already visited neighbors, we essentially build a DFS tree/forest and direct cross-edges consistent with the DFS traversal order. This guarantees a DAG.\n*   **Vertex 1 has no incoming edges:** Since DFS starts from 1, all its neighbors will be unvisited initially. Thus, all edges connected to 1 will be directed `1 -> v`. This satisfies the condition.\n*   **Flow conservation for 1 < v < n:** This is the tricky part. The above DFS strategy doesn't explicitly guarantee flow conservation. For an intermediate vertex `v`, its `net_flow_balance[v]` might not be zero.\n\nLet's refine the DFS strategy. The problem statement guarantees a solution exists and the given `c_i` values are for a *correct maximum flow*. This implies that the total flow out of source 1 must equal the total flow into sink `n`.\n\nA more robust approach for flow conservation in a DAG:\nWe can use a DFS (or BFS) that processes vertices in a topological-like order. For each vertex `u`, we want to determine if `net_flow_balance[u]` is positive or negative. If `net_flow_balance[u]` is positive, it means `u` has too much incoming flow, so some of its *undirected* outgoing edges must be directed *out* of `u`. If `net_flow_balance[u]` is negative, it means `u` has too much outgoing flow, which is impossible if we start from source 1 and never create cycles. If `net_flow_balance[u]` is zero, it's balanced.\n\nInstead, let's track the *net flow required* for each vertex. For each vertex `v`, let `required_flow[v]` be the total flow that needs to pass through `v` to satisfy flow conservation.\nA simpler DFS approach that works:\n1.  Initialize `balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n2.  Store edges as `(u, v, c, original_index)`.\n3.  Perform a DFS starting from vertex 1.\n    *   `dfs(u, parent)`:\n        *   Mark `u` as visited.\n        *   For each edge `(u, v, c, original_index)` connected to `u`:\n            *   If `v == parent`, skip (don't go back immediately).\n            *   If `v` is not visited:\n                *   Call `dfs(v, u)`.\n                *   After the recursive call returns, `v` and its subtree have been processed. Now, we need to decide the direction of `(u, v)`.\n                *   If `balance[v] > 0`: This means `v` has an excess of flow coming into it (from its children in the DFS tree). To balance `v`, this excess must flow *out* of `v` towards `u`. So, direct `v -> u`.\n                    *   `result[original_index] = 1` (flow `b_i -> a_i` if `u` is `a_i`, `v` is `b_i`).\n                    *   `balance[u] += c`.\n                    *   `balance[v] -= c`.\n                *   Else (`balance[v] <= 0`): This means `v` has a deficit or is balanced. The flow should go `u -> v`.\n                    *   `result[original_index] = 0` (flow `a_i -> b_i` if `u` is `a_i`, `v` is `b_i`).\n                    *   `balance[u] -= c`.\n                    *   `balance[v] += c`.\n        *   **Important exception:** For vertex `n` (the sink), it *must* accumulate all flow. So, if `u == n`, we don't need to balance it to zero.\n        *   **Correction to the above logic:** The `balance[v]` accumulated from children represents the *net flow that needs to leave the subtree rooted at v* (if positive) or *enter the subtree rooted at v* (if negative). For flow conservation, we need `balance[u]` to be 0 for `1 < u < n`.\n\nLet's use a standard DFS for topological sort. We want to find a topological ordering. The \"no cycles\" constraint is key.\nThe problem can be rephrased: for each vertex `v`, we need `sum(in_c) - sum(out_c) = 0`.\nFor vertex 1, `sum(in_c) - sum(out_c) < 0` (all flow outgoing).\nFor vertex `n`, `sum(in_c) - sum(out_c) > 0` (all flow incoming).\n\nThe core idea is to use a DFS to build a spanning tree. Edges within the spanning tree are directed away from the root (vertex 1). For back-edges (edges connecting a vertex to an ancestor in the DFS tree), they must be directed towards the ancestor to avoid cycles.\n\nConsider the total flow that *must* exit a subtree rooted at `u` (excluding the edge to its parent). Let `subtree_flow_deficit[u]` be this value.\n`dfs(u, parent_edge_id)`:\n1.  Mark `u` as visited.\n2.  Initialize `current_out_flow_from_subtree = 0`.\n3.  For each edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` connected to `u`:\n    *   If `edge_idx == parent_edge_id`, continue.\n    *   If `v` is visited:\n        *   This is a back-edge or cross-edge. To maintain DAG property, we must direct `v -> u`.\n        *   `result[edge_idx] = (u == original_a_i ? 1 : 0)` (direct `b_i -> a_i` if `u` is `a_i`, `v` is `b_i`).\n        *   `current_out_flow_from_subtree += c`.\n    *   If `v` is not visited:\n        *   Recursively call `dfs(v, edge_idx)`.\n        *   After `dfs(v, edge_idx)` returns, it will have determined the `subtree_flow_deficit[v]` for the subtree rooted at `v`.\n        *   If `u == 1` and `v == n`, this is a special case (direct path from source to sink).\n        *   If `u == 1`: all edges must be `1 -> v`.\n        *   If `v == n`: all edges must be `v -> n`.\n        *   For any other `v`:\n            *   If `subtree_flow_deficit[v] > 0`: This means `v`'s subtree has an excess of flow that needs to exit it. This flow must go `v -> u`.\n                *   `result[edge_idx] = (u == original_a_i ? 1 : 0)`.\n                *   `current_out_flow_from_subtree += c`.\n            *   Else (`subtree_flow_deficit[v] <= 0`): This means `v`'s subtree needs flow, or is balanced. The flow should go `u -> v`.\n                *   `result[edge_idx] = (u == original_a_i ? 0 : 1)`.\n                *   `current_out_flow_from_subtree -= c`.\n4.  After processing all children, `subtree_flow_deficit[u] = current_out_flow_from_subtree`.\n    *   **Special handling for `n`:** If `u == n`, `subtree_flow_deficit[n]` should be the total incoming flow to `n`. We don't need to balance it to 0.\n\nThis DFS approach is typical for finding articulation points or bridges, but adapted for flow direction. The `balance` array will store the net flow *out* of the subtree rooted at `u` (excluding the edge to its parent).\nLet `balance[u]` be the sum of flow volumes of edges directed *out* of `u` minus the sum of flow volumes of edges directed *into* `u` *within the subtree rooted at `u`*, considering edges to children and back-edges from children.\n\nCorrect DFS strategy:\n`dfs(u, p_edge_idx)`:\n1.  Mark `u` as visited.\n2.  `current_balance = 0` (this will track `sum(flow_out) - sum(flow_in)` for edges within `u`'s subtree, excluding the parent edge).\n3.  For each edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` connected to `u`:\n    *   If `edge_idx == p_edge_idx`, continue.\n    *   Let `(a_orig, b_orig, _, _) = original_edges[edge_idx]`.\n    *   If `v` is visited:\n        *   This is a back-edge or cross-edge. To avoid cycles, flow must go `v -> u`.\n        *   `result[edge_idx] = (1 if a_orig == u else 0)`.\n        *   `current_balance += c`.\n    *   Else (`v` is not visited):\n        *   `dfs(v, edge_idx)`.\n        *   Now, `balance[v]` holds the net flow *out* of `v`'s subtree.\n        *   If `balance[v] > 0`: `v`'s subtree has an excess of outgoing flow. This flow must come from `u` to `v`. So, direct `u -> v`.\n            *   `result[edge_idx] = (0 if a_orig == u else 1)`.\n            *   `current_balance += c`.\n        *   Else (`balance[v] <= 0`): `v`'s subtree needs incoming flow or is balanced. The flow must go `v -> u`.\n            *   `result[edge_idx] = (1 if a_orig == u else 0)`.\n            *   `current_balance -= c`.\n4.  `balance[u] = current_balance`.\n\nAfter the DFS from vertex 1 completes, `balance[1]` will represent the total flow from source 1 minus total flow into source 1 (which should be 0).\nFor any `u` where `1 < u < n`, `balance[u]` should be 0.\nFor `u = n`, `balance[n]` should represent the total flow into `n` minus total flow out of `n`.\n\nThis strategy is sound. The `balance[u]` value after `dfs(u, ...)` returns represents the net flow *out* of the subtree rooted at `u` (considering all edges within the subtree and edges connecting to already visited nodes outside the subtree, but *not* considering the edge to its parent).\nIf `balance[v] > 0`, it means the subtree at `v` has a net positive outgoing flow. To satisfy flow conservation for `v` and its descendants, this flow must ultimately pass from `u` to `v`. So, `u -> v`.\nIf `balance[v] <= 0`, it means the subtree at `v` has a net non-positive outgoing flow (i.e., it needs incoming flow or is balanced). This flow must come from `v` to `u`. So, `v -> u`.\nThis holds for all `v != n`.\nFor `v = n`, we don't need to balance it. If `n` is a child of `u`, and `balance[n]` is calculated (which would be 0 as `n` has no children in the DFS tree), then the edge `u-n` would be directed `n -> u` if `balance[n] <= 0`. This is incorrect. The flow must go `u -> n`.\n\nThe correct logic for the edge `(u, v)` (where `v` is a child of `u` in the DFS tree):\nIf `v == n`: The edge must be `u -> n`.\nElse (`v != n`):\n    If `balance[v] > 0`: direct `u -> v`. (Flow from `u` helps `v` balance its excess outgoing flow).\n    Else (`balance[v] <= 0`): direct `v -> u`. (Flow from `v` helps `u` balance its excess outgoing flow from `v`'s subtree).\n\nLet's trace this logic. `balance[u]` tracks the `sum(out_flow) - sum(in_flow)` for the *current* vertex `u` considering edges *to its children* and *back-edges from children*.\n\n`balance[u]` should be the flow that *needs to pass through the parent edge* to balance `u` and its subtree.\n`dfs(u, p_edge_idx)`:\n1.  Mark `u` as visited.\n2.  `deficit_to_parent = 0`. (This will be the net flow `sum(in_flow) - sum(out_flow)` within the subtree of `u`, *excluding* the parent edge).\n3.  For each edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` connected to `u`:\n    *   If `edge_idx == p_edge_idx`, continue.\n    *   Let `(a_orig, b_orig, _, _) = original_edges[edge_idx]`.\n    *   If `v` is visited:\n        *   This is a back-edge or cross-edge.

(Flow `v -> u` contributes to `u`'s incoming flow).\n    *   Else (`v` is not visited):\n        *   `dfs(v, edge_idx)`.\n        *   `flow_needed_by_v_subtree = balance[v]`. (This is `sum(in_flow) - sum(out_flow)` for `v`'s subtree, excluding its parent edge `(u,v)`).\n        *   If `flow_needed_by_v_subtree > 0`: `v`'s subtree needs `flow_needed_by_v_subtree` units of flow. This must come from `u`. So, `u -> v`.\n            *   `result[edge_idx] = (0 if a_orig == u else 1)`.\n            *   `deficit_to_parent += flow_needed_by_v_subtree`. (Incoming to `v` from `u` means `u` is outgoing, so `deficit_to_parent` increases by `flow_needed_by_v_subtree`).\n        *   Else (`flow_needed_by_v_subtree <= 0`): `v`'s subtree has an excess of `abs(flow_needed_by_v_subtree)` flow. This must go from `v` to `u`. So, `v -> u`.\n            *   `result[edge_idx] = (1 if a_orig == u else 0)`.\n            *   `deficit_to_parent += c`.

We don't need to balance `n` to 0. So, `balance[n]` should represent the total amount of flow that *has accumulated* in `n`.\n    *   **Special handling for `u == 1`:** If `u == 1`, it's the source. `deficit_to_parent` for `1` should be its total outgoing flow.

So `1 -> v`.\n            *   `result[edge_idx] = (0 if a_orig == u else 1)`.\n            *   `current_flow_sum[u] -= c`.\n            *   `current_flow_sum[v] += c`.\n        *   Else if `v == n`: All edges to `n` must be incoming. So `u -> n`.\n            *   `result[edge_idx] = (0 if a_orig == u else 1)`.\n            *   `current_flow_sum[u] -= c`.\n            *   `current_flow_sum[v] += c`.\n        *   Else (`1 < u, v < n`):\n            *   If `current_flow_sum[v] < 0`: `v` and its subtree have an excess of outgoing flow. To balance `v`, flow must go `u -> v`.\n                *   `result[edge_idx] = (0 if a_orig == u else 1)`.\n                *   `current_flow_sum[u] -= c`.\n                *   `current_flow_sum[v] += c`.\n            *   Else (`current_flow_sum[v] >= 0`): `v` and its subtree have an excess of incoming flow or are balanced. To balance `v`, flow must go `v -> u`.\n                *   `result[edge_idx] = (1 if a_orig == u else 0)`.\n                *   `current_flow_sum[u] += c`.\n                *   `current_flow_sum[v] -= c`.\n\nThis final strategy looks promising. `current_flow_sum[v]` will accumulate the net flow for `v` *and its entire subtree*, which needs to be balanced by the edge to its parent `u`. The base cases are `u=1` (always outgoing) and `v=n` (always incoming). For intermediate nodes, if `current_flow_sum[v]` is negative, it means `v`'s subtree has a net outgoing flow, so `u` must supply flow to `v`. If `current_flow_sum[v]` is non-negative, `v`'s subtree has a net incoming flow, so `v` must send flow to `u`.\n\nThe `current_flow_sum` should be initialized to 0. When `dfs(v, edge_idx)` returns, `current_flow_sum[v]` represents the `sum(in) - sum(out)` for the subtree rooted at `v` (excluding the edge to `u`).\nIf `current_flow_sum[v] < 0`, it means `v`'s subtree has a net outgoing flow (needs `abs(current_flow_sum[v])` flow to enter it). This flow must come from `u`. So `u -> v`.\nIf `current_flow_sum[v] >= 0`, it means `v`'s subtree has a net incoming flow (has `current_flow_sum[v]` flow that needs to leave it). This flow must go to `u`. So `v -> u`.\n\nThe `current_flow_sum` array will correctly track the `sum(in_flow) - sum(out_flow)` for each vertex. After the DFS, for all `1 < v < n`, `current_flow_sum[v]` will be 0.\n`current_flow_sum[1]` will be negative (total flow out of source).\n`current_flow_sum[n]` will be positive (total flow into sink).\n\nThis strategy guarantees:\n*   **DAG:** DFS tree edges are directed away from the source. Back-edges are directed towards the source. This forms a DAG.\n*   **Source 1 has no incoming edges:** All edges connected to 1 will be directed `1 -> v` because `u=1` is a special case.\n*   **Flow conservation for 1 < v < n:** The logic of directing `u -> v` if `v` needs flow, and `v -> u` if `v` has excess flow, ensures that `current_flow_sum[v]` becomes 0 for intermediate nodes.\n\nThe implementation will need:\n*   Adjacency list for the graph.\n*   `visited` array for DFS.\n*   `balance` (or `current_flow_sum`) array.\n*   `result` array to store directions (0 for `a_i -> b_i`, 1 for `b_i -> a_i`).\n*   Store original edge `(a_i, b_i)` to correctly assign 0 or 1.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2 * 10**5 + 500) # Increase recursion limit for deep DFS\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    # Store original edges to correctly determine 0 or 1 for output\n    original_edges = [] \n\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append((v, c, i)) # (neighbor, capacity, original_edge_index)\n        adj[v].append((u, c, i)) # Undirected graph, add to both\n        original_edges.append((u, v, c)) # Store (a_i, b_i, c_i)\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # balance[u] will store sum(incoming flow) - sum(outgoing flow) for the subtree rooted at u,\n    # EXCLUDING the edge connecting u to its parent in the DFS tree.\n    # For intermediate nodes (1 < u < n), this should be 0 after processing.\n    balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    result = [0] * m # 0 for a_i -> b_i, 1 for b_i -> a_i\n\n    # DFS function\n    # u: current vertex\n    # p_edge_idx: index of the edge connecting u to its parent in the DFS tree.\n    #             Used to avoid going back immediately to parent.\n    def dfs(u, p_edge_idx):\n        visited[u] = True\n\n        for v, c, edge_idx in adj[u]:\n            if edge_idx == p_edge_idx:\n                continue # Skip the edge to the parent\n\n            a_orig, b_orig, _ = original_edges[edge_idx]\n\n            if visited[v]:\n                # This is a back-edge or cross-edge to an already visited node.\n                # To maintain DAG property and prevent cycles, flow must go v -> u.\n                # This contributes to u's incoming flow.\n                if a_orig == u:\n                    result[edge_idx] = 1 # Flow goes b_orig -> a_orig (v -> u)\n                else: # a_orig == v\n                    result[edge_idx] = 0 # Flow goes a_orig -> b_orig (v -> u)\n                balance[u] += c\n                # No change to balance[v] because it's already processed and its balance is final.\n            else:\n                # v is not visited, explore it\n                dfs(v, edge_idx)\n\n                # After dfs(v) returns, balance[v] holds the net flow for v's subtree.\n                # This is sum(incoming) - sum(outgoing) for v's subtree, excluding the (u,v) edge.\n\n                if u == 1:\n                    # Source vertex 1: All edges from 1 must be outgoing (1 -> v).\n                    # This means flow (u -> v) is outgoing from u.\n                    if a_orig == u:\n                        result[edge_idx] = 0 # Flow goes a_orig -> b_orig (u -> v)\n                    else: # a_orig == v\n                        result[edge_idx] = 1 # Flow goes b_orig -> a_orig (u -> v)\n                    balance[u] -= c # u is outgoing\n                    balance[v] += c # v is incoming\n                elif v == n:\n                    # Sink vertex n: All edges to n must be incoming (u -> n).\n                    # This means flow (u -> v) is outgoing from u.\n                    if a_orig == u:\n                        result[edge_idx] = 0 # Flow goes a_orig -> b_orig (u -> v)\n                    else: # a_orig == v\n                        result[edge_idx] = 1 # Flow goes b_orig -> a_orig (u -> v)\n                    balance[u] -= c # u is outgoing\n                    balance[v] += c # v is incoming\n                else:\n                    # Intermediate vertex v (1 < v < n):\n                    # We need balance[v] to be 0 for flow conservation.\n                    # If balance[v] < 0, v's subtree has a net outgoing flow.\n                    # It needs abs(balance[v]) units of flow to enter it.\n                    # This flow must come from u.
