He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**My Plan for Tackling the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about finding numbers whose factorials end with a specific number of zeroes.  The core of this is figuring out *how* to count those zeroes in the first place.  That leads me right to the idea of prime factorization – specifically, how many pairs of 2 and 5 are lurking in the factorial.  Since there are always more 2s than 5s, the *number* of 5s dictates the number of trailing zeroes. I'm going to lean on Legendre's formula to handle this efficiently.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the behavior of this zero-counting function, let's call it *Z(n)*. It’s definitely non-decreasing.  It increases by 1 for every multiple of 5, but when it's a multiple of 25, 125, etc. I need to add those factors too, not just add one for every increase in n. The really important thing here is that I noticed it might skip numbers. For example, there's no factorial that ends with exactly 5 zeroes! This means I have to handle some \"missing\" outputs.\n\nGiven the non-decreasing nature of *Z(n)*, I know that if I can find *any* number that gives the target number of zeroes, I've got five consecutive numbers (that is, numbers, n, n+1, n+2, n+3, and n+4), which will also give the same number of zeroes. So, if I can find the *smallest* number (*n_s*) that results in the desired number of trailing zeros, then the answer is always five consecutive numbers! But what if the number of zeroes I’m looking for doesn't exist?\n\nTo get the *n_s* value, I plan to use binary search. I'll need a way to calculate *Z(n)* quickly and a good upper bound for the binary search. The upper bound will come from knowing that a good guess is `4*m` (where m is the given number of zeroes). I’ll use Legendre's formula in `calculate_trailing_zeroes` and use the binary search to zero in on the smallest *n* where *Z(n) = m*.\n\nBinary search will find the correct answer, if it exists. Binary search is great since it reduces the solution space by half each iteration. Then, if binary search gives me an *n*, I need to check if the value returned from `calculate_trailing_zeroes` is exactly the right number of zeroes. If it's *not* an exact match, I print 0, as I know that number of zeroes cannot be achieved by any factorial. If it *is* a match, I need to get the \"actual\" smallest number, which will be a multiple of 5. After that, finding those 5 numbers is trivial.\n\nI’m also keeping in mind the input and output formats and adding a few checks to avoid problems, especially if there are cases like m=0. The main loop to do the calculation has to use modular arithmetic to ensure an efficient solution. The plan is to handle edge cases, and ensure the correctness of my binary search. I’ve looked at the code to ensure there are no bugs. Overall, I think I have a solid approach to this competitive programming problem and it should perform efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n` values, followed by the values themselves in increasing order.\n\n**1. Counting Trailing Zeroes in n!**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2 and 5. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes is simply the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\nLegendre's formula provides an efficient way to calculate this:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n**2. Properties of Z(n)**\n\nLet `Z(n)` denote the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.\n*   `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function.\n*   `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n*   If `Z(n_0) = k`, then `Z(n_0+1) = k, Z(n_0+2) = k, Z(n_0+3) = k, Z(n_0+4) = k`, provided `n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4` are not multiples of 5 that would cause `Z` to increase.\n*   More precisely, for any integer `k`, if `Z(n_s) = k` for some `n_s` that is a multiple of 5, then `Z(n_s) = Z(n_s+1) = Z(n_s+2) = Z(n_s+3) = Z(n_s+4) = k`. The value `Z(n_s+5)` will be greater than `k`.\n*   This implies that if `m` is an attainable number of zeroes, there will always be exactly 5 consecutive integers `n` that produce `m` zeroes. These integers will be `n_s, n_s+1, n_s+2, n_s+3, n_s+4`, where `n_s` is the smallest multiple of 5 such that `Z(n_s) = m`.\n*   However, `Z(n)` can skip values. For example, `Z(24) = 4` and `Z(25) = 6`. The value `m=5` is skipped, meaning there is no `n` such that `Z(n) = 5`.\n\n**3. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe need to find if `m` is an attainable number of zeroes, and if so, find the smallest `n_s` (which must be a multiple of 5) such that `Z(n_s) = m`.\n\nSince `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n\n*   **Binary Search Range:**\n    *   The lower bound for `n` can be 1.\n    *   For the upper bound: `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`. So, `n` is approximately `4m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` would be around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search can be `5 * m` (e.g., `500,000` for `m=100,000`).\n\n*   **Binary Search Logic:**\n    1.  Initialize `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m + 5` (a safe upper bound).\n    2.  Initialize `ans_n_s = -1`.\n    3.  While `low <= high`:\n        *   Calculate `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n        *   Calculate `zeroes = Z(mid)` using the `calculate_trailing_zeroes` function.\n        *   If `zeroes >= m`: This `mid` could be our answer or we might find a smaller `n`. Store `mid` in `ans_n_s` and try to search in the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).\n        *   If `zeroes < m`: We need a larger `n`. Search in the upper half (`low = mid + 1`).\n\n*   **Post-Binary Search Check:**\n    After the binary search, `ans_n_s` will hold the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n    1.  Check if `Z(ans_n_s)` is *exactly* `m`. If `ans_n_s` is -1 (shouldn't happen for `m >= 1`) or `calculate_trailing_zeroes(ans_n_s) != m`, it means `m` is a skipped value (not attainable). In this case, print `0`.\n    2.  Otherwise (if `calculate_trailing_zeroes(ans_n_s) == m`): This means `m` is an attainable number of zeroes. The actual smallest `n` that produces `m` zeroes (which must be a multiple of 5) is `ans_n_s - (ans_n_s % 5)`. Let's call this `n_start`. The five integers are `n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`. Print `5` followed by these five integers.\n\n**Example Trace (m=1):**\n`low=1, high=10`\n1. `mid=5, Z(5)=1`. `1 >= 1`. `ans_n_s=5, high=4`.\n2. `low=1, high=4`. `mid=2, Z(2)=0`. `0 < 1`. `low=3`.\n3. `low=3, high=4`. `mid=3, Z(3)=0`. `0 < 1`. `low=4`.\n4. `low=4, high=4`. `mid=4, Z(4)=0`. `0 < 1`. `low=5`.\n5. `low=5, high=4`. Loop terminates.\n`ans_n_s = 5`.\n`calculate_trailing_zeroes(5) == 1` (True).\n`n_start = 5 - (5 % 5) = 5`.\nOutput:\n`5`\n`5 6 7 8 9`\n\n**Example Trace (m=5):**\n`low=1, high=25` (approx)\n...
