He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Refinement and Code Verification**\n\nAlright, after meticulously reviewing the problem, I've zeroed in on the core requirements for validating the string `S`.  I need to ensure `S` follows a very specific pattern: a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, and finally a sequence of 'c's. The crucial detail is that the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This implies that there *must* be at least one 'c', one 'b', and one 'a' in the valid string.  I've come up with a state machine approach to make this validation efficient.\n\nHere's my refined thinking:\n\n1.  **State Machine:**  I've defined states to track the expected characters. Initially, I'm in the 'a' state.  If I encounter a 'b', I transition to the 'b' state.  If I then hit a 'c', I transition to the 'c' state. Any other character in the wrong state immediately renders the string invalid.\n\n2.  **Character Counting:**  Simultaneously, I'm keeping track of the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. I've initialized the counts to zero.\n\n3.  **Order Enforcement:** As I parse the string, I'm extremely vigilant about the order of the characters.  Any deviation from the `a...b...c` pattern flags the string as invalid.\n\n4.  **Final Validation:**  After iterating through the string, I check the counts.  The essential conditions are that the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's must all be greater than zero.  And critically, I verify whether the count of 'c's equals either the count of 'a's or 'b's.  If all conditions are satisfied, it's a \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n5.  **Robustness and Error Handling**:  I've included handling for potential errors such as a non `a`, `b`, or `c` character. I also included explicit checks for at least one of each character.\n\nI've tested with several examples, including edge cases and challenging inputs to catch errors. Iâ€™m confident that this approach guarantees a correct solution. The time complexity is clearly linear, making it efficient given the size constraints. I am sure now about the logic and robustness, and about how to efficiently translate this logic into the Python code. I'm ready to proceed.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and derive the conditions for a valid string:\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with a string of `N_a` lowercase 'a's.\n2.  **B's step**: B appends `N_b` lowercase 'b's to A's string. At this point, the string has `N_a` 'a's followed by `N_b` 'b's. The problem states that \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" at this stage. This implies `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step**: C appends `N_c` lowercase 'c's to the end of the string. The crucial condition here is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`.\n\nCombining these rules, a valid string `S` must satisfy the following:\n\n*   **Structure**: The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's. There should be no 'b' or 'c' before an 'a', no 'c' before a 'b', no 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b' after a 'c'.\n*   **Counts**:\n    *   `N_a >= 1` (at least one 'a')\n    *   `N_b >= 1` (at least one 'b')\n    *   `N_c >= 1` (Since `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`, and `N_c` must be equal to either `N_a` or `N_b`, `N_c` must also be at least 1).\n    *   `N_c == N_a` OR `N_c == N_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can solve this problem by iterating through the string once, keeping track of the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c', and using a state machine to ensure the characters appear in the correct order.\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Initialize `n_a = 0`, `n_b = 0`, `n_c = 0`.\n    *   Initialize a `current_phase` variable:\n        *   `0`: We are currently expecting 'a's.\n        *   `1`: We are currently expecting 'b's (meaning we have encountered at least one 'a' and are now in the 'b' section).\n        *   `2`: We are currently expecting 'c's (meaning we have encountered at least one 'a' and at least one 'b', and are now in the 'c' section).\n\n2.  **Iterate through the string `S`**: For each character `char` in `S`:\n    *   If `char == 'a'`:\n        *   If `current_phase` is `1` or `2` (meaning we've already started counting 'b's or 'c's), then an 'a' is out of order. Print \"NO\" and terminate.\n        *   Increment `n_a`.\n        *   `current_phase` remains `0`.\n    *   If `char == 'b'`:\n        *   If `current_phase` is `2` (meaning we've already started counting 'c's), then a 'b' is out of order. Print \"NO\" and terminate.\n        *   If `current_phase` is `0` (meaning we were expecting 'a's), transition to `current_phase = 1`.\n        *   Increment `n_b`.\n    *   If `char == 'c'`:\n        *   If `current_phase` is `0` (meaning we were expecting 'a's and haven't seen any 'b's yet), then a 'c' is out of order. Print \"NO\" and terminate.\n        *   If `current_phase` is `1` (meaning we were expecting 'b's), transition to `current_phase = 2`.\n        *   Increment `n_c`.\n    *   (Optional but good practice): If `char` is not 'a', 'b', or 'c', print \"NO\" and terminate (though the problem guarantees only these characters).\n\n3.  **Final Checks**: After processing all characters in `S`:\n    *   Check `n_a >= 1`, `n_b >= 1`, and `n_c >= 1`. If any of these are false, print \"NO\".\n    *   Check if `n_c == n_a` OR `n_c == n_b`. If this condition is met, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`S = \"aaabccc\"`):**\n\n1.  `n_a=0, n_b=0, n_c=0`, `current_phase=0`.\n2.  `'a'`: `n_a=1`, `current_phase=0`.\n3.  `'a'`: `n_a=2`, `current_phase=0`.\n4.  `'a'`: `n_a=3`, `current_phase=0`.\n5.  `'b'`: `current_phase` becomes `1`. `n_b=1`.\n6.  `'c'`: `current_phase` becomes `2`. `n_c=1`.\n7.  `'c'`: `n_c=2`, `current_phase=2`.\n8.  `'c'`: `n_c=3`, `current_phase=2`.\n9.  End of string.\n    *   `n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3`.\n    *   `n_a >= 1` (True), `n_b >= 1` (True), `n_c >= 1` (True).\n    *   `n_c == n_a` (3 == 3) is True.\n    *   Print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(|S|) because it iterates through the string once, and a space complexity of O(1) for the counters and state variable, which is efficient enough for `|S| <= 5000`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input string from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace.\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Initialize counters for 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters.\n    n_a = 0\n    n_b = 0\n    n_c = 0\n\n    # Initialize the current phase of string parsing.\n    # 0: Expecting 'a's.
