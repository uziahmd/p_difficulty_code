Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Solution to Substitutes in Number**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, and here's my thought process: The core issue is that directly substituting strings can blow up the initial string `s` exponentially, making it impractical. Instead, I need to track the *impact* of each digit replacement.\n\nEach digit will eventually be replaced by *some* numeric value, so I'll keep `val[digit]` to represent this value modulo 1000000007 (MOD).  The other thing is, the length of the *new* digit has to affect the powers of 10. So I’ll keep `len[digit]` which is the *length* of that digit when it transforms after queries, and it needs to be modulo 1000000006 (MOD-1) because that's what governs the powers of 10.\n\nNow, if I naively process queries from first to last, it will be hard. Each query modifies the definitions for all digits, which makes things complicated. Processing in reverse is the key!  When processing \"di -> ti\", all later queries have already happened, so I am *defining* `di` at that point. Thus the order I perform the substitution is the key to managing this problem.\n\nFor a query \"di -> ti\", I’ll go through `ti` from right to left (because that's the correct order when building the decimal number). I build a running value (`new_val_di`) for what `di` now becomes, and a running length (`new_len_di`). I'll need to do some modular exponentiation here to get the correct powers of 10. The length needs to be calculated Modulo (MOD - 1) for the exponent.\n\nAfter processing all the queries (backwards), I need to calculate the *final* numeric value of `s`. Again, I'll go through `s` from right to left. For each digit `c` in the initial string, I multiply the `val[c]` value by the appropriate power of 10 (which I'll track with `current_power_of_10`) and add it to a running `final_ans`.\n\nI've got to be careful with empty strings (\"\"). When a digit maps to \"\", it means this digit contributes nothing. My code naturally handles this: I can initialize `val` and `len` appropriately, and the logic in the main loop will take this into account.\n\nAfter reviewing the example and doing a trace, and looking at the time constraints and the constraints on the input I’ve made sure the logic is correct and the code should be very efficient. I believe I have it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string replacements on an initial digit string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct simulation infeasible.\n\nThe core idea to solve this type of problem is to process the queries in reverse order. This is because each query \"di -> ti\" defines how a digit `di` is transformed. When we process a query `di -> ti` in reverse, we are determining the final transformation for `di` assuming all subsequent queries (which we've already processed) have established the final transformations for the digits within `ti`.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007` be the modulus for the final answer.\nLet `MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`. This is used for exponents in powers of 10, based on Fermat's Little Theorem (`a^(p-1) % p = 1` for prime `p` and `a % p != 0`). Specifically, `10^L % MOD = 10^(L % (MOD-1)) % MOD`.\n\nWe maintain two arrays (or dictionaries) for each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numeric value of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD_EXP`.\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself.\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries (in reverse order):**\nWe iterate through the queries from the last one to the first one. For each query `di -> ti`:\n1.  We need to calculate the `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` that `di` will represent based on `ti`.\n2.  Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n3.  Iterate through the characters `c` in `ti` from **right to left**. This is crucial for correctly accumulating the value and length.\n    *   For each `c` (which is a digit):\n        *   `new_val_di = (val[c] * pow(10, new_len_di, MOD) + new_val_di) % MOD`\n            *   `val[c]` is the value of the string `c` transforms into.\n            *   `pow(10, new_len_di, MOD)` shifts `val[c]` to the left by `new_len_di` positions, where `new_len_di` is the accumulated length of all digits to the right of `c` in `ti`.\n        *   `new_len_di = (length[c] + new_len_di) % MOD_EXP`\n            *   `length[c]` is the length of the string `c` transforms into.\n            *   We add this to `new_len_di` to get the new total length of the substring processed so far.\n4.  After processing all characters in `ti`, update `val[di] = new_val_di` and `length[di] = new_len_di`.\n    *   If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` will remain `0` and `new_len_di` will remain `0`, which correctly represents an empty string.\n\n**Final Calculation (on initial string `s`):**\nAfter all queries are processed, `val[d]` and `length[d]` hold the final transformation values and lengths for each digit `d`. Now, we apply these to the initial string `s`.\n1.  Initialize `final_ans = 0` and `current_power_of_10 = 1` (representing `10^0`).\n2.  Iterate through the characters `c` in the initial string `s` from **right to left**.\n    *   For each `c` (which is a digit):\n        *   `final_ans = (final_ans + val[c] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`\n            *   `val[c]` is the value of the string `c` transforms into.\n            *   `current_power_of_10` is the accumulated power of 10 from all digits to the right of `c` in `s`.\n        *   `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[c], MOD)) % MOD`\n            *   Update `current_power_of_10` by multiplying it with `10` raised to the power of `length[c]`. This prepares it for the next digit to the left.\n\nThe `final_ans` will be the remainder of the total number by `MOD`. This approach naturally handles leading zeros (e.g., \"007\" becomes 7) and empty strings (value 0).\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Initialization: O(1) for 10 digits.\n    *   Processing queries: `N` queries. Each query involves iterating through `ti`. The sum of lengths of all `ti` strings is `N_ti`. Each character in `ti` involves a `pow` operation, which takes `O(log MOD)` time. So, `O(N_ti * log MOD)`.\n    *   Final calculation: Iterating through the initial string `s` of length `|s|`. Each character involves a `pow` operation. So, `O(|s| * log MOD)`.\n    *   Total time: `O((N_ti + |s|) * log MOD)`. Given `N_ti <= 10^5` and `|s| <= 10^5`, this is approximately `(10^5 + 10^5) * log(10^9) = 2 * 10^5 * 30 = 6 * 10^6` operations, which is efficient enough.\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `val`, `length` arrays: O(1).\n    *   Storing queries: `O(N_ti)` for all `ti` strings and `O(N)` for `di` characters.\n    *   Storing initial `s`: `O(|s|)`.\n    *   Total space: `O(N_ti + |s|)`. Given constraints, this is `O(10^5)`, which is well within memory limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 1000000007\nMOD_EXP = 1000000006 # For exponents in powers of 10 (Fermat's Little Theorem)\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit (0-9)\n    # val[d]: numeric value of the string d eventually becomes (modulo MOD)\n    # length[d]: length of the string d eventually becomes (modulo MOD_EXP)\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order to correctly propagate transformations\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_char, ti_str = queries[i]\n        di = int(di_char)\n\n        current_val_for_ti = 0\n        current_len_for_ti = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through ti_str from right to left to correctly combine values and lengths\n        for char_t in reversed(ti_str):\n            t_digit = int(char_t)\n            \n            # Add the value of the current digit's transformation, shifted by the length\n            # accumulated from digits to its right.\n            current_val_for_ti = (val[t_digit] * pow(10, current_len_for_ti, MOD) + current_val_for_ti) % MOD\n            \n            # Accumulate the length of the current digit's transformation\n            current_len_for_ti = (length[t_digit] + current_len_for_ti) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        # Update val and length for di based on the processed ti_str\n        val[di] = current_val_for_ti\n        length[di] = current_len_for_ti\n        \n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    current_power_of_10 = 1 # Represents 10^0, then 10^(len of last char), etc.\n\n    # Iterate through initial string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        s_digit = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Add the value of the current digit's transformation, shifted by current_power_of_10\n        final_ans = (final_ans + val[s_digit] * current_power_of_10) % MOD\n        \n        # Update current_power_of_10 for the next (left) digit\n        # It needs to be multiplied by 10^(length of current digit's transformation)\n        current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[s_digit], MOD)) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
