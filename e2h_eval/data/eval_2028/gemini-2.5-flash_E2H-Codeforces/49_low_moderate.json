They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment: Mushroom Strife Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem, and it's a classic graph-based constraint problem. The gist is, we've got these lawns (vertices) connected by roads (edges), and each road has GCD and LCM constraints on the number of mushrooms on the connected lawns. My goal is to craft a Python script to determine *any* valid mushroom assignments or signal that no such arrangement exists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Let's say two lawns connected by a road have 'a' and 'b' mushrooms. We are given the GCD (g) and LCM (l) of 'a' and 'b'. The core relationship here is `a * b = g * l`. From this, and the definitions of GCD and LCM, I can deduce that `a` and `b` must be multiples of `g`.  If I express `a` as `g * x` and `b` as `g * y`, then `x * y = l / g`. Also, crucial constraint:  `GCD(x, y)` has to be 1.  This is key, meaning x and y must be coprime factors.  \n\nSo, for any edge:\n1. `l % g != 0` means no solution exists.  Immediate check.\n2. We compute `P = l / g`.\n3.  We need to find a coprime factor pair `(x, y)` whose product is `P`.  \n4.  Then the values of `a` and `b` are derived `a = g * x` and `b = g * y`.\n5.  Also, these values cannot exceed 10^6 (the upper bound).\n\nFrom a graph perspective, each vertex `i` needs a value `V[i]`.  Each edge `(u, v)` enforces constraints on `V[u]` and `V[v]` based on the edge's `g` and `l`.  It's clear that if `l` isn't divisible by `g`, the whole thing is shot.\n\nThis screams constraint satisfaction. I think the plan is to systematically try and assign values to each lawn while ensuring these constraints are met. My primary concern will be handling the coprime factor pairs efficiently. If `P` is large, finding those coprime factors can become computationally expensive, and I will need to think about optimizations.  The fact that all mushroom values are bounded to a million helps, but how do I pick an initial value for any given vertex, considering constraints are defined in terms of relationships between the vertices? The graph structure can be exploited.  Maybe I can propagate values based on connected edge constraints.\n",
