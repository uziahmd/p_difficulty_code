You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Plan for Tackling Odd Cycles**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to find the fewest edges ('t') I need to add to a graph so I can create a simple, odd-length cycle, and figure out how many ways ('w') I can do that.  Here's my thought process:\n\n**First Check: Is there an odd cycle already?**\n\nThe first thing I'll do is check if the given graph already has an odd cycle. If it does, then t=0.  I can quickly check for an odd cycle by trying to color the graph with two colors (bipartite coloring). If I can successfully color all the connected components without any edges connecting two vertices of the same color *within the same component*, then there is no odd cycle. If I hit a color conflict during this two-coloring, I've got an odd cycle and t = 0 (and w = 1).\n\n**If Not, and the Graph is Bipartite**\n\nIf the graph is bipartite (no odd cycle), I need to add at least one edge (t >= 1). To create an odd cycle, I must add an edge *within* the same connected component, connecting two vertices of the same color. This guarantees an odd-length cycle.\n\nTo figure out how many ways (w) I can do this, I'll:\n\n1.  Do a two-coloring of each connected component.\n2.  Count the vertices of each color within a component (let's say `s0` and `s1`).\n3.  Calculate the number of ways to add an edge between two vertices of the same color within that component: (`s0 * (s0 - 1) / 2`) + (`s1 * (s1 - 1) / 2`). This is the number of ways, adding one edge, that forms an odd cycle.\n4.  Sum this count across *all* connected components.  That's my `w` for t=1.\n\nIf, after this, `w > 0`, that means I *can* create an odd cycle by adding just one edge, and t = 1.\n\n**What If `t=1` Doesn't Work?**\n\nIf the number of ways to add one edge in `w` is zero, meaning that `t = 1` isn't enough, it means all my connected components are simple: either isolated vertices or single edges.\n\n**t = 2 Considerations**\n\n*   If all components are isolated vertices, I'll need to connect three vertices to form a triangle and achieve an odd cycle.  In this case, t=3, and I must calculate the number of ways to pick three vertices from the graph.\n*   If each component is a single edge, I'm faced with a new challenge. I have edges but need to combine them to get an odd cycle. It looks like I need to pick two of them to add at least two edges. So t=2.\n    *   To make the cycle odd, the new edges I add have to create a triangle by connecting to existing edges.\n\nLet's carefully consider:\n\nIf I have an isolated vertex *and* an existing edge, adding two edges can make a triangle. The ways = number of edges * number of isolated vertices.\n\nIf I have *only* isolated vertices, then I need at least three. t=3, ways = n choose 3.\n\n**Summary of the Cases**\n\n1.  **Odd Cycle Already Present (t=0):** Do two-coloring. If a conflict arises, t=0, w=1, end.\n2.  **Bipartite, t=1 possible:** (t=1): For each component, sum up: (number of vertices color 0 choose 2) + (number of vertices color 1 choose 2). If sum > 0, t=1, w is the sum, end.\n3.  **Bipartite, t=1 not possible:** (`w = 0` from t=1 calculations):\n    *   Find the number of isolated vertices (`N_iso`) and edges (`N_edge`).\n    *   If `N_iso >= 1` and `N_edge >= 1`, t=2 and ways = `N_iso * N_edge`.\n    *   If `N_edge >= 2`, t=2, the total ways = C(N_edge, 2) * 4.\n    *   If all components are single vertices, t=3, w = n choose 3.\n4.  For all other combinations, I need to add more edges, so t>=3.\n5.  If n < 3, which is the cases",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` the number of ways to do so. A simple cycle means each vertex occurs at most once. The cycle must consist of more than one vertex, implying a length of at least 3 for an odd cycle.\n\nThe core concept for odd cycles is bipartiteness. A graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite.\n\nWe can categorize the solution based on the minimum number of edges `t` to add:\n\n**Step 1: Check for `t = 0` (Odd cycle already exists)**\nWe attempt to 2-color the graph using BFS or DFS.\nFor each connected component:\n1.  Pick an unvisited vertex, assign it color 0.\n2.  Perform a BFS/DFS from this vertex, assigning its neighbors color 1, their neighbors color 0, and so on.\n3.  If we encounter an edge `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` already have the same color, an odd cycle exists in the original graph.\nIf an odd cycle is found anywhere in the graph, then `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's only one way to add 0 edges). We print `0 1` and terminate.\n\n**Step 2: Check for `t = 1` (Graph is bipartite, add one edge)**\nIf no odd cycle was found in Step 1, the graph is bipartite. We have successfully 2-colored all connected components.\nTo form an odd cycle by adding one edge `(u, v)`, `u` and `v` must be in the same connected component and must have the same color. Adding such an edge `(u, v)` creates a cycle: `u` to `v` via an existing path (which must be of even length in a bipartite graph if `u` and `v` have the same color), plus the new edge `(u, v)` (length 1). The total length is even + 1 = odd.\nThe number of ways `w1` to do this is the sum, over all connected components, of `C(|V_0|, 2) + C(|V_1|, 2)`, where `|V_0|` and `|V_1|` are the counts of vertices in the two partition sets of that component. `C(k, 2) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nIf `w1 > 0`, it means `t = 1`. We print `1 w1` and terminate.\n\n**Step 3: Check for `t = 2` (Graph is bipartite, `t=1` not possible, add two edges)**\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means for every connected component, `|V_0| <= 1` and `|V_1| <= 1`. This implies that every connected component is either an isolated vertex or a single edge.\nLet `N_iso` be the count of isolated vertices.\nLet `N_edge` be the count of connected components that are single edges.\n\nThere are two primary ways to form an odd cycle with two added edges:\n*   **Scenario 1: Connect an isolated vertex to an existing edge.**\n    Pick an isolated vertex `u` and an existing edge `v-x`. Add edges `(u, v)` and `(u, x)`. This forms a triangle `u-v-x-u`. The existing edge `v-x` has length 1. The path `v-u-x` has length 2 (new edges). The total cycle length is 1 + 2 = 3 (odd).\n    The number of ways for this scenario is `N_iso * N_edge`. This is possible if `N_iso >= 1` and `N_edge >= 1`.\n*   **Scenario 2: Connect two existing edges.**\n    Pick two distinct existing edges `e1=(u1, v1)` and `e2=(u2, v2)`. Assume `u1, u2` are color 0 and `v1, v2` are color 1 (WLOG, by consistent 2-coloring). Add edges `(u1, u2)` and `(u2, v1)`. This forms a triangle `u1-v1-u2-u1`. The existing edge `u1-v1` has length 1. The path `u1-u2-v1` has length 2 (new edges). The total cycle length is 1 + 2 = 3 (odd).\n    There are `C(N_edge, 2)` ways to choose two distinct edges. For each pair `(u1, v1)` and `(u2, v2)`, we can choose `u1` or `v1` from the first edge, and `u2` or `v2` from the second edge, to form the \"middle\" vertex of the path. Let's say we pick `u1` and `u2`. We can add `(u1,u2)` and `(u2,v1)` (cycle `u1-v1-u2-u1`). Or `(u1,u2)` and `(u2,v2)` (cycle `u1-v1-u2-v2-u1` is even). We can also pick `u1` and `v2`. We can add `(u1,v2)` and `(v2,v1)` (cycle `u1-v1-v2-u1` is odd).\n    A simpler way to count: Pick two distinct edges `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`. (a,c are color 0, b,d are color 1). The 4 ways to form a triangle are:\n    1.  Add `(a,c)` and `(c,b)` to existing `(a,b)`. Cycle `a-b-c-a`.\n    2.  Add `(a,d)` and `(d,b)` to existing `(a,b)`. Cycle `a-b-d-a`.\n    3.  Add `(b,c)` and `(c,a)` to existing `(c,d)`. Cycle `b-a-c-b`. (This is symmetric to 1).\n    4.  Add `(b,d)` and `(d,a)` to existing `(c,d)`. Cycle `b-a-d-b`. (This is symmetric to 2).\n    So, for each pair of edges, there are 4 ways. The total ways are `C(N_edge, 2) * 4`. This is possible if `N_edge >= 2`.\n\n`w2` is the sum of ways from these scenarios. Note that these scenarios are mutually exclusive based on the counts `N_iso` and `N_edge`.\nIf `N_iso >= 1` and `N_edge >= 1`, then `w2 = N_iso * N_edge`.\nElse if `N_iso == 0` and `N_edge >= 2`, then `w2 = N_edge * (N_edge - 1) // 2 * 4`.\nIf `w2 > 0`, it means `t = 2`. We print `2 w2` and terminate.\n\n**Step 4: Check for `t = 3` (Graph is bipartite, `t=1, t=2` not possible, add three edges)**\nIf `t=2` is not possible, it implies:\n*   Either `N_iso = n` (all vertices are isolated, `m=0`).\n*   Or `N_iso = 0` and `N_edge < 2` (i.e., `N_edge = 0` or `N_edge = 1`).\n    *   `N_edge = 0` implies `N_iso = n`, which is the first case.\n    *   `N_edge = 1` implies `n=2` and one edge. In this case, `N_iso=0`.\n\nIf `N_iso = n` (all `n` vertices are isolated):\nWe need to pick 3 distinct vertices `u, v, x` and add edges `(u, v), (v, x), (x, u)` to form a triangle. This requires `t=3` edges.\nThe number of ways `w3 = C(n, 3) = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. This is possible if `n >= 3`.\nIf `n < 3`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle. The problem doesn't specify output for this. Assuming `n >= 3` for this case.\n\nIf `N_iso = 0` and `N_edge = 1` (i.e., `n=2`, one edge `u-v`):\nIt's impossible to form an odd cycle with 3 vertices. We need a third vertex.\nThis specific case means `n=2`, `m=1`. We can't form an odd cycle.\nThe problem statement implies a solution always exists. If `n < 3`, no odd cycle can be formed.\n\nGiven the constraints `1 <= n <= 10^5`, if `n < 3`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle.\nThe problem implies a solution always exists.\nThe problem statement \"consisting of more than one vertex\" means length >= 3 for an odd cycle.\nIf `n=1`, `m=0`: `N_iso=1`, `N_edge=0`. `w1=0, w2=0`. `w3=0`.\nIf `n=2`, `m=0`: `N_iso=2`, `N_edge=0`. `w1=0, w2=0`. `w3=0`.\nIf `n=2`, `m=1` (`1-2`): `N_iso=0`, `N_edge=1`. `w1=0, w2=0`. `w3=0`.\nIn these cases, the logic for `t=3` would yield `w3=0`.\nThe problem implies a solution *must* be found. This suggests that `n` will be at least 3 in cases where `t=3` is the answer.\n\nFinal check on `t=3` logic:\nIf `t=0, t=1, t=2` are not possible, it means we are in one of these scenarios:\n1.  All `n` vertices are isolated (`m=0`). `N_iso = n, N_edge = 0`.\n    We need to pick 3 vertices and add 3 edges. `t=3`. `w = C(n, 3)`.\n2.  `N_iso = 0` and `N_edge = 1`. (`n=2, m=1`).\n    This case is impossible to form an odd cycle. `n` must be at least 3.\n    This implies that if `n=2, m=1`, the problem's constraints are not met for forming an odd cycle. This should not happen for a competitive programming problem usually.\n    Let's assume `n >= 3` for `t=3` to be possible.\n\nSo, if `t=0, t=1, t=2` are not possible, it must be that `N_iso = n` (all isolated vertices) and `n >= 3`.\nThen `t = 3`, `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.\n\n**Example 1: 4 4, edges (1,2), (1,3), (4,2), (4,3)**\n1.  2-coloring:\n    Start BFS from 1, color 0.\n    1 (0) -> 2 (1), 3 (1)\n    2 (1) -> 1 (0, ok), 4 (0)\n    3 (1) -> 1 (0, ok), 4 (0)\n    4 (0) -> 2 (1, ok), 3 (1, ok)\n    All vertices colored without conflict.
