Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. The goal is to write a Python script that reads input, processes it, and prints the output. Specifically, we need to count sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a growing string `S`, appending '0' or '1' characters and reporting the count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nBreaking down the problem, the first step is to recognize the Morse code representation of English letters. We have 30 possible strings (2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4) of length 1 to 4 characters, and 26 of them correspond to English letters. The remaining four strings are invalid.\n\nWe need to consider all non-empty substrings of the growing string `S`. For each substring, the core is to find all possible *sequences* of English letters it can represent.\n\nFor example, given `S = \"111\"`, substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". \"1\" maps to 'T', \"11\" maps to 'M', and \"111\" maps to 'O'. \"11\" can form the sequence \"TT\" as well, and \"111\" could be \"TM\", \"MT\", or \"TTT\". This sounds like it will require dynamic programming or string processing techniques.\n\n**Initial Approach and Refinements**\n\nAn initial thought is to let `dp[i]` represent the number of sequences for the prefix `S[0...i-1]`. But this quickly seems problematic because we need to consider all substrings, not just prefixes. \n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, we're dealing with substrings ending at that character. These are substrings of lengths 1 to `len(S')`. Let `valid_codes` be the set of valid Morse codes (30 total - the 4 invalid strings), and let `f(T)` represent the number of distinct sequences a string `T` can represent. The challenge lies in counting *distinct* sequences.\n\nUsing dynamic programming, we let `g[k]` represent the number of sequences for `T[k:]`. The base case is when we reach the end of the substring (`k=len(T)`), where `g[len(T)] = 0` (empty substring, representing no sequence) and it needs to be non-empty sequences. We then iterate backward, checking valid substrings (length 1-4) starting at position `k`.\n\nHowever, initial implementations will over count sequences. Counting \"11\" as \"M\" or \"TT\" is simple, but as `T` gets longer, we have multiple combinations that are generated.\n\n**Dynamic Programming and Optimization**\n\nI realize this is the dynamic programming, but still trying to avoid sets and trying to figure out how to count distinct sequences efficiently. I then had the idea to use a `set` to store sequences, but the complexity of set operations would become too slow.\n\nRereading the problem, I noticed the phrasing: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some* substring of S.\" It's critical whether we need the union of all sequences from the substrings of `S` or the sum. I'll need to figure out which is correct based on the problem wording. It seems that \"number of non-empty sequences\" implies the union. If it implies summing the count of sequences, it is more straightforward.\n\nIf we need the union, the complexity will be high because we need to construct all the possible sequences from all the substrings. We can represent sequences as tuples and store it in a set, but this seems too slow.\n\nIf the answer is indeed the sum of `count_sequences(sub)` for all substrings `sub`, it's simpler because we can sum them up as we calculate them. I have rechecked the example, and the sum of `count_sequences(substring)` turns out to be equal to the total count of distinct sequences. This suggests the *correct interpretation* might be simply to sum the sequence counts for each substring. This opens the door to an efficient `O(m^3)` DP solution.\n\nTo optimize the algorithm, let `dp_suffix[k]` be `count_sequences(S[k:])`, where `S` is the current string of length `N`. When we append a new character, let's efficiently compute `count_sequences(S[k:N])` from `k=0 to N-1`.\n\n**Final DP Implementation**\n\nFor each new character appended, initialize `current_append_sum = 0`. For all previous substrings ending at index `i`, we compute the count. Then, we can calculate `count_sequences(S[k:N])`",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate, after each character is appended to a string `S`, the total number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by *any* substring of `S`. We need to output this count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the interpretation of \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". The example provided (\"111\" -> 7 sequences) strongly suggests that we should sum the number of distinct sequences formed by each substring independently. That is, if `count_sequences(T)` is the number of distinct sequences of letters formed by string `T`, and `Substrings(S)` is the set of all unique substrings of `S`, then the answer is `sum_{T in Substrings(S)} count_sequences(T)`. Note that distinct substrings `T1` and `T2` might produce the same letter sequence (e.g., \"1\" -> 'T', \"01\" -> 'A', but if `S=\"101\"`, \"1\" (first char) and \"1\" (last char) both produce 'T'). However, the problem statement and example imply that we should count these as separate contributions if they come from distinct substrings. For example, if `S = \"11\"`, substrings are \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), and \"11\" (at index 0).\n`count_sequences(\"1\")` from `S[0:1]` is \"T\" (1 sequence).\n`count_sequences(\"1\")` from `S[1:2]` is \"T\" (1 sequence).\n`count_sequences(\"11\")` from `S[0:2]` is \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences).\nTotal would be `1+1+2 = 4`.\nThe example for \"111\" yields 7. Substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\n`count_sequences(\"1\")` = 1 (\"T\")\n`count_sequences(\"11\")` = 2 (\"M\", \"TT\")\n`count_sequences(\"111\")` = 4 (\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\")\nSum = 1+2+4 = 7.\nThis implies `sum_{sub in all_substrings_of_S} count_sequences(sub)`.\nThis simplifies the problem greatly, as we don't need to deal with sets of sequences or hashes.\n\nLet `S` be the current string. When a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S + c`. Let the new length be `N`.\nThe total answer for `S` of length `N` is `(answer for S of length N-1) + (sum of count_sequences(T) for all substrings T that *end* at index N-1)`.\nThe substrings ending at index `N-1` are `S[N-1:N]`, `S[N-2:N]`, ..., `S[0:N]`.\nLet `current_string = S[0...N-1]`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{j=0}^{N-1} count_sequences(current_string[j:N])`.\n\nLet's define `count_sequences(T)` for a given string `T`.\nThis can be computed using dynamic programming. Let `dp[k]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by `T[k:]`.\nThe base case is `dp[len(T)] = 0` (an empty string cannot represent a non-empty sequence).\nFor `k` from `len(T)-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = 0`\n  For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k+l <= len(T)` and `T[k:k+l]` corresponds to an English letter:\n      If `k+l == len(T)` (the entire suffix `T[k:]` forms a single letter):\n        `dp[k] = (dp[k] + 1) % MOD`\n      Else (the suffix `T[k:k+l]` forms a letter, followed by sequences from `T[k+l:]`):\n        `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n`dp[0]` will be `count_sequences(T)`.\n\nThe length of `S` can be up to `m = 3000`.\nA naive calculation of `sum_{j=0}^{N-1} count_sequences(current_string[j:N])` would involve `N` calls to `count_sequences`, each taking `O(N)` time. This leads to `O(N^2)` for each append, and `O(m^3)` total, which is too slow for `m=3000`.\n\nWe need a more efficient way to calculate `sum_{j=0}^{N-1} count_sequences(current_string[j:N])`.\nLet `S_N` be the string `S` after `N` appends.\nLet `f(k)` be `count_sequences(S_N[k:N])`.\nWe need `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(k)`.\nNotice that `f(k)` depends on `f(k+1), f(k+2), f(k+3), f(k+4)`.\nThis structure allows us to compute all `f(k)` values for `k = N-1, N-2, ..., 0` in `O(N * 4) = O(N)` time.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Initialize `total_ans = 0`.\n2.  Store `S` as a list of characters (or a string). Let `current_S = []`.\n3.  Precompute the set of valid Morse codes. These are all `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` strings of length 1-4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n    `valid_codes = {\"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\"}`. (26 codes)\n4.  For each of the `m` input characters:\n    a.  Append the new character `c` to `current_S`. Let `N` be the new length of `current_S`.\n    b.  Create a DP array `dp` of size `N+1`, initialized to 0. `dp[N] = 0`.\n    c.  Initialize `current_append_sum = 0`. This will store `sum_{j=0}^{N-1} count_sequences(current_S[j:N])`.\n    d.  Iterate `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        i.  `dp[k] = 0`\n        ii. For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `k+l <= N`:\n                Extract substring `sub = \"\".join(current_S[k:k+l])`.\n                If `sub` is in `valid_codes`:\n                    `val = 1` if `k+l == N` else `dp[k+l]`\n                    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + val) % MOD`\n        iii. `current_append_sum = (current_append_sum + dp[k]) % MOD`\n    e.  `total_ans = (total_ans + current_append_sum) % MOD`\n    f.  Print `total_ans`.\n\nThe time complexity for each append operation is `O(N * 4)`, where `N` is the current length of `S`. Since `N` goes from `1` to `m`, the total time complexity is `sum_{N=1 to m} O(N) = O(m^2)`.\nGiven `m <= 3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`, which is well within typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).\nSpace complexity is `O(m)` for storing `current_S` and `dp` array.\n\nExample walkthrough: `S` is \"1\", then \"11\", then \"111\".\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n\n**1.

Wait, example output is 3. What went wrong?\n   Ah, the example output is `1, 3, 7`.\n   My calculation `total_ans = (ans_prev + current_append_sum)` is correct if `current_append_sum` is `sum_{j=0}^{N-1} count_sequences(S_new[j:N])`.\n   For `S = \"1\"`: `count_sequences(\"1\") = 1`. Total = 1.\n   For `S = \"11\"`: `ans_prev = 1`. New substrings ending at index 1: `S[1:2]=\"1\"`, `S[0:2]=\"11\"`.\n     `count_sequences(\"1\") = 1`.\n     `count_sequences(\"11\") = 2` (\"M\", \"TT\").\n     `current_append_sum = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n     `total_ans = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n   The example output `1, 3, 7` implies that `total_ans` is `sum_{sub in Substrings(S)} count_sequences(sub)`.\n   For `S = \"1\"`, substrings: {\"1\"}. `count_sequences(\"1\") = 1`. Total = 1.\n   For `S = \"11\"`, substrings: {\"1\" (from S[0:1]), \"1\" (from S[1:2]), \"11\" (from S[0:2])}.\n     `count_sequences(S[0:1]) = 1`.\n     `count_sequences(S[1:2]) = 1`.\n     `count_sequences(S[0:2]) = 2`.\n     Total = `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.\n   The example output `3` for \"11\" is `count_sequences(\"1\") + count_sequences(\"11\")` if \"1\" is only counted once for substring \"1\". This is the sum of `count_sequences(T)` for *unique* substrings `T`.\n   The problem statement: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". This phrasing usually implies `|Union_{sub in Substrings(S)} {sequences(sub)}|`.\n   However, the example output `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"1\"`, `S=\"11\"`, `S=\"111\"` is `sum_{k=1..N} count_sequences(S[0:k])`.\n   For `S=\"1\"`: `count_sequences(\"1\") = 1`. Total = 1.\n   For `S=\"11\"`: `count_sequences(\"1\") + count_sequences(\"11\") = 1 + 2 = 3`. Total = 3.\n   For `S=\"111\"`: `count_sequences(\"1\") + count_sequences(\"11\") + count_sequences(\"111\") = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. Total = 7.\n   This is the most plausible interpretation that matches the example output.\n   So, we need to calculate `sum_{k=1}^{N} count_sequences(S[0:k])`.\n   Let `ans[N]` be this sum.\n   `ans[N] = ans[N-1] + count_sequences(S[0:N])`.\n   This means for each append, we only need to calculate `count_sequences(S[0:N])` (the *entire* current string as a prefix).\n   This is `O(N)` for each append. Total `O(m^2)`. This is consistent.\n\nRevised Algorithm:\n1.  Initialize `total_ans = 0`.\n2.  Store `S` as a list of characters. `current_S = []`.\n3.  Precompute `valid_codes` set as before.\n4.  For each of the `m` input characters:\n    a.  Append the new character `c` to `current_S`. Let `N` be the new length of `current_S`.\n    b.  Calculate `count_sequences(current_S)`:\n        i.  Create a DP array `dp` of size `N+1`, initialized to 0. `dp[N] = 0`.\n        ii. For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n            `dp[k] = 0`\n            For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n                If `k+l <= N`:\n                    Extract substring `sub = \"\".join(current_S[k:k+l])`.\n                    If `sub` is in `valid_codes`:\n                        `val = 1` if `k+l == N` else `dp[k+l]`\n                        `dp[k] = (dp[k] + val) % MOD`\n        iii. Let `sequences_for_current_S = dp[0]`.\n    c.  `total_ans = (total_ans + sequences_for_current_S) % MOD`.\n    d.
