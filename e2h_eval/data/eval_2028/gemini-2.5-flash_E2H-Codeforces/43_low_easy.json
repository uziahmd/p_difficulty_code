He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing String Formation Logic**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a string validation problem. The core idea is to determine if an input string, let's call it `S`, conforms to a specific pattern. My thought process is to break down the rules governing this pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structural constraints. The valid string is constructed in three distinct steps: 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. There has to be at least one of each character.\n\n*   **'a' Phase:** The string starts with a sequence of 'a's. Let's denote the count of 'a's as `count_a`.\n*   **'b' Phase:** After the 'a's, there's a sequence of 'b's. This count is `count_b`. Importantly, we're guaranteed to have at least one 'b'.\n*   **'c' Phase:** Finally, we have a sequence of 'c's. The count here, `count_c`, is the critical element.  It *must* equal either `count_a` or `count_b` (or potentially both, that's fine).\n\nSo the overall structure is: `aaaa...bbbb...cccc...`.\n\nThe conditions for a valid string are:\n\n1.  `count_a >= 1`\n2.  `count_b >= 1`\n3.  `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`\n\nNow, let's analyze the input string `S` to verify if it is valid.\n\nMy strategy is to look at the character ordering.  The sequence of `a`s has to appear before `b`s which has to appear before `c`s. No character can appear out of sequence. To achieve this, I can scan the string from left to right. I'm going to track the transitions from one state to another, using states to represent which characters are permissible at a given point.\n\nI'll use these states:\n\n*   **State 0:** Expecting 'a's only.\n*   **State 1:** Expecting 'b's, but only *after* at least one 'a'.\n*   **State 2:** Expecting 'c's, after at least one 'b'.\n\nI will keep three counters: `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c`.\n\nMy algorithm will initialize all the counts to 0 and start in state 0.\nThen, I will iterate through `S` character by character.\nIf a character doesn't follow the state's rules, I'll flag the string as invalid. If I encounter 'a', 'b', or 'c' in the expected order, then I increment the corresponding counter.\nThis approach will allow me to efficiently validate the string's structure and counts.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules. Let's break down these rules and then devise a checking mechanism.\n\n**Rules for String Formation:**\n\n1.  **A's turn**: A starts with a string consisting of some number of lowercase 'a's. Let this number be `count_a`. It must be at least one (`count_a >= 1`).\n    *   String: `aaaa...`\n\n2.  **B's turn**: B appends some number of lowercase 'b's to the end. Let this number be `count_b`. It must be at least one (`count_b >= 1`). At this point, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b', which is guaranteed by `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`.\n    *   String: `aaaa...bbbb...`\n\n3.  **C's turn**: C appends some number of lowercase 'c's to the end. Let this number be `count_c`. The crucial condition is that `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`. It can also be equal to both.\n    *   String: `aaaa...bbbb...cccc...`\n\n**Summary of Conditions for a Valid String:**\n\n1.  **Order of characters**: The string must consist of all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, followed by all 'c's. There should be no 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b' after a 'c'.\n2.  **Minimum counts**: There must be at least one 'a' (`count_a >= 1`), at least one 'b' (`count_b >= 1`), and at least one 'c' (`count_c >= 1`). The `count_c >= 1` is implicitly covered by the next condition, as `count_a` and `count_b` are both at least 1.\n3.  **C's rule**: The number of 'c's (`count_c`) must be equal to the number of 'a's (`count_a`) OR equal to the number of 'b's (`count_b`). That is, `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can iterate through the input string `S` once to check both the character order and count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n1.  Initialize `count_a = 0`, `count_b = 0`, `count_c = 0`.\n2.  Initialize a `state` variable to keep track of which character type we are currently expecting.\n    *   `state = 0`: Expecting 'a's.\n    *   `state = 1`: Expecting 'b's (after seeing at least one 'a').\n    *   `state = 2`: Expecting 'c's (after seeing at least one 'b').\n\n3.  Iterate through each character `char` in `S`:\n    *   If `char == 'a'`:\n        *   If `state == 0`: Increment `count_a`.\n        *   If `state == 1` or `state == 2`: This is an 'a' appearing after 'b's or 'c's, which violates the order. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n    *   If `char == 'b'`:\n        *   If `state == 0`: Transition to `state = 1`. Increment `count_b`.\n        *   If `state == 1`: Increment `count_b`.\n        *   If `state == 2`: This is a 'b' appearing after 'c's, which violates the order. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n    *   If `char == 'c'`:\n        *   If `state == 0` or `state == 1`: Transition to `state = 2`. Increment `count_c`.\n        *   If `state == 2`: Increment `count_c`.\n\n4.  After iterating through the entire string, check the final conditions:\n    *   **Minimum counts**: `count_a` must be greater than 0, `count_b` must be greater than 0, and `count_c` must be greater than 0. If any of these are zero, print \"NO\".\n    *   **C's rule**: `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`. If this condition is not met, print \"NO\".\n\n5.  If all checks pass, print \"YES\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Input: `aaabccc`)**\n\n1.  Initialize `count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0`, `state=0`.\n2.  `S[0] = 'a'`: `state=0`, `count_a=1`.\n3.  `S[1] = 'a'`: `state=0`, `count_a=2`.\n4.  `S[2] = 'a'`: `state=0`, `count_a=3`.\n5.  `S[3] = 'b'`: `state=0`, transition to `state=1`, `count_b=1`.\n6.  `S[4] = 'c'`: `state=1`, transition to `state=2`, `count_c=1`.\n7.  `S[5] = 'c'`: `state=2`, `count_c=2`.\n8.  `S[6] = 'c'`: `state=2`, `count_c=3`.\n\nEnd of string. Final counts: `count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3`.\n\nCheck conditions:\n*   `count_a > 0` (3 > 0): True.\n*   `count_b > 0` (1 > 0): True.\n*   `count_c > 0` (3 > 0): True.\n*   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3): True. (The OR condition is satisfied).\n\nAll conditions met. Print \"YES\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Input: `bbacc`)**\n\n1.  Initialize `count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0`, `state=0`.\n2.  `S[0] = 'b'`: `state=0`, transition to `state=1`, `count_b=1`.\n3.  `S[1] = 'b'`: `state=1`, `count_b=2`.\n4.  `S[2] = 'a'`: Current `state=1`. An 'a' appeared after 'b's. This violates the order. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n    \n    # State machine:\n    # 0: Expecting 'a's\n    # 1: Expecting 'b's (after seeing at least one 'a')\n    # 2: Expecting 'c's (after seeing at least one 'b')\n    state = 0\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if state == 0:\n                count_a += 1\n            else:\n                # 'a' appeared after 'b's or 'c's, invalid order\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if state == 0:\n                # Transition from 'a's to 'b's\n                if count_a == 0: # Must have at least one 'a' before 'b's start\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                state = 1\n                count_b += 1\n            elif state == 1:\n                count_b += 1\n            else: # state == 2\n                # 'b' appeared after 'c's, invalid order\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'c':\n            if state == 0:\n                # 'c' appeared before any 'a's or 'b's, invalid order\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            elif state == 1:\n                # Transition from 'b's to 'c's\n                if count_b == 0: # Must have at least one 'b' before 'c's start\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                state = 2\n                count_c += 1\n            else: # state == 2\n                count_c += 1\n        else:\n            # String contains characters other than 'a', 'b', 'c' (problem statement guarantees only 'a', 'b', 'c', but good practice)\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    # After iterating through the entire string, check final conditions\n    \n    # 1.
