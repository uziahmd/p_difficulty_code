Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The New Year Candle Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and my mind's already racing. It's a classic: figuring out the total burn time of candles, given some initial candles and the ability to craft new ones from burnt-out ones.  Essentially, I need to translate this into a Python script.\n\n**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n\nThe crux of it is recognizing that the number of hours lit directly corresponds to the total number of candles burned.  We start with some new candles, *a*, and have the option to recycle *b* burnt-out stubs into one new candle.\n\n**Strategic Approach: A Greedy Algorithm**\n\nThe best strategy is clear: maximize burn time. Therefore, I need to burn candles as quickly as possible, and immediately recycle those stubs. This suggests a greedy algorithm where I prioritize burning new candles at every step because it offers immediate hours plus more stubs for future recycling.\n\n**Formalizing the Logic**\n\nTo track this, I'll use a few variables:\n*   `total_hours`: Keep a running count of the total burn time.\n*   `current_new_candles`: The new candles available at the present moment.\n*   `burnt_out_candles`: The accumulated burnt-out candles.\n\n**Simulation Steps in Detail:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** `total_hours` starts at zero, `current_new_candles` is initialized to *a*, and `burnt_out_candles` is zero.\n2.  **The Loop:** I'll run a loop *while* I have new candles (`current_new_candles > 0`).\n    *   **Burn:** Light all available new candles.  Add the number of candles I burn to `total_hours`. All those candles become stubs, so I add the number of new candles to the `burnt_out_candles`. And, obviously set `current_new_candles` to zero.\n    *   **Craft:** From the stubs, calculate how many *new* candles can be created. I'll use integer division (`//`) to get the number of full 'b' packs. Update the number of `burnt_out_candles` by taking the remainder of the integer division. The newly crafted candles are added to `current_new_candles`.\n\n    The loop continues as long as `current_new_candles` remains non-zero.  When crafting yields no new candles, it indicates the end of the burn-cycle.\n\n**Working Through an Example**\n\nLet's say *a* is 4, and *b* is 2.\n\n**Initial:**\n`total_hours = 0`\n`current_new_candles = 4`\n`burnt_out_candles = 0`\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n*   Burn all 4. `total_hours = 4`. `burnt_out_candles = 4`.  `current_new_candles = 0`\n*   Craft: 4 burnt-out / 2 = 2 new candles. `burnt_out_candles` becomes zero, and `current_new_candles` is now 2.\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n*   Burn the 2 new candles. `total_hours = 6`. `burnt_out_candles = 2`. `current_new_candles = 0`.\n*   Craft: 2 burnt-out / 2 = 1 new candle.  `burnt_out_candles = 0`. `current_new_candles = 1`.\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n*   Burn 1 new candle. `total_hours = 7`. `burnt_out_candles = 1`.  `current_new_candles = 0`\n*   Craft: 1 burnt-out / 2 = 0 new candles. The remaining burnt stub is set to 1.  `current_new_candles = 0`\n\n**Iteration 4:**\nSince now `current_new_candles` is 0, the loop stops. Final `total_hours` is 7.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.  Now, I'm ready to translate this into Python and get the solution.\n",
