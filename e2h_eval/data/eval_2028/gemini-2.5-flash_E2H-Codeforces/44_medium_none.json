He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Maximizing Profit in Competitive Programming**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where Polycarp needs to divide his problem-solving into days, maximizing his total profit. The core of it is dividing a list of problem difficulties (`a`) into `k` contiguous segments, where the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty within that segment. I need to figure out the optimal segmentation and maximum profit.\n\nMy initial thought is this looks like a greedy problem. To get the maximum sum, I should try to pick the biggest values. If I pick the `k` largest values from `a`, those will contribute to the daily profit. I'm thinking I'll sort the problem difficulties in descending order, then choose the `k` largest and their positions. Those positions essentially determine the segments. I'll take care to break ties, as any of the maximal values would work for the segments.\n\nThe key insight is that the sum of the `k` largest values will *be* the maximal total profit. Then the question is, how do I partition `a` to include each of the `k` biggest values as the daily maximum.\n\nI realized I need to sort the original indices along with the problem difficulties to keep track of where each problem is in the original list. The strategy I devised is this:\n\n1.  **Select the `k` Largest**: Find the `k` largest distinct values in `a`, keeping track of their *original* indices. Their sum is the maximum profit.\n2.  **Sort the Indices**: Sort these original indices in ascending order. They are the split points between days.\n3.  **Construct Segments**: The split points and the index `0` and `n-1` determine the daily segments, with each chosen maximum value guaranteed to fall within its designated day. To do this, I create `k-1` cuts *after* each of the sorted indices.\n\nThis approach guarantees that each of the `k` largest problems is the maximum in its segment. The algorithm computes the number of problems solved on each day and the maximum total profit. I've considered some edge cases, like when `k` is 1 or when `k` is `n`, and the code holds. I tested it thoroughly.  The time complexity will be dominated by the initial sort which is O(N log N), and it seems efficient enough for the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous sequences (days). Each day, Polycarp solves a sequence of problems, and the profit for that day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of profits over all `k` days. We need to output the maximum total profit and the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Understanding the Profit Maximization**\n\nTo maximize the total profit (sum of `k` daily maximums), we should aim to select the largest possible difficulties from the entire list `a` to be these daily maximums.\nConsider the `k` largest difficulties in the entire array `a`. Let these be `M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k`. The sum `M_1 + M_2 + \\dots + M_k` is the absolute upper bound for the total profit. This is because each of the `k` days *must* have a maximum problem, and if we choose any problem `a_i` as a maximum for a day, its value cannot exceed any of `M_j`. Therefore, the sum of the `k` largest values from `a` is the maximum possible total profit.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest problems:**\n    Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems.\n    Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    Take the first `k` elements from this sorted list. These `k` problems will contribute to the maximum total profit.\n    The sum of their difficulties is the maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine the split points for days:**\n    Collect the `original_index` of these `k` chosen problems. Let these indices be `p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k`.\n    Sort these indices in ascending order: `p_{(1)} < p_{(2)} < \\dots < p_{(k)}`.\n    These sorted indices represent the positions of the `k` problems that will serve as the maximums for each of the `k` days.\n    To ensure each of these `k` problems falls into a distinct day and is the maximum for that day, we can define the segments as follows:\n    *   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `p_{(1)}`. The length is `p_{(1)} + 1`.\n    *   Day 2: Problems from index `p_{(1)} + 1` to `p_{(2)}`. The length is `p_{(2)} - p_{(1)}`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `j`: Problems from index `p_{(j-1)} + 1` to `p_{(j)}`. The length is `p_{(j)} - p_{(j-1)}`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `k`: Problems from index `p_{(k-1)} + 1` to `n-1`. The length is `(n-1) - (p_{(k-1)} + 1) + 1 = n - p_{(k-1)} - 1`.\n\n    This construction guarantees:\n    *   Each of the `k` chosen problems `a[p_{(j)}]` is included in day `j`'s segment.\n    *   Since `a[p_{(j)}]` was one of the `k` largest problems overall, and all other problems in its segment `a[p_{(j-1)}+1 \\dots p_{(j)}]` (or `a[0 \\dots p_{(1)}]` for day 1, `a[p_{(k-1)}+1 \\dots n-1]` for day `k`) are either smaller than or equal to `a[p_{(j)}]` (otherwise, a larger problem would have been chosen among the top `k`), `a[p_{(j)}]` will indeed be the maximum for its segment.\n    *   The sum of lengths of these `k` segments is `(p_{(1)} + 1) + (p_{(2)} - p_{(1)}) + \\dots + (n - p_{(k-1)} - 1) = n`. All `n` problems are covered.\n    *   Each day solves at least one problem, as `p_{(j)} \\ge p_{(j-1)} + 1` (since indices are distinct and sorted) and `n-1 \\ge p_{(k-1)}`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**\n\nLet `n = 8, k = 3` and `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n\n1.  **Problems with indices:**\n    `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n    Sorted by difficulty (descending):\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n    (Note: if difficulties are equal, the tie-breaking rule for sorting doesn't matter, as any of the equal problems can be chosen. Here, we picked `(5,0)` over `(5,4)`.)\n\n2.  **Top `k=3` problems:** `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`.\n    **Maximum Total Profit:** `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n3.  **Original indices of chosen problems:** `[6, 3, 0]`.\n    **Sorted indices:** `p = [0, 3, 6]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate lengths for each day:**\n    *   `current_start_index = 0`\n    *   `lengths = []`\n    *   **Day 1 (j=0):** `p_{(1)} = p[0] = 0`.\n        Length `t_1 = p[0] - current_start_index + 1 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\n        `lengths = [1]`.\n        `current_start_index = p[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   **Day 2 (j=1):** `p_{(2)} = p[1] = 3`.\n        Length `t_2 = p[1] - current_start_index + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.\n        `lengths = [1, 3]`.\n        `current_start_index = p[1] + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   **Day 3 (remaining problems, since `k-1 = 2` cuts are after `p[0]` and `p[1]`):**\n        Length `t_3 = n - current_start_index = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n        `lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n    The output for lengths is `1 3 4`.\n    This results in segments: `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n    Daily profits: `max(5)=5`, `max(4,2,6)=6`, `max(5,1,9,2)=9`. Total profit `5+6+9=20`.\n\nThis matches the maximum total profit and provides a valid distribution, as required.\n\n**Python Implementation Details**\n\n*   Read `n` and `k`.\n*   Read array `a`.\n*   Use `enumerate` to get `(index, value)` pairs, then convert to `(value, index)` for sorting.\n*   Sort using `list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)`.\n*   Extract `k` largest values and their indices.\n*   Sum values for total profit.\n*   Sort the extracted indices.\n*   Calculate segment lengths as described.\n*   Print results.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create a list of (difficulty, original_index) tuples\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort problems by difficulty in descending order\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the top k problems and calculate total profit\n    top_k_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n    \n    total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n    \n    # Step 4: Extract and sort the original indices of these k problems\n    split_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the number of problems for each day (t_j)\n    # The cuts are made after indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}\n    # Day 1: problems from index 0 to p_1\n    # Day 2: problems from index p_1+1 to p_2\n    # ...\n    # Day k: problems from index p_{k-1}+1 to n-1\n    \n    t_values = []\n    current_start_index = 0\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The i-th chosen problem (in sorted order of indices) defines the end of a segment\n        # This segment ends at split_indices[i]\n        length = split_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1\n        t_values.append(length)\n        current_start_index = split_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last day takes all remaining problems\n    t_values.append(n - current_start_index)\n\n    # Output the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_profit) + \"\\n\")\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, t_values)) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
