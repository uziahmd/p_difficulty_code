In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions.

The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Solving the House-Building Profit Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a competitive programming problem where the goal is to maximize profit from building houses across `n` spots. Each spot allows a house with a height from 0 to `h`, and the profit is simply the square of the height.  The twist?  We have `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction defines a range of spots (`l_j` to `r_j`) and a maximum height (`x_j`) for *any* house within that range.  The objective is to find the total maximum profit.\n\nMy initial thought is that for each spot, we need to determine the maximum allowed height given both the general height limit (`h`) and the restrictions.  Let's define `max_allowed_height[i]` to store the maximum permissible height at spot `i`.  Initially, every spot can have the maximum height `h`.\n\nWe then process each restriction. If a restriction affects a spot, we update the `max_allowed_height` for that spot to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height (`x_j`). The logic here is key: We enforce the *individual* height constraint within the zoning restrictions.  Therefore, for each spot `i`, the actual limit is the minimum of the global limit and all restrictions impacting that spot.\n\nAfter processing all restrictions, the `max_allowed_height` array holds the optimal height for each spot. Since the profit function is the square of the height, and the square function is monotonically increasing, we maximize the profit by building each house to its allowed maximum height. The total profit is the sum of the squares of all `max_allowed_height` values.\n\nThis seems efficient.  We scan the restrictions once and update the array in-place. The time complexity is dominated by the nested loop within the restrictions, so it's `O(m*n)`. Given the problem constraints (`n`, `m` up to 50), this is certainly acceptable.  The memory usage, which is `O(n)` to store the `max_allowed_height` array, is also quite manageable. We only have one iteration over the array to calculate the result. This solution is clean, memory-efficient, and easy to code. The final piece is calculating the sum of squares, and returning it as the answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the maximum profit achievable by building houses on `n` spots, subject to a global maximum height `h` and `m` specific zoning restrictions. For each house of height `a`, the profit gained is `a^2`.\n\nLet's break down the constraints on the height of a house at any given spot `i`:\n1.  **Global Height Limit:** The height `a_i` of a house at spot `i` must be an integer between `0` and `h` (inclusive). So, `0 <= a_i <= h`.\n2.  **Zoning Restrictions:** For each restriction `j` defined by `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, it states that the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`. This implies that for any spot `k` such that `l_j <= k <= r_j`, the height `a_k` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we need to maximize the profit from each individual house. Since the profit function `a^2` is strictly increasing for `a >= 0`, to maximize `a_i^2`, we must choose the largest possible integer height `a_i` that satisfies all constraints for spot `i`.\n\nLet `max_allowed_height[i]` be the maximum possible height for a house at spot `i`.\nInitially, due to the global height limit, every house can be built up to height `h`. So, we can initialize `max_allowed_height[i] = h` for all `i` from `1` to `n`.\n\nThen, we process each of the `m` zoning restrictions. For a restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\nFor every spot `k` within the range `[l_j, r_j]` (i.e., `l_j <= k <= r_j`), its height `a_k` must be at most `x_j`. This means we must update `max_allowed_height[k]` to be `min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)`. We apply this update for all `k` in the specified range.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, the `max_allowed_height[i]` array will contain the maximum permissible height for a house at each spot `i` that satisfies all global and specific zoning rules.\n\nFinally, to calculate the maximum total profit, we sum up the squares of these maximum allowed heights: `total_profit = sum(max_allowed_height[i]^2 for i from 1 to n)`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n`, `h`, and `m`.\n2.  Create an array (or list in Python) `max_allowed_height` of size `n`. Initialize all its elements to `h`. (Using 0-indexing for the array, so spot `i` corresponds to index `i-1`).\n3.  For each of the `m` restrictions:\n    a.  Read `l_j`, `r_j`, and `x_j`.\n    b.  Iterate from `k = l_j` to `r_j` (inclusive). For each `k`, update `max_allowed_height[k-1] = min(max_allowed_height[k-1], x_j)`.\n4.  Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n5.  Iterate through the `max_allowed_height` array. For each `height` in the array, add `height * height` to `total_profit`.\n6.  Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1,1,1)`, `(2,2,3)`, `(3,3,2)`\n\n1.  Initialize `max_allowed_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n2.  Process restrictions:\n    *   `(1,1,1)`: For spot 1 (index 0), `max_allowed_height[0] = min(max_allowed_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `max_allowed_height` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   `(2,2,3)`: For spot 2 (index 1), `max_allowed_height[1] = min(max_allowed_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `max_allowed_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   `(3,3,2)`: For spot 3 (index 2), `max_allowed_height[2] = min(max_allowed_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `max_allowed_height` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n3.  Calculate total profit:\n    `total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Initializing `max_allowed_height`: `O(n)`.\n    *   Processing `m` restrictions: Each restriction involves iterating through a range of spots, which can be up to `n` spots. So, `m` restrictions take `O(m * n)` time.\n    *   Calculating total profit: `O(n)`.\n    *   Total time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\n    *   Given `n, m <= 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   Storing `max_allowed_height`: `O(n)`.\n    *   Given `n <= 50`, this is very small.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, each house can be at most 'h' tall.\n    # We use a 0-indexed list, so spots 1 to n map to indices 0 to n-1.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read l_i, r_i, x_i for the current restriction\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # For each spot within the restriction's range [l, r],\n        # its height must be at most x.\n        # We update the max_allowed_height for these spots.\n        # Adjust l and r to be 0-indexed for list access:\n        # l_i becomes l-1, and the range goes up to r (exclusive upper bound in Python's range).\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    # To maximize profit, for each spot, we build a house with the maximum\n    # allowed height, because the profit function (height^2) is increasing.\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed_height:\n        total_profit += height * height\n\n    # Print the final maximum profit\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
