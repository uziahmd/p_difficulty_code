You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem:  maximize a number by swapping its digits with ones from a given sequence. Seems straightforward. The key is to make the *leftmost* (most significant) digits as big as possible. That means I need to go through the original number, digit by digit, from left to right.\n\nFor each digit in the original number, I'll check if there's a *larger* digit available in the sequence of replacement digits.  If I find one, I swap it and move on. Critically, I have to keep track of *which* digits from the sequence I've already used.  That's where a frequency map, or something similar, comes in handy.  I'll use a `s_counts` list (indexed by digit value 0-9) to store how many times each digit appears in the replacement sequence.  Then, when I'm looking for a replacement, I just check `s_counts[digit]` to see if it's available.  If a better digit is *not* available, I leave the original digit as it is.\n\nThe algorithm itself is quite simple. First, I parse the input.  Then, I create this `s_counts` array. Next, I iterate through the digits of the original number (let's call it `a`). For each digit, I go down from 9 to the current digit plus one, checking `s_counts`. If I find a digit that's available *and* larger, I replace the current digit, decrement the count in `s_counts`, and break out of the inner loop (since I've found the best replacement). I make sure that if I didn't find anything, I do not make the change. Finally, I combine the modified digits back into a string and output.\n\nI've carefully considered edge cases like the original number having a length of one, the replacement sequence being empty, and what happens if none of the digits in the replacement sequence are large enough. The code should handle those without any issues. The whole thing runs in `O(n + m)` time complexity, which is efficient enough. I've also verified all the details of the logic to make sure I am not missing anything when it comes to edge cases and possible pitfalls.\n\nI should be good to go. Let's code this up!\n",
