Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Finding Inscribed Angle Closest to Target Angle**\n\nI need a Python script to find three distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3) in a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given target angle 'a'.  The key is understanding that all angles formed by vertices of a regular n-gon are multiples of 180/n degrees.\n\nFirst, I'll need to calculate the possible inscribed angles. I'll represent the n-gon's vertices numerically from 1 to n (or 0 to n-1).  I can fix one vertex, v2, as the vertex of the angle. Then, the angle v1-v2-v3 is determined by the number of segments in the arc connecting v1 and v3, *not* including v2. Each segment is a side of the n-gon, and each contributes 180/n degrees to the angle.  The number of segments on that arc will be an integer 'k', which will range from 1 to n-2. For k=1, vertices v1,v2,v3 are sequential on the circumference. If the arc contains all vertices except v2, this has n-2 segments. So, this produces angles of the form k * (180/n) for k between 1 and n-2 (inclusive).\n\nMy goal is to find the 'k' that makes `k * (180/n)` closest to the target angle 'a'.  I can rearrange this to look for 'k' that minimizes `abs(k - (a * n / 180))`. I need to handle cases where my calculated 'k' is outside the range [1, n-2]. I'll then select k as floor or ceiling of a * n/180. The actual optimal 'k' can be calculated, if it is in the range.\n\nOnce I've found the best 'k', I just need to determine which vertices correspond to v1, v2, and v3 for this chosen angle.\n\nFinally, I'll translate the best 'k' to three valid vertex indices in the range 1 to n to form the best angle and output those.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular n-gon**\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` where `v2` is the vertex of the angle is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nLet `v2` be any vertex. Let `v1` and `v3` be two other distinct vertices. The angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1-v3` that does not contain `v2`.\nA regular `n`-gon has `n` sides, and the entire circle is 360 degrees. So, each segment connecting two adjacent vertices subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nIf the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) consists of `k` segments (i.e., `k` sides of the polygon), then the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is half of this central angle: `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Possible Values for k**\n\nThe vertices `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct.\nThe number of segments `k` in the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) must be at least 1 (since `v1` and `v3` are distinct).\nThe maximum number of segments `k` can be is `n-2`. This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are the vertices adjacent to `v2`. For example, if `v2` is vertex 2, `v1` is vertex 1, and `v3` is vertex 3. The arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) would be the arc from vertex 3 to vertex 1 clockwise, which spans `n-2` segments (`3 -> 4 -> ... -> n -> 1`). This angle `(n-2) * (180/n)` is the internal angle of a regular `n`-gon.\n\nSo, the possible values for `k` are integers from `1` to `n-2`, inclusive.\n\n**Finding the Optimal k**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `abs(k * (180/n) - a)`.\nWe can iterate through all possible values of `k` from `1` to `n-2`, calculate the angle `current_angle = k * (180/n)`, and find the `k` that yields the minimum absolute difference `abs(current_angle - a)`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^5`, an `O(n)` linear scan is efficient enough.\n\n**Constructing the Vertices (v1, v2, v3)**\n\nOnce we find the optimal `k`, we need to output three distinct vertices.\nLet's fix `v2` to be vertex `2`.\nLet `v1` be vertex `1`.\nThen `v3` must be chosen such that the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) has `k` segments.\nThe arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2=2`) is the arc from `v3` to `v1=1` clockwise.\nSo, `v3` should be `k` steps away from `v1` (vertex 1) in the clockwise direction, but not passing through `v2` (vertex 2).\nThis means `v3` would be vertex `1 + k`.\n\nLet's check the distinctness for `v1=1, v2=2, v3=1+k`:\n1. `v1 != v2`: `1 != 2` (always true).\n2. `v1 != v3`: `1 != 1+k`. This is true because `k >= 1`.\n3. `v2 != v3`: `2 != 1+k`. This is true if `k != 1`.\n\nThis set of vertices `(1, 2, 1+k)` works for `k > 1`.\nIf `k=1`, then `v2=v3` (both are 2), which is not allowed.\nSo, we need a special case for `k=1`. If `k=1`, we can use `v1=1, v2=2, v3=3`.\nFor `k=1`, `v1=1, v2=2, v3=3` are distinct. The angle `1-2-3` subtends arc `1-3` (not containing 2), which has 1 segment (`3 -> ... -> 1`). This correctly gives `1 * (180/n)`.\n\nSo, the strategy for outputting vertices is:\n- If `best_k == 1`: print `1 2 3`.\n- If `best_k > 1`: print `1 2 (1 + best_k)`.\n  Note that `1+best_k` might exceed `n`. If `1+best_k > n`, it means `1+best_k` wraps around.\n  However, since `best_k <= n-2`, `1+best_k <= 1+(n-2) = n-1`.\n  So `1+best_k` will never exceed `n` when `best_k > 1`.\n  Thus, `v1=1, v2=2, v3=1+best_k` (for `best_k > 1`) will always produce distinct vertices within the range `[1, n]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**\n\nLet's re-check the examples with this logic:\n\n1. `n=3, a=15`\n   Possible `k`: `1` to `3-2=1`. So `k=1`.\n   Angle for `k=1`: `1 * (180/3) = 60`.\n   `abs(60-15) = 45`.\n   `best_k = 1`.\n   Since `best_k == 1`, output `1 2 3`. (Matches example)\n\n2. `n=4, a=67`\n   Possible `k`: `1` to `4-2=2`. So `k=1, 2`.\n   For `k=1`: Angle `1 * (180/4) = 45`. `abs(45-67) = 22`.\n   For `k=2`: Angle `2 * (180/4) = 90`. `abs(90-67) = 23`.\n   Minimum difference is `22` for `k=1`. So `best_k = 1`.\n   Since `best_k == 1`, output `1 2 3`. (Example output is `2 1 3`, which is the same angle `1-2-3` just with `v1, v2, v3` relabeled, so it's a valid solution).\n\n3. `n=4, a=68`\n   Possible `k`: `1` to `2`.\n   For `k=1`: Angle `45`. `abs(45-68) = 23`.\n   For `k=2`: Angle `90`. `abs(90-68) = 22`.\n   Minimum difference is `22` for `k=2`. So `best_k = 2`.\n   Since `best_k > 1`, output `1 2 (1 + best_k) = 1 2 (1+2) = 1 2 3`.\n   Wait, this is incorrect. For `n=4, k=2`, the angle is `90`. With `v1=1, v2=2, v3=3`, the angle `1-2-3` is `1 * (180/4) = 45`.\n   My chosen `v1, v2, v3` (1, 2, 1+k) does not form an arc of `k` segments that does not contain `v2`.\n\nLet's re-think the vertex selection.\nTo get an angle `k * (180/n)`, we need an arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) that spans `k` segments.\nA simple way to achieve this is:\nLet `v2` be vertex `1`.\nLet `v1` be vertex `2`.\nThen `v3` must be `k` steps away from `v1` along the perimeter, in the clockwise direction, without passing `v2`.\nSo `v3` would be vertex `(2 + k - 1)`.\nIf `(2 + k - 1)` is greater than `n`, we wrap around: `v3 = (2 + k - 1 - n)`.\nMore generally, `v3 = ((2 + k - 1 - 1) % n) + 1`. This formula ensures 1-based indexing and wraps around correctly.\nLet's test this vertex choice: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=((2+k-1-1)%n)+1`.\n\n1. `n=3, a=15`. `best_k=1`.\n   `v1=2, v2=1`.\n   `v3 = ((2+1-1-1)%3)+1 = (1%3)+1 = 1+1 = 2`.\n   This results in `v1=2, v3=2`, which are not distinct. This choice is problematic for `k=1`.\n\nThe simplest and most robust way to choose `v1, v2, v3` is:\nFix `v2` to be vertex `1`.\nFix `v1` to be vertex `n`. (This is `1-1` in 0-based indexing, or the vertex immediately counter-clockwise from `v2`).\nThen `v3` should be `k` steps away from `v2` in the clockwise direction.\nSo `v3 = 1 + k`.\nLet's check distinctness for `v1=n, v2=1, v3=1+k`:\n1. `v1 != v2`: `n != 1`. True since `n >= 3`.\n2. `v1 != v3`: `n != 1+k`. True since `k <= n-2`, so `1+k <= n-1`.\n3. `v2 != v3`: `1 != 1+k`. True since `k >= 1`.\nAll distinctness conditions are satisfied.\nThe arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2=1`) is the arc from `n` to `1+k` going clockwise. This arc spans `k` segments.\n`n -> (n-1) -> ... -> (1+k)`. No, this is incorrect.\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` is `V_n - V_1 - V_{1+k}`.\nThe arc `V_n - V_{1+k}` (not containing `V_1`) is the arc `V_{1+k} -> V_{1+k+1} -> ... -> V_n`.\nThe number of segments in this arc is `n - (1+k) + 1 = n - k`.\nThis angle would be `(n-k) * (180/n)`. This is not `k * (180/n)`.\n\nLet's use the simplest possible construction that works:\n`v2` is vertex `1`.\n`v1` is vertex `2`.\n`v3` is vertex `(1 + k + 1) % n`. If this is `0`, then `n`.\nMore simply: `v3 = 2 + k`. If `v3 > n`, then `v3 -= n`.\nLet's trace this again with `n=4, a=68`. `best_k=2`.\n`v2=1`. `v1=2`.\n`v3 = 2 + best_k = 2 + 2 = 4`.\nOutput: `2 1 4`.\nAngle `2-1-4`. Arc `2-4` (not containing 1) is `2 -> 3 -> 4`. This has 2 segments.\nSo the angle is `2 * (180/4) = 90`. This is correct.\nThis matches the example output `4 1 2` (which is just `2 1 4` with `v1` and `v3` swapped).\n\nThis construction `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+k` (with wrap-around) seems to work for all `k` in `[1, n-2]`.\nDistinctness:\n`v1=2, v2=1`. Distinct.\n`v1=2, v3=2+k`. `2 != 2+k` because `k >= 1`. Distinct.\n`v2=1, v3=2+k`. `1 != 2+k` because `k >= 1`. Distinct.\nThe values `2, 1, 2+k` will always be distinct.\nAlso, `2+k` will be at most `2 + (n-2) = n`. So no complex modulo arithmetic needed, just `if v3 > n: v3 -= n`.\n\nFinal refined logic:\n1. Read `n` and `a`.\n2. Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n3. Loop `k` from `1` to `n-2`:\n   a. Calculate `current_angle = k * 180 / n`.\n   b. Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n   c. If `diff < min_diff`:\n      `min_diff = diff`\n      `best_k = k`\n4. Print `2 1` (for `v1` and `v2`).\n5. Calculate `v3_val = 2 + best_k`.\n6. If `v3_val > n`:\n   `v3_val -= n`\n7. Print `v3_val`.\n\nThis logic is sound and covers all cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # Possible k values range from 1 to n-2\n    # k represents the number of segments in the arc subtended by the angle.\n    # The angle is k * (180/n) degrees.\n    for k in range(1, n - 1): # loop from 1 to n-2 inclusive\n        current_angle = k * 180 / n\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        # If diffs are equal, any solution is fine.
