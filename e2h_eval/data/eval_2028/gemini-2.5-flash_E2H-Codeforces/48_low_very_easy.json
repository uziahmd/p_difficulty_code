            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Base Conversion**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to convert a number from one base to another. The input is pretty straightforward: the source and target bases, and the number itself as a string.  The target base can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. There are some constraints I have to keep in mind, specifically relating to the ranges of the bases and the maximum decimal values. The number in base `a` can have leading zeros, but that shouldn't cause any issues with my conversion logic.\n\nMy immediate thought is to break this problem down into two key parts.  First, I'll need to convert the number from its initial base (`a`) into its decimal (base 10) equivalent.  Then, I'll convert that decimal number into the target base (`b`).  This modular approach feels cleaner and more manageable.\n\n**Converting from base a to decimal:**\n\nLet's start with the first part.  The input number, `c`, is a string. It can contain digits '0'-'9' and letters 'A' through 'O' (for bases up to 25). I'll need a helper function to convert each character in the string to its integer value.  Something like `char_to_int(char)` will do the trick.  It needs to handle both digits and letters.\n\nNow, to convert the entire string to decimal, I'll iterate through the string from right to left, multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of the base.  I'll sum these products to get the decimal value.  So, I envision a function `to_decimal(num_str, base)` that does precisely this.  I'll use a loop to iterate from the least significant digit, and use an accumulator variable to build up the result. This should handle the leading zeros gracefully.\n\n**Converting the Decimal to the Target Base:**\n\nNow that I have the decimal value, I need to convert it to the target base `b`.  This will depend on whether `b` is an integer base or 'R'.\n\n**Subpart 2a: Integer base conversion.**\n\nIf `b` is an integer, I'll use repeated division and remainder operations.  I'll repeatedly divide the decimal number by the base and save the remainders.  The remainders, read in reverse order, will be the digits in the new base. I'll need another function for this, something like `from_decimal(decimal_val, base)`.  I'll have to use the `char_to_int` function in reverse (int to char) here.\n\nThe Roman numeral conversion will be separate.\n\nEssentially, I'm thinking of building this up, piece by piece, with helper functions. I need to be careful with the ranges, and the format of the output, when dealing with the base conversions.  That should cover the core logic of the program.\n",
