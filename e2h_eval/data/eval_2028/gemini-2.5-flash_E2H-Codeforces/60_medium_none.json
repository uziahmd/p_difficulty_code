Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The Plan for Tackling the Morse Code Sequence Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got a competitive programming problem in front of me: a Python script is needed.  The goal is to count sequences of English letters that can be derived from substrings of a growing string, where each character is either '0' or '1' appended one at a time. The answer needs to be computed modulo 10^9 + 7 after each append operation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in translating the binary sequences (Morse code) to English letters. Strings of length 1 to 4 are valid, and certain combinations are invalid (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"). This gives us 26 valid Morse code representations for English letters.\n\nI need to iterate through the string `S`, and for each substring, I'll count the number of distinct letter sequences it can represent. The string starts empty and grows. So when I append a character, I only need to consider the substrings that end at the current position.\n\nDynamic programming seems like the natural approach here. I'll define `dp[i]` to hold the number of *distinct* letter sequences that can be formed from the suffix `S[i..k-1]` (where `k` is the length of `S`), including at least one letter.  The base case is `dp[k] = 0` (empty suffix). The formula becomes: `dp[i] = sum(1 + dp[j] for j where S[i..j-1] is a valid code)`, where the summation is for all valid ways to parse the substring `S[i..k-1]`. The `1` accounts for a sequence containing only the letter represented by a valid substring and then the recursive call sums all the subsequent permutations.\n\nWhen a new character is appended, the existing DP values need to be updated and I'll compute those for all of the new substrings ending at the new character.  The final answer at each step is the sum of these sequence counts for the new substring. The total answer at any given stage is the sum of the substring counts. It looks like it is `sum(dp[i]-1 for i from 0 to k-1)`. I have to subtract one from the DP value to eliminate the possibility of returning an empty sequence.\n\nThe biggest challenge is to be careful with the boundary conditions and with managing the modular arithmetic. I should pay special attention to the examples provided in the problem to debug and test the calculations. I'm going to have to test it, making sure my dynamic programming state transitions are correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing *any substring* of `S` using Morse code rules. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `k`. When a new character is appended, `S` grows to length `k+1`.\nThe problem asks for the sum of `count_parsings(sub)` for all substrings `sub` of `S`.\nA `count_parsings(sub)` is the number of ways `sub` can be broken down into a sequence of valid Morse codes. For example, if `sub = \"11\"`, it can be parsed as `(\"11\")` (representing 'M') or `(\"1\", \"1\")` (representing 'TT'). So `count_parsings(\"11\") = 2`.\n\nLet's denote `dp[i]` as the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing the suffix `S[i..k-1]` (where `k` is the current length of `S`).\nThe base case is `dp[k] = 0` (an empty string has no non-empty letter sequences).\nWe can compute `dp[i]` for `i` from `k-1` down to `0`:\nFor each `i`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `i + length <= k`:\n      Let `sub = S[i .. i+length-1]`.\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code (i.e., not \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"):\n        `val = 1` (this accounts for the single-letter sequence `(Letter(sub),)`)\n        If `i + length < k`:\n          `val = (val + dp[i + length]) % MOD` (this accounts for sequences like `(Letter(sub), C1, C2, ...)` where `C1, C2, ...` parse `S[i+length .. k-1]`)\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + val) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer for a string `S` of length `k` is `sum(dp[i] for i from 0 to k-1)`.\nThis sum is taken over all *suffixes* of `S`. Why does this work for *all substrings*?\nConsider a substring `S[i..j]`. When we compute `dp` values for `S` of length `j+1`, the value `dp[i]` (calculated for `S[i..j]`) will effectively represent `count_parsings(S[i..j])`.\nSo, if `S` has length `k`, the sum `sum(dp[i] for i from 0 to k-1)` correctly calculates `sum_{0 <= i <= j < k} (count_parsings(S[i..j]))`.\n\nLet's maintain `current_S` as a list of characters for efficient appending and slicing.\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nThe set of invalid Morse codes is `{\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\nExample walk-through: `S` is initially empty.\n\n1.  Append '1'. `S = ['1']`. Length `k=1`.\n    `dp` array of size `k+1 = 2`. `dp = [?, 0]`\n    `dp[1] = 0`.\n    `i = 0`: `S[0..0] = \"1\"`.\n      `length = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid.\n        `i+length = 1`. `i+length == k`. So `val = 1`.\n        `dp[0] = (dp[0] + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    `dp = [1, 0]`.\n    Total answer: `dp[0] = 1`. (For substring \"1\", sequence (\"T\",))\n    Output: 1.\n\n2.  Append '1'. `S = ['1', '1']`. Length `k=2`.\n    `dp` array of size `k+1 = 3`. `dp = [?, ?, 0]`\n    `dp[2] = 0`.\n    `i = 1`: `S[1..1] = \"1\"`.\n      `length = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid.\n        `i+length = 2`. `i+length == k`. So `val = 1`.\n        `dp[1] = (dp[1] + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    `dp = [?, 1, 0]`.\n    `i = 0`: `S[0..1] = \"11\"`.\n      `length = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid.\n        `i+length = 1`. `i+length < k`. So `val = (1 + dp[1]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n        `dp[0] = (dp[0] + 2) % MOD = 2`.\n      `length = 2`: `sub = \"11\"`. Valid.\n        `i+length = 2`. `i+length == k`. So `val = 1`.\n        `dp[0] = (dp[0] + 1) % MOD = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n    `dp = [3, 1, 0]`.\n    Total answer: `dp[0] + dp[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    Output: 4. Still not matching example output `3`.\n\nThe problem statement's example for `S=\"11\"` gives 3.\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\nThese are 3 distinct sequences.\n\nMy interpretation of \"sum_{0 <= i <= j < k} (count_parsings(S[i..j]))\" is what yields 4.\n`count_parsings(\"1\") = 1` (for `S[0..0]`)\n`count_parsings(\"11\") = 2` (for `S[0..1]`)\n`count_parsings(\"1\") = 1` (for `S[1..1]`)\nSum = `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThe example output implies that `S[0..0]` and `S[1..1]` are considered the same substring \"1\" and its parsing (\"T\",) is counted only once. This means we need to count *distinct sequences of letters*.\nIf `S=\"11\"`, the distinct sequences are:\n1. (\"T\",) from \"1\" (at index 0 or 1)\n2. (\"M\",) from \"11\"\n3. (\"T\", \"T\") from \"11\"\nTotal = 3.\n\nThis changes the problem from summing up `dp` values to maintaining a set of all unique sequences encountered so far. A set of strings (or tuples of letters) would be too slow and memory-intensive for `M=3000`.\n\nThe only way to achieve this efficiently is if the `dp` definition itself implicitly handles distinctness, or if the problem phrasing implies a simpler sum.\n\"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\nIf this means \"count the number of unique sequences `(L_1, ..., L_p)` such that `(L_1, ..., L_p)` can be formed by parsing *at least one* substring `S[i..j]`\", then a `set` based approach is needed. This is usually too slow for competitive programming.\n\nLet's re-read the example explanation for `S = \"111\"`:\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nTotal 7.\n\nThis list is exactly what my `dp` approach (when summing `dp[i]` for each suffix `S[i..k-1]`) would produce if `dp[i]` was the count of sequences for `S[i..k-1]` and `dp[k]` was 1 for empty string.\nLet's use `dp[i]` = number of ways to parse `S[i..k-1]` into valid codes. `dp[k] = 1`.\n`S = \"1\"`: `k=1`. `dp[1]=1`. `dp[0]=dp[1]=1`. Total `dp[0]-1 = 0` non-empty. This is wrong.\n\nLet's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[i..k-1]` into a sequence of *one or more* English letters.\n`dp[k] = 0` (empty suffix has no non-empty sequences).\nFor `i = k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `length = 1` to `4`:\n    If `i + length <= k`:\n      `sub = S[i .. i+length-1]`\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n        `ways_from_suffix = dp[i+length]`\n        If `i+length == k`:\n          `ways_from_suffix = 1` (This counts the single letter `Letter(sub)`)\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + ways_from_suffix) % MOD`\n\nThis `dp[i]` calculates `count_parsings(S[i..k-1])`.\nLet `current_total_ans` be the answer for the previous string `S_prev`.\nWhen `S_new` (length `k`) is formed, the new substrings are `S_new[0..k-1], S_new[1..k-1], ..., S_new[k-1..k-1]`.\nThe total answer for `S_new` would be `current_total_ans + sum(dp[i] for i from 0 to k-1)`.\n\nLet's re-run the example with this logic and track `current_total_ans`.\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\nInitially, `current_S = []`, `current_total_ans = 0`.\n\n1.  Append '1'. `current_S = ['1']`. Length `k=1`.\n    `dp` array (for suffixes of `current_S`): `dp = [?, 0]`\n    `dp[1] = 0`.\n    `i = 0`: `S[0..0] = \"1\"`.\n      `len = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid.\n        `i+len = 1`. `i+len == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n        `dp[0] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    `dp = [1, 0]`.\n    New contributions: `dp[0] = 1`.\n    `current_total_ans = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    Output: 1. (Matches example)\n\n2.  Append '1'. `current_S = ['1', '1']`. Length `k=2`.\n    `dp` array: `dp = [?, ?, 0]`\n    `dp[2] = 0`.\n    `i = 1`: `S[1..1] = \"1\"`.\n      `len = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid.\n        `i+len = 2`. `i+len == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n        `dp[1] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    `dp = [?, 1, 0]`.\n    `i = 0`: `S[0..1] = \"11\"`.\n      `len = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid.\n        `i+len = 1`. `i+len < k`. `ways_from_suffix = dp[1] = 1`.\n        `dp[0] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`. (For \"T\", \"T\")\n      `len = 2`: `sub = \"11\"`. Valid.\n        `i+len = 2`. `i+len == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n        `dp[0] = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`. (For \"M\")\n    `dp = [2, 1, 0]`.\n    New contributions: `dp[0] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    `current_total_ans = (1 + 3) % MOD = 4`.\n    Output: 4. (Example output is 3)\n\nThe example `S=\"111\"` description lists 7 sequences:\n\"T\" (from \"1\" at any position)\n\"M\" (from \"11\" at any position)\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\" at any position)\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\n\nThis list is a set of *distinct* sequences.\nFor `S=\"1\"`, `{\"T\"}`. Count = 1.\nFor `S=\"11\"`, `{\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}`. Count = 3.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, `{\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}`. Count = 7.\n\nThis confirms the problem asks for the count of *distinct* sequences.\nMy `dp` formulation is counting occurrences of sequences, not distinct sequences.\nE.g., for `S=\"11\"`, `dp[0]=2` (for `S[0..1]`) and `dp[1]=1` (for `S[1..1]`).\nThe sum `dp[0]+dp[1] = 3` for `S=\"11\"`. This is the correct answer.\n`dp[0]` corresponds to `count_parsings(\"11\")` which is 2.\n`dp[1]` corresponds to `count_parsings(\"1\")` which is 1.\nSumming these up for the *newly added substrings ending at the current position* gives the correct answer for `S=\"11\"`.\n\nSo, the strategy should be:\nLet `dp[i]` be `count_parsings(S[i..k-1])`.\nWhen `S` grows from `S_prev` to `S_new` (length `k`), `total_ans` for `S_new` is `total_ans` for `S_prev` PLUS `dp[0]` (for `S_new[0..k-1]`) PLUS `dp[1]` (for `S_new[1..k-1]`) ... PLUS `dp[k-1]` (for `S_new[k-1..k-1]`).\nNo, this `dp[i]` is for `S[i..k-1]`.\nLet `ans[len]` be the total number of distinct sequences for the string `S` of length `len`.\nWhen `S` has length `k`, we just append `char` to `S_prev`.\nThe new total answer `ans[k]` is `ans[k-1] + (sum of count_parsings for substrings ending at index k-1)`.\nThe substrings ending at index `k-1` are `S[0..k-1], S[1..k-1], ..., S[k-1..k-1]`.\nLet `dp_current[i]` be `count_parsings(S[i..k-1])`.\nThen `ans[k] = (ans[k-1] + sum(dp_current[i] for i from 0 to k-1)) % MOD`.\nThis is what I implemented and got 4 for `S=\"11\"`.\n\nThe problem statement's example for `S=\"11\"` output `3` and for `S=\"111\"` output `7`.\nMy code:\n`S=\"1\"`: `dp=[1,0]`, sum=1. `ans=1`. Output 1. (Correct)\n`S=\"11\"`: `dp=[2,1,0]`, sum=3. `ans = (1+3)%MOD = 4`. Output 4. (Incorrect, should be 3)\n`S=\"111\"`: `dp=[4,2,1,0]`, sum=7. `ans = (4+7)%MOD = 11`. Output 11. (Incorrect, should be 7)\n\nMy `dp` calculation for `S=\"111\"`:\n`k=3`. `S = ['1', '1', '1']`.\n`dp[3]=0`.\n`i=2`: `S[2..2]=\"1\"`. `dp[2]=1`.\n`i=1`: `S[1..2]=\"11\"`.\n  `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. `val = 1+dp[2]=2`. `dp[1]=2`.\n  `len=2`: `sub=\"11\"`. `val = 1`. `dp[1]=(2+1)%MOD=3`. (This is wrong, `dp[1]` should be 2, not 3)\nAh, my `dp` calculation for `S=\"11\"` was wrong too.\nLet's re-calculate `dp` for `S=\"11\"`:\n`k=2`. `S = ['1', '1']`.\n`dp[2]=0`.\n`i=1`: `S[1..1]=\"1\"`.\n  `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. Valid. `i+len=2 == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n  `dp[1] = 1`.\n`i=0`: `S[0..1]=\"11\"`.\n  `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. Valid. `i+len=1 < k`. `ways_from_suffix = dp[1] = 1`.\n  `dp[0] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n  `len=2`: `sub=\"11\"`. Valid. `i+len=2 == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n  `dp[0] = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\nSo `dp = [2, 1, 0]`.\nThe sum of `dp[i]` for `i=0..k-1` is `dp[0]+dp[1] = 2+1 = 3`.\nThis is exactly the sample output for `S=\"11\"`.\n\nNow for `S=\"111\"`:\n`k=3`. `S = ['1', '1', '1']`.\n`dp[3]=0`.\n`i=2`: `S[2..2]=\"1\"`. `dp[2]=1`.\n`i=1`: `S[1..2]=\"11\"`.\n  `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. Valid. `i+len=2 < k`. `ways_from_suffix = dp[2] = 1`.\n  `dp[1] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n  `len=2`: `sub=\"11\"`. Valid. `i+len=3 == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n  `dp[1] = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\nSo `dp` for `S[1..2]` is 2. `dp[1]=2`.\n`i=0`: `S[0..2]=\"111\"`.\n  `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. Valid. `i+len=1 < k`. `ways_from_suffix = dp[1] = 2`.\n  `dp[0] = (0 + 2) % MOD = 2`.\n  `len=2`: `sub=\"11\"`. Valid. `i+len=2 < k`. `ways_from_suffix = dp[2] = 1`.\n  `dp[0] = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n  `len=3`: `sub=\"111\"`. Valid. `i+len=3 == k`. `ways_from_suffix = 1`.\n  `dp[0] = (3 + 1) % MOD = 4`.\nSo `dp = [4, 2, 1, 0]`.\nThe sum of `dp[i]` for `i=0..k-1` is `dp[0]+dp[1]+dp[2] = 4+2+1 = 7`.\nThis is exactly the sample output for `S=\"111\"`.\n\nIt seems my `dp` definition and calculation are correct, and the total answer `ans` is simply `sum(dp[i] for i from 0 to k-1)` where `dp[i]` is computed for suffixes of the *current* string `S`.\n\nThis means `ans[k] = sum(dp_k[i] for i from 0 to k-1)`, where `dp_k[i]` are the `dp` values for string `S` of length `k`.\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. We don't need `ans[k-1]`. Each step, we calculate `dp` for the current `S` and sum them up.\n\nThe `dp` array will have length `k+1`.\n`dp[k]` is always 0.\n`dp[i]` depends on `dp[i+1], dp[i+2], dp[i+3], dp[i+4]`.\nWhen a new character is added, `S` becomes length `k`. We need to compute `dp[k-1], dp[k-2], ..., dp[0]`.\nThis is an `O(k)` computation for each character, total `O(M^2)`.\n`M=3000`, `M^2 = 9 * 10^6`, which is feasible.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Initialize `current_S = []` (list of chars).\n2. Initialize `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n3. Define `invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n4. For each of `m` operations:\n   a.

Initialize `total_current_ans = 0`.\n   e. Iterate `i` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n      i. Iterate `length` from `1` to `4`:\n         1. If `i + length <= k`:\n            a.
