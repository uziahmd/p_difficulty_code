The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving a Tree Connectivity Problem with a Greedy Approach**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to tackle this competitive programming problem where we're given a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) and need to remove a specific number of nodes (`k`) while maximizing the sum of indices of the remaining nodes, ensuring they stay connected.  The goal is to output the indices of the `k` nodes that should be removed, in increasing order. Since each node has a value `2^i`, maximizing the sum `2^i` is the same as maximizing the sum of indices `i`. My intuition tells me a greedy strategy is the way to go here.\n\nThe core of the problem is about maintaining connectivity. If we just blindly remove nodes with the smallest indices, we risk disconnecting the tree.  So, we need a removal strategy that guarantees the remaining nodes form a connected component. My thought is, that removing a leaf node is crucial. If a leaf node `u` is removed, the remaining graph stays connected. Otherwise, removing a non-leaf node might split the graph.\n\nSo here's my plan. I'll start with the entire tree and repeatedly remove the smallest-indexed leaf node until I've removed `k` nodes. To do this efficiently, I'll need to keep track of the degrees of each node and store the leaves in a min-priority queue (min-heap). This way, I can quickly find and remove the smallest-indexed leaf node in each step. When I remove a leaf, I'll update the degrees of its neighbors and add new leaves to the priority queue. This strategy should ensure that the final set of remaining nodes is connected, and the indices of removed nodes are minimized. It makes sense because minimizing the sum of the remaining nodes means you maximize the nodes with large indices, and this greedy removal of leaves will result in this.\n\nThe time complexity appears to be `O(N log N)`, with N being the number of nodes. This should be sufficient for the problem constraints. I need to make sure I'm careful with the details of the priority queue updates and degree calculations to avoid any off-by-one errors or inefficient operations. It seems quite elegant: the only nodes that can be removed are leaves and that greedy approach is the simplest approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree, such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts is maximized. Since `2^i` is a strictly increasing function of `i`, maximizing `sum(2^i)` is equivalent to maximizing `sum(i)` for the selected districts.\n\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `sum(i)` for the `k` districts that are removed, subject to the constraint that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component.\n\nThe key insight for problems like this on trees is that to remove a node from a connected component while keeping the remaining part connected, the removed node must be a \"leaf\" in the current connected component (i.e., it has degree 1 within the component). If we remove a non-leaf node, it might disconnect the component.\n\nTherefore, a greedy strategy works:\n1. Initialize the set of `n` districts as the current graph.\n2. We need to remove `k` districts. In each step, identify all districts that are \"leaves\" in the current graph (i.e., they have only one neighbor among the currently active districts).\n3. From these leaves, choose the one with the smallest district number (smallest `i`). Removing this district minimizes the sum of indices of removed districts at this step.\n4. Remove this chosen district. Update the degrees of its neighbors. If a neighbor's degree drops to 1, it becomes a new leaf and should be considered for removal in subsequent steps.\n5. Repeat `k` times.\n\nLet's trace this with an example: `n=6, k=3`, edges `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`.\nThe graph is:\n  1 -- 2 -- 3\n       |\n       4\n       |\n       6 -- 5\n\nInitial state:\n- Districts: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`\n- Degrees: `deg(1)=1, deg(2)=4, deg(3)=1, deg(4)=1, deg(5)=1, deg(6)=2`\n- Leaves (degree 1): `1, 3, 4, 5`. We use a min-priority queue to efficiently get the smallest-indexed leaf. `pq = [1, 3, 4, 5]` (conceptual order).\n- `removed_nodes = []`\n\n**Iteration 1 (remove 1st node):**\n1. Extract min from `pq`: `1`. Add `1` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [1]`.\n2. Mark `1` as removed.\n3. Neighbor of `1` is `2`. `deg(2)` decreases from `4` to `3`. `2` is not a leaf.\n4. `pq = [3, 4, 5]`\n\n**Iteration 2 (remove 2nd node):**\n1. Extract min from `pq`: `3`. Add `3` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [1, 3]`.\n2. Mark `3` as removed.\n3. Neighbor of `3` is `2`. `deg(2)` decreases from `3` to `2`. `2` is not a leaf.\n4. `pq = [4, 5]`\n\n**Iteration 3 (remove 3rd node):**\n1. Extract min from `pq`: `4`. Add `4` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [1, 3, 4]`.\n2. Mark `4` as removed.\n3. Neighbor of `4` is `2`. `deg(2)` decreases from `2` to `1`. Now `deg(2)=1`, so `2` becomes a leaf. Add `2` to `pq`.\n4. `pq = [2, 5]`\n\nWe have removed `k=3` nodes. The `removed_nodes` are `[1, 3, 4]`. Sorting them gives `1, 3, 4`. This matches the example output. The remaining nodes are `2, 5, 6`, which form a connected path `2-6-5`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. **Build Adjacency List and Calculate Initial Degrees:**\n   - Create an adjacency list `adj` for the graph.\n   - Create a `degree` array to store the degree of each district. Iterate through the `n-1` roads, add edges to `adj`, and increment degrees.\n2. **Initialize Priority Queue:**\n   - Create a min-priority queue `pq` (using `heapq` in Python).\n   - For each district `i` from `1` to `n`, if `degree[i]` is `1`, add `i` to `pq` (these are the initial leaves).\n3. **Iteratively Remove Districts:**\n   - Create a boolean array `is_removed` initialized to `False` for all districts.\n   - Create an empty list `removed_nodes` to store the districts to be removed.\n   - Loop `k` times:\n     a. Extract the smallest district `u` from `pq` using `heapq.heappop()`.\n     b. Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n     c. Mark `is_removed[u]` as `True`.\n     d. For each neighbor `v` of `u` in `adj[u]`:\n        i. If `v` has not been removed (`is_removed[v]` is `False`):\n           - Decrement `degree[v]` by `1`.\n           - If `degree[v]` becomes `1`, `v` is now a leaf. Add `v` to `pq` using `heapq.heappush()`.\n4. **Output:**\n   - Sort `removed_nodes` in increasing order.\n   - Print the sorted `removed_nodes` space-separated.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- **Time Complexity:**\n    - Building adjacency list and calculating degrees: `O(N)`\n    - Initializing priority queue: `O(N)` (if iterating through nodes and pushing leaves) or `O(N log N)` in worst case if all nodes are pushed.\n    - `k` removals: Each `heappop` is `O(log N)`. Each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint when a neighbor is checked). Each `heappush` is `O(log N)`. In total, `O(N)` degree updates and `O(N)` `heappush/heappop` operations over the `k` iterations.\n    - Total: `O(N log N)` (dominated by heap operations).\n- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for adjacency list, degree array, `is_removed` array, and priority queue.\n\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `O(N log N)` is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degree[u] += 1\n        degree[v] += 1\n\n    # Priority queue to store leaves (nodes with degree 1)\n    # The smallest node index will be extracted first\n    pq = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Nodes with degree 0 are isolated, not part of a connected component (unless n=1).\n        # For n > 1, leaves have degree 1.\n        # If n=1, k=0, this loop is not entered. k < n is guaranteed.\n        if degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, i)\n\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    removed_nodes = []\n\n    # Remove k nodes\n    for _ in range(k):\n        if not pq:\n            # This case should ideally not happen if the problem guarantees a valid solution\n            # and k < n.
