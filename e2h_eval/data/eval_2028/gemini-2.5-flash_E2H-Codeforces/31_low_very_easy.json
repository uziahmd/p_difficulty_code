Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Approach for Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The objective is to figure out the fewest extra cards Vanya requires to bring the total sum to zero. I'm given the number of cards found (`n`), the maximum absolute value of a card (`x`), and the values of the cards Vanya already possesses.\n\nMy strategy breaks down into these core steps:\n\n1.  **Get the Lay of the Land:** First, I'll read the input to grasp the specifics of the problem: `n`, `x`, and the values of the found cards.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Sum:** I need to determine the current total value of the found cards. This is simply a matter of summing up all the given values.\n\n3.  **Find the Discrepancy:** The target sum is zero. Thus, I'll compute how far off the current sum is from zero. The absolute value of the current sum represents the magnitude of the deficit (or surplus) I need to address. Let's call this `abs_current_sum`.\n\n4.  **Optimal Card Selection:** To minimize the number of additional cards, Vanya should utilize cards with the largest possible absolute values. The most effective cards are those with values of `-x` (if the current sum is positive) or `x` (if it's negative).\n\n5.  **Compute the Minimum Count:** Each extra card contributes by `x` to the total in absolute terms. Therefore, the minimum number of extra cards needed is calculated by `ceil(abs_current_sum / x)`. In integer arithmetic, this `ceil` is essentially `(abs_current_sum + x - 1) // x`. If `abs_current_sum` is zero, we're done. No extra cards are necessary.\n\nFor the example case with inputs `3 2` and cards `-1 1 2`:\n\n*   `n = 3`, `x = 2`\n*   Current Sum = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2\n*   `abs_current_sum` = `2`\n*   Minimum Cards = `ceil(2 / 2) = 1`. One `-2` card is the solution.\n\nAnd the input case with inputs `2 3` and cards `-2 -2`:\n\n*   `n = 2`, `x = 3`\n*   Current Sum = -2 + (-2) = -4\n*   `abs_current_sum` = `4`\n*   Minimum Cards = `ceil(4 / 3) = 2`. Two `3` cards is the solution.\n",
