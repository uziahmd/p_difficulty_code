Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to find all the positive integers 'n' whose factorial (n!) ends with exactly 'm' zeroes. The goal is to output the count of these 'n' values and then list them in ascending order.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to count those trailing zeroes in n!.  It's all about prime factorization, specifically the factors of 10. Since 10 is 2 * 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is just the number of times 5 appears as a factor. Legendre's formula comes to mind:  `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` – this will keep going as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, the core of the problem is finding 'n' when I'm given 'm' where `Z(n) = m`. I need to understand how `Z(n)` behaves. Let me map out some values and see if I can spot a pattern:\n\n*   Z(1) = Z(2) = Z(3) = Z(4) = 0\n*   Z(5) = Z(6) = Z(7) = Z(8) = Z(9) = 1\n*   Z(10) = Z(11) = Z(12) = Z(13) = Z(14) = 2\n*   Z(15) = Z(16) = Z(17) = Z(18) = Z(19) = 3\n*   Z(20) = Z(21) = Z(22) = Z(23) = Z(24) = 4\n*   Z(25) = 6\n\nAlright, I see it!  `Z(n)` is *non-decreasing*. It either stays the same or goes up as 'n' increases.  It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. Specifically: if `n` isn't a multiple of 5, then `Z(n)` is the same as `Z(n-1)`. When `n` *is* a multiple of 5, the increase depends on how many powers of 5 it contains (e.g., multiples of 25 cause a bigger jump).  Now I need to use this to efficiently search for the desired values of `n`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in its prime factorization. This can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\n\nLet's analyze the function `Z(n)`:\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n    *   If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) = Z(n-1)`.\n    *   If `n` is a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases. For example, `Z(5)=1`, `Z(10)=2`, `Z(15)=3`, `Z(20)=4`.\n    *   A special case is when `n` is a multiple of 25. For example, `Z(24)=4`, but `Z(25)=6`. This is because `25` contributes an additional factor of 5 compared to `5, 10, 15, 20`. In general, `Z(n)` increases by `k` if `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`.\n\nConsider the sequence of `Z(n)` values:\n`Z(1)...Z(4) = 0`\n`Z(5)...Z(9) = 1`\n`Z(10)...Z(14) = 2`\n`Z(15)...Z(19) = 3`\n`Z(20)...Z(24) = 4`\n`Z(25)...Z(29) = 6` (Note: `Z(25)=5+1=6`)\n`Z(30)...Z(34) = 7`\n...\n`Z(45)...Z(49) = 10`\n`Z(50)...Z(54) = 12` (Note: `Z(50)=10+2=12`)\n\nThe key observation is that for any `n`, the value `Z(n)` is fixed for a block of 4 consecutive integers: `n, n+1, n+2, n+3` if `n` is a multiple of 5. More precisely, `Z(5k) = Z(5k+1) = Z(5k+2) = Z(5k+3) = Z(5k+4)`. This is incorrect. The correct statement is: `Z(n) = Z(n-1)` if `n` is not a multiple of 5. So, `Z(5k) = Z(5k+1) = Z(5k+2) = Z(5k+3) = Z(5k+4)` for `k` such that `5k+1, ..., 5k+4` are not multiples of 5. This is always true.\nThis means that if `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n+1) = m`, `Z(n+2) = m`, `Z(n+3) = m`, `Z(n+4) = m`, as long as `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are not multiples of 5.\nThe next value `Z(n+5)` will be greater than `m`.\nTherefore, if `m` is a possible number of trailing zeroes for some `n`, it must be achieved by `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` for some `n` that is a multiple of 5.\nSpecifically, if `Z(N) = m` for some `N`, and `N` is a multiple of 5, then `Z(N) = Z(N+1) = Z(N+2) = Z(N+3) = Z(N+4) = m`.\nThe next value `Z(N+5)` will be `m + k` where `k >= 1`.\nSo, if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` can take, it will always be taken by exactly 5 consecutive integers `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`, where `n` is a multiple of 5.\nFor example, `Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1`. Here `m=1` is achieved by `5,6,7,8,9`.\nAnother example, `Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4`. Here `m=4` is achieved by `20,21,22,23,24`.\nThe only exception is if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` *never* takes. For example, `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`. The value `m=5` is never achieved. In such a case, the count `k` would be 0.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1.  Find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n2.  Calculate `Z(n)`.\n3.  If `Z(n) == m`, then the integers are `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. The count `k` is 5.\n4.  If `Z(n) > m`, then `m` is a value that `Z(x)` never takes (it \"jumps over\" `m`). The count `k` is 0.\n\nTo efficiently find `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`:\nSince `Z(n)` is monotonically increasing, we can use binary search.\nThe maximum value for `m` is 100,000.\nLet's estimate the range for `n`.\n`Z(n) approx n/4` (roughly, since `n/5 + n/25 + ... = n * (1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = n * ( (1/5) / (1 - 1/5) ) = n * (1/4)`).\nSo, if `m = 100,000`, `n` would be approximately `4 * 100,000 = 400,000`.\nA safe upper bound for binary search could be `5 * m + 5` (e.g., `500,005`) or a constant like `500,000`.\n\nLet's refine the search for `n`:\nWe want to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\nWe can binary search for `n` in the range `[1, 5 * m + 5]`.\nThe `check(x)` function for binary search would be `calculate_trailing_zeroes(x) >= m`.\nAfter binary search, `low` will be the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\nLet this `n` be `n_found`.\nThen we calculate `Z(n_found)`.\nIf `Z(n_found) == m`: The answer is `n_found, n_found+1, n_found+2, n_found+3, n_found+4`. Count is 5.\nIf `Z(n_found) > m`: The answer is 0. Count is 0.\n\nExample: `m = 1`\nBinary search for `n` where `Z(n) >= 1`.\n`low = 1, high = 10` (e.g., `5*1+5`).\n`mid = 5`, `Z(5) = 1`. `Z(5) >= 1` is true. Try smaller: `high = 5`.\n`low = 1, high = 5`.\n`mid = 3`, `Z(3) = 0`. `Z(3) >= 1` is false. Try larger: `low = 4`.\n`low = 4, high = 5`.\n`mid = 4`, `Z(4) = 0`. `Z(4) >= 1` is false. Try larger: `low = 5`.\n`low = 5, high = 5`. Loop ends. `n_found = 5`.\n`Z(5) = 1`. This equals `m`. So, output 5 values: `5 6 7 8 9`.\n\nExample: `m = 5`\nBinary search for `n` where `Z(n) >= 5`.\n`low = 1, high = 30` (e.g., `5*5+5`).\n`mid = 15`, `Z(15) = 3`. `Z(15) >= 5` is false. `low = 16`.\n`low = 16, high = 30`.\n`mid = 23`, `Z(23) = 4`. `Z(23) >= 5` is false. `low = 24`.\n`low = 24, high = 30`.\n`mid = 27`, `Z(27) = 6`. `Z(27) >= 5` is true. `high = 27`.\n`low = 24, high = 27`.\n`mid = 25`, `Z(25) = 6`. `Z(25) >= 5` is true. `high = 25`.\n`low = 24, high = 25`.\n`mid = 24`, `Z(24) = 4`. `Z(24) >= 5` is false. `low = 25`.\n`low = 25, high = 25`. Loop ends. `n_found = 25`.\n`Z(25) = 6`. This is `> m` (which is 5). So, output 0 values.\n\nThis approach seems correct and efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! using Legendre's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0 # Factorial not defined for negative numbers, or 0 zeroes.\n    \n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n.
