Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Souvenir Sales: A Knapsack Variant**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which is basically a knapsack problem with a twist.  We need to pick souvenirs, each with a weight and cost, to maximize the total cost without exceeding a maximum weight capacity, `m`.  The real kicker here is those constraints:  `n` up to 100,000, `m` up to 300,000, and critically, the weights (`w_i`) are only 1, 2, or 3.\n\nA standard dynamic programming solution like `O(n*m)` would be too slow because `n*m` is just massive.  But hold on...those small weights are the key!  Since each item only weighs 1, 2 or 3, I can group them by weight. I will create three lists, `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, and `costs_w3` to store the costs of souvenirs with weights 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nThe greedy approach is to take the most expensive souvenirs first. So I'll sort each of those lists in descending order.  Now, I have to figure out the right combination of items from each group. Let's say I choose `k1` items of weight 1, `k2` items of weight 2, and `k3` items of weight 3. My constraint is `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`.\n\nTo quickly sum the costs of the top `k` items in each weight category, I'll calculate prefix sums: `prefix_sum_w1`, `prefix_sum_w2`, and `prefix_sum_w3`. Now, I just need to find the combination of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` that maximizes the total cost.\n\nThe key to efficiency here is to iterate over possible values of `k3` from 0 up to `m / 3` (or the length of `costs_w3`). For each value of `k3`, I calculate the remaining capacity (`m'`). Then I need to optimize the values of k1 and k2. Since `m'` is in a reasonable range, I can iterate over `k2` in a similar way and then determine `k1` to use up the rest of the capacity.  This will result in a solution!\n",
