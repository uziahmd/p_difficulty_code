Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. Let's break this down. We have a street of length *l*, and *n* lanterns at given positions *a<sub>i</sub>*. Each lantern illuminates a certain distance *d* around it, and the goal is to find the *minimum* value of *d* needed to light up the *entire* street.\n\nFirst, I know that to efficiently solve this, I'll start by sorting the lantern positions *a<sub>i</sub>*. This will make it much easier to reason about the coverage.\n\nNow, let's think about the different segments we need to cover. We have three main areas to consider:\n\n1.  **The Beginning:** The start of the street at position 0 needs to be lit. The closest lantern to 0 is *a<sub>0</sub>*. To light up the entire first segment, the radius *d* must be at least *a<sub>0</sub>*.\n\n2.  **The End:** The end of the street at position *l* also needs coverage. The lantern closest to *l* is at position *a<sub>n-1</sub>*.  So, *a<sub>n-1</sub> + d* must be at least *l*, which means *d* needs to be at least *l - a<sub>n-1</sub>*.\n\n3.  **The Gaps Between Lanterns:**  Here's where it gets a little more involved. For any two adjacent lanterns *a<sub>i</sub>* and *a<sub>i+1</sub>*, the segment between them needs to be lit. To cover the *gap* between them, I'm going to have to center my logic at the midpoint: * (a<sub>i</sub> + a<sub>i+1</sub>) / 2*. I have to ensure that radius *d* is at least *half* of the distance between those lanterns. The maximum of these radii between adjacent pairs will be my *d*. In other words, I am taking the largest of *(a<sub>i+1</sub> - a<sub>i</sub>) / 2*.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to take the maximum of three values: *a<sub>0</sub>* (start coverage), *l - a<sub>n-1</sub>* (end coverage), and the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns *(a<sub>i+1</sub> - a<sub>i</sub>) / 2*. That maximum value for *d* will be the solution, and I need to output it with a high level of precision.\n",
