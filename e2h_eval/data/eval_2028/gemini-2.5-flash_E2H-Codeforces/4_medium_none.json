The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. My goal is to write a Python script that efficiently determines the number of spots each player gets over a massive number of rounds.**\n\nFirst, I identified the core elements: the game's rules, the two players (Nikephoros and Polycarpus), their cyclic strategies (sequences A and B), and the scoring mechanism where the loser receives a spot. The critical constraint here is the extremely large number of rounds, up to 2 * 10^9. This immediately tells me that a direct simulation is out of the question; I need a mathematical or cycle-based solution.\n\nThe key insight is the cyclical nature of the players' strategies. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's every `k` rounds. Therefore, the outcome of the game will also be cyclic.  The combined cycle length, where the same moves repeat, is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.  Since `m` and `k` are limited to 1000, the LCM will be at most 1,000,000. That's a reasonable number to simulate directly.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  **Helper Function:** I'll create a function, `get_winner(char_A, char_B)`, which takes the characters representing the players' moves and returns 1 if Nikephoros wins, -1 if Polycarpus wins, and 0 for a draw. This simplifies the logic.\n2.  **Determine the Cycle:** Calculate the LCM of `m` and `k` using the formula `(m * k) // gcd(m, k)`. The greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation can be done using the Euclidean algorithm, and I already have the Python `math.gcd` function if available in the environment.\n3.  **Simulate a Cycle:**  I'll simulate one full cycle of `lcm(m, k)` rounds.  For each round within the cycle, determine the outcome using `get_winner` and count the spots for each player.\n4.  **Extrapolate to `n` Rounds:**  Divide the total rounds `n` by the cycle length to get the number of full cycles. Multiply the spots in one cycle by the number of full cycles.  Then, calculate the remaining rounds `n % cycle_length`, and simulate those individually. Add the spots from the remaining rounds to the results from the full cycles.\n5.  **Output:** Print the final spot counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nI've tested this logic thoroughly using the provided examples, and carefully checked the edge cases. I also ensure that the `gcd` and `lcm` functions are correct.  I've optimized by using the built-in `math.gcd` and a streamlined structure, which provides a fast and correct solution for this problem. The code is ready for implementation, and I'm confident it'll handle the large inputs efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of red spots (losses) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both players use a cyclic strategy: Nikephoros uses a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus uses a sequence `B` of length `k`.\n\nSince `n` can be very large (up to 2 * 10^9), a direct simulation of all `n` rounds would be too slow. However, the strategies are cyclic. This means the sequence of moves and their outcomes will also be cyclic.\n\n**1. Determine the Cycle Length:**\nNikephoros's moves repeat every `m` rounds. Polycarpus's moves repeat every `k` rounds. The combined pattern of (Nikephoros's move, Polycarpus's move) will repeat every `lcm(m, k)` rounds, where `lcm` is the least common multiple.\nThe `lcm(m, k)` can be calculated using the formula: `(m * k) // gcd(m, k)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.\nGiven `m, k <= 1000`, the `lcm(m, k)` will be at most `1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000`. This cycle length is small enough to simulate directly.\n\n**2. Simulate One Full Cycle:**\nWe can iterate `i` from `0` to `lcm(m, k) - 1`. In each iteration:\n*   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n*   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n*   We determine the winner of the round. If Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. If it's a draw, no spots are awarded.\nWe keep a running count of spots for Nikephoros (`nikephoros_spots_in_cycle`) and Polycarpus (`polycarpus_spots_in_cycle`) for these `lcm(m, k)` rounds.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Spots:**\nAfter simulating one full cycle, we know how many spots each player accumulates in `cycle_length` rounds.\n*   The number of full cycles that fit into `n` rounds is `num_full_cycles = n // cycle_length`.\n*   The spots from these full cycles are `num_full_cycles * nikephoros_spots_in_cycle` for Nikephoros and `num_full_cycles * polycarpus_spots_in_cycle` for Polycarpus.\n*   There will be `remaining_rounds = n % cycle_length` rounds left. We simulate these remaining rounds directly, starting from the beginning of the cycle (index 0). We add any spots from these rounds to our total counts.\n\n**Helper Function for Round Outcome:**\nA function `get_winner(char_A, char_B)` can be used to determine the outcome of a single round:\n*   Returns `1` if `char_A` beats `char_B` (Nikephoros wins).\n*   Returns `-1` if `char_B` beats `char_A` (Polycarpus wins).\n*   Returns `0` if `char_A` and `char_B` are the same (draw).\n\n**Example of `get_winner` logic:**\n*   Draw: `R` vs `R`, `S` vs `S`, `P` vs `P`\n*   Nikephoros wins: `R` vs `S`, `S` vs `P`, `P` vs `R`\n*   Polycarpus wins: `R` vs `P`, `S` vs `R`, `P` vs `S`\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Python's `math.gcd` function can be used to calculate the greatest common divisor.\n*   Python handles large integers automatically, so `n` and the total spot counts (which can also be large) will not cause overflow issues.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by simulating one full cycle, which is `O(lcm(m, k))`. Given `m, k <= 1000`, this is at most `O(10^6)`, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate LCM, using math.gcd\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    # m and k are guaranteed to be >= 1, so a and b will be >= 1.\n    # No need to handle cases where a or b is 0.\n    return (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Function to determine the winner of a single round\ndef get_winner(char_A, char_B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the winner of a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n    Args:\n        char_A (str): Nikephoros's move ('R', 'P', or 'S').\n        char_B (str): Polycarpus's move ('R', 'P', or 'S').\n    Returns:\n        1 if Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus gets a spot).\n        -1 if Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros gets a spot).\n        0 if it's a draw.\n    \"\"\"\n    if char_A == char_B:\n        return 0  # Draw\n\n    # Nikephoros wins conditions:\n    # Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock\n    if (char_A == 'R' and char_B == 'S') or \\\n       (char_A == 'S' and char_B == 'P') or \\\n       (char_A == 'P' and char_B == 'R'):\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins\n\n    # If it's not a draw and Nikephoros didn't win, Polycarpus must have won.\n    return -1  # Polycarpus wins\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input()\n    B = input()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Calculate the length of the combined cycle of moves\n    cycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Simulate one full cycle to count spots for each player\n    nikephoros_spots_in_cycle = 0\n    polycarpus_spots_in_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        nikephoros_move = A[i % m]  # Nikephoros's move for this round\n        polycarpus_move = B[i % k]  # Polycarpus's move for this round\n        \n        winner_status = get_winner(nikephoros_move, polycarpus_move)\n        \n        if winner_status == 1:\n            polycarpus_spots_in_cycle += 1\n        elif winner_status == -1:\n            nikephoros_spots_in_cycle += 1\n\n    # Calculate total spots based on the number of full cycles\n    num_full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    total_nikephoros_spots = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_spots_in_cycle\n    total_polycarpus_spots = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_spots_in_cycle\n\n    # Simulate the remaining rounds (less than one full cycle)\n    remaining_rounds = n % cycle_length\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        nikephoros_move = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        winner_status = get_winner(nikephoros_move, polycarpus_move)\n        \n        if winner_status == 1:\n            total_polycarpus_spots += 1\n        elif winner_status == -1:\n            total_nikephoros_spots += 1\n            \n    # Print the final spot counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus\n    print(total_nikephoros_spots, total_polycarpus_spots)\n\n# Call the solver function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
