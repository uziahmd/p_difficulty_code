    "thought": "**Calculating Gilded Cells on a Rectangular Plate**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem involves a rectangular plate, and we're looking to find the total number of \"gilded\" cells. The plate has a width `w` and height `h`. There are `k` rings of gilded cells. Each ring is defined by the *bordering cells* of an inner rectangle within the larger plate.  Importantly, the first ring touches the edge, and subsequent rings are spaced one cell apart. This means the dimensions of the inner rectangles shrink with each ring. For example, for a ring `i`, the inner rectangle dimensions are `w - 4(i - 1)` and `h - 4(i - 1)`.\n\nThe crucial part is figuring out how to count the border cells. A key observation is this formula: The border of an `W x H` rectangle can be found with `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` cells *if* both W and H are greater than or equal to 2. If, however, one dimension is 1 (e.g., 1xH), the border consists of the entire `W * H` cells. It's really the problem's definition of \"bordering cells\".\n\nSo, to solve this, I'll loop through each ring from 1 to `k`.  In each loop, I compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. I then apply the right formula to determine the number of gilded cells in the current ring. And finally, I add those cells to a total counter. The tricky part is the \"bordering cell\" definition - I need to make sure I handle the 1-dimension cases correctly.\n\nThe input `w, h, k` are read from input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, then mapped to integers. The final output is calculated and written to standard output. After some testing, the program looks sound.\n",
