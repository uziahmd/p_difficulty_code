He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My plan for tackling this competitive programming problem is taking shape.** I've got a solid understanding of the rules and constraints now.  I need to write a Python script to take in the problem size `n`, the number of days `k`, and a list of problem difficulties `a`, and produce the maximum total profit along with a way of splitting up the problems across the days.\n\nThe core idea is this: to maximize total profit, I need to make the *largest* problems the \"maximum\" difficulty on each day. These maximums are basically what makes each day's profit. If there are any other problems in a day, their difficulty doesn't matter, just the highest one does. So, to get the maximum overall profit, I should pick the `k` biggest difficulties from the list `a`. If there are any ties in difficulty values, the order doesn't matter, just that I pick `k` values.\n\nWith these `k` difficulties chosen, I need to partition the original problem list, or array, such that each maximum problem is in a different segment, and is the largest in that segment. A simple partition method is to put each of the `k` largest values as the *last* element of their respective day's segment. That way, that maximum difficulty *is* indeed the segment's maximum!\n\nTo get the program going, I'll first sort the problem difficulties in descending order to identify the `k` largest problems. Next, I will keep track of where the `k` maximum problems are originally in the array, using indices. With those indices, I will easily construct the segments. I'll make the maximum elements *the last* elements of each segment for ease. The lengths of these segments are the distribution of problems `t_j` for each day, and I can output them. Now, it's just a matter of writing the Python code to do this!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on a particular day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. Our goal is to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Understanding the Maximum Profit**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily profits, we should make each daily profit as large as possible. The largest possible value for any daily profit is simply the largest difficulty among all problems in `a`. If we select `k` problems from the entire list `a` to be the \"maximums\" for each of the `k` days, then to maximize their sum, these `k` problems must be the `k` largest difficulties in `a`.\n\nFor example, if `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` and `k = 3`, the `k=3` largest difficulties are `9, 6, 5`. Their sum is `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`. This sum represents the maximum possible total profit. It's always possible to achieve this sum, as shown in the construction below.\n\n**Constructing the Partition**\n\nOnce we've identified the `k` largest difficulties, say `M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k`, we need to find their original indices in the `a` array. Let these indices be `p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k`. To ensure each `M_j` contributes to the total profit, we must assign each `M_j` to a different day's segment, and ensure `M_j` is the maximum within its segment.\n\nA simple and valid strategy is to make each `M_j` the *last* problem solved on its respective day.\nLet's sort the original indices of these `k` largest problems in ascending order: `s_1 < s_2 < \\dots < s_k`.\n\nWe can then define the `k` segments (days) as follows:\n1.  **Day 1**: Problems from index `0` to `s_1`. The length is `t_1 = s_1 - 0 + 1`.\n2.  **Day 2**: Problems from index `s_1 + 1` to `s_2`. The length is `t_2 = s_2 - (s_1 + 1) + 1 = s_2 - s_1`.\n3.  ...\n4.  **Day `j` (for `1 < j < k`)**: Problems from index `s_{j-1} + 1` to `s_j`. The length is `t_j = s_j - s_{j-1}`.\n5.  **Day `k`**: Problems from index `s_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1` (the end of the list). The length is `t_k = (n-1) - (s_{k-1} + 1) + 1 = n - s_{k-1} - 1`.\n\n**Why this construction works:**\n*   **All `n` problems are solved**: The segments cover indices `0` to `n-1` exactly once. The sum of `t_j` values is `(s_1+1) + (s_2-s_1) + \\dots + (s_k-s_{k-1}) + (n-s_k-1) = n`. (There was a slight error in my formula for `t_k` in the thought process, it should be `n - s_{k-1}` if `s_k` is the last index of the `k`-th segment, but here `s_k` is just one of the chosen maximums and the last segment goes to `n-1`. The correct `t_k` is `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)` for the number of problems from index `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`. Let's correct this. The last segment starts at `s_{k-1}+1` and ends at `n-1`. Its length is `(n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1) + 1 = n - s_{k-1} - 1`. Oh, I see, the last `s_k` is not used in the formula for `t_k` directly. It's `s_{k-1}` that defines the split for the last day. The actual `s_k` is simply contained within this last segment `[s_{k-1}+1, n-1]`.\n    Let's re-verify the sum of lengths:\n    `t_1 = s_1 + 1`\n    `t_2 = s_2 - s_1`\n    ...\n    `t_{k-1} = s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}`\n    `t_k = n - (s_{k-1} + 1)` (This is the number of problems from index `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`. The `(n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1) + 1` formula is correct. So `n - s_{k-1} - 1` is correct for `t_k`. )\n    Sum: `(s_1 + 1) + (s_2 - s_1) + \\dots + (s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}) + (n - s_{k-1} - 1)`\n    This is a telescoping sum: `s_1 - s_1 + s_2 - s_2 + \\dots + s_{k-1} - s_{k-1} + 1 + n - 1 = n`. The sum is correct.\n\n*   **Exactly `k` days**: We explicitly define `k` segments.\n*   **Each day at least one problem**:\n    *   `t_1 = s_1 + 1 \\ge 1` since `s_1 \\ge 0`.\n    *   `t_j = s_j - s_{j-1} \\ge 1` for `j=2, \\dots, k-1` because `s_j` are distinct and sorted, so `s_j > s_{j-1}`.\n    *   `t_k = n - s_{k-1} - 1`. Since `s_{k-1} < n-1` (the last chosen maximum is before the end of the array, or is the last element itself), `s_{k-1} + 1 \\le n-1`. Thus `n - (s_{k-1} + 1) \\ge 0`. The length `t_k` is `(n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1) + 1`, which is the count of problems from index `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`. This must be at least 1, as `s_{k-1}` is at most `n-1`, and if `s_{k-1} = n-1`, then `k` must be 1. If `k > 1`, then `s_{k-1} < n-1` because `s_k` must be `n-1` if `s_{k-1}` is `n-2`.\n    A simpler argument: `s_k` is one of the `k` chosen indices. `s_k` must fall into the last segment `[s_{k-1}+1, n-1]`. Since `s_k \\ge s_{k-1}+1`, this segment contains at least `a[s_k]`, so its length is at least 1.\n*   **`M_j` is maximum in its segment**: By selecting the `k` largest values, `M_j` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to any other `a_i` that was *not* among the `k` largest. Within its segment, `a[s_j]` is one of the `k` chosen maximums. Any other problem `a[x]` in the same segment `j` (where `x \\ne s_j`) must have `a[x] \\le a[s_j]` because if `a[x] > a[s_j]`, then `a[x]` would have been chosen among the `k` largest instead of `a[s_j]` (or in addition to `a[s_j]` if `a[x]` is also one of the `k` largest, in which case `a[s_j]` is still a valid maximum for its day). This construction ensures that `a[s_j]` is indeed the maximum of its segment.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the list `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)` for each problem in `a`.\n4.  Sort this list in descending order based on `value`. If values are equal, their relative order doesn't impact the total profit or validity of the partition.\n5.  Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These are the `k` largest problems.\n6.  Calculate the `total_profit` by summing the `value` components of these `k` problems.\n7.  Extract the `original_index` components of these `k` problems. Sort these indices in ascending order to get `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k`.\n8.  Construct the list of daily lengths `t_j`:\n    *   Initialize `t = []`.\n    *   `current_start_index = 0`.\n    *   For each `s_j` in `s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}`:\n        *   `length = s_j - current_start_index + 1`.\n        *   Append `length` to `t`.\n        *   `current_start_index = s_j + 1`.\n    *   For the last day (which starts at `current_start_index` and goes to `n-1`):\n        *   `length = n - current_start_index`.\n        *   Append `length` to `t`.\n    *   Note: The last `s_k` is not used in defining the cut points for the segments, it just needs to be included in the last segment. The problem is about defining `k-1` cut points, and the `k-1` indices `s_1, ..., s_{k-1}` serve this purpose. The last segment naturally extends to `n-1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**\n`n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  `indexed_a = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  Sorted `indexed_a` by value (descending):\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  Top `k=3` problems: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`\n4.  `total_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n5.  Original indices: `[6, 3, 0]`. Sorted: `s = [0, 3, 6]`. (`s_1=0, s_2=3, s_3=6`)\n6.  Construct `t`:\n    *   `current_start_index = 0`.\n    *   For `s_1 = 0` (first element in `s`):\n        *   `length = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`. `t = [1]`.\n        *   `current_start_index = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   For `s_2 = 3` (second element in `s`):\n        *   `length = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. `t = [1, 3]`.\n        *   `current_start_index = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   (Loop finishes for `s_{k-1}` which is `s_2` here)\n    *   Last day: `length = n - current_start_index = 8 - 4 = 4`. `t = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\nOutput:\n`20`\n`1 3 4`\n\nThis is a valid solution, although different from the example output `3 2 3`.
