For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Classifying Musical Triads: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify a musical triad as major, minor, or something \"strange.\" I'm familiar with music theory, so the concepts are clear. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes numerically.  I'll use integers from 0 to 11, with C being 0, C# being 1, and so on. A dictionary, `note_to_int`, will be perfect for this mapping.\n\nThe input will be three space-separated note strings. I'll read those in, convert them to integers using my dictionary, and store them in a list.\n\nNow comes the crucial part: determining the distances between the notes. The problem defines distance as the number of semitones from the *lower* note to the *higher* note.  Since the musical scale is cyclic, I'll use the modulo operator to handle this. Given two notes, a and b, the distance from a to b will be `(b - a + 12) % 12`. This captures the cyclical nature nicely.\n\nSince the triad is an *unordered* set, I need to consider all possible orderings of the notes.  A simple and effective approach is to sort the numerical values. Let's call them `n_min`, `n_mid`, and `n_max`.  Then, I'll calculate the distances:\n\n*   `d1 = (n_mid - n_min + 12) % 12`\n*   `d2 = (n_max - n_mid + 12) % 12`\n*   `d3 = (n_min - n_max + 12) % 12` (This is technically redundant, but helpful for debugging)\n\nNow, I can check for the major and minor triad patterns:\n\n*   **Major:**  `d1 == 4` and `d2 == 3` (or any cyclic permutation of that).  The total distance `d1 + d2` is then 7.\n*   **Minor:** `d1 == 3` and `d2 == 4` (or any cyclic permutation of that).  Again, the total distance will be 7.\n\nIf the distances don't fit either of these patterns, it's a \"strange\" triad. The problem states that classification is unambiguous, so this approach should work reliably. With this plan in mind, I can easily translate these steps into Python code, leveraging the built-in functions for sorting and modulo arithmetic. This should be a straightforward task, and I can have this script up and running in no time.\n",
