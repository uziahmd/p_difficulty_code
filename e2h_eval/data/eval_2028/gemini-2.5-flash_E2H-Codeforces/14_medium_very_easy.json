He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down.** The problem's pretty straightforward: find all numbers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. First, I need to figure out how to count those zeroes. It's all about factors of 5 in `n!`, because there are always more factors of 2 than 5. Legendre's formula does the trick: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` where `Z(n)` is the count of zeroes.\n\nNow, I need to understand how `Z(n)` behaves. It's non-decreasing and jumps up only when `n` is a multiple of 5. I worked out some examples: `Z(5)=1, Z(10)=2, Z(25)=6`, and so on. Notice that `Z(n)` often stays the same for a few values of `n`. For example, `Z(5)` to `Z(9)` are all `1`.\n\nThis means, for a given `m`, if I find an `n` where `Z(n) = m`, the next four numbers (unless one of them is a multiple of 5) will also have `m` trailing zeroes. Like, if `n=5`, `n` is `5 6 7 8 9`.  But, there are also \"gaps\". Like between `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`, there is no `n` for `Z(n)=5`. That's important!\n\nThe largest `m` is `100,000`. If I were to iterate all `n` from 1, it will be slow. If I estimate `Z(n) = n/4` as a starting point. So `n` won't get too big. To find the right value of `n` for a given `m`, I'll use binary search. I implemented a `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function for the binary search. It loops a few times, so it's efficient enough. My high bound will be `5 * m`.\n\nSo, the game plan: binary search to find the *smallest* `n` where `Z(n) >= m`. This gives me an `n_candidate`. If `Z(n_candidate) == m`, then I've got a sequence of 5 numbers! The first number in this sequence must be a multiple of 5 (since it's the smallest one that works). If `Z(n_candidate) > m`, then there are no solutions.\n\nI checked all those edge cases and potential bugs. My Python code should work efficiently. It'll read in `m`, do the binary search, count the zeroes, and print the results in the correct format (`k` and then `k` numbers). It's all about finding that right starting point and checking if it actually *is* the right starting point, then handling \"impossible\" `m` values correctly (those leading to a zero count). I think I've got this one!\n",
