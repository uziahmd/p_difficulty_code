A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this \"Soft Drinking\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so we've got this competitive programming problem where we need to figure out how many toasts each friend can have, given limited resources of drinks, limes, and salt. The key is to break down the problem into individual resources and their constraints.  First, let's identify the inputs: `n` friends, `k` bottles of drink, `l` ml per bottle, `c` limes, `d` slices per lime, `p` grams of salt, `nl` ml per friend per toast, and `np` grams of salt per friend per toast.\n\nMy approach is going to be to calculate how many toasts we can make based on *each* resource.  Essentially, what's the maximum number of toasts that drink allows, limes allow, and salt allows? I'll do this by figuring out the *individual* toasts per resource first and then will find the *minimum* across the three resources. That minimum value becomes the bottleneck; it limits the total number of toasts we can make *across all friends*.  We then divide this \"total\" number of possible toasts by the number of friends, `n`, because the problem states they all have the same amount.\n\nLet's work through the resources individually:\n\n1.  **Drink:**  The total drink is `k * l` ml. Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. So, the number of *individual* toasts possible from drink is `(k * l) // nl` (integer division, no partial toasts).\n2.  **Limes:**  The total lime slices are `c * d`. Each friend needs one slice, so individual toasts from limes are `c * d`.\n3.  **Salt:** The total salt is `p` grams.  Each friend needs `np` grams per toast, so individual toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n\nNow, the total individual toasts possible will be limited by the *smallest* of these three numbers, basically `min(drink, lime, salt)`. This is because we can't make more toasts than the scarcest resource allows. After calculating this, which represents *all* the toasts made possible by the available resources, we divide by `n` to get the number of toasts *per friend*.\n\nI'm confident in this approach. It seems logical and accounts for the resource limitations. Integer division is essential to ensure we don't have fractional toasts. Now, let's transform this into Python code. The code will simply read the input, perform these calculations, find the minimum, and divide by the number of friends. I'll test it out with a few examples to confirm the logic. Let's see if this works!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given a set of resources and requirements per friend per toast. All friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nLet's break down the available resources and the requirements:\n\n**Input Variables:**\n*   `n`: Number of friends.\n*   `k`: Number of bottles of soft drink.\n*   `l`: Milliliters of drink per bottle.\n*   `c`: Number of limes.\n*   `d`: Number of slices per lime.\n*   `p`: Grams of salt.\n*   `nl`: Milliliters of drink needed per friend per toast.\n*   `np`: Grams of salt needed per friend per toast.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nWe need to find out how many *individual* toasts can be made in total based on each resource. An \"individual toast\" refers to one friend making one toast.\n\n1.  **Drink:**\n    *   Total milliliters of drink available: `k * l`\n    *   Milliliters needed per individual toast: `nl`\n    *   Total individual toasts possible from the drink: `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division since we can't make partial toasts).\n\n2.  **Limes:**\n    *   Total lime slices available: `c * d`\n    *   Slices needed per individual toast: 1 (the problem states \"a slice of lime\").\n    *   Total individual toasts possible from limes: `(c * d) // 1` (which simplifies to `c * d`).\n\n3.  **Salt:**\n    *   Total grams of salt available: `p`\n    *   Grams needed per individual toast: `np`\n    *   Total individual toasts possible from salt: `p // np`.\n\n**Determining the Bottleneck:**\n\nThe total number of individual toasts that can be made across all friends is limited by the resource that allows the fewest toasts. So, we take the minimum of the three values calculated above:\n`total_individual_toasts_possible = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)`\n\n**Toasts per Friend:**\n\nSince there are `n` friends and they all must make the same amount of toasts, we divide the `total_individual_toasts_possible` by the number of friends (`n`).\n`toasts_per_friend = total_individual_toasts_possible // n`\n\nThis `toasts_per_friend` is the final answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample: `3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1`)**\n*   `n = 3, k = 4, l = 5, c = 10, d = 8, p = 100, nl = 3, np = 1`\n\n1.  **Drink:** `(4 * 5) // 3 = 20 // 3 = 6` individual toasts.\n2.  **Limes:** `(10 * 8) // 1 = 80 // 1 = 80` individual toasts.\n3.  **Salt:** `100 // 1 = 100` individual toasts.\n\n*   `total_individual_toasts_possible = min(6, 80, 100) = 6`.\n*   `toasts_per_friend = 6 // 3 = 2`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the single line of input and split it into parts.\n    line_parts = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\n    # Parse the integer values from the input parts.\n    n = int(line_parts[0])  # Number of friends\n    k = int(line_parts[1])  # Number of drink bottles\n    l = int(line_parts[2])  # Milliliters per bottle\n    c = int(line_parts[3])  # Number of limes\n    d = int(line_parts[4])  # Slices per lime\n    p = int(line_parts[5])  # Grams of salt\n    nl = int(line_parts[6]) # Milliliters of drink needed per friend per toast\n    np = int(line_parts[7]) # Grams of salt needed per friend per toast\n\n    # Calculate the total number of individual toasts possible based on each resource.\n    # An \"individual toast\" means one friend making one toast.\n\n    # 1.
