He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Validating a String Against a Specific Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about a Python script to validate a string `S` based on a pretty specific rule set. Let's break down how I'm going to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to define the valid string structure. It's essentially three stages: a string of 'a's, followed by 'b's, then 'c's. There has to be at least one of each character. The important part is the constraint on the number of 'c's. It has to be either equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both).\n\nI need to confirm the sequence. The string *must* be sorted lexicographically, meaning all 'a's come first, then 'b's, and finally 'c's. No exceptions. Think of it this way: as I'm iterating through the string, I need to keep track of what I *should* be seeing at each point.\n\nI'm thinking of using a state machine-like approach. I'll need to initialize and update counters for 'a', 'b', and 'c' as I go through the string. Also, I have to keep track of the expected character (a, b, or c) at any given position, ensuring that the characters are in the right sequence. The logic would need to ensure the sequence remains lexicographically sorted.\n\nFinally, after I've processed the entire string, I'll check if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's to satisfy the condition. Then I can return True/False based on whether the string adheres to all the rules.\n",
