    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Array Stabilization\" problem, and my initial thought is, this seems straightforward enough, but let's make sure we nail down the optimal approach. The core is all about minimizing the instability of an array after removing one element. \"Instability\" is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\nMy immediate understanding is that we're given an array, `a`, with `n` integers. The goal is to strategically remove a single element and then calculate the instability of the resulting array. The constraints aren't too restrictive; `n` can go up to 10^5, and the elements themselves are bounded by 10^5 as well.\n\nI looked at the examples to reinforce my understanding of the problem. Example 1 shows that by removing the right element, we can significantly reduce the instability. Example 2 clarifies that we can have an instability of zero if we have repeating numbers and remove an instance of the repeated number.\n\nTo solve this efficiently, I recognize a key insight: To minimize the instability, we need to bring the maximum down and the minimum up. It's a simple, and rather obvious, relationship, but crucial to understanding the problem. So, I figure, sorting the array is the most straightforward way to work with it. That way the smallest and largest and their adjacent values are clear. Once sorted, the original minimum will be `a[0]`, and the original maximum will be `a[n-1]`.\n\nNow, the important consideration is *which* element to remove.  The array is sorted, so removing the smallest or largest elements seem like the most likely candidates to minimize the instability.  If we remove the smallest (`a[0]`), the new minimum will be `a[1]`, and the new maximum will still be `a[n-1]`.  The instability in this case will be `a[n-1] - a[1]`.\n\nSimilarly, if we remove the largest element (`a[n-1]`), the new maximum will be `a[n-2]`, and the new minimum will be `a[0]`. This leads to an instability of `a[n-2] - a[0]`.\n\nIt's tempting to think about removing any element besides the first and the last. However, those removals won't be as effective because you'd only potentially reduce the instability if the removed number were particularly far away from the max or min. Therefore, the problem is most likely solved by only checking the two previous cases. So now the question is: can removing any other element besides the min and max be the optimal solution?\n",
