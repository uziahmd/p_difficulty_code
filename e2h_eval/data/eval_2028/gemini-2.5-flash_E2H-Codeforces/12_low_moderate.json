The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Xenia and the Ringroad: Algorithm Development**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's see... I need to write a Python script for this.  First, the essentials:  `n` is the number of houses, `m` is the number of tasks, and `a_i` tells me where to go for the *i*-th task. Movement's only clockwise, takes one time unit per house, and I start at house 1.  Got it. Gotta solve these tasks in order. I'm after the *minimum* total time.\n\nAlright, the core of the algorithm will involve tracking my current position (`current_pos`) and the total time elapsed (`total_time`).  I'll initialize `current_pos` to 1 and `total_time` to 0.\n\nNow, for each task, from `a_1` to `a_m`: I need to figure out the fastest way to get from `current_pos` to `a_i`.  Clockwise only.  This is the key.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking to approach the movement calculation:\n\n*   **Case 1:  Target house is *at* or *past* me:** If `a_i` is greater than or equal to `current_pos`, then the time's simply `a_i - current_pos`. I just move forward. `current_pos` updates to `a_i`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Target house is *behind* me:** If `a_i` is less than `current_pos`, things get interesting. I have to go the long way around. I'd move from `current_pos` to `n`, then from `n` to 1, and finally from 1 up to `a_i`.  The total time for this becomes `(n - current_pos) + 1 + (a_i - 1)`, which simplifies to `n - current_pos + a_i`. Again, `current_pos` updates to `a_i`.\n\nI've been playing with combining these cases, trying for a more elegant solution with modular arithmetic. A formula like `(target_pos - current_pos + n) % n` *almost* works if the house indices start at 0 (instead of 1), but I keep finding myself preferring the explicit cases for clarity. Sticking to the two cases should be fine.  I'm confident I can make the Python script work with that.\n\nLet's test this logic out with the example: `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and tasks `a = [3, 2, 3]`.  Initial state: `current_pos = 1`, `total_time = 0`.  Task 1 is `3`. Okay, seems clear. I'm ready to code.\n",
