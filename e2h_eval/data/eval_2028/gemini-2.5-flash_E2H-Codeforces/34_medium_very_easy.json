And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script to find the average sleep time over a certain number of weeks. Each week is made up of a specific, consecutive number of days (k), and I have records for the sleep time of n days. The core of the problem is figuring out the correct formula to calculate the average.\n\nInitially, I defined a \"week\" and figured the number of these \"weeks\" I'd have. This turns out to be `n - k + 1`.  Then, I represented each week's sleep time as `S_i`, the sum of sleep times for those `k` consecutive days. The average of that week is `S_i / k`. The tricky part: what does the problem actually want as the final output: The average of the *averages*, or something else?\n\nI started with the most straightforward approach: Calculating the average of the *averages* of the weeks.  But the example made me doubt this.\n\nThe example gave me an incorrect computation, which confused me. Looking at the example output and re-reading the problem statement very carefully, I started to think that the problem was asking for the average of the *sums* of sleep times for each week, *not* the averages per week. I realized the example text was a misleading. After carefully re-evaluating the example data, I determined that the formula should be the sum of all week sums (`S_i`) divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nTo get the sum of all the `S_i` values, I thought of a brute-force approach which would be `O(k * n)`, but for large values of `n`, this would not work. This led me to develop a sliding window technique. This sliding window approach uses the sum of the previous window (k-day interval) and update it to the next window. This approach would be `O(n)`.  The rest was straightforward: calculating the initial sum, updating the window sum as I moved through the data, summing these, and finally dividing by the correct number of weeks. This method is `O(n)`.\n\nI then worked through edge cases: `k=n` (only one week), and `k=1` (each day is a week) and confirmed that the algorithm behaved as I expected.\n\nI also considered potential overflow with large numbers, checking against the largest possible inputs that matched the constraints and checked the output format to match the question.\n",
