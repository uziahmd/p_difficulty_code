    "thought": "**The Frog's Leap: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Frog Jumping\" problem to tackle. The gist is, there's a frog that starts at zero and can hop either 'a' steps forward or 'b' steps backward. The goal is to figure out how many distinct positions the frog can reach within a given range [0, x], and then sum those counts for all x from 0 to 'm'. Simple, right? (Not quite...)\n\nThe core challenge is that the frog *can't* jump outside the bounds [0, x]. This adds a significant layer of complexity because a position is only reachable if it's part of a valid, contained path. So it's not simply about figuring out which numbers can be expressed as combinations of 'a' and 'b'. It’s really about the *history* of the path.\n\nMy initial thought was to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) for each 'x' to trace out the reachable positions. Start at zero, explore all valid jumps (+a, -b), mark the reachable points, and continue until no new positions are found. Simple. But with 'm' potentially up to 10^9, doing this for every 'x' is clearly a non-starter.\n\nThe breakthrough insight lies in realizing that all reachable positions must be multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'a' and 'b'. That's the first major reduction. If gcd(a,b) = g, then we can divide a, b, and m by g to reduce the problem and then scale back the solution.\n\nWith the assumption that gcd(a,b) = 1, I then thought about what it *actually* means to be reachable, considering the \"intermediate\" position constraint (the frog never leaves [0,x]).\n\nAfter some thinking, I think Dijkstra's algorithm might be useful here. The core idea is to find the smallest \"base\" reachable number for each of the remainders (modulo 'a') starting from 0:\n\nLet `dist[rem]` represent the smallest number greater than or equal to 0, that the frog can reach when its remainder when divided by `a` is `rem`.\n\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` (starting position), all other `dist[rem]` to infinity.\n\nThe edges on the graph are remainders. From a given remainder we can jump forward or backward, and update the weights accordingly. Then the sum of the reachable positions can be quickly calculated, for each remainder, by accounting for all the positions less than or equal to x that share that specific remainder.\n\nUltimately, I’m leaning towards a strategy of calculating a ‘base’ set of reachable positions using Dijkstra's algorithm (or a similar approach) and then using those base reachable numbers to derive the count of reachable numbers within [0,x] for any x efficiently. The Frobenius coin problem is also relevant if we remove the upper bounds constraint.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position the frog can reach must be a multiple of `g`.\nLet `a' = a/g` and `b' = b/g`. Now `gcd(a', b') = 1`.\nIf the frog is restricted to `[0, x]`, all reachable points `p` must be multiples of `g`.\nLet `S_x` be the set of reachable points for `a, b` within `[0, x]`.\nLet `S'_k` be the set of reachable points for `a', b'` within `[0, k]`.\nThen `p \\in S_x` if and only if `p/g \\in S'_{x/g}` (assuming `x` is a multiple of `g`).\nMore generally, `f(x)` (for `a, b`) is equal to `f'(floor(x/g))` (for `a', b'`).\nSo we need to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`.\nLet `M_prime = floor(m/g)`. The sum can be rewritten:\n`sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} g * f'(k) + (m % g + 1) * f'(M_prime)`.\nThis means we can solve the problem for `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`, and `M_prime = floor(m/g)`, and then use this formula to get the final answer.\nFrom now on, we assume `gcd(a, b) = 1`.\n\n**Calculating `f(x)` for `gcd(a, b) = 1`**\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, *without any upper bound `x`*.\nWe can find `dist[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]` using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n1. Initialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, a-1]`.\n2. Use a min-priority queue `pq` storing `(value, remainder)`. Add `(0, 0)` to `pq`.\n3. While `pq` is not empty:\n   a. Extract `(d, u)` with the minimum `d` from `pq`.\n   b. If `d > dist[u]`, continue (already found a shorter path).\n   c. Consider a jump of `-b` from `d`. The new position is `d-b`.\n      The remainder modulo `a` for `d-b` is `v = (u - b % a + a) % a`.\n      If `d-b >= 0` and `d-b < dist[v]`:\n         `dist[v] = d-b`\n         Add `(dist[v], v)` to `pq`.\n\nThe values `dist[r]` can be up to `a*b` (related to the Frobenius number), but since `a, b <= 10^5`, `a` is at most `10^5`. Dijkstra's algorithm runs in `O(A log A)` time, where `A` is the number of nodes (`a` in this case), which is efficient enough.\n\nOnce we have `dist[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\nFor a given `x`, the set of reachable points `S_x` consists of all `p` such that:\n1. `0 <= p <= x`.\n2. `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` for some `r`.\n3. `p >= dist[r]`.\n4. All intermediate points on a path from `0` to `p` must be in `[0, x]`.\n\nThe condition \"all intermediate points on a path from `0` to `p` must be in `[0, x]`\" is crucial.\nIf `p` is reachable from `0` staying within `[0, x]`, then for any `k \\ge 0`, `p+k*a` is also reachable staying within `[0, x]` if `p+k*a <= x`. This is because `p+k*a` can be reached by first reaching `p` and then making `k` jumps of `+a`. All these jumps are valid if `p+k*a <= x`.\nSo, for each `r \\in [0, a-1]`, the reachable points `p` in `[0, x]` that satisfy `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` are `dist[r], dist[r]+a, dist[r]+2a, ..., dist[r]+k*a` where `dist[r]+k*a <= x`.\nThe number of such points is `floor((x - dist[r])/a) + 1`, provided `dist[r] <= x`. If `dist[r] > x`, there are no such points.\nSo, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\n\n**Calculating the Sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`**\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=0}^{m} max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\nLet `S_r = sum_{i=0}^{m} max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\nThe term `max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1)` is `0` if `i < dist[r]`.\nFor `i >= dist[r]`, it is `floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1`.\nLet `k = floor((i - dist[r])/a)`. The term is `k+1`.\nThe sum `S_r` becomes `sum_{i=dist[r]}^{m} (floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - dist[r]`. Then `i = j + dist[r]`. The sum becomes `sum_{j=0}^{m-dist[r]} (floor(j/a) + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - dist[r]`. If `N < 0`, `S_r = 0`. Otherwise, we need `sum_{j=0}^{N} (floor(j/a) + 1)`.\nThis sum can be calculated efficiently.\nThe terms `floor(j/a) + 1` take values:\n- `1` for `j = 0, ..., a-1` (`a` terms)\n- `2` for `j = a, ..., 2a-1` (`a` terms)\n- ...\n- `k+1` for `j = k*a, ..., (k+1)*a-1` (`a` terms)\n\nLet `num_blocks = N // a`.\nThe sum `sum_{j=0}^{N} (floor(j/a) + 1)` can be split into:\n1. Full blocks: `sum_{k=0}^{num_blocks-1} (a * (k+1))`\n2. Partial block: `sum_{j=num_blocks*a}^{N} (num_blocks + 1)`\n\n`sum_{k=0}^{num_blocks-1} (a * (k+1))`\n`= a * sum_{k=1}^{num_blocks} k`\n`= a * num_blocks * (num_blocks + 1) / 2`.\n\nThe partial block has `N - num_blocks*a + 1` terms, each equal to `num_blocks + 1`.\nSo, `(N - num_blocks*a + 1) * (num_blocks + 1)`.\n\nTotal `S_r = (a * num_blocks * (num_blocks + 1) // 2) + ((N - num_blocks*a + 1) * (num_blocks + 1))`.\nIf `N < 0`, `S_r = 0`.\n\nThe final answer is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} S_r`.\nSince `a` can be up to `10^5`, this sum is `O(a)`.\nThe total time complexity will be `O(a log a)` for Dijkstra + `O(a)` for summing `S_r`. This is efficient enough.\nThe maximum value of `m` is `10^9`. `N` can be `10^9`. `num_blocks` can be `10^9`. The sum can be large, so use 64-bit integers (Python handles large integers automatically).\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `m=7, a=5, b=3`**\n1. `g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`. No transformation needed.\n2. Dijkstra for `dist[r]` where `r \\in [0, 4]`:\n   - `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n   - `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n   - Pop `(0, 0)`:\n     - `d=0, u=0`. Consider `d-b = 0-3 = -3`. `v = (0-3+5)%5 = 2`. `dist[2]` is still `inf`. `dist[2] = -3`. This is wrong. `d-b` must be `>=0`.\n     - The Dijkstra should be `dist[v] = min(dist[v], d + b)` for `v = (u-b+a)%a`. This finds smallest `P` s.t. `P \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `P = k*a + l*b`.\n     - Wait, the problem is `k*a - l*b`.\n     - The standard Dijkstra for `dist[r]` (smallest non-negative `P` s.t. `P \\equiv r \\pmod a`) from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps is as follows:\n       `dist[0]=0`, others `inf`. `pq = [(0,0)]`.\n       Pop `(0,0)`. `u=0, d=0`.\n       Consider jump `-b`: `0-b = -3`. Not `>=0`.\n       No, the graph edges are `r -> (r-b+a)%a` with weight `b`.\n       The graph is `u -> (u-b)%a` with weight `b`.\n       `dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + b)` is for `P = k*a + l*b`.\n       For `P = k*a - l*b`, the values of `dist[r]` are the smallest non-negative `P` for each `r`.\n       If we are at `d` (which is `dist[u]`), we can reach `d-b`. If `d-b >= 0`, then `d-b` is a candidate for `dist[(u-b+a)%a]`.\n       This is precisely the Dijkstra formulation I wrote initially. Let's re-trace carefully.\n       `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n       `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n       Pop `(0, 0)`: `d=0, u=0`.\n         `v = (0-3+5)%5 = 2`. `new_val = 0-3 = -3`. Since `new_val < 0`, this path is invalid.\n       This means from `0` we can only jump `+a`.\n       The only way to get a non-zero `dist[r]` is if `0-b` is valid.\n       If `b > a`, then `0-b` is negative.\n       If `a=5, b=3`.\n       `dist[0]=0`.\n       From `0`, we can reach `5`. `dist[0]` could be `0` or `5`. But `dist[0]` is smallest.\n       From `5`, we can reach `5-3 = 2`. So `dist[2]=2`.\n       From `2`, we can reach `2+5=7`. From `2`, we can reach `2-3=-1` (invalid).\n       From `7`, we can reach `7-3=4`. So `dist[4]=4`.\n       From `4`, we can reach `4+5=9`. From `4`, we can reach `4-3=1`. So `dist[1]=1`.\n       From `1`, we can reach `1+5=6`. From `1`, we can reach `1-3=-2` (invalid).\n       From `6`, we can reach `6-3=3`. So `dist[3]=3`.\n       `dist = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n       Let's re-run Dijkstra with `dist[v] = min(dist[v], d_u + b)` where `v = (u-b+a)%a`.\n       This is the standard way to find `dist[r]` for `P = k*a + l*b`. For `k*a - l*b` we need to be careful.\n       The problem says \"it can either jump to position `k+a` or `k-b`\".\n       The `dist[r]` values should be the minimum non-negative `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\n       `dist[0]=0`.\n       `pq = [(0,0)]`.\n       Pop `(0,0)`. `u=0, d=0`.\n       New node from `u`: `v = (u-b+a)%a = (0-3+5)%5 = 2`.\n       New value for `v`: `d+b = 0+3 = 3`.\n       If `3 < dist[2]`, update `dist[2]=3` and push `(3,2)` to `pq`.

(`dist` is `[0,inf,3,inf,6]`)\n       Pop `(6,4)`. `u=4, d=6`.\n       New node from `u`: `v = (u-b+a)%a = (4-3+5)%5 = 1`.\n       New value for `v`: `d+b = 6+3 = 9`.\n       If `9 < dist[1]`, update `dist[1]=9` and push `(9,1)` to `pq`.

(`dist` is `[0,9,3,12,6]`)\n       Pop `(12,3)`. `u=3, d=12`.\n       New node from `u`: `v = (u-b+a)%a = (3-3+5)%5 = 0`.\n       New value for `v`: `d+b = 12+3 = 15`.\n       `15` is not less than `dist[0]=0`. No update.\n       PQ empty.\n       Final `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`. These are the minimum values that are `P = k*a + l*b`.\n       But the problem allows `k*a - l*b`.\n       Let's use the actual BFS for reachability.\n       `reachable[p]` = True if `p` is reachable.\n       `q = deque([0])`, `reachable = {0}`.\n       While `q`:\n         `curr = q.popleft()`\n         `next_a = curr + a`\n         `next_b = curr - b`\n         If `next_a` not in `reachable`: `reachable.add(next_a)`, `q.append(next_a)`\n         If `next_b >= 0` and `next_b` not in `reachable`: `reachable.add(next_b)`, `q.append(next_b)`\n       This will find all reachable points (without `x` bound).\n       The smallest non-negative `p` for each `p \\pmod a` is what `dist` should store.\n       `dist[r]` = minimum `p` in `reachable` such that `p \\pmod a = r`.\n       This is precisely the Dijkstra algorithm where edges are `u \\to (u-b+a)%a` with weight `b`.\n       The `dist[r]` values are the minimum positive integers `P` such that `P = k*a - l*b` and `P \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\n       The `dist` values for `a=5, b=3` are:\n       `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`. This is correct.\n       \n       Now calculate `S_r` for `m=7`:\n       `r=0: dist[0]=0`. `N = 7-0 = 7`. `num_blocks = 7//5 = 1`.\n         `S_0 = (5 * 1 * (1+1) // 2) + ((7 - 1*5 + 1) * (1+1))`\n             `= (5 * 2 // 2) + ((3) * 2) = 5 + 6 = 11`.\n       `r=1: dist[1]=9`. `N = 7-9 = -2`. `S_1 = 0`.\n       `r=2: dist[2]=3`. `N = 7-3 = 4`. `num_blocks = 4//5 = 0`.\n         `S_2 = (5 * 0 * (0+1) // 2) + ((4 - 0*5 + 1) * (0+1))`\n             `= 0 + (5 * 1) = 5`.\n       `r=3: dist[3]=12`. `N = 7-12 = -5`. `S_3 = 0`.\n       `r=4: dist[4]=6`. `N = 7-6 = 1`. `num_blocks = 1//5 = 0`.\n         `S_4 = (5 * 0 * (0+1) // 2) + ((1 - 0*5 + 1) * (0+1))`\n             `= 0 + (2 * 1) = 2`.\n       Total sum = `11 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 2 = 18`.\n\n       The example output is 19. My sum is 18. What's wrong?\n       Let's check `f(x)` values for `m=7, a=5, b=3`.\n       `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`\n       `f(0)`: `x=0`. `r=0: dist[0]=0 <= 0`. `floor((0-0)/5)+1 = 1`. Others `dist[r]>0`. So `f(0)=1`. Correct.\n       `f(1)`: `x=1`. `r=0: dist[0]=0 <= 1`. `floor((1-0)/5)+1 = 1`. Others `dist[r]>1`. So `f(1)=1`. Correct.\n       `f(2)`: `x=2`. `r=0: dist[0]=0 <= 2`. `floor((2-0)/5)+1 = 1`. Others `dist[r]>2`. So `f(2)=1`. Correct.\n       `f(3)`: `x=3`. `r=0: dist[0]=0 <= 3`. `floor((3-0)/5)+1 = 1`. `r=2: dist[2]=3 <= 3`. `floor((3-3)/5)+1 = 1`. Others `dist[r]>3`. So `f(3)=1+1=2`.\n       Example says `f(3)=1`. This means my `dist` values are wrong.\n\n       The \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" means that the set of reachable points for `f(x)` is the connected component of `0` in the graph where nodes are `0, ..., x` and edges are `k \\leftrightarrow k+a` (if `k+a \\le x`) and `k \\leftrightarrow k-b` (if `k-b \\ge 0`).\n       This is not simply the points `p` such that `p >= dist[r]` and `p <= x`.\n       The `dist[r]` values computed by Dijkstra are for the unbounded case.\n       The crucial part is \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\n       This means that for `f(x)`, a point `p` is counted if `0 <= p <= x` AND there is a path `0=p_0, p_1, ..., p_k=p` such that `0 <= p_j <= x` for all `j`.\n       This is a BFS for each `x`.\n       Since `m` is large, we cannot do BFS for each `x`.\n       However, the set of reachable points `S_x` is non-decreasing with `x`. `S_x \\subseteq S_{x+1}`.\n       The set of reachable points changes only when `x` crosses a value `k` such that `k` becomes reachable, or `k+a` or `k-b` becomes allowed.\n       The maximum value for `a, b` is `10^5`.\n       The `f(x)` function will be constant for ranges of `x`.\n       `f(x)` will change only when `x` reaches a value `p` such that `p` is reachable, or `p` is `k+a` for some `k` that is reachable, or `p` is `k-b` for some `k` that is reachable.\n       The points `p` that can be reached are `0, a, 2a, ...`. From these, `p-b, p-2b, ...`.\n       The maximum value of `a` and `b` is `10^5`.\n       The set of reachable points `S_x` can be found by BFS. The values `f(x)` will stabilize after `x` reaches some threshold.\n       The threshold is typically around `a+b` or `a*b`.\n       The maximum `a` is `10^5`. So `a+b` is `2*10^5`.\n       Let's compute `f(x)` for `x` up to `2*max(a,b)`.\n       Let `MAX_AB = 2 * 10^5`.\n       We can compute `f(x)` for `x` from `0` to `MAX_AB` using BFS.\n       `reachable_points = {}` (map `x` to set of points)\n       `f_values = [0] * (MAX_AB + 1)`\n       `q = deque([0])`\n       `visited = {0}`\n       `current_max_reachable = 0`\n       For `x` from `0` to `MAX_AB`:\n         While `q` is not empty:\n           `curr = q.popleft()`\n           `current_max_reachable = max(current_max_reachable, curr)`\n           `next_a = curr + a`\n           `next_b = curr - b`\n           If `next_a <= x` and `next_a` not in `visited`:\n             `visited.add(next_a)`\n             `q.append(next_a)`\n           If `next_b >= 0` and `next_b` not in `visited`:\n             `visited.add(next_b)`\n             `q.append(next_b)`\n         `f_values[x] = len(visited)`\n         // Restore q and visited for next x. This is wrong.\n         // This BFS should be done for each x. Too slow.\n\n       The problem states \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\". This implies that the decision to jump must be valid *at the time of the jump*.\n       This means `f(x)` is the number of points in the connected component of `0` in the graph with nodes `0, ..., x` and edges `k \\leftrightarrow k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) and `k \\leftrightarrow k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\n       Let's re-calculate `f(x)` for `a=5, b=3`.\n       `f(0)`: Start 0. Can't jump `0+5 > 0`. Can't jump `0-3 < 0`. `S_0 = {0}`. `f(0)=1`.\n       `f(1)`: Start 0. Can't jump. `S_1 = {0}`. `f(1)=1`.\n       `f(2)`: Start 0. Can't jump. `S_2 = {0}`. `f(2)=1`.\n       `f(3)`: Start 0. Can't jump. `S_3 = {0}`. `f(3)=1`.\n       `f(4)`: Start 0. Can't jump. `S_4 = {0}`. `f(4)=1`.\n       `f(5)`: Start 0. Can jump `0+5=5`. `S_5 = {0, 5}`. From 5, can jump `5-3=2`. `S_5 = {0, 2, 5}`. From 2, can't jump `2+5 > 5`, can't jump `2-3 < 0`. `f(5)=3`.\n       `f(6)`: Start 0. Jump `0+5=5`. `S_6 = {0, 5}`. From 5, jump `5-3=2`. `S_6 = {0, 2, 5}`. From 2, can't jump. `f(6)=3`.\n       `f(7)`: Start 0. Jump `0+5=5`. `S_7 = {0, 5}`. From 5, jump `5-3=2`. `S_7 = {0, 2, 5}`. From 2, can't jump. `f(7)=3`.\n       Example output `f(7)=8`. My `f(7)=3`.\n       The example output `f(7)=8` suggests that `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers `p` such that `0 <= p <= x` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps *without any path restrictions*.\n       That is, `f(x) = |{p | 0 <= p <= x and p is reachable from 0 without bounds}|`.\n       If this is the case, then `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r])/a) + 1)` is correct.\n       Let's recheck example `f(7)` with `dist=[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`:\n       `r=0: dist[0]=0 <= 7`. `floor((7-0)/5)+1 = floor(1.4)+1 = 1+1 = 2`. Points: `0, 5`.\n       `r=1: dist[1]=9 > 7`. `0`.\n       `r=2: dist[2]=3 <= 7`. `floor((7-3)/5)+1 = floor(0.8)+1 = 0+1 = 1`. Point: `3`.\n       `r=3: dist[3]=12 > 7`. `0`.\n       `r=4: dist[4]=6 <= 7`. `floor((7-6)/5)+1 = floor(0.2)+1 = 0+1 = 1`. Point: `6`.\n       Total `f(7) = 2+0+1+0+1 = 4`. Still not 8.\n\n       The problem statement is crucial: \"The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from 0.\" This implies that the path restriction is not on the *entire path* to `p`, but on *each jump*.\n       \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\"\n       This means:\n       `S_x` is the set of points reachable from `0` using only `+a` and `-b` jumps, such that if `p \\in S_x`, then `0 \\le p \\le x`.\n       AND for any `p \\in S_x`, if `p+a` is reachable, it must be `p+a \\le x`. If `p-b` is reachable, it must be `p-b \\ge 0`.\n       This is a definition of a connected component. My BFS for `f(x)` was correct.\n\n       Why is `f(7)=8` in the example?\n       `a=5, b=3`.\n       `x=7`.\n       `0`.\n       `0+5=5`. `S={0,5}`.\n       `5-3=2`. `S={0,2,5}`.\n       `2+5=7`. `S={0,2,5,7}`.\n       `7-3=4`. `S={0,2,4,5,7}`.\n       `4-3=1`. `S={0,1,2,4,5,7}`.\n       `1+5=6`. `S={0,1,2,4,5,6,7}`.\n       `6-3=3`. `S={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}`.\n       All points from `0` to `7` are reachable. So `f(7)=8`.\n       My BFS for `f(x)` (the one I manually traced for `x=5,6,7`) was wrong. I was not letting `x` increase.\n       The correct interpretation of the BFS for a fixed `x`:\n       `q = deque([0])`\n       `visited = {0}`\n       While `q` is not empty:\n         `curr = q.popleft()`\n         `next_a = curr + a`\n         `next_b = curr - b`\n         If `next_a <= x` and `next_a` not in `visited`:\n           `visited.add(next_a)`\n           `q.append(next_a)`\n         If `next_b >= 0` and `next_b` not in `visited`:\n           `visited.add(next_b)`\n           `q.append(next_b)`\n       `f(x) = len(visited)`\n\n       Let's retrace `f(7)` with this BFS:\n       `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`.\n       Pop `0`.\n         `0+5=5`. `5 <= 7`. `visited={0,5}`, `q=[5]`.\n         `0-3=-3`. Not `>=0`.\n       Pop `5`.\n         `5+5=10`. Not `<=7`.\n         `5-3=2`. `2 >= 0`. `visited={0,5,2}`, `q=[2]`.\n       Pop `2`.\n         `2+5=7`. `7 <= 7`. `visited={0,5,2,7}`, `q=[7]`.\n         `2-3=-1`. Not `>=0`.\n       Pop `7`.\n         `7+5=12`. Not `<=7`.\n         `7-3=4`. `4 >= 0`. `visited={0,5,2,7,4}`, `q=[4]`.\n       Pop `4`.\n         `4+5=9`. Not `<=7`.\n         `4-3=1`. `1 >= 0`. `visited={0,5,2,7,4,1}`, `q=[1]`.\n       Pop `1`.\n         `1+5=6`. `6 <= 7`. `visited={0,5,2,7,4,1,6}`, `q=[6]`.\n         `1-3=-2`. Not `>=0`.\n       Pop `6`.\n         `6+5=11`. Not `<=7`.\n         `6-3=3`. `3 >= 0`. `visited={0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3}`, `q=[3]`.\n       Pop `3`.\n         `3+5=8`. Not `<=7`.\n         `3-3=0`. `0` is in `visited`.\n       `q` is empty. `len(visited) = 8`. This matches `f(7)=8`.\n\n       So `f(x)` is indeed the size of the connected component.\n       The values of `f(x)` will be non-decreasing.\n       The maximum point reachable from `0` (without `x` bound) is `k*a` for some `k`.\n       The minimum point reachable from `0` (without `x` bound) is `l*b` for some `l`.\n       The problem is that the state space `[0, x]` changes.\n       The points `p` that are reachable are multiples of `g = gcd(a,b)`.\n       Let `MAX_K = a+b` (or `2*10^5` based on constraints).\n       For `x >= MAX_K`, `f(x)` will likely behave predictably.\n       The `dist[r]` values (min `p` s.t. `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`) are for the unbounded case.\n       The maximum `dist[r]` value is `a*b - a - b` (Frobenius number for `gcd(a,b)=1`).\n       Let `L = a*b - a - b`. If `x > L`, then all `p \\in [0, x]` that are multiples of `g` and `p \\ge dist[r]` are reachable.\n       So for `x >= L`, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\n       The maximum value of `a*b` is `10^{10}`. This is too large for `L`.\n       The maximum value `dist[r]` can take is `a-1` if `b=1`. If `a=10^5, b=1`, `dist[r]=r`.\n       If `a=1, b=10^5`, `dist[0]=0`. `f(x)=x+1`.\n       The maximum `dist[r]` value is actually bounded by `a*b/g - a - b`.\n       The maximum `dist[r]` is less than `a*b`.\n       The values `dist[r]` are found via Dijkstra on `a` nodes. The edge weights are `b`.\n       The maximum `dist[r]` value is `(a-1) * b`. If `a=10^5, b=10^5`, this is `10^{10}`.\n       This is the maximum value for `dist[r]`, not `L`.\n       The threshold `L` is `max(dist[r])`.\n       So we need to compute `f(x)` for `x` up to `max(dist[r])`.\n       Let `MAX_DIST = max(dist[r])`.\n       We can compute `f(x)` for `x \\in [0, \\min(m, MAX_DIST + a + b)]` using BFS.\n       `MAX_DIST` can be `10^{10}`. This is too large.\n\n       The property of `f(x)` for `a,b` when `gcd(a,b)=1`:\n       `f(x)` is the number of integers `p \\in [0,x]` that can be written as `k*a - l*b` for `k,l \\ge 0`.\n       The `dist[r]` values computed by Dijkstra are the smallest such `p` for each `r \\pmod a`.\n       The example output `f(7)=8` implies that all points `0,1,...,7` are reachable.\n       This means that for `x=7, a=5, b=3`, the points `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` are reachable.\n       `dist[0]=0, dist[1]=1, dist[2]=2, dist[3]=3, dist[4]=4`.\n       My Dijkstra `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` is incorrect for this problem.\n       The Dijkstra should be:\n       `dist[r]` = minimum `p` (reachable from `0` and `p \\ge 0`) such that `p \\pmod a = r`.\n       This is a shortest path on a graph where nodes are `0, ..., a-1`.\n       From node `u`, we can transition to `(u+b)%a` with cost `b`.\n       This is `dist[ (u+b)%a ] = min( dist[ (u+b)%a ], dist[u] + b )`.\n       This finds the smallest `P = k*a + l*b`.\n       But we can also jump `k-b`. This means `P = k*a - l*b`.\n       The correct Dijkstra for `dist[r]` for `P = k*a - l*b` is:\n       Initialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[i] = infinity` for `i \\neq 0`.\n       `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n       When extracting `(d, u)`:\n         If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n         `v = (u + a - b % a) % a` (remainder for `d-b`)\n         If `d - b >= 0` and `d - b < dist[v]`:\n           `dist[v] = d - b`\n           `pq.push((dist[v], v))`\n         `v = (u + a % a) % a = u` (remainder for `d+a`)\n         If `d + a < dist[v]`: // This is not useful, d is already minimum\n           `dist[v] = d + a`\n           `pq.push((dist[v], v))`\n       No, the `+a` jump does not change the remainder `u`. So `d+a` is not useful for finding `dist[u]`.\n       The `dist[r]` values are the *minimum non-negative* values `P` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `P` is reachable.\n       The set of reachable points is `\\{ k \\cdot a - l \\cdot b \\mid k, l \\ge 0 \\text{ and } k \\cdot a - l \\cdot b \\ge 0 \\}`.\n       Since `gcd(a,b)=1`, this set contains all integers greater than `a*b - a - b` that are multiples of `g`.\n       The `dist[r]` values are the smallest such points.\n       This is a classic \"Shortest Path Faster Algorithm\" (SPFA) problem (or Dijkstra with non-negative weights).\n       The graph has `a` nodes. From `u`, there's an edge to `(u-b)%a` with weight `b`.\n       `dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + b)`\n       This is the standard formulation for `k*a + l*b`.\n       The `dist` values for `a=5, b=3` (with `gcd(a,b)=1`) are `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`. These are correct `P = k*a + l*b`.\n       But `f(7)=8` suggests `dist = [0,1,2,3,4]`.\n       This means `dist[r]` is the smallest non-negative `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod{gcd(a,b)}`.\n       But we already assumed `gcd(a,b)=1`.\n       If `f(x)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, x]` *without path restrictions* (i.e. any point `p` is reachable if `0 <= p <= x` and `p = k*a - l*b`), then `f(x)` would be `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist_correct[r])/a) + 1)`.\n       The `dist_correct[r]` should be `r` for `a=5, b=3`. This would give `f(7) = sum_{r=0}^4 max(0, floor((7-r)/5)+1)`.\n       `r=0: floor(7/5)+1 = 1+1=2`.\n       `r=1: floor(6/5)+1 = 1+1=2`.\n       `r=2: floor(5/5)+1 = 1+1=2`.\n       `r=3: floor(4/5)+1 = 0+1=1`.\n       `r=4: floor(3/5)+1 = 0+1=1`.\n       Sum = `2+2+2+1+1 = 8`. This matches the example!\n\n       So the interpretation of `f(x)` is:\n       `f(x)` = number of integers `p` such that `0 <= p <= x` and `p` can be expressed as `k*a - l*b` for some non-negative integers `k, l`.\n       This means `f(x) = |\\{p \\mid 0 \\le p \\le x \\text{ and } p \\in \\text{ReachableSet}\\}|`.\n       The `ReachableSet` is `\\{ k \\cdot a - l \\cdot b \\mid k, l \\ge 0 \\text{ and } k \\cdot a - l \\cdot b \\ge 0 \\}`.\n       The crucial part is how to find `dist[r]` for this `ReachableSet`.\n       This is precisely the Dijkstra algorithm I used initially, but the interpretation of edges.\n       The graph nodes are `0, ..., a-1`.\n       `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative `P` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `P` is reachable.\n       From `u`, we can jump `u \\to (u-b+a)%a` by subtracting `b`.\n       `dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] - b)`. This is not Dijkstra (negative weights).\n       But we are looking for non-negative values.\n       The \"shortest path\" formulation for `P = k*a - l*b` is:\n       `dist[r]` = minimum `P` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `P` is reachable.\n       Initialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[i] = infinity` for `i \\neq 0`.\n       `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n       When `(d, u)` is popped:\n         If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n         // Option 1: Jump `-b`.\n         `v = (u - b % a + a) % a`\n         If `d - b >= 0` and `d - b < dist[v]`:\n           `dist[v] = d - b`\n           `pq.push((dist[v], v))`\n         // Option 2: Jump `+a`.\n         // This is implicitly handled. If `d` is reachable, then `d+a, d+2a, ...` are reachable.\n         // But `d+a` has the same remainder `u`. Since `d` is the minimum for `u`, `d+a` cannot be smaller.\n         // This Dijkstra finds the minimum `P` for each `P \\pmod a`.\n       This is the correct Dijkstra. Let's re-run for `a=5, b=3`.\n       `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n       `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n       Pop `(0, 0)`. `d=0, u=0`.\n         `v = (0-3+5)%5 = 2`. `new_val = 0-3 = -3`. Not `>=0`.\n       PQ is empty. So `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`. This is clearly wrong.\n\n       The issue is that `+a` jumps are not explicitly handled in the Dijkstra.\n       If `p` is reachable, then `p+a` is also reachable.\n       So, from `dist[u]`, we can reach `dist[u]+a`. This point is `u \\pmod a`.\n       From `dist[u]`, we can reach `dist[u]-b`. This point is `(u-b+a)%a \\pmod a`.\n       This means the edges are `u \\to (u-b+a)%a` with weight `-b`. This is Bellman-Ford/SPFA.\n       Since we only care about non-negative points, we can use a modified SPFA.\n       `dist[0] = 0`, others `inf`. `q = deque([0])`. `in_queue[0]=True`.\n       While `q`:\n         `u = q.popleft()`, `in_queue[u]=False`.\n         // Try `u - b`\n         `v = (u - b % a + a) % a`\n         `new_val = dist[u] - b`\n         If `new_val >= 0` and `new_val < dist[v]`:\n           `dist[v] = new_val`\n           If not `in_queue[v]`: `q.append(v)`, `in_queue[v]=True`.\n         // Try `u + a` (This is tricky, `u+a` has same remainder)\n         // `dist[u]` is the smallest `P` for remainder `u`.

If `a=1`, then `dist[0]=0`. `f(x)=x+1`.\n       If `a=5, b=3`, then `gcd(a,b)=1`.\n       Any integer `p` can be written as `k*a - l*b` for some `k,l` (Bézout's identity).\n       Specifically, `1 = k*a - l*b`.\n       `1 = 2*5 - 3*3 = 10 - 9 = 1`.

The `dist[r]` should be `r`.\n       This happens if `b` is small enough.\n       Specifically, if `dist[r]` is the smallest non-negative integer `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\n       This is a Dijkstra problem on `a` nodes, where `dist[u]` is the path length.\n       Edges are `u \\to (u+a)\\%a` with cost `a` (from `p` to `p+a`).\n       Edges are `u \\to (u-b+a)\\%a` with cost `b` (from `p` to `p-b`).\n       So from `u`, we can reach `v = (u-b+a)%a` with cost `b`.\n       The `dist` values for `a=5, b=3` should be:\n       `dist[0]=0`.\n       `dist[1] = (0+5-3*3)%5 = (5-9)%5 = -4%5 = 1`. `1` is reachable.\n       `dist[2] = (0+5-3)%5 = 2`. `2` is reachable.\n       `dist[3] = (0+5*2-3*3)%5 = (10-9)%5 = 1`. `1+5-3 = 3`. `3` is reachable.\n       `dist[4] = (0+5*2-3*2)%5 = (10-6)%5 = 4`. `4` is reachable.\n       So `dist=[0,1,2,3,4]` is correct.\n       The Dijkstra should be:\n       `dist[r]` = min `P` s.t. `P \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `P \\ge 0`.\n       `dist[0]=0`, others `inf`. `pq = [(0,0)]`.\n       Pop `(d,u)`.\n       1.

This is equivalent to saying all `p \\ge 0` are reachable.\n       This is true if `gcd(a,b)=1` and `x` is large enough.\n       The `dist[r]` values must be computed using BFS on `[0, MAX_AB]` states.\n       The states are `0, 1, ..., MAX_AB`.\n       `dist[i]` = minimum number of jumps to reach `i` from `0`.\n       No, `dist[i]` is not needed. Just reachability.\n       The values `f(x)` are computed for `x` up to `m`.\n       The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n       The maximum value `a,b` is `10^5`.\n       The sum is `sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} g * f_prime(k) + (m % g + 1) * f_prime(M_prime)`.\n       Let `M = M_prime`.\n       We need to compute `f_prime(k)` for `k` from `0` to `M`.\n       `f_prime(k)` for `a', b'` up to `M = m/g`.\n       The maximum `M` can be `10^9`.\n       The number of `dist[r]` values is `a'`. `a'` can be `10^5`.\n       The `f(x)` function will eventually stabilize to `x+1` (if `gcd(a,b)=1`).\n       When does `f(x)` become `x+1`? When all `p \\in [0,x]` are reachable.\n       This happens when `x \\ge \\max_{r} (\\text{smallest reachable } p \\text{ s.t. } p \\equiv r \\pmod a)`.\n       The \"smallest reachable `p`\" for each `r` is what `dist[r]` should store.\n       This is the standard coin problem. `dist[r]` is the smallest `P \\ge 0` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `P` is of the form `k*a - l*b`.\n       This can be found by Dijkstra:\n       `dist[0]=0`, `dist[i]=infinity` for `i \\neq 0`.\n       `pq = [(0,0)]`.\n       While `pq`:\n         `d, u = pq.pop_min()`.\n         If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n         // Option 1: `d+a`.

The values are large, but Python handles it.\n       Let's re-run for `a=5, b=3`.\n       `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n       `pq = [(0,0)]`\n       Pop `(0,0)`. `d=0, u=0`.\n         `v = (0-3+5)%5 = 2`. `new_val = 0-3 = -3`.

This means `dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + b)`. This finds `P = k*a + l*b`.\n       This is the one that gives `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` for `a=5, b=3`.\n       The example `f(7)=8` means `dist[r]=r`. This is the case if `b` is small enough that `dist[r]` can reach `r`.\n       For example, if `b=1`, `dist[r]=r`.\n       If `b > a`, then `dist[r]` can be large.\n\n       The problem is that the state space `[0, x]` affects reachability.\n       The \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" implies that we cannot use the unbounded `dist[r]` directly.\n       However, the example `f(7)=8` is only possible if all integers `0..7` are reachable.\n       This means `0, 0+a, 0+a-b, 0+a-b+a, ...` must stay within `[0, x]`.\n       The example output `f(7)=8` for `a=5, b=3` is `1+1+1+1+1+3+3+8 = 19`.\n       My trace for `f(x)`: `f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8`.\n       This matches the example.\n       So my interpretation of `f(x)` as the size of the connected component within `[0,x]` is correct.\n       The issue is how to calculate `sum f(i)` efficiently.\n       The `f(x)` values will be constant for `x` up to `a-1` (all 1).\n       Then `f(a)` will jump.\n       The state space is `0, ..., max(a,b)`. Let `K = max(a,b)`.\n       The `f(x)` values will change at most `K` times.\n       The values `f(x)` for `x >= K` will be `x+1` if `gcd(a,b)=1`.\n       No, not `x+1`. It will be `(x/g)+1`.\n       The number of reachable points will be `k+1` if `k` is the largest reachable point.\n       The `f(x)` sequence can be computed up to `2*max(a,b)` or `a+b`.\n       Let `MAX_COMPUTE = a+b`.\n       We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `min(m, MAX_COMPUTE)` using BFS.\n       `f_arr = [0] * (MAX_COMPUTE + 1)`\n       `q = deque()`\n       `visited = set()`\n       `total_sum = 0`\n       For `i` from `0` to `min(m, MAX_COMPUTE)`:\n         `q.append(0)`\n         `visited.clear()`\n         `visited.add(0)`\n         `head = 0`\n         While `head < len(q)`:\n           `curr = q[head]`\n           `head += 1`\n           `next_a = curr + a`\n           `next_b = curr - b`\n           If `next_a <= i` and `next_a` not in `visited`:\n             `visited.add(next_a)`\n             `q.append(next_a)`\n           If `next_b >= 0` and `next_b` not in `visited`:\n             `visited.add(next_b)`\n             `q.append(next_b)`\n         `f_arr[i] = len(visited)`\n         `total_sum += f_arr[i]`\n       This is `O(MAX_COMPUTE * (MAX_COMPUTE + a + b))`.

Compute `min_x_to_reach_prime[p]` for `p \\in [0, K_prime]` where `K_prime = max(a_prime, b_prime) + b_prime`. (A sufficiently large threshold where `f(x)` becomes `x+1`). A safe bound is `2*(a_prime+b_prime)`. Let's use `MAX_P = 2 * (a_prime + b_prime) + 1`.\n   a. Initialize `min_x_to_reach_prime` array of size `MAX_P` with infinity, `min_x_to_reach_prime[0] = 0`.\n   b. Use a min-priority queue `pq`. Push `(0, 0)` onto `pq`.\n   c. While `pq` is not empty:\n      i. `max_val, curr = pq.pop_min()`.\n      ii. If `max_val > min_x_to_reach_prime[curr]`, continue.\n      iii. Jump `+a_prime`: `next_a = curr + a_prime`.\n          If `next_a < MAX_P`:\n            `new_max_val = max(max_val, next_a)`.\n            If `new_max_val < min_x_to_reach_prime[next_a]`:\n              `min_x_to_reach_prime[next_a] = new_max_val`.\n              `pq.push((new_max_val, next_a))`.\n      iv. Jump `-b_prime`: `next_b = curr - b_prime`.\n          If `next_b >= 0`:\n            `new_max_val = max(max_val, curr)`.\n            If `new_max_val < min_x_to_reach_prime[next_b]`:\n              `min_x_to_reach_prime[next_b] = new_max_val`.\n              `pq.push((new_max_val, next_b))`.\n5. Build `count_le_prime` array for `f_prime(k)` values for `k \\le \\min(M_prime, MAX_P-1)`:\n   a. `count_le_prime = [0] * MAX_P`.\n   b. For `p` from `0` to `MAX_P-1`:\n      If `min_x_to_reach_prime[p]` is not infinity and `min_x_to_reach_prime[p] < MAX_P`:\n         `count_le_prime[min_x_to_reach_prime[p]] += 1`.\n   c. For `k` from `1` to `MAX_P-1`:\n      `count_le_prime[k] += count_le_prime[k-1]`.\n   d. `f_prime_values = [0] * MAX_P`.\n   e. For `k` from `0` to `MAX_P-1`:\n      `f_prime_values[k] = count_le_prime[k]`.\n\n6. Calculate the total sum `S`.\n   a. `S = 0`.\n   b. `limit = min(M_prime, MAX_P - 1)`.\n   c. For `k` from `0` to `limit`:\n      `S += g * f_prime_values[k]`.\n   d. If `M_prime >= MAX_P`:\n      The remaining sum is `sum_{k=MAX_P}^{M_prime} f_prime(k)`.\n      For `k \\ge MAX_P`, `f_prime(k) = k+1`. This is because `MAX_P` is chosen large enough that all `p \\le k` are reachable for `x=k`.\n      This implies `min_x_to_reach_prime[p] = p` for `p \\ge \\text{some_threshold}`.\n      The threshold for `min_x_to_reach_prime[p] = p` is `max(a', b')`.\n      So, `MAX_P` should be `max(a_prime, b_prime)`. Let `MAX_P = max(a_prime, b_prime)`.\n      If `M_prime >= MAX_P`:\n         `start_k = MAX_P`.\n         `end_k = M_prime`.\n         `num_terms = end_k - start_k + 1`.\n         `sum_arith = num_terms * (start_k + 1 + end_k + 1) // 2`.\n         `S += g * sum_arith`.\n   e. Finally, add the partial block for `m % g + 1` terms:\n      `num_partial_terms = m % g + 1`.\n      `f_M_prime = f_prime_values[M_prime]` if `M_prime < MAX_P` else `M_prime + 1`.\n      `S += num_partial_terms * f_M_prime`.\n      No, this is wrong. The formula for the sum `sum_{k=0 to M_prime-1} g * f_1(k) + (m % g + 1) * f_1(M_prime)` is correct.\n      My step `6.c` already sums `g * f_prime_values[k]` for `k` up to `min(M_prime, MAX_P - 1)`.\n      So if `M_prime < MAX_P`, the loop covers all terms except the last partial block.\n      If `M_prime >= MAX_P`, the loop covers `0` to `MAX_P-1`.\n      Remaining sum is `g * sum_{k=MAX_P}^{M_prime-1} (k+1)`. (if `M_prime >= MAX_P`).\n      Let `f_M_prime = f_prime_values[M_prime]` if `M_prime < MAX_P`. Else `f_M_prime = M_prime + 1`.\n      Total sum:\n      `res = 0`\n      `limit = min(M_prime, MAX_P - 1)`\n      For `k` from `0` to `limit`: `res += f_prime_values[k]`\n      If `M_prime >= MAX_P`:\n         `start_k = MAX_P`\n         `end_k = M_prime - 1`\n         If `start_k <= end_k`:\n            `num_terms = end_k - start_k + 1`\n            `sum_arith = num_terms * (start_k + 1 + end_k + 1) // 2`\n            `res += sum_arith`\n      `res = g * res`\n      `f_M_prime = f_prime_values[M_prime]` if `M_prime < MAX_P` else `M_prime + 1`\n      `res += (m % g + 1) * f_M_prime`\n\nThis looks robust. `MAX_P` must be chosen carefully.\n`MAX_P = max(a_prime, b_prime)` is probably too small. `a_prime+b_prime` is a better estimate for the threshold.\nLet `MAX_P = a_prime + b_prime + 5`. (A small constant buffer).\nThis bound is `2*10^5`. Dijkstra `2*10^5 * log(2*10^5)` is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    a_prime = a // g\n    b_prime = b // g\n    m_prime = m // g\n\n    # MAX_P is a threshold beyond which f_prime(k) is simply k+1.\n    # A safe bound for this threshold is related to a_prime + b_prime.\n    # The Frobenius number for (a', b') is a'*b' - a' - b'.\n    # For k > max(a', b') (or similar small threshold), min_x_to_reach_prime[k] = k.\n    # Let's use a bound like 2 * (a_prime + b_prime) + 1 for safety.\n    # Max value of a, b is 10^5, so a_prime, b_prime are also up to 10^5.\n    # MAX_P will be around 4 * 10^5.\n    MAX_P = 2 * (a_prime + b_prime) + 5 # Add a small buffer\n\n    # Dijkstra to find min_x_to_reach_prime[p]:\n    # The minimum 'x' such that 'p' is reachable within [0, x].\n    # Nodes are positions p from 0 to MAX_P-1.\n    # Edge from 'curr' to 'next_a' has cost 'next_a' (max value on path).\n    # Edge from 'curr' to 'next_b' has cost 'curr' (max value on path).\n    \n    min_x_to_reach_prime = [float('inf')] * MAX_P\n    min_x_to_reach_prime[0] = 0\n    \n    pq = [(0, 0)] # (max_val_on_path, current_position)\n\n    while pq:\n        max_val, curr = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        if max_val > min_x_to_reach_prime[curr]:\n            continue\n\n        # Jump +a_prime\n        next_a = curr + a_prime\n        if next_a < MAX_P:\n            new_max_val = max(max_val, next_a)\n            if new_max_val < min_x_to_reach_prime[next_a]:\n                min_x_to_reach_prime[next_a] = new_max_val\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_max_val, next_a))\n\n        # Jump -b_prime\n        next_b = curr - b_prime\n        if next_b >= 0:\n            new_max_val = max(max_val, curr) # The max value on path to curr is max_val, curr is not necessarily max_val\n                                             # max_val is max on path to curr, so curr is implicitly <= max_val.\n                                             # The path to next_b from curr uses curr itself.
