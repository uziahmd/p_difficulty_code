And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time Over K-Day Weeks**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the average sleep time, but it's not straightforward. Let me break this down step-by-step. I've got a total number of days, `n`, a week length `k`, and a list of sleep times `a`. My task is to calculate the average sleep across all *k*-day weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to define what a \"week\" means here. It's simply *k* consecutive days from my data. So the first week is days 1 through *k*, the second is days 2 through *k+1*, and so on, until the last week which ends on day *n*. The crucial part is to correctly count the total number of such *k*-day \"weeks\"; that's just `n - k + 1`.\n\nNow, the instructions got a bit fuzzy in the examples regarding calculating the average. Initially, the example formula was a bit misleading, making me think I needed to average *each week's* average. However, after careful review and a re-interpretation of the examples, and a look at the third example's note, I'm pretty sure I need to calculate the *sum* of sleep times for each week, *then* sum those weekly sums, and finally divide the grand total by the total number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nTherefore, the core idea is to slide a window of size *k* across the sleep time list `a`, calculate the sum of elements within each window, accumulate these sums, and finally divide that accumulated sum by the number of windows, which represents the total number of weeks. This method should give me the correct average sleep time.\n",
