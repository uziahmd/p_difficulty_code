He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My thinking on solving this problem:**\n\nI need to create a Python script that can determine if a given string, `S`, adheres to specific rules.  The rules define a string that's built in three stages (A, B, and C), each appending a certain type of character.\n\nFirst, there must be at least one lowercase 'a' (the A stage), so the string begins with one or more 'a's, or `N_a` 'a's, where `N_a >= 1`.  Then, you append some 'b's to the end (B stage), `N_b` 'b's. This means there's at least one 'b', or `N_b >= 1`. Finally, some 'c's (C stage) get appended, `N_c` 'c's. The rule for the number of 'c's is crucial: `N_c` must equal either `N_a` or `N_b`.  \n\nTherefore, string `S` must have the structure: `a...ab...bc...c`, where the number of 'c's either matches the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.  \n\nI can analyze the given string `S` by calculating how many of each character exist, specifically the counts for 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's say these are `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c`.\n\nI derived the key conditions:\n\n1. `S` must consist of only 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n2. The order of characters must strictly be 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, without any 'b' or 'c' appearing before the preceding ones.\n3. The count of 'a's must be at least 1: `count_a >= 1`.\n4. The count of 'b's must be at least 1: `count_b >= 1`.\n5. The count of 'c's must be at least 1: `count_c >= 1`.\n6. The count of 'c's must equal either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's: `count_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b`.\n\nI considered checking these rules on some examples to test my logic. I noticed that I needed an efficient way to check the order of characters. I finally landed on a state machine approach to check the correct sequence of characters.\n\nThe state machine uses a state variable:\n\n* State 0:  Expecting an 'a'.\n* State 1:  Expecting a 'b'.\n* State 2:  Expecting a 'c'.\n\nI'll iterate through the string.  If at any point, the character does not match the expected one according to the state, the string is invalid.  I must also keep track of the character counts (count_a, count_b, count_c).\n\nI iterated through more test cases and edge cases, refining the logic where necessary. It appears this state machine along with these derived conditions accurately solve the given problem.\n\nFinally, to address the input/output specifics, I will read the string `S` from the user input and output either \"YES\" if the conditions are satisfied or \"NO\" otherwise.  I will write the final Python program in this manner.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and derive the conditions for a valid string:\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with a string of some number of 'a's. Let this number be `N_a`. The problem implies `N_a >= 1`.\n2.  **B's step**: B appends some number of 'b's to the end. Let this be `N_b`. The string now looks like `a...ab...b`. At this point, the string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b'. This means `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step**: C appends some number of 'c's to the end. Let this be `N_c`. The string now looks like `a...ab...bc...c`. The critical condition is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`. Since `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`, this implies that `N_c` must also be at least 1.\n\nCombining these rules, a valid string `S` must satisfy the following:\n\n**Structural (Order) Conditions:**\n*   The string must consist of zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, followed by zero or more 'c's.\n*   This means:\n    *   No 'b' can appear before an 'a'.\n    *   No 'c' can appear before an 'a' or a 'b'.\n    *   No 'a' can appear after a 'b' or a 'c'.\n    *   No 'b' can appear after a 'c'.\n\n**Count Conditions:**\n*   Let `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` be the total number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string `S`, respectively.\n*   `count_a >= 1` (from A's step).\n*   `count_b >= 1` (from B's step, \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\").\n*   `count_c >= 1` (derived from C's condition: `N_c == N_a` or `N_c == N_b`, and `N_a, N_b >= 1`).\n*   The final condition: `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can check these conditions by iterating through the string once, maintaining counts for 'a', 'b', and 'c', and keeping track of the current \"state\" to ensure the characters appear in the correct order.\n\nLet `state` represent the current section of the string we are in:\n*   `state = 0`: We are currently in the 'a' section (or expecting the first 'a').\n*   `state = 1`: We are currently in the 'b' section (the first 'b' has been encountered, so we no longer expect 'a's).\n*   `state = 2`: We are currently in the 'c' section (the first 'c' has been encountered, so we no longer expect 'a's or 'b's).\n\nWe iterate through each character of the input string `S`:\n1.  **If `char == 'a'`**:\n    *   If `state` is `0`, increment `count_a`.\n    *   Otherwise (`state` is `1` or `2`), an 'a' appeared after a 'b' or 'c', which is an invalid order. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n2.  **If `char == 'b'`**:\n    *   If `state` is `2`, a 'b' appeared after a 'c', which is an invalid order. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n    *   Otherwise (`state` is `0` or `1`), we transition to or remain in the 'b' section. Set `state = 1` and increment `count_b`.\n3.  **If `char == 'c'`**:\n    *   If `state` is `0`, a 'c' appeared before any 'b' (and potentially before any 'a' if `count_a` was 0), which is an invalid order. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n    *   Otherwise (`state` is `1` or `2`), we transition to or remain in the 'c' section. Set `state = 2` and increment `count_c`.\n\nAfter iterating through the entire string, we check the count conditions:\n1.  If `count_a == 0`, `count_b == 0`, or `count_c == 0`, print \"NO\".\n2.  Otherwise, if `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`, print \"YES\".\n3.  Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach correctly handles all order and count constraints in a single pass, making it efficient for the given string length (`|S| <= 5000`).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`aaabccc`):**\n\n1.  `s = \"aaabccc\"`, `count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0`, `state=0`\n2.  `char = 'a'`: `state=0`, `count_a=1`.\n3.  `char = 'a'`: `state=0`, `count_a=2`.\n4.  `char = 'a'`: `state=0`, `count_a=3`.\n5.  `char = 'b'`: `state=0`, so set `state=1`, `count_b=1`.\n6.  `char = 'c'`: `state=1`, so set `state=2`, `count_c=1`.\n7.  `char = 'c'`: `state=2`, `count_c=2`.\n8.  `char = 'c'`: `state=2`, `count_c=3`.\n9.  End of string.\n    *   `count_a=3`, `count_b=1`, `count_c=3`.\n    *   Check minimum counts: `count_a=3 >= 1`, `count_b=1 >= 1`, `count_c=3 >= 1`. All OK.\n    *   Check final condition: `(count_c == count_a)` is `(3 == 3)` which is `True`.\n    *   Print \"YES\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n\n    # state:\n    # 0: in 'a' section (or expecting first 'a')\n    # 1: in 'b' section (first 'b' seen, no 'a' expected)\n    # 2: in 'c' section (first 'c' seen, no 'a' or 'b' expected)\n    state = 0 \n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if state == 0:\n                count_a += 1\n            else:\n                # 'a' appeared after 'b' or 'c', invalid order\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if state == 2:\n                # 'b' appeared after 'c', invalid order\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            # If state was 0, it means we've finished 'a's and now seeing 'b's.\n            # If state was 1, we're continuing in 'b' section.\n            state = 1 \n            count_b += 1\n        elif char == 'c':\n            if state == 0:\n                # 'c' appeared before any 'b' (and potentially before any 'a's if count_a was 0), invalid order\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            # If state was 1, it means we've finished 'b's and now seeing 'c's.\n            # If state was 2, we're continuing in 'c' section.\n            state = 2\n            count_c += 1\n        # No 'else' needed for invalid characters, problem guarantees 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n    # After iterating through the string, check final conditions:\n    # 1.
