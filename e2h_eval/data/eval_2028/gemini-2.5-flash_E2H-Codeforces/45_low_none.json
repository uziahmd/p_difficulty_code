There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. The goal is to maximize the number of games the winner plays in a knockout tournament, given a specific set of rules. It seems like a classic dynamic programming or perhaps a recursive approach would work best.\n\nMy initial thought is to represent a player's progress by their \"experience\" or the number of games they've won. The core constraint is that two players can only compete if the absolute difference in their win counts is at most one. Both players must also be undefeated. This is the key to figuring out how the tournament structure develops.\n\nI want to maximize the games played by the ultimate winner, so I'll start by considering how the winner accumulates wins. Let's call the winner \"W\".  W begins with zero wins. With each game W plays and wins, their experience level increases. \n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of recursive relationships. If a player is at a level 'k', the opponent must be at level 'k-1' or 'k'. I can define a function, let's call it `N(k)`, that represents the minimum number of players needed to allow *some* player to achieve 'k' wins. The answer will be the largest value of k where `N(k)` is less than or equal to the total number of players `n`.\n\nLet's trace out a few starting points. To get the winner to one win, I need two players, W and X. With one win, W can face an opponent with zero wins, which gives W two wins total. \n\nSo it's coming into focus. I need to determine how the minimum number of players grows as the winner's games increase. There is likely some sort of Fibonacci-like pattern here, given the rule about the experience difference of the players being limited by one. Time to formulate a recurrence relation!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given `n` initial players. The key rule is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already won differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already won.\n\nLet `W` be the player we want to maximize games for. Let `k` be the number of games `W` has won so far.\nTo play the `(k+1)`-th game, `W` (who has `k` wins) needs an opponent. Let this opponent be `O`.\n`O` must also be undefeated. Let `m` be the number of games `O` has won.\nThe rule states `abs(k - m) <= 1`. This means `m` can be `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`.\nHowever, since `W` is the player we are trying to maximize games for, it's highly unlikely `W` would play against someone who has already won more games than `W` (`m = k+1`). If `W` plays against such an opponent and wins, `W` would then have `k+1` wins, while the opponent had `k+1` wins. This implies the opponent also played `k+1` games, which would mean `W` wasn't maximizing their own games by waiting. To maximize `W`'s games, `W` should play as early as possible. So, `W` will play against an opponent with `k-1` or `k` wins.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games.\n- To win 0 games: 1 player (no games played). `f(0) = 1`.\n- To win 1 game: `W` (0 wins) plays against `O` (0 wins). `W` wins. `W` has 1 win. We need 2 players. `f(1) = 2`.\n- To win 2 games: `W` (1 win) needs an opponent `O`.\n    - If `O` has 0 wins: `W` (1) vs `O` (0). `W` wins. `W` has 2 wins. This requires `f(1)` players for `W` and `f(0)` players for `O`. Total `f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3` players.\n    - If `O` has 1 win: `W` (1) vs `O` (1). `W` wins. `W` has 2 wins. This requires `f(1)` players for `W` and `f(1)` players for `O`. Total `f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4` players.\n    To minimize players for `W` to win 2 games, we pick the first option: `f(2) = 3`.\n- To win 3 games: `W` (2 wins) needs an opponent `O`.\n    - If `O` has 1 win: `W` (2) vs `O` (1). `W` wins. `W` has 3 wins. This requires `f(2)` players for `W` and `f(1)` players for `O`. Total `f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5` players.\n    - If `O` has 2 wins: `W` (2) vs `O` (2). `W` wins. `W` has 3 wins. This requires `f(2)` players for `W` and `f(2)` players for `O`. Total `f(2) + f(2) = 3 + 3 = 6` players.\n    To minimize players for `W` to win 3 games, we pick the first option: `f(3) = 5`.\n\nThis pattern suggests that to minimize the total number of players for `W` to win `k` games, `W` should always play against an opponent who has won `k-1` games. This means `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!\nLet's re-index:\n`F_0 = 1` (players needed for 0 wins)\n`F_1 = 2` (players needed for 1 win)\n`F_2 = F_1 + F_0 = 2 + 1 = 3` (players needed for 2 wins)\n`F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 3 + 2 = 5` (players needed for 3 wins)\n`F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 5 + 3 = 8` (players needed for 4 wins)\n`F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 8 + 5 = 13` (players needed for 5 wins)\n\nIn general, `F_k` is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `F_k <= n`.\n\nLet's list the Fibonacci sequence (standard definition where `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, ...`):\n`fib(0) = 0`\n`fib(1) = 1`\n`fib(2) = 1`\n`fib(3) = 2`\n`fib(4) = 3`\n`fib(5) = 5`\n`fib(6) = 8`\n`fib(7) = 13`\n...\n\nComparing our `F_k` sequence with the standard Fibonacci sequence:\n`F_0 = 1`\n`F_1 = 2 = fib(3)`\n`F_2 = 3 = fib(4)`\n`F_3 = 5 = fib(5)`\n`F_k = fib(k+2)`\n\nSo, we need to find the largest `k` such that `fib(k+2) <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently until they exceed `n`.\nWe can do this iteratively:\n\nInitialize `a = 1` (representing `fib(2)` or `F_0` if we think of it as players needed for 0 games)\nInitialize `b = 2` (representing `fib(3)` or `F_1` if we think of it as players needed for 1 game)\nInitialize `games = 1` (because `b=2` players allow 1 game for the winner)\n\nLoop:\nWhile `b <= n`:\n  `temp = b`\n  `b = a + b`\n  `a = temp`\n  `games += 1`\n\nAfter the loop, `b` will be the first Fibonacci number `> n`. The previous value of `b` (which is stored in `a` before the last update) would be the largest Fibonacci number `F_k <= n`. The `games` counter will correctly track `k`.\n\nLet's trace with examples:\n`n = 2`:\n  `a = 1, b = 2, games = 1`\n  Loop: `b (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n    `temp = 2`\n    `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n    `a = 2`\n    `games = 2`\n  Loop: `b (3) <= n (2)` is false.\n  Result: `games - 1 = 1` (because `games` incremented one too many times after `b` exceeded `n`).\n  Correct output for `n=2` is `1`.\n\n`n = 3`:\n  `a = 1, b = 2, games = 1`\n  Loop: `b (2) <= n (3)` is true.\n    `temp = 2`\n    `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n    `a = 2`\n    `games = 2`\n  Loop: `b (3) <= n (3)` is true.\n    `temp = 3`\n    `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n    `a = 3`\n    `games = 3`\n  Loop: `b (5) <= n (3)` is false.\n  Result: `games - 1 = 2`.\n  Correct output for `n=3` is `2`.\n\n`n = 4`:\n  `a = 1, b = 2, games = 1`\n  Loop: `b (2) <= n (4)` is true.\n    `temp = 2`\n    `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n    `a = 2`\n    `games = 2`\n  Loop: `b (3) <= n (4)` is true.\n    `temp = 3`\n    `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n    `a = 3`\n    `games = 3`\n  Loop: `b (5) <= n (4)` is false.\n  Result: `games - 1 = 2`.\n  Correct output for `n=4` is `2`.\n\n`n = 10`:\n  `a = 1, b = 2, games = 1`\n  `b (2) <= 10`: `a=2, b=3, games=2`\n  `b (3) <= 10`: `a=3, b=5, games=3`\n  `b (5) <= 10`: `a=5, b=8, games=4`\n  `b (8) <= 10`: `a=8, b=13, games=5`\n  `b (13) <= 10` is false.\n  Result: `games - 1 = 4`.\n  Correct output for `n=10` is `4`.\n\nThe logic seems correct. The number of Fibonacci numbers up to `10^18` is relatively small (around 90), so this iterative approach is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for the minimum number of players needed for k games:\n    # F_0 = 1 player for 0 games (winner has played 0 games)\n    # F_1 = 2 players for 1 game (winner has played 1 game)\n    # F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2} for k >= 2\n    # This sequence corresponds to F_k = fib(k+2) where fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1.\n\n    # a represents F_{k-1} (players needed for k-1 games)\n    # b represents F_k (players needed for k games)\n    # games represents k (the number of games the winner has played)\n\n    # Initial state:\n    # For 0 games, 1 player is needed (F_0 = 1).\n    # For 1 game, 2 players are needed (F_1 = 2).\n    # We start with the state where the winner has played 1 game.\n    a = 1 # Corresponds to F_0\n    b = 2 # Corresponds to F_1\n    games = 1 # Number of games for the winner corresponding to 'b' players\n\n    # We want to find the maximum 'games' such that 'b' (players needed) <= n.\n    while b <= n:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number in our sequence\n        next_b = a + b\n        a = b\n        b = next_b\n        games += 1\n    \n    # After the loop, 'b' is the first Fibonacci number (players needed) that is > n.\n    # The previous 'b' (which is now stored in 'a') was the largest Fibonacci number <= n.\n    # The 'games' counter was incremented one too many times in the last iteration\n    # when 'b' became > n.
