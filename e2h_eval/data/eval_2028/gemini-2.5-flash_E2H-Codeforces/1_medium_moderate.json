The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "**Analysis and Implementation for Gilded Cell Calculation**\n\nMy task is to write a Python script to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, with dimensions `w` and `h`, and `k` concentric rings. Each ring is one cell wide and borders an inner rectangle.\n\nThe core idea is to determine the number of cells in each ring, which is essentially the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle. Let `i` be the ring index (1-indexed), the inner rectangle dimensions are `w - 4(i-1)` by `h - 4(i-1)`. After careful analysis of the perimeter calculation, I found that the formula for calculating gilded cells in each ring `i`, where `i` runs from `1` to `k`, will be `current_w * current_h - max(0, current_w - 2) * max(0, current_h - 2)`.\n\nHowever, given the problem constraints, particularly the limit on `k`, and since the effective value of w and h is always at least 3 after subtracting `4(i-1)` from them, this can be simplified to `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n\nThe simplest way to calculate the total gilded cells is an iterative approach: iterate through each ring, calculate the perimeter of the ring's corresponding inner rectangle using the simplified perimeter formula and add it to the total count. I'm going to implement it this way.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` is constrained by the minimum of `w` and `h`. After careful derivation, I found `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This guarantees that the width and height of the inner rectangles will always be at least 3, making the simplified perimeter formula valid.\n\nI'll write the script using Python's `sys` module for reading input and `print` for output and call a `solve()` function with the input/output mechanism. The input will be read from standard input as space-separated integers, representing `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n\nThe iterative solution will be efficient because `k` is guaranteed to be small. The computational complexity will be O(k), which is acceptable given the small `k` constraint. No explicit closed-form formula is necessary.",
