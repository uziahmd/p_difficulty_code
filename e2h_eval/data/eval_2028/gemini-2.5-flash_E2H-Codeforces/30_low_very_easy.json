Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"TV Game\" problem. It seems straightforward at first glance, but there's a little bit of a twist to figuring out the optimal strategy.  The core of it is a game between Homer and Marge, where they're trying to maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\nI've got the basics down: we're dealing with a number `A` with an even number of digits (let's call it `2n`). Each player gets `n` turns, picking the leftmost digit available from `A` and appending it to their own number. The final goal is to generate the moves for the solution. I need to produce an output string of `2n` characters, showing the moves.\n\nI've already started sketching out a few scenarios.  Take that first example with `n=2` and `A = \"1234\"`.  I had to think about edge cases (like one player taking everything, which is obviously not allowed). Then, I manually traced a few move sequences like `HHMM`, `HMHM`, and `HMMH` to get a feel for how the sums change. I could see how the sum varies depending on which player gets which digits. The whole problem is about distributing the digits strategically.\n\nThe key realization is the important observation:  the relative order of the digits *within* each player's number is preserved. This is huge! It means I'm not dealing with rearranging individual digits, just deciding which digits go to which player.  I need to figure out an algorithm that exploits this order preservation to make the best decisions. It's like finding the optimal partitioning strategy. Now I need to design an algorithm for a robust Python script to handle this!\n",
