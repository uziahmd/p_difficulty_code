    "thought": "**Algorithm Design and Implementation for the \"Gluttony\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with tackling the \"Gluttony\" problem.  The goal is to generate a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sum of elements in any proper, non-empty subset of indices in `a` is *different* from the sum of elements in the same subset using `b`.  The constraint that `n` is limited to 22 clues me in to explore exponential time complexities, potentially involving bitmasks or a \"meet-in-the-middle\" approach, but I suspect there's a more efficient solution to be found.\n\nThinking this through, the condition boils down to ensuring that `sum_a(S) - sum_b(S) != 0` for all valid subsets `S`. If we let `c[i] = a[i] - b[i]`, we need `sum(c[i]) != 0` for all non-empty, proper subsets. The key observation is that `sum(c[i])` over the entire array *must* equal zero, since `b` is a permutation of `a`.  This means the sums can *never* be equal for the entire array. This is consistent with the constraints.  So, the critical condition becomes finding `b` that avoids subset sum collisions.\n\nMy initial thought is to simply try a cyclic shift: `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`.  A quick test shows that this *does* work for smaller values of `n`.  However, it might not always be the case if the elements in `a` are \"too close\" in value, leading to sums that match.\n\nDigging further, I realize that sorting `a` first could be beneficial. My current hunch is to sort `a` in ascending order. Then, construct `b` using the cyclic shift strategy mentioned before. This makes sense. The key is in the differences.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Sort and Store:** Read `n` and `a`, and create a paired list to preserve original indexes.\n2.  **Sort the paired list of (value, original_index)** sort `a` in ascending order (based on values), and then build `b` using this sorted order.\n3.  **Construct `b`:** Build the `b` array by assigning each value from sorted `a` to its new position determined by a circular shift in its original index. This creates a permutation of the original array.\n\nAfter a detailed proof, I am convinced that this \"sorted cyclic shift\" strategy is mathematically sound and meets the conditions.  It guarantees that `sum_a(S) != sum_b(S)` for all valid subsets, making the implementation efficient. Time to code it up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` (of `n` distinct integers) such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\n\nLet's define `c[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. The condition becomes `sum_{i in S} c[i] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\nSince `b` is a permutation of `a`, the total sum of elements is the same: `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b[i]`. This implies `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c[i] = 0`. This is consistent with the problem statement that the condition does not apply to the full set of indices (`|S|=n`).\n\nConsider the following strategy:\n1. Pair each element `a[k]` with its original index `k`. So we have `(a[k], k)` for `k = 0, ..., n-1`.\n2. Sort these pairs based on the values `a[k]` in ascending order. Let the sorted list of pairs be `sorted_a_pairs = [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]`, where `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}` are the sorted values from `a`, and `idx_k` is the original index of `val_k` in `a`.\n3. Construct the array `b` as follows: for each `k` from `0` to `n-1`, place `val_{(k+1)%n}` into `b` at the original index `idx_k`. In other words, if `a[idx_k]` is the `k`-th smallest element, then `b[idx_k]` will be the `(k+1)%n`-th smallest element.\n\nLet's prove why this strategy works for `n >= 2`.\nLet `a_k = val_k` be the `k`-th smallest element (after sorting `a`).\nOur construction defines `b[idx_k] = a_{(k+1)%n}`.\nLet `c_k = a_k - a_{(k+1)%n}`.\nThe values `c_k` are:\n* `c_0 = a_0 - a_1 < 0` (since `a_0 < a_1`)\n* `c_1 = a_1 - a_2 < 0`\n* ...\n* `c_{n-2} = a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} < 0`\n* `c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0` (since `a_{n-1} > a_0`)\n\nNow, consider any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` from the *original* array `a`.\nThe condition `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]` is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a[i] - b[i]) != 0`.\nLet's convert `S` to a set of indices `K` corresponding to the sorted values `a_k`. That is, `K = {k | idx_k \\in S}`.\nThen we need to check `sum_{k \\in K} (a_k - a_{(k+1)%n}) != 0`.\n\nCase 1: `n-1 \\notin K`.\nIn this case, all `k \\in K` satisfy `k < n-1`. For such `k`, `a_k - a_{(k+1)%n} = a_k - a_{k+1}` which is strictly negative.\nSince `K` is non-empty, `sum_{k \\in K} (a_k - a_{k+1})` is a sum of one or more negative numbers. Thus, the sum is strictly negative and therefore non-zero. The condition holds.\n\nCase 2: `n-1 \\in K`.\nLet `K' = K \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`.\nThe sum is `(a_{n-1} - a_0) + sum_{k \\in K'} (a_k - a_{k+1})`.\nWe know `a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`.\nFor `k \\in K'`, `a_k - a_{k+1} < 0`.\nIf `K'` is empty, then `K = \\{n-1\\}`, and the sum is `a_{n-1} - a_0`, which is strictly positive and thus non-zero. The condition holds.\nIf `K'` is non-empty, `sum_{k \\in K'} (a_k - a_{k+1})` is a sum of negative numbers, so it is strictly negative.\nConsider the sum of all negative `c_k` terms: `sum_{k=0}^{n-2} (a_k - a_{k+1}) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}) = a_0 - a_{n-1}`.\nThis means `sum_{k=0}^{n-2} (a_k - a_{k+1}) = -(a_{n-1} - a_0)`.\nSince `K'` is a proper subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}` (because `|K| < n` implies `|K'| < n-1`), the sum `sum_{k \\in K'} (a_k - a_{k+1})` will be strictly greater than `a_0 - a_{n-1}` (i.e., less negative).\nSo, `a_0 - a_{n-1} < sum_{k \\in K'} (a_k - a_{k+1}) < 0`.\nLet `X = sum_{k \\in K'} (a_k - a_{k+1})`.\nWe need to show `(a_{n-1} - a_0) + X \\neq 0`.\nFrom the inequality, `X > -(a_{n-1} - a_0)`.\nAdding `(a_{n-1} - a_0)` to both sides gives:\n`(a_{n-1} - a_0) + X > (a_{n-1} - a_0) - (a_{n-1} - a_0) = 0`.\nThus, `(a_{n-1} - a_0) + X` is strictly positive and therefore non-zero. The condition holds.\n\nSince all cases satisfy the condition, this strategy always works for `n >= 2`.\n\nFor `n=1`: The problem statement specifies `0 < k < n`. For `n=1`, there are no such `k`. So, the condition is vacuously true. Any permutation `b` of `a` works. Since `a` has only one element, `b` must be `a` itself.\n\nExample: `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. Pairs with original indices: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. Sorted pairs: `sorted_a_pairs = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   `val_0=1, idx_0=3`\n   `val_1=10, idx_1=2`\n   `val_2=100, idx_2=1`\n   `val_3=1000, idx_3=0`\n3. Construct `b`:\n   `b` is initialized as `[None, None, None, None]`\n   `k=0`: `b[idx_0] = val_{(0+1)%4}` => `b[3] = val_1 = 10`\n   `k=1`: `b[idx_1] = val_{(1+1)%4}` => `b[2] = val_2 = 100`\n   `k=2`: `b[idx_2] = val_{(2+1)%4}` => `b[1] = val_3 = 1000`\n   `k=3`: `b[idx_3] = val_{(3+1)%4}` => `b[0] = val_0 = 1`\n   Result `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. This is a valid answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        # For n=1, there are no non-empty proper subsets of indices (0 < k < n is impossible).\n        # So any permutation works.
