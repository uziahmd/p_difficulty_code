The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and the goal is to maximize the number of chests I can open. The core idea is that a key opens a chest if the sum of the key and chest values is odd, meaning one has to be even and the other odd.  That's the fundamental constraint: different parities unlock the chest.\n\nMy first step is to break down this parity condition. If a chest value is even, I *need* an odd key, and vice versa.  Now, I'm given the number of chests, `n`, and keys, `m`, along with their individual values.  I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to match them.\n\nIt's clear I'll need to sort my information by parity. I'll count the number of even and odd chests, calling these `chests_even` and `chests_odd` respectively. Similarly, I'll count the number of even and odd keys, storing them in `keys_even` and `keys_odd`.  The sums of these represent the total number of chests and keys I have, respectively.\n\nThe pairings are key here (pun intended). Even chests can *only* be opened by odd keys, and odd chests can *only* be opened by even keys.  These two pairings are completely independent of each other.  I'm thinking I can just solve each pairing problem separately and then add the results.\n\nFor the even chests and odd keys, I've got `chests_even` chests and `keys_odd` keys.  The maximum number of chests I can open here is limited by whichever is smaller, the number of even chests or the number of odd keys, because each key or chest can only be used once. I can compute this with `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd chests and even keys, I have `chests_odd` and `keys_even`.  The maximum number of pairings is  `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two pairings don't affect each other, the total number of chests I can open is the sum of these two results: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  It's pretty elegant, and doesn't seem to have any redundant calculations.\n\nI'm feeling good about this solution. I should try a quick test case to be sure, and then submit!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThere are two scenarios for this condition to be met:\n1. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n2. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys by their parity:\n- Count the number of chests with even numbers (`chests_even`).\n- Count the number of chests with odd numbers (`chests_odd`).\n- Count the number of keys with even numbers (`keys_even`).\n- Count the number of keys with odd numbers (`keys_odd`).\n\nNow, we can consider the two independent ways to form valid pairings:\n\n1.  **Pairing even chests with odd keys:**\n    An even chest can only be opened by an odd key. We have `chests_even` such chests and `keys_odd` such keys. The maximum number of pairings we can make in this category is limited by whichever count is smaller. So, we can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` even chests using odd keys.\n\n2.  **Pairing odd chests with even keys:**\n    An odd chest can only be opened by an even key. We have `chests_odd` such chests and `keys_even` such keys. Similarly, the maximum number of pairings here is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two types of pairings use distinct sets of chests (even vs. odd) and distinct sets of keys (odd vs. even), they do not interfere with each other. Therefore, to find the total maximum number of chests Neko can open, we simply sum the maximums from these two independent categories.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`, `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`:\n   - If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`.\n   - Else, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`:\n   - If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`.\n   - Else, increment `keys_odd`.\n5. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n6. Print the result.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=5, m=4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\nChest parities:\n- `9` (odd)\n- `14` (even)\n- `6` (even)\n- `2` (even)\n- `11` (odd)\nSo, `chests_even = 3`, `chests_odd = 2`.\n\nKey parities:\n- `8` (even)\n- `4` (even)\n- `7` (odd)\n- `20` (even)\nSo, `keys_even = 3`, `keys_odd = 1`.\n\nCalculate pairings:\n- Even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n- Odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `1 + 2 = 3`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then performing a simple arithmetic calculation. The time complexity will be O(N + M), which is well within limits for N, M up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # An even chest needs an odd key.\n    # An odd chest needs an even key.\n    \n    # Max pairings of even chests with odd keys\n    match_even_chests_odd_keys = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # Max pairings of odd chests with even keys\n    match_odd_chests_even_keys = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    total_opened_chests = match_even_chests_odd_keys + match_odd_chests_even_keys\n    \n    print(total_opened_chests)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
