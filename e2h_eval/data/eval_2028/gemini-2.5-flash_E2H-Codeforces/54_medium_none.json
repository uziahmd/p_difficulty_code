Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solving the Mister B and Angle in Polygon Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to write a Python script to tackle this competitive programming problem. The core is to find three distinct vertices in a regular *n*-gon that create an angle as close as possible to a given angle *a*.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the angles within a regular polygon. Since all vertices are on a circumcircle, angles formed by these vertices are inscribed angles. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Fixing one vertex (let's call it *v2* and without loss of generality, we can rotate the polygon) helps us simplify things. If we number the vertices clockwise from 1 to *n*, each side of the regular *n*-gon creates a central angle of `360/n` degrees, and thus, a corresponding arc length.\n\nNow, let's say *v2* is vertex 1. We have two other vertices, *v1* and *v3*. The angle *v1-v2-v3* is what we're after. To find this angle, we'll determine the intercepted arc's length *not* including *v2*. If *v1* and *v3* are vertices *j* and *k* respectively, then the number of segments between them along the arc that doesn't include *v2* is key.\n\nFocusing on fixing *v2* as vertex 1 makes the calculations easier. Let *v1* be vertex 2. Now we need to determine *v3* such that the arc between them creates an angle closest to *a*. Let the number of sides (segments) between *v1* and *v3* be *k* (where *k* ranges from 1 to *n-2* because all the vertices must be distinct, or the intercepted arc is not of length 0). So the possible inscribed angles will be *k*(180/*n*). Our goal is to minimize the difference `|k * (180 / n) - a|`.\n\nThis leads to a strategy: we calculate `base_angle = 180.0 / n` and then the ideal *k* value, `k_ideal = a / base_angle`. Since *k* has to be an integer between 1 and n-2, we need the closest integer to *k_ideal*, so we test `floor(k_ideal)` and `ceil(k_ideal)`. We'll call these, adjusted to be within the required range, `k_cand1` and `k_cand2`.  We then compare the absolute differences between `k_cand1 * base_angle` and *a*, and `k_cand2 * base_angle` and *a* to determine the best *k*. Let's call this the `best_k`.\n\nWe can then construct a valid solution by setting *v2=1*, *v1=2*.\nFor any `best_k` value the *v3* can be calculated and will be in the correct range so it's a valid solution, no matter the specific *n* or *a* values.\nI'll select vertices `2, 1, and 2 + best_k`. Making sure the third vertex is in range of 1 to n.\n\nThe goal is achieved by calculating the angle for all possible values. This approach is guaranteed to work and return a solution. I'll make sure to check all of the constraints regarding input ranges and that output is within the boundaries of a valid polygon.\n",
