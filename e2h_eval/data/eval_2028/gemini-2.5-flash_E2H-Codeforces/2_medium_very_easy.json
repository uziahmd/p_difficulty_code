Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Solver**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to determine if a character grid forms an \"X\" based on specific criteria. The key is to efficiently check the diagonals and non-diagonal elements, adhering to the given rules.  First, the input is read, getting `n`, the grid size, and the grid itself. I immediately need to establish that this input is valid: `n` has to be an odd number (which is given), and `3 <= n < 300` ensures that it's a manageable problem, and there will be non-diagonal cells to work with.\n\nThe algorithm needs to establish `diag_char` (the character on the diagonals) and `other_char` (the character for all the other cells). I'll initialize them and iterate to determine the values; checking if the initial `diag_char` and `other_char` are the same, if so, immediately print \"NO\" and return. Then, I iterate through the grid. While doing this, I'll need to use two nested loops to check. If the character isn't correct, \"NO\" is printed. Otherwise, and if all is well, then I print \"YES\". After the iteration, the checks will complete and the correct answer will be printed. The iteration strategy is important.  I'll want to avoid unnecessary looping.\n\nI think a \"determine then verify\" approach makes the code cleaner. First, I identify the characters: I take the top-left element as `diag_char`, then find any non-diagonal element.  If these two are the same, it's immediately \"NO\". Then I use nested loops again: for the diagonal cells, confirm they are all equal to the first diagonal cell. And for all non-diagonal cells, confirm that they are equal to the `other_char`.\n\nI think this approach is quite robust, especially now that I've refined how I calculate the characters. This algorithm should easily handle different grid sizes within the given constraints. Also, the code will be very readable. Seems this should do the trick. Now it's time to write the code.\n",
