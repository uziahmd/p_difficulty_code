The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for the Xenia and Ringroad Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let me break this down. The core is figuring out the minimum time to complete a series of tasks on a circular road. I have `n` houses and `m` tasks.  Each task `a_i` specifies the house I need to be at, and these tasks must be done in order. I start at house 1.\n\nThe crucial part is calculating the time to move between houses.  It's clockwise, and it takes one unit of time to move to the next house. So, I need an algorithm that efficiently computes the distance. Let's see... I'll maintain a `current_pos` which is Xenia's location and `total_time` accumulated.\n\nFirst, I initialize `current_pos` to 1 and `total_time` to 0.\n\nNow, for each task `a_i`, I'll consider that the target house is `target_pos`. To calculate the time to move from my current position to the target, I'll consider two cases.\n\nIf `target_pos` is greater than or equal to `current_pos`, the time is simply `target_pos - current_pos`.  Easy.\n\nIf `target_pos` is less than `current_pos`, I need to go around the circle. That means the time calculation is a bit more involved. The distance from `current_pos` to `n` would be `n - current_pos`. Then, the distance from 1 to `target_pos` is `target_pos - 1`. The total time is going to be the sum of these two, with a plus 1 to account for moving to house 1. So, that's `(n - current_pos) + (target_pos - 1) + 1`. This looks correct.\n\nI need to iterate through the list of tasks. For each task, I'll calculate the time to the target house using this logic, add it to `total_time`, and update `current_pos`. In the end, `total_time` will hold the minimum time, which I need to return. Seems like this approach will work and I think I can translate this directly into Python. I'll need a loop and the conditional logic. Time to code this!\n",
