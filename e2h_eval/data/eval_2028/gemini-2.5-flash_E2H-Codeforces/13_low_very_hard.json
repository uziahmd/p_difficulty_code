For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Triad Classification Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: I need to write a Python script that can tell me whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or is just... strange.  This seems pretty straightforward, but I need to think through the steps carefully to make it robust.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes themselves numerically.  The idea of mapping each of the 12 notes (C, C#, D, etc.) to a corresponding integer from 0 to 11 seems like the perfect solution. This will make calculating distances between notes – the core of this problem – a breeze.  I'll define C as 0, C# as 1, and so on.\n\nNext, I have to figure out how to calculate the *semitone* distance between two notes, taking into account the cyclic nature of the musical scale (H looping back to C).  The formula `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` looks like it'll do the trick, ensuring a positive distance within the 0-11 semitone range.  This accounts for both directions (e.g., C to E and E to C).\n\nNow, the core of the classification! I know that a major triad has a specific interval pattern (4 semitones then 3), and a minor triad has a different pattern (3 semitones then 4). Because the *order* of the notes doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible permutations of the three notes.  I'll read in the three notes, convert them to their integer values, and then systematically try all orderings, checking if the intervals between them match either the major or minor triad definition.  Since the problem guarantees unambiguity (it won't be both major and minor), the first match I find should be the correct classification.  If none of the orderings fit, then it must be a \"strange\" triad.\n",
