She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Tab Closure Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving closing tabs. The core is straightforward: I need to efficiently close tabs outside a given range `[l, r]`. I start with `n` tabs and the cursor at `pos`. My options are to move the cursor left or right and to close tabs on either side of the cursor.  `a` and `b` track the min/max open tab indices.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down into cases. First, if `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, I'm golden - no action needed, zero cost.\n\nNext, I consider the case where I only need to close tabs to the left (`l > 1`, `r = n`). I need to get the cursor to the *right* of `l` and then I can close the left tabs, increasing 'a' on each closure.  I realized it doesn't matter *where* within the open range `[l,n]` the cursor is, as long as it's at least `l`. The optimal cost is essentially the distance the cursor needs to move to `l` (or from whatever tab it's at, to `l`) plus one for the closure operation: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\nThe inverse case is where I only close tabs to the right (`l = 1`, `r < n`).  The logic mirrors the previous case, but the cursor must move to *the left* of `r`, and then close the right tabs. The cost again is the absolute distance from `pos` to `r`, plus one for the close: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\nEffectively, I've narrowed this down to these core calculations based on which side or sides of the range need closure. I feel like this is a good path to quickly arriving at an efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`).\n\nLet's analyze the operations and conditions:\n- `n`: total number of tabs.\n- `pos`: current cursor position.\n- `l`: leftmost tab to keep.\n- `r`: rightmost tab to keep.\n\nEach operation takes 1 second:\n1. Move cursor left.\n2. Move cursor right.\n3. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (from `a` to `cursor-1`).\n4. Close all tabs to the right of the cursor (from `cursor+1` to `b`).\n`a` and `b` are the minimum and maximum indices of currently unclosed tabs. Initially, `a=1, b=n`.\n\nWe need to perform at most two \"close\" operations: one for the left side (if `l > 1`) and one for the right side (if `r < n`).\n\n**Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nIf `l = 1` and `r = n`, all tabs are within the desired range. No operations are needed.\nCost = 0.\n\n**Case 2: Only tabs to the left need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r = n`.\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or any tab `i > l` if we are closing `[a, i-1]`). The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then close tabs to its left.\n- Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n- Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: 1 second.\nTotal cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: Only tabs to the right need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l = 1` and `r < n`.\nWe need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or any tab `i < r` if we are closing `[i+1, b]`). The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then close tabs to its right.\n- Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n- Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: 1 second.\nTotal cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Case 4: Both left and right tabs need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`.\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This will require two \"close\" operations.\nThe cursor must visit `l` (to close left tabs) and `r` (to close right tabs). The order doesn't matter for the final state, but it affects the path.\nLet's analyze the path:\n- **Option A: Close left tabs first, then right tabs.**\n    1. Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2. Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: 1 second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    3. Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `abs(l - r)` seconds.\n    4. Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: 1 second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n- **Option B: Close right tabs first, then left tabs.**\n    1. Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2. Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: 1 second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    3. Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `abs(r - l)` seconds.\n    4. Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: 1 second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n\nThe minimum cost for Case 4 is `min(Option A, Option B)`.\nNotice that `abs(l - r)` is the same as `abs(r - l)`. So, the costs are:\n`min(abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2)`.\nThis can be simplified. The path involves moving from `pos` to one end (`l` or `r`), then to the other end.\n- If `pos` is to the left of `l` (i.e., `pos < l`): We must move right to `l` (`l - pos` steps), then continue right to `r` (`r - l` steps). Total move: `r - pos`. Cost: `(r - pos) + 2`.\n- If `pos` is to the right of `r` (i.e., `pos > r`): We must move left to `r` (`pos - r` steps), then continue left to `l` (`r - l` steps). Total move: `pos - l`. Cost: `(pos - l) + 2`.\n- If `pos` is between `l` and `r` (i.e., `l <= pos <= r`): We can choose to go to `l` first (`pos - l` steps), then to `r` (`r - l` steps). Total move: `(pos - l) + (r - l) = pos - 2l + r`. No, this is wrong. Total move `(pos - l) + (r - pos) = r - l`. This is the distance between l and r. The path is from `pos` to `l`, then to `r`, or from `pos` to `r`, then to `l`. The total movement will be `(pos - l)` to reach `l` then `(r - l)` to reach `r` (if `pos` is closer to `l`) OR `(r - pos)` to reach `r` then `(r - l)` to reach `l` (if `pos` is closer to `r`).\n    The total movement distance is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + abs(l - r)`.\n    For example, if `pos=3, l=2, r=4`:\n    - Go `pos -> l`: `abs(3-2)=1`. Then `l -> r`: `abs(2-4)=2`. Total move: `1+2=3`. Cost `3+2=5`.\n    - Go `pos -> r`: `abs(3-4)=1`. Then `r -> l`: `abs(4-2)=2`. Total move: `1+2=3`. Cost `3+2=5`.\n    This is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))` (to reach the closer end) + `abs(l - r)` (to traverse to the other end) + 2 (for two close operations).\n    So, `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations:\n1. If `l == 1` and `r == n`: cost = 0.\n2. If `l == 1` (only need to close right side): cost = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n3. If `r == n` (only need to close left side): cost = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n4. If `l > 1` and `r < n` (need to close both sides):\n   The cursor must move to `l` and `r` at some point.\n   The total movement will be from `pos` to one of `l` or `r`, then from that point to the other (`l` or `r`).\n   - If `pos < l`: Cursor is to the left of the required segment. It must move right to `r` (passing `l`). Total move: `r - pos`. Cost: `(r - pos) + 2`.\n   - If `pos > r`: Cursor is to the right of the required segment. It must move left to `l` (passing `r`). Total move: `pos - l`. Cost: `(pos - l) + 2`.\n   - If `l <= pos <= r`: Cursor is within the required segment. It can go to `l` first, then to `r`, or to `r` first, then to `l`.\n     - To `l` then `r`: `(pos - l)` moves to `l`, then `(r - l)` moves to `r`. Total moves: `(pos - l) + (r - l)`.\n     - To `r` then `l`: `(r - pos)` moves to `r`, then `(r - l)` moves to `l`. Total moves: `(r - pos) + (r - l)`.\n     The minimum of these two sequences of moves is `min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l)`.\n     Cost: `min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l) + 2`.\n     This can be simplified: `min(pos - l + r - l, r - pos + r - l) + 2 = min(pos - 2*l + r, 2*r - pos - l) + 2`.\n     This is equivalent to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n     For example, if `pos=3, l=2, r=4`: `min(3-2, 4-3) + (4-2) + 2 = min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`.\n     Example 1: `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`. `l > 1` and `r < n`.\n     `l <= pos <= r` (2 <= 3 <= 4).\n     Cost = `min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l) + 2`\n          = `min(3 - 2, 4 - 3) + (4 - 2) + 2`\n          = `min(1, 1) + 2 + 2`\n          = `1 + 2 + 2 = 5`. This matches the example.\n\nLet's test all conditions with the examples:\n\nExample 1: `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\n- `l=2`, `r=4`. `l > 1` and `r < n`. This is Case 4.\n- `l <= pos <= r` (2 <= 3 <= 4).\n- Cost = `min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l) + 2`\n        = `min(3 - 2, 4 - 3) + (4 - 2) + 2`\n        = `min(1, 1) + 2 + 2`\n        = `1 + 2 + 2 = 5`. Correct.\n\nExample 2: `n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\n- `l=1`, `r=3`. `l = 1` and `r < n`. This is Case 3.\n- Cost = `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n        = `abs(3 - 3) + 1`\n        = `0 + 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\nExample 3: `n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\n- `l=1`, `r=5`. `l = 1` and `r = n`. This is Case 1.\n- Cost = `0`. Correct.\n\nFinal refined logic:\n1. Initialize `ans = 0`.\n2. If `l > 1`: We need to close tabs to the left.\n   - `ans += 1` (for the \"close left\" operation).\n   - `ans += abs(pos - l)` (to move cursor to `l`).\n   - `pos = l` (update cursor position for subsequent calculations).\n3. If `r < n`: We need to close tabs to the right.\n   - `ans += 1` (for the \"close right\" operation).\n   - `ans += abs(pos - r)` (to move cursor from its current `pos` to `r`).\n   - `pos = r` (update cursor position, though not strictly needed here).\n\nLet's re-evaluate Example 1 with this logic: `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\n- Initial `ans = 0`.\n- `l > 1` (2 > 1) is true:\n    - `ans += 1` (`ans = 1`).\n    - `ans += abs(pos - l)` (`ans = 1 + abs(3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`).\n    - `pos = l` (`pos = 2`).\n- `r < n` (4 < 6) is true:\n    - `ans += 1` (`ans = 2 + 1 = 3`).\n    - `ans += abs(pos - r)` (`ans = 3 + abs(2 - 4) = 3 + 2 = 5`).\n    - `pos = r` (`pos = 4`).\n- Final `ans = 5`. This works!\n\nThis greedy approach of moving to one end, closing, then moving to the other end, closing, seems to cover all cases correctly.\nThe crucial part is that when we move `pos` to `l` and close tabs `[1, l-1]`, the effective `a` becomes `l`. When we move `pos` to `r` and close tabs `[r+1, n]`, the effective `b` becomes `r`. The movement costs are purely distance.\n\nThe order of closing matters for `pos` updates but not for the total distance.\nIf `l > 1` and `r < n`:\nOption 1: Close left first.\n  `cost = abs(pos - l) + 1` (move to `l`, close left)\n  `pos` is now `l`.\n  `cost += abs(l - r) + 1` (move from `l` to `r`, close right)\n  Total: `abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2`\nOption 2: Close right first.\n  `cost = abs(pos - r) + 1` (move to `r`, close right)\n  `pos` is now `r`.\n  `cost += abs(r - l) + 1` (move from `r` to `l`, close left)\n  Total: `abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2`\n\nThe minimum of these two is the answer when both `l > 1` and `r < n`.\nMy simplified logic:\n`ans = 0`\n`current_pos = pos`\n`if l > 1:`\n  `ans += abs(current_pos - l) + 1`\n  `current_pos = l`\n`if r < n:`\n  `ans += abs(current_pos - r) + 1`\n  `current_pos = r`\n\nThis logic implicitly assumes a fixed order (left then right if both are needed).\nLet's check `n=10, pos=1, l=5, r=8`.\nMy logic:\n`ans = 0`. `current_pos = 1`.\n`l > 1` (5 > 1) is true:\n  `ans += abs(1 - 5) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n  `current_pos = 5`.\n`r < n` (8 < 10) is true:\n  `ans += abs(5 - 8) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n  `ans = 5 + 4 = 9`.\nResult: 9.\n\nUsing the `min` approach for Case 4:\n`abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2 = abs(1 - 5) + abs(5 - 8) + 2 = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9`.\n`abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2 = abs(1 - 8) + abs(8 - 5) + 2 = 7 + 3 + 2 = 12`.\nMinimum is 9.\n\nMy simplified logic gives the correct answer for `n=10, pos=1, l=5, r=8`.\nIt seems that the path from `pos` to `l` then to `r` (if `pos` is closer to `l` or `l` is between `pos` and `r`) or `pos` to `r` then to `l` (if `pos` is closer to `r` or `r` is between `pos` and `l`) is indeed the optimal one.\nThe \"simplified logic\" actually calculates `abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2` if `l > 1` and `r < n`.\nThis is only one of the two options. The other option is `abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2`.\nWe need to take the minimum of these two.\n\nSo, the logic should be:\n1. If `l == 1` and `r == n`: `print(0)`\n2. If `l == 1`: `print(abs(pos - r) + 1)`\n3. If `r == n`: `print(abs(pos - l) + 1)`\n4. If `l > 1` and `r < n`:\n   `cost1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`\n   `cost2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`\n   `print(min(cost1, cost2))`\n\nThis covers all cases and is correct.\n\nLet's verify again with `n=10, pos=10, l=3, r=7`.\n- `l > 1` and `r < n`. Case 4.\n- `cost1 = abs(10 - 3) + 1 + abs(3 - 7) + 1 = 7 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 13`. (Move pos->l, close left, move l->r, close right)\n- `cost2 = abs(10 - 7) + 1 + abs(7 - 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9`. (Move pos->r, close right, move r->l, close left)\n- `min(13, 9) = 9`.\n\nThis is correct. The `min` is necessary when both sides need closing.\nThe simplified logic from before (which I called \"my logic\"):\n`ans = 0`. `current_pos = 10`.\n`l > 1` (3 > 1) is true:\n  `ans += abs(10 - 3) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8`.\n  `current_pos = 3`.\n`r < n` (7 < 10) is true:\n  `ans += abs(3 - 7) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n  `ans = 8 + 5 = 13`.\nThis simplified logic yields 13, which is `cost1`, but not `min(cost1, cost2)`.\nSo, the `if/elif/else` structure is necessary.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.\n        print(0)\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Case 2: Only tabs to the right need to be closed.\n        # Move cursor to r, then close tabs to the right.\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(cost)\n    elif r == n:\n        # Case 3: Only tabs to the left need to be closed.\n        # Move cursor to l, then close tabs to the left.\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(cost)\n    else:\n        # Case 4: Both left and right tabs need to be closed.\n        # We need two close operations (+2 seconds).\n        # The cursor must traverse the path from pos to l and to r.\n        # There are two main strategies:\n        # 1.
