There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solving the Zoning Restriction Problem**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for tackling this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem.  First, the goal is to maximize the profit from building houses, where profit is the square of a house's height.  There are *n* spots, each with a house, and the height of each house *i* can range from 0 to *H*. We are trying to find the maximum possible total profit. The twist? There are *M* restrictions, each one saying that within a certain range of houses (from *l* to *r*), no house can exceed a certain height *x*. \n\nThe key insight here is that since profit is simply the square of the height, we want each house to be as tall as possible.  For each house, there are two limits on the height. The first is the global maximum height *H*, and the second comes from these zoning restrictions. Essentially, the height of a house *i* can be no higher than *H* and also no higher than *x* for all restrictions that cover that house. Thus, to find the maximum possible height for each spot, we should simply compute the *minimum* of *H* and the lowest *x* among all restrictions that affect the specific house.\n\nSince the constraints are fairly small (*n, H, m <= 50*), this should be pretty efficient. The solution will involve initializing an array `max_allowed_height` to *H* for each spot and then iterating through each restriction, updating the allowed heights to the minimum of what's allowed so far and *x*. In the end, we calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the `max_allowed_height` values.\n\nLet's look at the time complexity. The initialization is O(*N*), the restriction processing is O(*M* * *N*) (because we have to loop through the houses affected by each restriction), and the final profit calculation is O(*N*). So, the overall time complexity will be O(*M* * *N*), which is acceptable given our small constraint sizes. The space complexity is simply O(*N*) for the `max_allowed_height` array, which is negligible.  We should be able to whip this up in Python and get it done!",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the maximum profit from building houses on `n` spots. Each house can have an integer height between `0` and `h`. A house of height `a` yields `a^2` dollars. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that houses within a certain range `[l_i, r_i]` must have a height of at most `x_i`.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we need to maximize the height of each individual house, since the profit `a^2` is an increasing function for non-negative heights `a`. The height of a house at spot `j` (let's denote it `h_j`) is subject to several constraints:\n1.  **Global maximum height**: `h_j <= h`.\n2.  **Zoning restrictions**: For every restriction `i` (`l_i, r_i, x_i`) such that spot `j` falls within its range (`l_i <= j <= r_i`), `h_j` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, its height `h_j` must be less than or equal to `h`, and also less than or equal to `x_i` for all applicable restrictions `i`. Therefore, the maximum possible height for a house at spot `j` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`.\nFormally, `max_h_j = min(h, min(x_i for all i such that l_i <= j <= r_i))`. If no restrictions cover spot `j`, `max_h_j = h`.\n\nIf we set each house `j` to its `max_h_j`, all restrictions will be satisfied:\nFor any restriction `(L, R, X)`, we need `max(h_j for j in [L, R]) <= X`.\nBy our construction, for any `j` in `[L, R]`, `max_h_j` is calculated by taking the minimum of `h` and all relevant `x_k` values. Since `X` is one of those relevant `x_k` values for any `j` in `[L, R]`, it means `max_h_j <= X`. This holds for all `j` in `[L, R]`, so `max(h_j for j in [L, R]) <= X` is true.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to determine the maximum allowed height for each spot independently and then sum their squared values.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize an array, say `final_heights`, of size `n`. Each element `final_heights[k]` will store the maximum allowed height for spot `k+1`. Initialize all elements to `h`.\n2.  For each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n    Iterate through the spots `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). For each such spot `j`, update `final_heights[j-1]` (using 0-indexed array) with `min(final_heights[j-1], x_i)`. This ensures that `final_heights[j-1]` respects the current restriction.\n3.  After processing all restrictions, `final_heights[k]` will contain the maximum possible height for house `k+1` that satisfies all conditions.\n4.  Calculate the total profit by summing `height * height` for each `height` in `final_heights`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nInitial `final_heights = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3)\n\nRestrictions:\n1.  `l=1, r=1, x=1`:\n    For spot 1 (`j=1`): `final_heights[0] = min(final_heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n    `final_heights` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n2.  `l=2, r=2, x=3`:\n    For spot 2 (`j=2`): `final_heights[1] = min(final_heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n    `final_heights` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n3.  `l=3, r=3, x=2`:\n    For spot 3 (`j=3`): `final_heights[2] = min(final_heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n    `final_heights` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nFinal heights: `[1, 3, 2]`.\nTotal profit: `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Initializing `final_heights`: O(`n`)\n    *   Processing `m` restrictions: Each restriction involves iterating from `l_i` to `r_i`. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` can be `n`. So, processing `m` restrictions takes O(`m * n`).\n    *   Calculating total profit: O(`n`)\n    *   Overall: O(`n + m * n + n`) = O(`m * n`).\n    Given `n, h, m <= 50`, `m * n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity**: O(`n`) for storing `final_heights`. Given `n <= 50`, this is negligible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # All spots initially can have height up to H.\n    # We use a 0-indexed list for n spots.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each of the m zoning restrictions\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read l, r, x for the current restriction\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply the restriction to all spots within the range [l, r].\n        # Adjust l and r to be 0-indexed for list access:\n        # l_problem becomes l-1_list, r_problem becomes r-1_list.\n        # The range in Python's for loop is exclusive for the end, so range(l-1, r) covers indices l-1 to r-1.\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            # The height of house at spot i must be at most x.\n            # Update the max_allowed_height for this spot if x is more restrictive.\n            max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed_height:\n        total_profit += height * height\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
