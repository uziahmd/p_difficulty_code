A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Soft Drinking\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it. Let's break this down systematically. The core of it seems to be resource management and finding the bottleneck.\n\nI need to figure out how many toasts everyone can make, *together*, given these resources: drinks, limes, and salt. Then, I have to divide that total evenly among the friends. So, the number of friends, `n`, is key.\n\nFirst, I'm going to calculate the *total* available resource units of each item:\n*   **Drink:** `k` bottles * `l` ml/bottle. That's `k * l` ml total.\n*   **Lime:** `c` limes * `d` slices/lime, or `c * d` slices.\n*   **Salt:** Just `p` grams.\n\nNow comes the crucial part. I have to see how many *toasts* I can get from *each* resource, given the requirements *per friend per toast*.  This is where `nl` and `np` come in.\n\n*   **Drink:**  Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. The example's helpful here - it clarifies that if I have a total of milliliters of drink, I should divide that by `nl`. The total number of toasts I can make from the drink is `(k * l) // nl` (integer division, because I can't have partial toasts).\n*   **Lime:**  Each friend needs one slice of lime per toast. So, I have `c * d` slices of lime in total, which means I can get `c * d` toasts based on the lime resource.\n*   **Salt:**  Each friend needs `np` grams of salt per toast.  Therefore, I've got `p // np` toasts from the salt.\n\nAlright, so I have three numbers - how many total toasts I can make based on each resource.  The catch is, *everyone has to have enough of everything*.  So, the *limiting factor* is the minimum of those three values: `min((k * l) // nl, (c * d), p // np)`.\n\nThat's the *total* number of toasts possible. Now, the final step: I have to divide this total by `n`, the number of friends. That gives me the number of toasts *each* friend can make.  That's my answer!\n",
