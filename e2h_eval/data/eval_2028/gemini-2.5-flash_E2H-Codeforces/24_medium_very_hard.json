She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving the \"Browser\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the *minimum* time (in seconds) to close all the browser tabs *except* a given range `[l, r]`. I'm starting with a total of `n` tabs and my cursor is initially at tab `pos`. My mind is racing through different scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic moves. I can move the cursor left or right, one tab at a time (but only to unclosed tabs using the `a` and `b` limits described) which costs a second per tab moved. I can also *close* all tabs to the left or right of the cursor, in a single second. That's it!\n\nNow, the core idea is to close tabs outside the `[l, r]` range. Logically, I'll only need at most *two* close operations: one for the left side (`[1, l-1]`) and one for the right side (`[r+1, n]`). I'm looking at different \"strategies\" based on where my cursor is and where `l` and `r` are.\n\n**I'm breaking it down into distinct cases:**\n\n*   **Case 1: No work needed!** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, then everything's already in the target range. The cost is 0. Easy win!\n*   **Case 2: Just left side to close.** If `l > 1` and `r` is `n`, I need to close `[1, l-1]`. I'm thinking, \"I have to move the cursor to `l` to do this.\" So it's the distance between `pos` and `l` (movement time) plus the 1 second to close.\n*   **Case 3: Just right side to close.** This is the mirror of Case 2 (l = 1 and r < n). I need to close the range `[r+1, n]`. It's the distance between `pos` and `r` plus 1 second for the close.\n*   **Case 4: The tricky one!** I'm thinking this requires the most thought. `l > 1` and `r < n`. I need to close both the left and right sides. I'm imagining two \"options\". Either:\n    *   **Option A:** Go left (to `l`), close, *then* move to `r`, and then close.\n    *   **Option B:** Go right (to `r`), close, *then* move to `l`, and then close.\n    Then I need to compare the total time taken by these two options and choose the *minimum*.\n\nI realize I need to *carefully consider the costs of moving*. Each move takes 1 second. Each closing takes 1 second. In the strategy, the cost is the movement from `pos` to l (or r), plus 1 second to close, then movement again from l to r (or vice versa), and another 1 second to close the other side. So it becomes a comparison of costs:\nmin (Option A, Option B)\n(abs(pos -l) + 1 + r -l + 1)\nand\nmin (Option B, Option A)\n(abs(pos - r) + 1 + r -l + 1)\n\nMy current line of reasoning is that the solution will involve conditional logic to determine the appropriate case and calculate the cost based on the different scenarios. I'm feeling confident about this approach! I'm now writing this solution up.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum time to close all tabs outside a specified range `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the target range `[l, r]`.\n\nThere are four main scenarios based on whether tabs need to be closed to the left of `l` (i.e., `l > 1`) and/or to the right of `r` (i.e., `r < n`).\n\nLet `needs_left_close = (l > 1)` and `needs_right_close = (r < n)`.\n\n1.  **No tabs to close (l=1 and r=n):**\n    If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, it means all initial tabs are within the desired range `[1, n]`. No operations are needed.\n    Cost: `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need closing (l>1 and r=n):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l`, and then a \"close left\" operation is performed.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. This takes `1` second.\n    Cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need closing (l=1 and r<n):**\n    We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r`, and then a \"close right\" operation is performed.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. This takes `1` second.\n    Cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides need closing (l>1 and r<n):**\n    We need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two close operations. The cursor must be at `l` to close the left segment and at `r` to close the right segment. There are two possible sequences of operations:\n\n    *   **Option A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n            (At this stage, `a=1, b=n`. Movement is within `[1,n]`).\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`.\n            (Now, the minimum unclosed tab index `a` becomes `l`. Cursor is at `l`.)\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `r - l`.\n            (At this stage, `a=l, b=n`. Movement is within `[l,n]`, which is fine for moving from `l` to `r`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`.\n            (Now, the maximum unclosed tab index `b` becomes `r`. Cursor is at `r`.)\n        Total cost for Option A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n    *   **Option B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n            (At this stage, `a=1, b=n`. Movement is within `[1,n]`).\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`.\n            (Now, the maximum unclosed tab index `b` becomes `r`. Cursor is at `r`.)\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `r - l`.\n            (At this stage, `a=1, b=r`. Movement is within `[1,r]`, which is fine for moving from `r` to `l`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`.\n            (Now, the minimum unclosed tab index `a` becomes `l`. Cursor is at `l`.)\n        Total cost for Option B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n    The minimum cost for this case is `min(cost_A, cost_B)`.\n\nThe provided solution implements this case analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    cost = 0\n\n    # Determine if left side (1 to l-1) needs closing\n    needs_left_close = (l > 1)\n    # Determine if right side (r+1 to n) needs closing\n    needs_right_close = (r < n)\n\n    if not needs_left_close and not needs_right_close:\n        # Case 1: No tabs outside [l, r] to close.\n        # This means l=1 and r=n.\n        cost = 0\n    elif needs_left_close and not needs_right_close:\n        # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of l need closing.\n        # This means l > 1 and r = n.\n        # Move cursor from pos to l: abs(pos - l) operations.\n        # Close tabs [1, l-1]: 1 operation.\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif not needs_left_close and needs_right_close:\n        # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of r need closing.\n        # This means l = 1 and r < n.\n        # Move cursor from pos to r: abs(pos - r) operations.\n        # Close tabs [r+1, n]: 1 operation.\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else: # needs_left_close and needs_right_close\n        # Case 4: Tabs on both sides need closing.\n        # This means l > 1 and r < n.\n        \n        # Option A: Close left side first, then right side.\n        # 1.
