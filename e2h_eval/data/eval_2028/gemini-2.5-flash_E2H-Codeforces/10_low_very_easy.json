Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The \"Feed the Golorp\" Puzzle - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Feed the Golorp.\" The goal is to come up with a Python script to solve it.  Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input is a string representing a Golorp's name, which I'm inferring is really an expression and constraint set. The Golorp's name is structured as `?(` *expression* `):-` *constraints*. This seems fairly standard.  The *expression* involves arithmetic operations and parentheses, and the *constraints* use comparison operators (`<`, `>`).  The core is figuring out the values assigned to each variable and making sure the *expression* and *constraints* hold true.\n\nThe underscores (`_`) are the key. Each one represents a variable, and the *number* of underscores denotes which variable it is, starting from zero.  So a single underscore is variable `v0`, two underscores are `v1`, and so on. These variables can only take values from 0 to 9, which will be helpful for the search space.\n\nThe \"jaw shape\" part tells me the *number* of unique variables (underscores) determines the *length* of the output sequence. Now, the expression needs careful consideration.  It has arithmetic operations, and it has to evaluate to *something* that satisfies the Golorp. The problem statement doesn't explicitly state what that value *is*, but the examples strongly suggest it must evaluate to 0.  I'll test this hypothesis with my script.\n\nThe *constraints* are relatively straightforward. It's a matter of comparing variables (via their values) based on the comparisons `>` and `<`.  No complex logic there.\n\nThe crucial bit is the \"lexicographically smallest\" requirement.  This means I need to search for a valid solution, but not just *any* solution. I need the smallest one in lexicographical order.  This naturally leads to a brute-force approach. I'll need to try values for the variables in order (v0=0, v1=0, etc.), and as soon as I find a sequence that satisfies both the expression (evaluates to 0) and the constraints, that's my answer.\n\nSo, in essence, I need a Python script to parse the Golorp's name, identify the variables, evaluate the expression (to zero), check the constraints, and find the smallest valid variable assignment.  Let's get to coding!\n",
    "response": "The provided solution parses the golorp's name to identify variables, the arithmetic expression, and comparison constraints. It then uses a recursive backtracking approach to try all possible digit assignments (0-9) for each variable. The first valid assignment found (lexicographically smallest) is returned. If no valid assignment is found after trying all possibilities, it outputs \"false\".\n\nThe core logic involves:\n1.  **Parsing:** Extracting the expression and constraints from the golorp's name. It identifies unique variables based on the length of underscore sequences.\n2.  **Variable Mapping:** Assigning an index (0 to N-1) to each unique variable.\n3.  **Expression Evaluation:** A helper function `evaluate_expression` takes the expression string and the current variable assignments, substitutes values, and evaluates the resulting arithmetic expression using Python's `eval()`. It handles potential `ZeroDivisionError` by returning `None`.\n4.  **Constraint Checking:** A helper function `check_constraints` takes the constraint string and variable assignments, substitutes values, and evaluates each comparison. It returns `False` if any constraint is violated.\n5.  **Backtracking (DFS):** The `solve` function recursively tries assigning digits (0-9) to variables.\n    *   It starts with `var_idx = 0`.\n    *   For each `var_idx`, it iterates `digit` from 0 to 9.\n    *   It assigns `digit` to `assignments[var_idx]`.\n    *   If all variables have been assigned (`var_idx == num_vars - 1`):\n        *   It evaluates the main expression. If it's not `0` or encounters a `ZeroDivisionError`, this assignment is invalid.\n        *   It checks all constraints. If any are `False`, this assignment is invalid.\n        *   If both pass, the current `assignments` is a valid, lexicographically smallest solution, which is then joined into a string and returned.\n    *   Otherwise (not all variables assigned), it recursively calls `solve` for the next variable (`var_idx + 1`). If the recursive call returns a solution, it's propagated up.\n    *   If no digit for the current `var_idx` leads to a solution, it returns `None`.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve():\n    name = input()\n\n    # 1.
