Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm Design**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got a competitive programming problem: \"Guard Duty (easy)\". The goal is to assign spaceships to bases (and vice versa) in a way that the paths between them don't intersect. I need to output \"Yes\" if such an assignment is possible, \"No\" otherwise.\n\n**Understanding the Constraints**\n\n*   First, we're given *R* rebel spaceships and *B* bases. The most immediate thing that strikes me is that for a perfect matching to exist, *R* must equal *B*. If this isn't true, it's game over right away - print \"No\" and quit.\n\n*   The crux of the problem lies in that constraint about \"non-intersecting paths.\"  Since we're dealing with points in a 2D plane, I'll need some robust segment intersection check.\n\n*   The coordinates are integers within a reasonable range (|-10000|, |y| <= 10000), which shouldn't be a problem.\n\n*   The significant hint for the algorithm is `R, B <= 10`. That's small! This tells me that a brute-force approach, maybe checking all possible assignments, should be feasible.\n\n*   Crucially, there's a guarantee: no two points coincide (ships and bases are distinct), and no three points are on the same line. That's fantastic! This simplifies the geometric checks enormously.\n\n**The Algorithm**\n\nMy plan is:\n\n1.  **Check the Prerequisite:** If *R* != *B*, print \"No\".\n2.  **Input:** Read in the coordinates of the rebels and the bases.\n3.  **Brute-Force Permutations:** Generate all possible permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n4.  **Intersection Check:** For each permutation (assignment),  I'll do this:\n\n    *   Create line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base.\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of these segments and use an efficient segment intersection check (details below).\n    *   If *any* pair of segments intersects, this assignment is invalid.\n    *   If *no* intersections are found, this is a valid assignment. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n5.  **No Solution:** If I've checked all permutations and found no valid assignments, print \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Helper Functions**\n\nI'm going to need a few helper functions:\n\n*   **Point Representation:** Points will be tuples of coordinates `(x, y)`.\n*   **Vector Subtraction:** Simple subtraction of coordinates.\n*   **Cross Product (2D):**  This will be the workhorse for the geometric checks. The cross product of vectors (b-a) x (p-a) tells us whether a point *p* is to the \"left\" or \"right\" of a directed line segment from *a* to *b*.  If it's positive, *p* is left; negative means right; zero means collinear. Given the guarantee that no three points are collinear (and no points are the same) this means any cross product that returns zero is because the calculation had points that were shared between the line segments, and this would not be considered an intersection for this problem.\n*   **`segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)`:** This function takes two line segments, `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)`, and determines if they intersect. The usual test for this involves checking if the endpoints of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment (and vice versa).  Because the problem says no three points are collinear, this test should be very simple and straightforward.\n\n**Code Structure**\n\nHere's how I envision the code:\n\n```python\n# [Python code - same as in the original response]\n```\n\n**Reasoning about segment Intersection:**\n\nI can use the 2D cross product. Let the segments be AB and CD.\n\n1.  `cross_product(A, B, C)` and `cross_product(A, B, D)` must have opposite signs. This means C and D are on opposite sides of line AB.\n2.  `cross_product(C, D, A)` and `cross_product(C, D, B)` must have opposite signs. This means A and B are on opposite sides of line CD.\n\nIf and only if both conditions are true, the segments intersect. If they do not both have opposite signs, then the code moves on to the next set of line segments. If no segments intersect, then the code outputs \"Yes\".\n\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship guards exactly one base and each base is guarded by exactly one spaceship (a perfect matching), with the additional constraint that no two paths (straight line segments) from a spaceship to its assigned base intersect.\n\n**1. Basic Condition: Perfect Matching**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible, and we should output \"No\".\n\n**2. Geometric Constraint: Non-intersecting Paths**\nThe core of the problem is checking if any two line segments formed by a matching intersect.\nThe problem guarantees:\n*   No two points coincide.\n*   No three points are on the same line.\n\nThis \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee simplifies the segment intersection check significantly. It means that for any three distinct points `p1, p2, p3`, the cross product `(p2-p1) x (p3-p1)` will never be zero. This implies that no point will lie *on* another segment unless it's an endpoint, and since all points involved in different segments of a matching are distinct (a spaceship is not a base, and all bases/spaceships are distinct), we only need to check for strict intersection.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read `R`, `B`, then the coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases. Store them in lists, `rebels` and `bases` respectively.\n2.  **Check `R == B`:** If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n3.  **Generate Permutations:** Since `R` and `B` are small (up to 10), we can try all possible matchings. A matching can be represented by a permutation of base indices. For each permutation `p` of `(0, 1, ..., B-1)`, `rebels[i]` is matched with `bases[p[i]]`.\n    *   The number of permutations for `B=10` is `10! = 3,628,800`. This is feasible for `B <= 10`.\n4.  **Check Each Matching:** For each permutation:\n    a.  Construct the `R` line segments based on the current matching.\n    b.  Iterate through all unique pairs of these `R` segments.\n    c.  For each pair, check if they intersect using a geometric function.\n    d.  If any pair of segments intersects, this matching is invalid. Move to the next permutation.\n    e.  If no pair of segments intersects after checking all pairs, then this is a valid non-intersecting matching. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n5.  **No Valid Matching Found:** If all permutations are checked and none result in a valid non-intersecting matching, print \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Helper Functions:**\n\n*   **`cross_product(p1, p2, p3)`:** This function calculates the 2D cross product of vectors `(p2 - p1)` and `(p3 - p1)`.\n    *   `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are points represented as `(x, y)` tuples.\n    *   The result `(p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])` gives twice the signed area of the triangle `p1p2p3`.\n    *   Its sign indicates the orientation of `p3` with respect to the directed line `p1p2`:\n        *   `> 0`: `p3` is to the \"left\" of `p1p2`.\n        *   `< 0`: `p3` is to the \"right\" of `p1p2`.\n        *   `== 0`: `p3` is collinear with `p1p2`. (This case is ruled out by the problem's \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee for distinct points).\n\n*   **`segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)`:** Checks if segment `(p1, q1)` intersects segment `(p2, q2)`.\n    *   Due to the \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee, we only need to check for strict intersection.\n    *   Two segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` strictly intersect if and only if:\n        1.  `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p2q2`.\n        2.  `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p1q1`.\n    *   This translates to checking the signs of cross products:\n        *   `o1 = cross_product(p1, q1, p2)`\n        *   `o2 = cross_product(p1, q1, q2)`\n        *   `o3 = cross_product(p2, q2, p1)`\n        *   `o4 = cross_product(p2, q2, q1)`\n    *   Intersection occurs if `(o1 * o2 < 0)` AND `(o3 * o4 < 0)`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Generating permutations: `B!`\n*   For each permutation:\n    *   Forming segments: `R` operations.\n    *   Checking pairs of segments: `R * (R-1) / 2` pairs.\n    *   Each intersection check: 4 cross products. Each cross product is a few arithmetic operations.\n*   Total complexity: `O(B! * R^2)`. Given `R, B <= 10`, `10! * 10^2 = 3,628,800 * 100 = 3.6 * 10^8`, which is acceptable for typical competitive programming time limits (usually around `10^8` operations per second).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Helper function for 2D cross product (orientation)\n# Returns (p2-p1) x (p3-p1)\n# > 0 if p3 is left of vector p1p2\n# < 0 if p3 is right of vector p1p2\n# == 0 if p3 is collinear with p1p2\ndef cross_product(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Function to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect\n# Given the problem constraints (\"no three points are on the same line\"),\n# we only need to check for strict intersection.\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Calculate orientations\n    o1 = cross_product(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = cross_product(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = cross_product(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = cross_product(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if all orientations are non-zero and signs are opposite\n    # o1 and o2 must have opposite signs (p2 and q2 on opposite sides of p1q1)\n    # o3 and o4 must have opposite signs (p1 and q1 on opposite sides of p2q2)\n    return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n\n    # A perfect matching requires R == B\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    # Try all permutations of bases to match with rebels\n    # Each permutation `p_indices` means rebels[i] is matched with bases[p_indices[i]]\n    for p_indices in permutations(range(B)):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p_indices[i]]))\n\n        # Check for intersections among all pairs of segments\n        has_intersection = False\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R): # Compare each segment with all subsequent segments\n                s1_p1, s1_q1 = segments[i]\n                s2_p2, s2_q2 = segments[j]\n                if segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_q1, s2_p2, s2_q2):\n                    has_intersection = True\n                    break # Found an intersection, this matching is invalid\n            if has_intersection:\n                break # No need to check further pairs for this matching\n        \n        # If no intersection was found for this matching, it's a valid solution\n        if not has_intersection:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    # If no valid matching was found after checking all permutations\n    print(\"No\")\n\n# Call the solver function\nsolve()\n\n```",
