The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Xenia's Ringroad Problem: A Time-Efficient Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem, and I need a Python script to do the heavy lifting.  Let's break this down. We've got a ring road with `n` houses and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` is a house where something needs to be done. We start at house 1 and can only move clockwise. The order of tasks is fixed: we do `a_1`, then `a_2`, and so on.\n\nMy primary concern is *efficiency*.  The core of the problem is calculating the time it takes to move between houses.  I realized this boils down to finding the *shortest* clockwise distance.  \n\nLet's think it through step-by-step.  If we're at house `current_house` and need to get to `target_house`, here's how the logic works:\n\n1.  **Direct Movement:** If `target_house` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, then the distance is simply `target_house - current_house`.  That's straightforward.\n\n2.  **Wrap-Around:**  The trickier part is when `target_house` is *less* than `current_house`. We can't just subtract. It's a ring!  We have to go all the way around.  So, we calculate the time as `(n - current_house) + target_house`.\n\nI believe this formula can be simplified further but it works for now. \n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  I'll initialize `total_time` to zero.\n2.  My current position, `current_house`, starts at 1.\n3.  I'll read in the number of houses (`n`) and tasks (`m`).\n4.  Then, I'll read the array of tasks `a`.\n5.  I'll iterate through the tasks, calculating the time for each move using the logic I described.\n6.  Finally, I'll print the `total_time`.\n\nThe key here is avoiding unnecessary computations and keeping the code as readable as possible.  This should be a pretty straightforward Python script. Now, let's get coding!\n",
