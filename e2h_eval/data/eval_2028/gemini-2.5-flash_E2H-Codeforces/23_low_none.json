            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Tokitsukaze Tile Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving Tokitsukaze and mahjong-like tiles. The core of it is figuring out the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one \"mentsu,\" which is either a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (a sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit).  I'm starting with three tiles, and any tile is available.\n\nMy initial thought is this can only be 0, 1, or 2 draws.  It's impossible to need more than two because with five tiles, a koutsu is guaranteed (just pick three identical ones). So I'll need to develop a strategy to evaluate these possibilities.\n\nFirst, I'll check for zero draws.  Can the initial three tiles form a mentsu?  This boils down to checking two scenarios:\n\n*   **Koutsu Check:** Are all three tiles identical?\n*   **Shuntsu Check:**\n    1.  Do all three tiles share the same suit?\n    2.  If so, sort their numbers and see if they form a sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n\nIf either a koutsu or shuntsu is found, the answer is zero.\n\nNext, I need to evaluate the possibility of one draw.  If zero draws aren't enough, can I make a mentsu with just one more tile?  This means I have four tiles now: the original three and the new one. I need to strategically pick this new tile so that I can make at least one mentsu.\n\nI'm thinking I should analyze how the addition of the new tile can form new mentsus with the original tiles. Let's call the original tiles `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, and the new one `t_new`. Can `t_new` complete a koutsu or shuntsu with any two of the original tiles? This looks like the right approach. I need to figure out the right conditions for this. \n\nI'll now attempt to devise an algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles she wants, and the supply of each tile type is infinite.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `T1`, `T2`, `T3`. Each tile is represented as a string like \"1m\", \"2p\", \"9s\".\n\nWe need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are needed. It's guaranteed that 2 draws are always sufficient (e.g., by drawing two tiles to match one of the original tiles to form a koutsu, or by drawing two tiles to form a new koutsu like \"1m 1m 1m\").\n\nFirst, let's parse the input tiles into a more usable format: a list of tuples `(number, suit)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. We will also sort the tiles for easier processing, especially for shuntsu checks.\n\n```python\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ntiles_str = input().split()\ntiles = sorted([parse_tile(s) for s in tiles_str])\n```\n\nNext, we define helper functions to check for koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n```python\ndef is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\ndef is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    return (t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1] and  # Same suit\n            t1[0] + 1 == t2[0] and      # Sequential numbers\n            t2[0] + 1 == t3[0])\n```\n\nNow, we check for 0, 1, and 2 draws in order.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nCan Tokitsukaze form a mentsu with her current three tiles?\nThis means checking if `(T1, T2, T3)` forms a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n```python\n# Check for 0 draws\nif is_koutsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]) or is_shuntsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n```\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can she form a mentsu by drawing one additional tile?\nWith one draw, she will have four tiles: `T1, T2, T3, T_new`. She needs *any* three of these four tiles to form a mentsu. This means we need to check if any pair of her original tiles `(Ti, Tj)` can form a mentsu with a single drawn tile `T_new`.\n\nLet's consider all possible pairs of original tiles: `(T1, T2)`, `(T1, T3)`, `(T2, T3)`.\nFor each pair `(Ta, Tb)`:\n1.  **To form a koutsu:** If `Ta == Tb`, she needs to draw one more `Ta`. This forms `[Ta, Ta, Ta]`.\n2.  **To form a shuntsu:**\n    *   If `Ta` and `Tb` are of the same suit:\n        *   If `Tb[0] == Ta[0] + 1` (e.g., `1m, 2m`), she can draw `Ta[0] - 1` (e.g., `0m`, not possible) or `Tb[0] + 1` (e.g., `3m`). So, `(Ta[0]-1, Ta[1])` (if `Ta[0]>1`) or `(Tb[0]+1, Tb[1])` (if `Tb[0]<9`).\n        *   If `Tb[0] == Ta[0] + 2` (e.g., `1m, 3m`), she can draw `Ta[0] + 1` (e.g., `2m`). So, `(Ta[0]+1, Ta[1])`.\n    *   Note that `Ta[0] == Tb[0]` is covered by the koutsu case if `Ta == Tb`. If `Ta[0] == Tb[0]` but `Ta != Tb` (different suits), they cannot form a shuntsu.\n\nWe can iterate through all pairs of original tiles and check these conditions.\n\n```python\n# Check for 1 draw\n# Store unique tiles to avoid redundant checks if tiles are identical\nunique_tiles = sorted(list(set(tiles))) \n# If there are duplicate tiles, e.g., [1m, 1m, 2m], we need to consider them\n# The original 'tiles' list already handles this by sorting.\n\ncan_win_in_1_draw = False\n\n# Check all combinations of two original tiles\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n        t1 = tiles[i]\n        t2 = tiles[j]\n\n        # Case 1: Form a koutsu\n        if t1 == t2: # e.g. [3p, 3p, X] -> draw 3p\n            can_win_in_1_draw = True\n            break\n        \n        # Case 2: Form a shuntsu\n        if t1[1] == t2[1]: # Same suit\n            # e.g. [2p, 3p, X] -> draw 1p or 4p\n            if t2[0] == t1[0] + 1:\n                can_win_in_1_draw = True\n                break\n            # e.g. [2p, 4p, X] -> draw 3p\n            if t2[0] == t1[0] + 2:\n                can_win_in_1_draw = True\n                break\n    if can_win_in_1_draw:\n        break\n\nif can_win_in_1_draw:\n    print(1)\n    exit()\n```\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then the answer must be 2. As discussed, it's always possible to form a mentsu with 2 draws (e.g., pick any tile `T1`, then draw `T1` and `T1` to form a koutsu `[T1, T1, T1]`).\n\n```python\n# If 0 or 1 draw is not enough\nprint(2)\n```\n\n**Final Code Structure:**\n\n```python\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ndef is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\ndef is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    return (t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1] and\n            t1[0] + 1 == t2[0] and\n            t2[0] + 1 == t3[0])\n\ntiles_str = input().split()\ntiles = sorted([parse_tile(s) for s in tiles_str])\n\n# Check for 0 draws\nif is_koutsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]) or is_shuntsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Check for 1 draw\ncan_win_in_1_draw = False\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n        t1 = tiles[i]\n        t2 = tiles[j]\n\n        # Case 1: Form a koutsu with a drawn tile\n        if t1 == t2:\n            can_win_in_1_draw = True\n            break\n        \n        # Case 2: Form a shuntsu with a drawn tile\n        if t1[1] == t2[1]: # Same suit\n            # e.g. [2p, 3p, X] -> draw 1p or 4p\n            if t2[0] == t1[0] + 1:\n                can_win_in_1_draw = True\n                break\n            # e.g. [2p, 4p, X] -> draw 3p\n            if t2[0] == t1[0] + 2:\n                can_win_in_1_draw = True\n                break\n    if can_win_in_1_draw:\n        break\n\nif can_win_in_1_draw:\n    print(1)\n    exit()\n\n# If 0 or 1 draw is not enough\nprint(2)\n\n```",
