    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this competitive programming problem. The core of it seems to be figuring out how many positive integers `n` have a factorial that ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The output should be the count and the `n` values themselves, in increasing order.\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle the trailing zeroes problem head-on. The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` hinges on the number of times 10 appears as a factor, which in turn depends on the number of 2s and 5s. Since there are always more 2s than 5s, the limiting factor is the number of 5s.  I can use Legendre's formula to calculate this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` – this sum goes on as long as the powers of 5 are less than or equal to n.\n\nNow, let's analyze `Z(n)`. It's non-decreasing, and it only changes its value when `n` is a multiple of 5. I realize there might be gaps. For example, `Z(24) = 4` but `Z(25) = 6`. This means there's no `n` for which `Z(n) = 5`. That's a crucial observation!\n\nThe problem asks for `n` where `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, if I find an `n_0` where `Z(n_0) = m`, the subsequent values of `Z(n)` will either remain `m` or jump to `m+1` (when `n` is a multiple of 5). For instance, if `Z(5) = 1`, all values `Z(n)` between 5 and 9 will still be equal to 1. This means all the values in that range have the same amount of trailing zeros. This seems to be the key to efficiently determine the ranges.\n\nI should be able to write an algorithm which first searchs for the first `n` such that `Z(n) >= m` using a binary search.\nThen, I should iterate forward and calculate the total number of valid `n` by analyzing if the total number of trailing zeros changes.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is given by Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum counts the total number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`.\n\nThe function `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function of `n`. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nFor example:\n`Z(1) = ... = Z(4) = 0`\n`Z(5) = ... = Z(9) = 1`\n`Z(10) = ... = Z(14) = 2`\n`Z(15) = ... = Z(19) = 3`\n`Z(20) = ... = Z(24) = 4`\n`Z(25) = ... = Z(29) = 6` (because `floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6`)\n\nNotice that `Z(24) = 4` and `Z(25) = 6`. This means there is no `n` for which `Z(n) = 5`.\nThis observation is crucial: if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` \"skips over\", then there are no solutions.\nSpecifically, if `Z(k-1) < m` and `Z(k) > m` for some `k`, then `m` is not achievable. This happens when `k` is a multiple of 25 (or 125, etc.) and `k` contributes multiple factors of 5.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n   - The search range for `n` can be estimated. The number of zeroes `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4` (since `n/5 + n/25 + ... = n * (1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = n * ( (1/5) / (1 - 1/5) ) = n * (1/4)`). So `n` will be roughly `4m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` can be up to `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search could be `5 * m` or `5 * 10^5`. Let's use `5 * 10^5 + 5` to be safe.\n2. Let the smallest `n` found by binary search be `n_start`.\n3. Calculate `Z(n_start)`.\n   - If `Z(n_start) == m`, then `n_start` is a potential candidate.\n   - If `Z(n_start) > m`, it means `m` was skipped. In this case, there are no solutions.\n4. If `Z(n_start) == m`, then we know that `n_start, n_start+1, ..., n_start+4` will all have `Z(n) = m`, provided `n_start+5` (or some other multiple of 5) doesn't cause `Z(n)` to increase to `m+1` prematurely.\n   - In general, if `Z(n_start) = m`, then `Z(n_start+1) = m`, `Z(n_start+2) = m`, `Z(n_start+3) = m`, `Z(n_start+4) = m`. This is because `n_start, n_start+1, ..., n_start+4` can contain at most one multiple of 5. If `n_start` is a multiple of 5, then `n_start+5` is the next multiple of 5. If `n_start` is not a multiple of 5, then there's a multiple of 5 between `n_start+1` and `n_start+4`. However, the calculation `Z(k)` only changes when `k` itself is a multiple of 5. So, if `Z(n_start)=m`, then `Z(n_start+1)=m`, `Z(n_start+2)=m`, `Z(n_start+3)=m`, `Z(n_start+4)=m`.\n   - The next value of `n` that could potentially change `Z(n)` is `n_start + (5 - (n_start % 5)) % 5`. This is just `n_start` if `n_start` is a multiple of 5, or the next multiple of 5 after `n_start`.\n   - More simply, if `Z(n_start) = m`, we know that `Z(n_start+1)=m, Z(n_start+2)=m, Z(n_start+3)=m, Z(n_start+4)=m`.\n   - And `Z(n_start-1)` must be `m-1` (or lower, if `m` was skipped before `n_start`).\n   - If `Z(n_start) = m`, then the values of `n` that satisfy `Z(n)=m` are `n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`. There will always be exactly 5 such values. This is because `Z(n)` increments by `1` when `n` crosses a multiple of 5, *unless* `n` is a multiple of 25 (or 125, etc.), in which case it increments by more. If `Z(n_start) = m` and `Z(n_start+5) = m+1`, then `n_start, ..., n_start+4` are the solutions. If `Z(n_start+5)` is `m+2` or more, then `m+1` was skipped, and `Z(n_start)=m` is the *only* block of 5 values that could have `m` zeroes. But the problem states that `Z(n)` is `m`. The crucial point is that if `Z(N)=m` for some `N`, then `Z(N-1)` must be `m-1` or `m`. If `Z(N-1)=m-1`, then `N` is the smallest number that produces `m` zeroes. The next value that *could* change the number of zeroes is `N'` which is the smallest multiple of 5 greater than or equal to `N`. If `Z(N') = m+1`, then all `n` from `N` up to `N'-1` will have `m` zeroes. `N'-N` can range from 1 to 5.\n   - However, the property of `Z(n)` is that `Z(n)` values are either `k` or `k+1` or `k+2` etc. If `Z(n_0) = m`, then `Z(n_0-1)` must be `m-1` (if `n_0` is a multiple of 5) or `m` (if `n_0` is not a multiple of 5). The important observation is that if `Z(n)` takes value `m`, it will take it for exactly 5 consecutive values of `n`. This is because `Z(n)` increases by `k` when `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`. The *smallest* increase is 1, which happens when `n` is a multiple of 5 but not 25. Thus, if `Z(n_0)=m`, then `Z(n_0+1)=m, ..., Z(n_0+4)=m` and `Z(n_0+5)` will be `m+1` (or more, if `n_0+5` is a multiple of 25 etc.). This means if `m` is an achievable number of zeroes, it will be achieved by exactly 5 values of `n`.\n\nLet's refine the binary search:\n- Define `count_trailing_zeroes(num)` function using Legendre's formula.\n- Binary search for the smallest `n` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n) == m`.\n  - `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m + 5` (a safe upper bound, e.g., for `m=100000`, `high=500005`).\n  - `ans_n = -1`\n  - While `low <= high`:\n    - `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`\n    - `zeros = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)`\n    - If `zeros < m`: `low = mid + 1` (need more zeroes, so increase `n`)\n    - Else if `zeros >= m`: `ans_n = mid`, `high = mid - 1` (found a potential `n` or too many zeroes, try smaller `n`)\n- After binary search, `ans_n` will hold the smallest `n` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m`.\n- Check `count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n)`:\n  - If it's exactly `m`: Then the solutions are `ans_n, ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4`. There are 5 such values.\n  - If it's greater than `m`: Then `m` is an unreachable number of zeroes. There are 0 solutions.\n\nExample `m=1`:\n- Binary search finds `ans_n = 5`.\n- `count_trailing_zeroes(5) = 1`. This is equal to `m`.\n- Solutions: `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`. Count = 5.\n\nExample `m=5`:\n- Binary search for `m=5`:\n  - `count_trailing_zeroes(24) = 4`\n  - `count_trailing_zeroes(25) = 6`\n  - Binary search would find `ans_n = 25` (smallest `n` with `Z(n) >= 5`).\n- `count_trailing_zeroes(25) = 6`. This is greater than `m=5`.\n- Solutions: 0.\n\nThis logic covers all cases efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! using Legendre's formula.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n.\n    # Z(n) is approximately n/4, so n is approximately 4m.\n    # For m=100_000, n is around 400_000. 5*m is a good upper bound.\n    high = 5 * m + 5 \n    \n    ans_n = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = low + (high - low) // 2\n        \n        zeros = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n\n        if zeros < m:\n            # We need more zeroes, so n must be larger\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif zeros >= m:\n            # We found an n that produces at least m zeroes.\n            # This 'mid' could be our answer, or we might find a smaller n.\n            ans_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    # After binary search, ans_n is the smallest integer such that count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) >= m.\n    \n    if ans_n == -1 or count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) != m:\n        # If ans_n is -1 (shouldn't happen for m >= 1), or\n        # if the smallest n that produces >= m zeroes actually produces > m zeroes,\n        # then m is an unreachable number of zeroes.\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # If count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) == m, then ans_n is the smallest n\n        # that produces exactly m zeroes.\n        # Due to the nature of Z(n), if Z(ans_n) = m, then Z(ans_n+1) = m, ..., Z(ans_n+4) = m.\n        # And Z(ans_n+5) will be m+1 (or more).\n        # So there are always 5 such values.\n        results = [ans_n, ans_n + 1, ans_n + 2, ans_n + 3, ans_n + 4]\n        print(len(results))\n        print(*results)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
