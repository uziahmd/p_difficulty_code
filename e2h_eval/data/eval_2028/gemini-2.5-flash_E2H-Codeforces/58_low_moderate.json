You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this graph problem. The objective is to figure out the fewest edges, *t*, to add to a given undirected graph to create a simple, odd-length cycle, and also to calculate the number of ways, *w*, to achieve this minimum *t*.  The graph is nice and clean - no parallel edges, no self-loops, but it might not be connected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the characteristics of odd cycles.  They inherently have an odd number of edges. \"Simple\" means no repeated vertices, except at the start/end of the cycle.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down into cases.\n\n**Case 0: The graph already has an odd cycle.**  This is the easiest scenario.  If the original graph is non-bipartite, then I've got my odd cycle.  Therefore, *t* would be 0, and *w* would be 1 since there's at least one cycle. To check for this, I can use a standard bipartite check. I can use BFS or DFS with 2-coloring. If I find an edge that connects two nodes of the same color during the 2-coloring process, it means that I can't split the graph into two partitions, and that component contains an odd cycle. If the graph isn't connected, I'll need to do this for each connected component.\n\n**Case 1: The graph *is* bipartite (no odd cycles).**  This means I *have* to add edges.  A bipartite graph has vertices that can be split into two sets, let's call them *L* and *R*, where all the existing edges go between the sets. To make an odd cycle, I have to add an edge. If the graph is bipartite, I can't have an odd cycle with the existing edges. So, adding an edge between two vertices in the *same* partition set, say *L*, creates a cycle. The edges between vertices in the same partition must form an even-length path, and adding that new edge creates a cycle of odd length. So, *t* will be at least 1.\n\n**Subcase 1.1: When *t* = 1.** I now need to count the ways I can add a single edge and make an odd cycle. I have to look at each connected component. For each one, I do the 2-coloring again to get the sets *L* and *R*.  Then, I need to count the number of edges I *could* add within either *L* or *R*.  If a component has *|L|* nodes in set *L* and *|R|* nodes in set *R*, the number of potential new edges I can add is  *|L|*( *|L|*-1)/2 + *|R|*( *|R|*-1)/2. I'm assured that no added edges will be parallel edges to existing edges because the original graph is bipartite. Finally, I have to sum up these counts for all the connected components to get my total *w* for *t* = 1.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` the number of ways to do so.\n\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check for bipartiteness using a 2-coloring algorithm (like BFS or DFS).\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for `t`:\n\n**Case 0: The graph already contains an odd cycle.**\nIf the graph is not bipartite, it means there's at least one connected component that is not bipartite. In this case, we don't need to add any edges.\n`t = 0`, `w = 1`. (There's one way: do nothing, the cycle already exists).\n\n**Case 1: The graph is bipartite, and we can form an odd cycle by adding one edge (`t = 1`).**\nIf the graph is bipartite, all its connected components are bipartite. For each bipartite component, we can partition its vertices into two sets, say `L` and `R`, such that all existing edges connect a vertex in `L` to a vertex in `R`.\nTo form an odd cycle by adding a single edge `(u, v)`, `u` and `v` must belong to the same partition set (e.g., both in `L` or both in `R`). If `u` and `v` are in the same set, any path between them in the original bipartite graph must have an even length. Adding the edge `(u, v)` creates a cycle of length `(even_path_length + 1)`, which is odd.\nThe number of ways to add one such edge within a component with partition sizes `|L|` and `|R|` is `|L| * (|L| - 1) / 2 + |R| * (|R| - 1) / 2`. We sum this over all connected components.\nIf this sum `w_1` is greater than 0, then `t = 1` and `w = w_1`.\n\n**Case 2: The graph is bipartite, and we cannot form an odd cycle by adding one edge (`t = 1`). This implies `t` must be at least 2.**\nThis situation occurs if and only if all bipartite components are trivial (single vertices) or paths/stars where at least one partition set has size 1. Specifically, it means that for every connected component, at least one of its partition sets `L` or `R` has size 1.\nIf a component has `|L|=1` and `|R|=k`, the number of ways to add an edge within `L` is `1*(1-1)/2 = 0`. The number of ways to add an edge within `R` is `k*(k-1)/2`. If `k*(k-1)/2` is 0 for all components, then `t=1` is not possible. This happens if all `k < 2`, i.e., all `k` are 0 or 1.\nThis means all connected components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\nIn this scenario, `t` must be at least 2.\n\n**Subcase 2.1: `t = 2`**\nIf `t=1` is not possible, we need to add at least two edges.\nTo form an odd cycle with two added edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`, there are two main scenarios:\n1. `u, v, x, y` are all distinct vertices. This would involve connecting two different components or connecting within a component in a way that forms an odd cycle.\n2. The added edges share a vertex, e.g., `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`. This forms a path `u-v-x`. If `u` and `x` are already connected by a path of even length, then `u-v-x` combined with the existing path forms an odd cycle. This is equivalent to adding an edge `(u, x)` where `u` and `x` are in the same partition set. If `t=1` wasn't possible, this means all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `t=2` more systematically.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means all connected components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\nIn this case, any path between two distinct vertices `u, v` must have length 1 (if `(u,v)` is an edge) or be non-existent.\nTo form an odd cycle of length 3 (the smallest odd cycle) using 2 new edges, we need to add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)` such that `u` and `x` are already connected by an edge. This forms a triangle `u-v-x-u`.\n`u-x` is an existing edge. We add `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`. This forms a cycle of length 3.\nThe number of ways `w_2` to do this:\nWe need to pick an existing edge `(u, x)` and a new vertex `v` (not `u` or `x`).\nThe number of existing edges is `m`.\nThe number of choices for `v` is `n - 2`.\nSo, `w_2 = m * (n - 2)`.\nThis applies if `n > 2`. If `n <= 2`, we can't pick `v`.\nIf `m > 0` and `n > 2`, then `t=2` and `w = m * (n - 2)`.\n\n**Case 3: `t = 3`**\nThis case occurs if `t=0`, `t=1`, and `t=2` are not possible.\n`t=0` not possible means the graph is bipartite.\n`t=1` not possible means all bipartite components are such that `min(|L|, |R|) <= 1`. This implies all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\n`t=2` not possible means `m * (n - 2) = 0`. This implies either `m = 0` (no edges) or `n <= 2`.\nIf `n <= 2`:\n  - If `n=1`: No cycles possible.\n  - If `n=2`: Graph can be `1-2` (m=1) or `1 2` (m=0). `m*(n-2)` would be `1*(0)=0` or `0*(0)=0`.\n    - If `n=2, m=1` (edge 1-2): We need to add 2 edges. If we add `(1,1)` or `(2,2)` it's a loop, not allowed. We can't form an odd cycle of length > 1.\n    - If `n=2, m=0`: Same as above.\n    So, if `n <= 2`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle of length > 1. The problem statement guarantees `n` vertices, and a cycle \"consisting of more than one vertex\". This means `n` must be at least 3 for `t=3` to be relevant.\n\nSo, if `m = 0` (no edges) and `n >= 3`:\nWe need to add three edges to form the smallest odd cycle, a triangle.\nWe pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` and add edges `(u, v)`, `(v, x)`, `(x, u)`.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `n` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\nSo, `t = 3`, `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n\n1.  **Bipartite Check:** Perform a 2-coloring (BFS/DFS) on each connected component.\n    *   Maintain `visited` array to process components.\n    *   For each component, run BFS/DFS:\n        *   `color[u] = 0` or `1`.\n        *   If `(u, v)` is an edge and `color[u] == color[v]`, then an odd cycle exists. Set `found_odd_cycle = True` and break.\n        *   If `color[v]` is uncolored, `color[v] = 1 - color[u]`.\n        *   Count `L_size` and `R_size` for each component. Store these counts.\n\n2.  **Determine `t` and `w` based on `found_odd_cycle` and component statistics:**\n\n    *   **If `found_odd_cycle` is True:**\n        `t = 0`, `w = 1`.\n\n    *   **If `found_odd_cycle` is False (graph is bipartite):**\n        Calculate `w_1 = 0`. Iterate through all bipartite components. For each component with partition sizes `|L|` and `|R|`:\n        `w_1 += |L| * (|L| - 1) // 2`\n        `w_1 += |R| * (|R| - 1) // 2`\n\n        *   **If `w_1 > 0`:**\n            `t = 1`, `w = w_1`.\n\n        *   **If `w_1 == 0`:** (This means all components are isolated vertices or single edges.)\n            *   **If `m > 0` and `n >= 3`:**\n                `t = 2`, `w = m * (n - 2)`.\n            *   **If `m == 0` and `n >= 3`:**\n                `t = 3`, `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.\n            *   **If `n < 3`:**\n                This case means it's impossible to form an odd cycle of length > 1. The problem statement implies a solution always exists. However, if `n=1` or `n=2`, no cycle of length > 1 is possible. For competitive programming, usually, such constraints are handled or the problem implies a valid `n`. Given `n >= 1`, we assume `n >= 3` if `t=3` is the answer. For `n=1,2`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle of length > 1. Let's assume the problem implicitly guarantees `n >= 3` if `t=3` is the minimum. If `n < 3` and `m=0`, then `n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6` would be 0. So `w=0` for `t=3` if `n<3`. This doesn't make sense for a `w` value. The smallest `n` for a triangle is 3.\n\nLet's refine the `n < 3` part.\nIf `n=1`: No cycles possible. The problem asks for cycle of more than one vertex. So `n >= 2`.\nIf `n=2`: Only possible cycle is length 2, not odd. So `n >= 3` for an odd cycle.\nIf `n=2, m=0`: `t=3` would be `2*1*0/6 = 0`.\nIf `n=2, m=1` (edge 1-2): `t=2` would be `1*(2-2) = 0`.\nSo if `n < 3`, no odd cycle can be formed. The problem statement does not explicitly say this case is impossible. However, the examples show `n=3` as the minimum for `t=3`. We can assume `n >= 3` for `t=3` or `t=2` to have non-zero ways.\n\nThe minimum `n` for an odd cycle is 3.\nIf `n < 3`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle. The problem statement implies a solution always exists. This means `n` must be at least 3 for any non-zero `t` and `w`.\nIf `n < 3`, the question is ill-posed. Assuming `n >= 3` for cases `t=2,3`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\nUse an adjacency list `adj`.\n`color` array to store 0/1 for bipartite coloring. `visited` array (or `color != -1`).\nBFS/DFS function:\n`bfs(start_node)`:\n  `q = deque([start_node])`\n  `color[start_node] = 0`\n  `component_nodes = 0`\n  `L_size = 0, R_size = 0`\n  `found_odd_cycle_in_component = False`\n  `while q:`\n    `u = q.popleft()`\n    `component_nodes += 1`\n    `if color[u] == 0: L_size += 1 else: R_size += 1`\n    `for v in adj[u]:`\n      `if color[v] == -1:`\n        `color[v] = 1 -
