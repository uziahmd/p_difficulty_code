Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Triangle Counting: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with counting non-degenerate triangles with integer sides, given these constraints: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.  My initial thought is a triple loop – but that's going to be too slow, computationally speaking, because of the range of `D`. We have to get clever.\n\nSince we know x, y, and z are integers and  `x <= y <= z`, the triangle inequalities simplify nicely: we only need to ensure `x + y > z`. The other two inequalities are automatically satisfied.\n\nThe key is to iterate efficiently. I fix `x` and `y`, then find the number of valid `z` values.  For fixed `x` and `y`, the condition is that z is between C and min(D, x+y-1). That's `count_z`. Then I calculate the number of valid (x, y) pairs for a given sum S (x + y), `count_xy`.\n\nThis leads to the core idea: let's sum over the *possible sums* of `x + y`, not over individual `x` and `y` values. This changes the double loop into a single loop to calculate `x + y = S`.\n\n`S` ranges from `A+B` to `B+C`.  For each sum `S`, I need to determine the count of (x, y) pairs.  That means I iterate over the range where x must be valid, knowing that y will be  `S - x`. This gives me `count_xy`.\n\nCrucially, I calculate the intersection of the constraints to determine how many valid values x can take: x must be between A and B, but also S-C <= x <= S-B. Then, the number of choices of z is also limited by C <= z <= D and z < S.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of valid (x, y) pairs `count_xy(S)` and `count_z(S)`, for that sum `S`. The solution, is a single loop over `S`, accumulating the result. This optimizes the whole process, because the range of S will always be `5 * 10^5` values maximum.\n\nThis approach gives the correct results, is efficient enough, and, I think, elegant.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` satisfying `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x, y, z` are positive integers, and `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x <= y <= z`:\n- `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= x` and `z > 0`. So `y + z >= x + z > x`.\n- `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x > 0`. So `x + z >= y + x > y`.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to satisfy is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to count triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all possible `x`, `y`, `z` values and check the conditions. This would involve three nested loops:\n`for x from A to B:`\n  `for y from B to C:`\n    `for z from C to D:`\n      `if x + y > z: count++`\n\nThe maximum value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`. In the worst case, `(B-A+1)`, `(C-B+1)`, `(D-C+1)` could each be large, leading to `(5*10^5)^3` operations, which is too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let's fix `x` and `y` and count valid `z` values.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n`C <= z <= D`\n`z < x + y` (from `x + y > z`)\n\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis still leaves us with a double loop over `x` and `y`, which can be up to `(5*10^5)^2` operations, still too slow.\n\nLet's change the order of summation. Instead of iterating `x` and `y` separately, let's iterate over the possible values of their sum, `S = x + y`.\nThe minimum value for `S` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum value for `S` is `B + C`.\n`S` can range from `A+B` (min `1+1=2`) to `B+C` (max `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`).\nThis means the loop for `S` will run at most `(B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1` times. Given `C <= 5*10^5`, this is at most `5 * 10^5` iterations, which is efficient enough.\n\nFor each `S` in `[A+B, B+C]`:\n1. **Count pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.**\n   If `x + y = S`, then `y = S - x`.\n   Substitute `y` into its range `B <= y <= C`:\n   `B <= S - x <= C`\n   This implies `S - C <= x <= S - B`.\n   Combining this with `A <= x <= B`, `x` must satisfy:\n   `max(A, S - C) <= x <= min(B, S - B)`\n   Let `x_lower_bound = max(A, S - C)` and `x_upper_bound = min(B, S - B)`.\n   The number of valid `x` values for a given `S` (and thus valid `(x, y)` pairs) is `count_xy_S = max(0, x_upper_bound - x_lower_bound + 1)`.\n\n2. **Count `z` values such that `C <= z <= D` and `z < S`.**\n   This means `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, S - 1)]`.\n   Let `z_upper_bound = min(D, S - 1)`.\n   The number of valid `z` values for a given `S` is `count_z_S = max(0, z_upper_bound - C + 1)`.\n\nThe total number of triangles is the sum over all possible `S` values:\n`total_triangles = sum_{S=A+B to B+C} (count_xy_S * count_z_S)`\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(C - A)`, which is at most `O(5 * 10^5)`. This is well within typical time limits. The maximum possible value for `total_triangles` can be large (up to `1.25 * 10^{11}`), so Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable.\n\nExample walkthrough: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n- `x` in `[1, 2]`, `y` in `[2, 3]`, `z` in `[3, 4]`.\n- `S` ranges from `A+B = 1+2=3` to `B+C = 2+3=5`.\n\n- **S = 3**:\n  - `x_lower_bound = max(1, 3-3) = max(1, 0) = 1`.\n  - `x_upper_bound = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1`.\n  - `count_xy_S = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1`. (Only `(x,y) = (1,2)`)\n  - `z_upper_bound = min(4, 3-1) = min(4, 2) = 2`.\n  - `count_z_S = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = 0`. (No `z` in `[3,2]`)\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n\n- **S = 4**:\n  - `x_lower_bound = max(1, 4-3) = max(1, 1) = 1`.\n  - `x_upper_bound = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2`.\n  - `count_xy_S = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2`. (Pairs `(1,3)` and `(2,2)`)\n  - `z_upper_bound = min(4, 4-1) = min(4, 3) = 3`.\n  - `count_z_S = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = 1`. (Only `z = 3`)\n  - `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`. (Triangles: `(1,3,3)`, `(2,2,3)`)\n\n- **S = 5**:\n  - `x_lower_bound = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2`.\n  - `x_upper_bound = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2`.\n  - `count_xy_S = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`. (Only `(x,y) = (2,3)`)\n  - `z_upper_bound = min(4, 5-1) = min(4, 4) = 4`.\n  - `count_z_S = max(0, 4 - 3 + 1) = 2`. (Values `z = 3, 4`)\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`. (Triangles: `(2,3,3)`, `(2,3,4)`)\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
