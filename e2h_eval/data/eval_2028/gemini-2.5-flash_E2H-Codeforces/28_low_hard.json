String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Beautiful String\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's asking me to count \"beautiful strings.\" The core challenge here is understanding the string modification operation and its impact on the final result.\n\nFirst, I need to define what a \"beautiful string\" actually *is*. It has to contain only '0's and '1's, with a specific number of each: `n` zeros and `m` ones. The real kicker is the modification rule. This rule dictates how we can transform the string through a series of steps, and the string is beautiful only if it can be reduced to a single character `g` after these modifications.\n\nSo, let's look closer at this modification operation. It reduces the string length by one at each step, combining the last two characters based on specific rules.  I'm interpreting the operation, where `0` is zero and `1` is one:\n*   `0, 0 -> 1`\n*   `0, 1 -> 0`\n*   `1, 0 -> 0`\n*   `1, 1 -> 0`\n\nInitially, I thought it resembled a NAND gate or a NOR operation. However, the exact mapping isn't immediately obvious, and that probably won't be the most efficient solution.\n\nI then started to think about parity: the sum of the digits modulo 2. I tried analyzing how the parity of the characters changed with each modification, but it didn't seem to yield a conserved property.\n\nI need to focus on finding some kind of invariant or a property that can help me predict the outcome of this reduction process. I think I'll write the script that does just this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that, when reduced by a specific operation, result in a single character `g`. The operation replaces the two last characters `c1 c2` with a new character `c_new`: `c_new = 1` if `c1=0, c2=0`, and `c_new = 0` otherwise.\n\nLet's analyze the reduction operation. We can represent '0' as 0 and '1' as 1.\nThe operation is:\n- `0, 0 -> 1`\n- `0, 1 -> 0`\n- `1, 0 -> 0`\n- `1, 1 -> 0`\n\nThis operation is equivalent to `c_new = (c1 == 0 && c2 == 0)`.\nLet `s = s_1 s_2 ... s_k` be a string. The reduction applies to `s_{k-1} s_k`.\nThe string becomes `s_1 s_2 ... s_{k-2} c_new`.\nThis process continues until only one character remains.\n\nConsider the effect of a '1' on the final result.\nIf we have a '1' at the end of the string, say `... X 1`.\n- If `X=0`, `01 -> 0`. The string becomes `... 0`.\n- If `X=1`, `11 -> 0`. The string becomes `... 0`.\nIn both cases, if the last character is '1', the result of the reduction involving it will be '0'.\n\nWhat if the string consists only of '0's?\n- `00 -> 1`\n- `000 -> 0(00) -> 01 -> 0`\n- `0000 -> 00(00) -> 001 -> 0(01) -> 00 -> 1`\n- `00000 -> 000(00) -> 0001 -> 00(01) -> 000 -> 0(00) -> 01 -> 0`\nIt appears that for a string of `k` zeros:\n- `k=1`: `0`\n- `k=2`: `1`\n- `k=3`: `0`\n- `k=4`: `1`\n- `k=5`: `0`\nThe result is `0` if `k` is odd, and `1` if `k` is even (for `k >= 1`).\nThis can be proven by induction. Let `f(k)` be the result for `k` zeros.\n`f(k) = (f(k-2) == 0 && 0 == 0) ? 1 : 0` if `k-2` is the previous character. This is incorrect.\nThe reduction is `f(s_1...s_{k-2} (s_{k-1}s_k))`.\nFor `k` zeros, the string is `0...0`.\n`f(k) = (f(k-1) == 0 && 0 == 0) ? 1 : 0` if the result of `k-1` zeros is `f(k-1)`.\n`f(k) = 1` if `f(k-1)=0` and `0` if `f(k-1)=1`.\n`f(1)=0`.\n`f(2)=1` (since `f(1)=0`).\n`f(3)=0` (since `f(2)=1`).\n`f(4)=1` (since `f(3)=0`).\nSo, `f(k) = (k % 2 == 0)`. This means the result is `1` if `k` is even, `0` if `k` is odd.\n\nNow, consider a string with at least one '1'.\nLet the string be `s_1 s_2 ... s_{j-1} 1 s_{j+1} ... s_{n+m}`.\nIf there is any '1' in the string, let `s_k` be the rightmost '1'.\nThe suffix `s_{k+1} ... s_{n+m}` consists only of zeros. Let its length be `Z`.\nThe string is `... s_{k-1} 1 0...0` (`Z` zeros).\nIf `Z=0` (the rightmost character is '1'): The string is `... s_{k-1} 1`. As shown above, any reduction `X1` results in `0`. So the final result will be `0`.\nIf `Z > 0` (the rightmost '1' is followed by one or more '0's):\nThe suffix `1 0...0` will reduce as follows:\n- `1 0 -> 0`\n- `1 00 -> 1 (00) -> 11 -> 0`\n- `1 000 -> 1 0(00) -> 1 01 -> 10 -> 0`\n- `1 0000 -> 1 00(00) -> 1 001 -> 1 0(01) -> 1 00 -> 1(00) -> 11 -> 0`\nIt appears that if there is at least one '1' in the string, the final result is always '0'.\nThis can be proven by induction. Let `s'` be `s_1 ... s_{k-1}`.\nThe string is `s' 1 0^Z`.\n- If `Z=0`: `s' 1`. The result is `0`.\n- If `Z=1`: `s' 10`. `10 -> 0`. The string becomes `s' 0`. If `s'` is empty, result is `0`. If `s'` not empty, result is `0` (by induction, as it's a string ending in `0` and if it has a `1`, it reduces to `0`).\n- If `Z > 0`: `s' 1 0^Z`. The suffix `1 0^Z` reduces to `0`. (Proof: `1 0^Z -> 1 (0^{Z-1} 0) -> 1 (f(Z-1) 0)`. If `f(Z-1)=0`, then `10 -> 0`. If `f(Z-1)=1`, then `11 -> 0`. So `1 0^Z` always reduces to `0`).\nThus, any string containing at least one '1' will reduce to '0'.\n\nSo, the final result `g` depends on whether `m > 0` and `n`'s parity:\n1. If `m > 0`: The final result `g` must be `0`.\n2. If `m = 0`: The string consists only of `n` zeros. The final result `g` is `1` if `n` is even, and `0` if `n` is odd. (This applies for `n >= 1`).\n\nLet's combine these observations to count beautiful strings:\n\nCase 1: `m > 0`.\n- If `g = 0`: Any string with `n` zeros and `m` ones will reduce to `0`. So we need to count all possible strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones. This is `C(n+m, n)` (choose `n` positions for zeros out of `n+m` total positions).\n- If `g = 1`: No string with `m > 0` can reduce to `1`. So the count is `0`.\n\nCase 2: `m = 0`.\n- The string consists only of `n` zeros.\n- If `n = 0`: This case is ruled out by `n+m >= 1`.\n- If `n >= 1`:\n    - If `n` is even: The string reduces to `1`.\n        - If `g = 0`: Count is `0`.\n        - If `g = 1`: Count is `1` (the string is `0...0` `n` times).\n    - If `n` is odd: The string reduces to `0`.\n        - If `g = 0`: Count is `1` (the string is `0...0` `n` times).\n        - If `g = 1`: Count is `0`.\n\nSummary of logic:\n- If `m > 0`:\n    - If `g == 0`: `C(n+m, n)`\n    - If `g == 1`: `0`\n- If `m == 0`:\n    - If `n == 0`: (This case is `n+m=0`, but `n+m >= 1` is specified, so this won't happen. If it could, `g=0` gives 0, `g=1` gives 0 as there's no string).\n    - If `n > 0`:\n        - If `g == (n % 2 == 0)`: `1` (the string is `0...0`)\n        - Else: `0`\n\nLet's implement this using modular arithmetic for combinations.\n`C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!) mod P`.\nWe need factorials and inverse factorials modulo `1000000007`.\n\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nMAX_N_M = 2 * 10**5 # Max n+m can be 2 * 10^5\n\nfact = [1] * (MAX_N_M + 1)\ninv_fact = [1] * (MAX_N_M + 1)\n\ndef precompute_factorials():\n    for i in range(1, MAX_N_M + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact[MAX_N_M] = pow(fact[MAX_N_M], MOD - 2, MOD) # Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverse\n    for i in range(MAX_N_M - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\ndef nCr_mod_p(n, r):\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    num = fact[n]\n    den = (inv_fact[r] * inv_fact[n-r]) % MOD\n    return (num * den) % MOD\n\n# Precompute factorials once\nprecompute_factorials()\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if m > 0:\n        if g == 0:\n            # Any string with m > 0 ones reduces to 0.\n            # Count combinations of n zeros and m ones: C(n+m, n)\n            print(nCr_mod_p(n + m, n))\n        else: # g == 1\n            # No string with m > 0 ones reduces to 1.\n            print(0)\n    else: # m == 0\n        # String consists only of n zeros.\n        # Result is 1 if n is even, 0 if n is odd (for n >= 1).\n        # n+m >= 1, so n >= 1 here.\n        \n        expected_g = 1 if n % 2 == 0 else 0\n        \n        if g == expected_g:\n            # Only one such string: \"0...0\"\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
