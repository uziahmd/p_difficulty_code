There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Tennis Winner's Games in a Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to figure out the most games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given a special rule about who can play whom. This rule says that two players can only face off if the difference in the number of games they've *already* played is no more than one.\n\nMy first thought is, to maximize the winner's games, that winner needs to *always* be winning. Makes sense, right? Let's call the winner \"W\".  So, to figure out how many games W can play, I need to understand the tournament's structure.\n\nAt any point, we have a bunch of players, each with a certain number of wins (games played). When two players clash, one wins and moves on, the other is eliminated.  To get W to play the most games, I have to figure out the sequence of opponents, ensuring that the rule is followed.\n\nSuppose W gets to G games. This means W needs G different opponents! To make it so, I have to make sure each opponent is available for W at each stage.\n\nLet's look at the beginning. To get W to play game 1, we start with 2 players (call them P and Q, both with zero games) and, of course, W. W beats P. So now W has one game and P is eliminated.\n\nTo get W to game 2, W has 1 game, and any subsequent opponent has to have 0, 1, or 2 games already. So the available opponent will either also have no games and, so, 2 players (one each for W with 1 win and one player with no games) or some other number. We want to *minimize* the number of total players.\n\nTo find the minimum number of players needed for W to play k games, let's call that f(k).\n\n*   `f(0) = 1` (a player who hasn't played yet)\n*   `f(1) = 2`\n*   `f(2) = 3`\n*   `f(3) = 5` and so on.\n\nOkay, I see a pattern! It looks like this is related to the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum number of players looks like it's the (k+2)th Fibonacci number. So, If I have `n` players, and I want to find the maximum possible number of games the winner W gets to play, I need to figure out which Fibonacci number (F_k) is the largest that's less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, Fibonacci numbers grow pretty quickly, and the input `n` can be huge. This means calculating the Fibonacci numbers iteratively makes sense. I just need a simple loop that finds the biggest `k` where F_k <= n, and that's it!\n\nSo, the algorithm is: start with two players.\nKeep calculating F_k using: `F_k = F_(k-1) + F_(k-2)` until a value becomes larger than the input `n`.\nReturn `k-2`.\n\nSimple and efficient, that's the way to go!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule for pairing players: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. All players start with 0 games played.\n\nLet `N(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a tournament winner who has played `k` games. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `N(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's determine the values of `N(k)`:\n\n*   **`N(0)`**: A player who has played 0 games. This requires 1 player (the player themselves). So, `N(0) = 1`.\n\n*   **`N(1)`**: A player who has played 1 game. This player must win their first game. They start with 0 games played and must play against an opponent who has also played 0 games (since `abs(0-0) = 0 <= 1`). So, Player A (0 games) plays Player B (0 games). Player A wins and now has 1 game played. This requires 2 players in total. So, `N(1) = 2`.\n\n*   **`N(k)` for `k >= 2`**: To produce a winner who has played `k` games, this player (let's call them `W`) must have previously played `k-1` games and then won one more game. `W` (with `k-1` games) needs an opponent (`O`). The opponent `O` must have played `j` games such that `abs((k-1) - j) <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\n\n    1.  **`W` (k-1 games) plays `O` (k-2 games)**:\n        This pairing is valid since `abs((k-1) - (k-2)) = 1 <= 1`.\n        To get `W` to `k-1` games, we need `N(k-1)` players.\n        To get `O` to `k-2` games, we need `N(k-2)` players.\n        The total number of players for this scenario would be `N(k-1) + N(k-2)`.\n\n    2.  **`W` (k-1 games) plays `O` (k-1 games)**:\n        This pairing is valid since `abs((k-1) - (k-1)) = 0 <= 1`.\n        To get `W` to `k-1` games, we need `N(k-1)` players.\n        To get `O` to `k-1` games, we need `N(k-1)` players.\n        The total number of players for this scenario would be `N(k-1) + N(k-1) = 2 * N(k-1)`.\n\n    3.  **`W` (k-1 games) plays `O` (k games)**:\n        This pairing is valid since `abs((k-1) - k) = 1 <= 1`.\n        However, if `O` has already played `k` games, it means `O` has already won `k` games. If `W` wins this match, `W` will have `k` wins. But `O` was already a player with `k` wins. This scenario doesn't help in *producing* a player who has played `k` games with the *minimum* number of initial players, as `O` already achieved or surpassed our target. We are interested in the minimum players to get *one* player to `k` wins, so we would not use a player who already has `k` wins as an opponent for a player with `k-1` wins.\n\n    To minimize `N(k)`, we should choose the option that requires fewer players. Comparing `N(k-1) + N(k-2)` and `2 * N(k-1)`, the former is generally smaller (as `N(k-2)` is usually less than `N(k-1)`).\n    So, the recurrence relation is `N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the sequence `N(k)`:\n`N(0) = 1`\n`N(1) = 2`\n`N(2) = N(1) + N(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`N(3) = N(2) + N(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n`N(4) = N(3) + N(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n`N(5) = N(4) + N(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\n...\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` is a shifted Fibonacci sequence. If we define the standard Fibonacci sequence as `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`, then `N(k) = F_{k+2}`.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `N(k) <= n`. We can find this by iteratively calculating `N(k)` values until `N(k)` exceeds `n`.\n\nGiven `n` can be up to `10^18`, `k` will be relatively small (around 90, as Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially). A simple iterative approach will be efficient enough.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `N(0)`).\n2. Initialize `b = 2` (representing `N(1)`).\n3. Initialize `k_games = 1` (representing the number of games for the winner corresponding to `b` players).\n4. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence: `next_b = a + b`. This represents `N(k_games + 1)`.\n   b. If `next_b > n`, it means we cannot form a tournament where the winner plays `k_games + 1` games with `n` players. So, the current `k_games` is the maximum possible. Break the loop.\n   c. Otherwise, update `a = b`, `b = next_b`, and increment `k_games` by 1.\n5. Print `k_games`.\n\n**Example walkthrough (`n = 10`):**\n- Initial: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `k_games = 1`.\n- Loop 1:\n    - `b` (2) <= `n` (10) is true.\n    - `next_b = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    - `next_b` (3) > `n` (10) is false.\n    - `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `k_games = 2`.\n- Loop 2:\n    - `b` (3) <= `n` (10) is true.\n    - `next_b = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n    - `next_b` (5) > `n` (10) is false.\n    - `a = 3`, `b = 5`, `k_games = 3`.\n- Loop 3:\n    - `b` (5) <= `n` (10) is true.\n    - `next_b = a + b = 3 + 5 = 8`.\n    - `next_b` (8) > `n` (10) is false.\n    - `a = 5`, `b = 8`, `k_games = 4`.\n- Loop 4:\n    - `b` (8) <= `n` (10) is true.\n    - `next_b = a + b = 5 + 8 = 13`.\n    - `next_b` (13) > `n` (10) is true. Break loop.\n- Print `k_games` (4).\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # N(k) represents the minimum number of players required for a winner\n    # to play k games.\n    # N(0) = 1 (A player who hasn't played yet)\n    # N(1) = 2 (Player A (0 games) beats Player B (0 games).
