    "thought": "**Analyzing Trailing Zeroes in Factorials for a Competitive Programming Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem where I need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends in exactly `m` zeroes. The output wants the count of such `n`'s and then the `n` values themselves in ascending order. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to count the trailing zeroes in `n!`.  It's all about prime factorization. Trailing zeroes come from factors of 10, which is 2 * 5. Since there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is simply the number of factors of 5.\n\nLegendre's formula gives us a way to calculate this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. This sum keeps going as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.  Now, I need to understand the properties of this `Z(n)` function.\n\nIt's a non-decreasing function, obviously. Adding 1 to `n` either leaves `Z(n)` the same or increases it.  It only *increases* when `n` is a multiple of 5. If `n` isn't a multiple of 5, then `Z(n)` and `Z(n-1)` are the same.  But, if `n` *is* a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` is greater than `Z(n-1)`.  And the jump depends on the power of 5: if it's a multiple of 25, the increase will be by two, if it's a multiple of 125, by three, and so on. Generalizing, If `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`, then `Z(n)` will be equal to `Z(n-1) + k`.\n\nSo, the problem is essentially asking me to find the `n` values where `Z(n)` equals a specific value, `m`. Because `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, if I find an `n` where `Z(n) = m`, the subsequent values (`n+1`, `n+2`, etc.) might *also* have `Z(n)` equal to `m`. It's non-decreasing, so at most the values will stay at m or increase. However, the function will eventually increase. For example, `Z(5)` to `Z(9)` will all be the same, but `Z(10)` is larger. `Z(n)` will stay constant for at most 5 consecutive integers. `Z(n+5)` will *always* be greater than `Z(n)`. This gives me the logic I'll need to use in the script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we count the number of factors of 5, as there will always be more factors of 2 than 5 in `n!`.\n\nThe number of factors of 5 in `n!` can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nLet's analyze the function `Z(n)`:\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function.\n2.  `Z(n)` strictly increases only when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n    *   If `n` is not a multiple of 5, `Z(n) = Z(n-1)`. For example, `Z(5)=1`, `Z(6)=1`, `Z(7)=1`, `Z(8)=1`, `Z(9)=1`.\n    *   If `n` is a multiple of 5, `Z(n) > Z(n-1)`. Specifically, if `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`, then `Z(n) = Z(n-1) + k`.\n\nBecause `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5, if `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n+1)`, `Z(n+2)`, `Z(n+3)`, `Z(n+4)` will also be equal to `m`. However, `Z(n+5)` will be strictly greater than `m`. This implies that if `Z(n) = m` for some `n`, then there can be at most 5 consecutive integers `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` for which `Z(n') = m`.\n\nThe strategy to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n    *   A reasonable upper bound for `n` can be estimated. Since `Z(n) approx n/4` (a loose upper bound for `Z(n)`), `n` would be roughly `4m`. Given `m <= 100,000`, `n` could be up to `400,000` or slightly more. A safe upper bound like `5 * m` or `500,000` is sufficient.\n2.  Let `n_start` be the smallest `n` found by binary search such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n3.  We then check `Z(n_start)`.\n    *   If `Z(n_start) > m`, it means `m` is an impossible number of trailing zeroes. This happens when `Z(n)` \"jumps over\" `m`. For example, if `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`, then `m=5` is impossible. In this case, there are no solutions.\n    *   If `Z(n_start) = m`, then `n_start` is the smallest integer whose factorial ends with `m` zeroes. Due to the property of `Z(n)`, we know that `Z(n_start+1)`, `Z(n_start+2)`, `Z(n_start+3)`, `Z(n_start+4)` will also be `m`. `Z(n_start+5)` will be greater than `m`. Thus, the solutions are `n_start`, `n_start+1`, `n_start+2`, `n_start+3`, `n_start+4`. There will be exactly 5 such integers.\n\nLet's define the `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function:\n\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    power_of_5 = 5\n    while n >= power_of_5:\n        count += n // power_of_5\n        power_of_5 *= 5\n    return count\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the binary search:\n\n```python\nm = int(input())\n\n# Binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\nlow = 1\nhigh = 5 * m  # A safe upper bound for n\nans_n = -1\n\nwhile low <= high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n    if zeroes >= m:\n        ans_n = mid\n        high = mid - 1\n    else:\n        low = mid + 1\n\n# Check if m is achievable\nif ans_n == -1 or count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # If Z(ans_n) == m, then ans_n, ans_n+1, ..., ans_n+4 are the solutions\n    # because Z(n) only increases when n is a multiple of 5.\n    # Since ans_n is the smallest n such that Z(n) = m,\n    # Z(ans_n-1) must be < m.\n    # The values Z(ans_n), Z(ans_n+1), Z(ans_n+2), Z(ans_n+3), Z(ans_n+4) will all be m.\n    # Z(ans_n+5) will be greater than m.\n    \n    solutions = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        solutions.append(ans_n + i)\n    \n    print(len(solutions))\n    print(*solutions)\n\n```",
