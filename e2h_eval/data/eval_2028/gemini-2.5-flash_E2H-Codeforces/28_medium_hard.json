String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Analyzing \"Beautiful Strings\" and the NOR Operation**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"beautiful string\" problem. The core of it is this reduction operation, which, after a bit of digging, I've realized boils down to a NOR gate.  Essentially, we're taking the last two characters of the string and replacing them with `NOT(x OR y)`. This NOR operation is right-associative, which is crucial.\n\nInitially, I tried to link this to a boolean operation using the XOR pattern from a similar problem, but NOR made more sense. I've realized, based on several examples, that the presence of a '1' in the string has a significant impact.\n\n**Parity and the Role of '1's**\n\nIf there's at least one '1', there's a strong rule: the string reduces, in general, to zero. I carefully derived that if any character from the second character onwards is '1', the value ultimately is determined by the combination of earlier bits.\n\nSo now there are two scenarios:\n1.  **Case: All 0s** (m=0): If all characters are 0 (e.g., \"000\"), the final value follows this pattern:\n    -   If the length n is odd, the final value is 0.\n    -   If the length n is even and greater than or equal to 2, the final value is 1.\n\n2.  **Case: At Least One 1** (m > 0): Now, it got intricate because if the first bit is 1, the result is always 0. But if the first bit is 0, the position of the first `1` matters. The trick is to identify the first `1`. The key now is the index, j of the first occurrence of `1` (from the left). We observe a pattern in parity.\n   - We trace the values back starting from the rightmost `1`, as if each `0` flips the `1`.\n     - `j`th bit is `1`: the result becomes dependent on this specific `j` index.\n   - The final result is:\n     - `g = 1` if `j` is even\n     - `g = 0` if `j` is odd.\n   - This leads to: If `s_1 = 0`, and index of the first `1` is `j`:\n      - `g = 1` if j is even.\n      - `g = 0` if j is odd.\n   - If `s_1 = 1`, then the final value is always 0.\n\nSo the main focus here is understanding this NOR operation and recognizing how the '1's influence the reduction process. Essentially, if all '0', it's the pattern, or if any `1` and `s_1` the overall parity in string becomes very important. I believe with this insight, the Python script should be easy to craft.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that reduce to a single character `g` using a specific operation. The operation is: replace the two last characters `x, y` with `NOT (x OR y)`. This is equivalent to `1` if `x=0, y=0`, and `0` otherwise. This operation is right-associative, meaning for a string `s_1 s_2 ... s_k`, the final character is `s_1 NOR (s_2 NOR (... NOR s_k)...)`.\n\nLet `V(s)` denote the final character obtained by reducing string `s`.\nThe recurrence relation for `V(s_1 ... s_k)` is `V(s_1 ... s_k) = f(s_1, V(s_2 ... s_k))`, where `f(x, y) = NOT (x OR y)`. The base case is `V(s_k) = s_k`.\n\nWe analyze the problem based on the number of ones (`m`) and the value of `g`.\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (The string consists only of zeros: `0^n`)**\nThe string is `s = \"00...0\"` (`n` times).\n- `V(\"0\") = 0`\n- `V(\"00\") = f(0, V(\"0\")) = f(0, 0) = 1`\n- `V(\"000\") = f(0, V(\"00\")) = f(0, 1) = 0`\n- `V(\"0000\") = f(0, V(\"000\")) = f(0, 0) = 1`\nThe pattern is: `V(\"0^n\") = 0` if `n` is odd, and `V(\"0^n\") = 1` if `n` is even and `n \\ge 2`.\nIf `n=0`, `m=0`, `n+m \\ge 1` is violated.\nSo, if `m=0`:\n- If `g=0`: The string `0^n` is beautiful if `n` is odd. There is 1 such string.\n- If `g=1`: The string `0^n` is beautiful if `n` is even and `n \\ge 2`. There is 1 such string.\n- Otherwise, there are 0 such strings.\n\n**Case 2: `m > 0` (The string contains at least one '1')**\nLet `L = n+m` be the total length of the string.\nLet's analyze the effect of a '1' in the string.\nIf `s_k = 1` (the last character is '1'):\n- `V(s_k) = 1`.\n- `V(s_{k-1} s_k) = f(s_{k-1}, V(s_k)) = f(s_{k-1}, 1) = 0`.\n- `V(s_{k-2} s_{k-1} s_k) = f(s_{k-2}, V(s_{k-1} s_k)) = f(s_{k-2}, 0) = NOT s_{k-2}`.\n- `V(s_{k-3} s_{k-2} s_{k-1} s_k) = f(s_{k-3}, V(s_{k-2} s_{k-1} s_k)) = f(s_{k-3}, NOT s_{k-2})`.\nThis sequence `NOT s_{k-2}`, `f(s_{k-3}, NOT s_{k-2})`, etc. is difficult to simplify.\n\nA simpler observation:\nThe operation `f(x, y) = NOT (x OR y)` implies that if `x=1` or `y=1`, the result is `0`. Only `f(0,0)=1`.\nThis means that to get a `1` as the final result, *every* operation must take two `0`s and produce a `1`. This implies the string must be `0^L` for `L` even.\nIf there is any `1` in the string, or if `n` is odd, the final result is `0`.\nLet's re-verify this.\nIf `s = s_1 ... s_k` contains at least one `1`.\nLet `s_j` be the rightmost `1`. So `s_j=1` and `s_{j+1}=...=s_k=0`.\n- If `j=k` (i.e. `s_k=1`):\n  `V(s_k) = 1`.\n  `V(s_{k-1} s_k) = f(s_{k-1}, 1) = 0`.\n  `V(s_{k-2} s_{k-1} s_k) = f(s_{k-2}, 0) = NOT s_{k-2}`.\n  `V(s_{k-3} s_{k-2} s_{k-1} s_k) = f(s_{k-3}, NOT s_{k-2})`.\n  This means the final character `g` depends on `s_1` and `s_2`. Specifically, `g = f(s_1, NOT s_2)` if `L \\ge 3`. If `L=2`, `g=f(s_1,1)=0`.\n  This is `g = (s_1 AND s_2)` if `L \\ge 3` and `s_k=1`. If `L=2`, `g=0`.\n  This is only valid if `s_k=1`.\n\nLet's use the property that `f(x,y)` is `0` if `x=1` or `y=1`.\nThis means if `V(s_2 ... s_k)` is `1`, then `s_2 ... s_k` must be `0...0` of even length.\nAnd if `s_1=1`, then `V(s_1 ... s_k) = f(1, V(s_2 ... s_k)) = 0`.\nSo, if `s_1=1`, then `g` must be `0`.\nIf `g=1` and `s_1=1`, then 0 strings.\nIf `g=0` and `s_1=1`: Any string starting with '1' is beautiful. Number of such strings: `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n\nWhat if `s_1=0` and `m>0`?\nThen `V(s_1 ... s_k) = f(0, V(s_2 ... s_k)) = NOT (V(s_2 ... s_k))`.\nSo `g = NOT (V(s_2 ... s_k))`.\nThis means `V(s_2 ... s_k)` must be `NOT g`.\nThe string `s_2 ... s_k` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\nLet `s' = s_2 ... s_k`. Length `L' = n+m-1`.\nIf `m>0`, `s'` still contains at least one '1'.\nIf `s'` starts with '1' (i.e. `s_2=1`): `V(s') = 0`.\nSo `g = NOT 0 = 1`.\nIf `s_1=0, s_2=1`: `g=1`.\nNumber of such strings: `C(n+m-2, m-1)`. (Remaining `n-1` zeros and `m-1` ones in `s_3 ... s_k`).\n\nIf `s_1=0, s_2=0`:\nThen `V(s') = NOT (V(s_3 ... s_k))`.\nSo `g = NOT (NOT (V(s_3 ... s_k))) = V(s_3 ... s_k)`.\nThe string `s'' = s_3 ... s_k` has `n-2` zeros and `m` ones. Length `L'' = n+m-2`.\nIf `m>0`, `s''` still contains at least one '1'.\nIf `s''` starts with '1' (i.e. `s_3=1`): `V(s'') = 0`.\nSo `g=0`.\nIf `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=1`: `g=0`.\nNumber of such strings: `C(n+m-3, m-1)`. (Remaining `n-2` zeros and `m-1` ones in `s_4 ... s_k`).\n\nThis pattern continues:\nLet `p` be the number of leading zeros. `s_1=...=s_p=0`, `s_{p+1}=1`.\nThen `V(s_1 ... s_k) = (p % 2 == 0) ? V(s_{p+1} ... s_k) : NOT (V(s_{p+1} ... s_k))`.\nAnd `V(s_{p+1} ... s_k) = f(1, V(s_{p+2} ... s_k)) = 0`.\nSo `V(s_{p+1} ... s_k) = 0`.\nTherefore, `V(s_1 ... s_k) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : NOT 0 = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1`.\nThis means `g = 1` if `p` is odd, `g = 0` if `p` is even.\n\nThis rule holds for `m>0` and `s_{p+1}=1` (the first '1' is not `s_k`).\nWhat if `s_{p+1}=1` is the last character? i.e. `s = 0^p 1`. (`n=p, m=1`).\n`V(1) = 1`.\n`V(01) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n`V(001) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`V(0001) = f(0,1) = 0`.\nSo `V(0^p 1) = 1` if `p` is even, `0` if `p` is odd.\nThis means `g = 1` if `p` is even, `g = 0` if `p` is odd.\n\nCombining the cases for `m > 0`:\n1. Strings starting with `1` (`s_1=1`): `g=0`.\n   Count: `C(n+m-1, m-1)`. This is valid if `m \\ge 1`.\n2. Strings of the form `0^p 1` (`n=p, m=1`): `g = (p % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0`.\n   This means `g = 1` if `n` is even, `g = 0` if `n` is odd.\n   Count: 1 string if `g` matches, 0 otherwise. This is valid if `m=1`.\n3. Strings of the form `0^p 1 X` where `X` is non-empty and contains at least one '0' or '1'.\n   `g = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1`.\n   This means `g = 0` if `p` is even, `g = 1` if `p` is odd.\n   Count: For a fixed `p`, the string `s_1 ... s_k` is `0^p 1 s_{p+2} ... s_k`.\n   `s_1 ... s_p` are `p` zeros. `s_{p+1}` is '1'.\n   Remaining `n-p` zeros and `m-1` ones for `s_{p+2} ... s_k`.\n   The length of `s_{p+2} ... s_k` is `n+m-(p+1)`.\n   The number of ways to arrange `n-p` zeros and `m-1` ones is `C(n+m-(p+1), m-1)`.\n   This is valid if `m \\ge 1`. And `n \\ge p`.\n   And `n+m-(p+1) \\ge 1` (X is non-empty).\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. We need combinations `C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)`.\nPrecompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo `MOD`.\n\n**Final Algorithm for `m > 0`:**\nTotal possible strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, m)`.\nLet `ans = 0`.\n\nCase A: `g=0`.\n  1. Strings starting with '1' (`s_1=1`): These always reduce to `0`.\n     Number of such strings: `C(n+m-1, m-1)` (if `m \\ge 1`). Add to `ans`.\n  2. Strings starting with `0` (`s_1=0`). Let `p` be the number of leading zeros.\n     `s = 0^p 1 X`. `g=0` requires `p` to be even.\n     `p` can range from `0` to `n-1`. (`s_{p+1}=1`).\n     If `m=1` (string is `0^p 1`): `g=0` requires `p` to be odd.\n        If `n` is odd, `p=n` is odd. `0^n 1` gives `g=0`. This is `0^n 1` (n zeros, 1 one). This case is covered by `s_1=0` and `p=n`.\n        If `n` is odd and `m=1`, the string is `0^n 1`. `p=n` is odd. `V(0^n 1) = 0`. So this string is beautiful. Add 1 to `ans`.\n     If `m > 1` (string is `0^p 1 X` where `X` contains `m-1` ones and `n-p` zeros): `g=0` requires `p` to be even.\n        Sum `C(n+m-(p+1), m-1)` for even `p` from `0` to `n-1`.\n\nCase B: `g=1`.\n  1. Strings starting with '1' (`s_1=1`): These always reduce to `0`. So no strings here.\n  2. Strings starting with `0` (`s_1=0`). Let `p` be the number of leading zeros.\n     `s = 0^p 1 X`. `g=1` requires `p` to be odd.\n     If `m=1` (string is `0^p 1`): `g=1` requires `p` to be even.\n        If `n` is even, `p=n` is even. `V(0^n 1) = 1`. So this string is beautiful. Add 1 to `ans`.\n     If `m > 1` (string is `0^p 1 X` where `X` contains `m-1` ones and `n-p` zeros): `g=1` requires `p` to be odd.\n        Sum `C(n+m-(p+1), m-1)` for odd `p` from `0` to `n-1`.\n\nThis is still complicated. Let's simplify the sum:\n`Sum C(N-p, M-1)` for `p` even/odd.\nLet `N_total = n+m`.\n`C(N_total - (p+1), m-1) = C(n+m-p-1, m-1)`.\nThe sum is over `p` from `0` to `n-1`.\n`p` is the number of leading zeros. `s_{p+1}=1`. This means `p \\le n-1`.\nThe number of zeros remaining is `n-p`. The number of ones remaining is `m-1`.\nThe length of `X` (the suffix after `0^p 1`) is `n-p + m-1`.\nSo `C(n-p+m-1, m-1)` is the number of ways to arrange `X`.\n\nThe sum `sum_{p=0}^{n-1} C(n-p+m-1, m-1)` for `p` having specific parity.\nThis is `sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(k+m-1, m-1)` where `k=n-p`.\nWhen `p` goes `0, 1, ..., n-1`: `k` goes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nSo we need `sum_{k=1}^{n} C(k+m-1, m-1)` for `k` having specific parity.\n`p` even means `n-k` even, so `k` has same parity as `n`.\n`p` odd means `n-k` odd, so `k` has opposite parity as `n`.\n\nHockey-stick identity: `sum_{i=r}^N C(i, r) = C(N+1, r+1)`.\nHere `r = m-1`.\n`sum_{k=1}^n C(k+m-1, m-1) = sum_{j=m}^{n+m-1} C(j, m-1)` where `j=k+m-1`.\nThis is `C(n+m, m) - C(m-1, m-1) = C(n+m, m) - 1`.

Strings starting with `0`: `0^p 1 X`. `g=0` requires `p` to be even.\n   `p=0`: `01XX`. `n-p=2`, `m-1=1`. `C(2+1,1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\n     These are `0101`, `0110`, `0100` (but `0100` is `n=3, m=1`).\n     `01XX` means `s_1=0, s_2=1`. Remaining `n-1` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n     `n-1=1`, `m-1=1`. So `C(1+1,1) = C(2,1)=2`.\n     These are `0101`, `0110`.\n     My rule `g=0` if `p` is even. For `p=0`, `g=0`.\n     But `0101` and `0110` produce `g=1`.\n     This means the rule `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` is wrong.\n\nLet's re-re-derive `V(0^p 1 X)`.\n`V(1 X) = f(1, V(X)) = 0`.

(Here `p=3`).\nSo `V(0^p 1 X) = 1` if `p` is odd, `0` if `p` is even. This is correct!\n\nWhy did `0101` and `0110` give `g=1`?\nFor `0101`, `p=1` (odd). Rule says `g=1`. Matches.\nFor `0110`, `p=1` (odd). Rule says `g=1`. Matches.\n\nSo for `n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n1. Strings starting with `1`: `C(3,1)=3`. (Correct).\n2. Strings starting with `0`. `m>1`. `g=0` requires `p` to be even.\n   `p` from `0` to `n-1=1`. Only `p=0` is even.\n   For `p=0`: `s_1=0, s_2=1`. (`n-p` zeros, `m-1` ones for `X`).\n   `n-p = 2`. `m-1 = 1`. `C(2+1,1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\n   These strings are `0101`, `0110`, `0100` (but `0100` has `n=3,m=1`).\n   The number of ways to arrange `n-p` zeros and `m-1` ones in `X` is `C( (n-p) + (m-1), m-1 )`.\n   For `p=0`: `C( (2-0) + (2-1), 2-1 ) = C(3,1) = 3`.\n   These are `01` followed by `n-1` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n   `01` followed by `1` zero and `1` one: `0101`, `0110`.\n   My combinations `C(3,1)` means there are 3 ways.\n   `C( (n-p) + (m-1), m-1 )` is for the string `X`.\n   So the strings are `0^p 1 X`.\n   For `p=0`, `s_1=0`. `s_2=1`.\n   `X` has `n-1` zeros and `m-1` ones. `n-1=1, m-1=1`.\n   So `X` can be `01` or `10`.\n   Strings are `0101`, `0110`.\n   For `p=0` (even), `g=0`.\n   `V(\"0101\")=1`. `V(\"0110\")=1`.\n   Neither of these gives `g=0`. So for `p=0` none are counted.\n   So `S_even_p = 0`.\n   Total `ans = 3`. Still not 4.\n\nThe issue is that for `n=2, m=2, g=0`, the string `0011` is beautiful.\nFor `0011`, `p=2` (even). `g=0`.\nThis string is `0^p 1 X` where `p=2`, `1` is `s_3`, and `X` is `s_4=1`.\n`X` is `1`. `n-p=0`, `m-1=1`. `C(0+1,1) = C(1,1) = 1`.\nThis is `0011`.\nMy logic: `g=0` if `p` is even. `p=2` is even. So `0011` should be counted.\nThis means `S_even_p` should include `0011`.\nSo `p` can range up to `n`.\nIf `p=n`, then `s=0^n 1`. And `m=1`. This is Case 2a.\nIf `p < n`, then `s=0^p 1 X`.\n   If `m=1`, then `X` must contain `n-p` zeros. (So `X` is `0^{n-p}`).\n   `V(0^p 1 0^{n-p})`.\n   This is `V(0^p (1 0^{n-p}))`.\n   `V(1 0^{n-p}) = f(1, V(0^{n-p})) = 0`. (If `n-p \\ge 0`).\n   Then `V(0^p 1 0^{n-p}) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1`.\n   This is `g=0` if `p` is even, `g=1` if `p` is odd.\n   This covers `m=1` and `p < n`.\n\nSo the refined logic for `m > 0`:\n`ans = 0`.\nIf `g=0`:\n  1. Strings starting with `1` (`s_1=1`): `C(n+m-1, m-1)`. Add to `ans`. (Requires `m \\ge 1`).\n  2. Strings starting with `0` (`s_1=0`).\n     Sum over `p` from `0` to `n`. `p` is number of leading zeros. `s_{p+1}=1`.\n     If `p=n`: string is `0^n 1`. (Requires `m=1`).\n        If `n` is odd, `g=0`. Add 1 to `ans`.\n     If `p < n`: string is `0^p 1 X`.\n        `g=0` requires `p` to be even.\n        Number of ways to form `X` is `C(n-p + m-1, m-1)`. Add to `ans`. (Requires `m \\ge 1`).\n\nIf `g=1`:\n  1. Strings starting with `1` (`s_1=1`): Reduce to `0`. So 0 strings.\n  2. Strings starting with `0` (`s_1=0`).\n     Sum over `p` from `0` to `n`.\n     If `p=n`: string is `0^n 1`. (Requires `m=1`).\n        If `n` is even, `g=1`. Add 1 to `ans`.\n     If `p < n`: string is `0^p 1 X`.\n        `g=1` requires `p` to be odd.\n        Number of ways to form `X` is `C(n-p + m-1, m-1)`. Add to `ans`. (Requires `m \\ge 1`).\n\nLet's re-run Example 2: `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n`m > 0`. `g=0`.\n1. Strings starting with `1`: `C(3,1) = 3`. `ans = 3`.\n2. Strings starting with `0`.\n   `p` from `0` to `n=2`.\n   `p=n=2`: `m=1` is false (m=2). So skip `0^n 1` case.\n   `p < n`: `p` from `0` to `1`.\n     `g=0` requires `p` to be even. So `p=0`.\n     Add `C(n-p+m-1, m-1)` for `p=0`.\n     `C(2-0+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\n     `ans = (3+3)%MOD = 6`. Still 6.\n\nWhere is the discrepancy?\nThe rule `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` is correct assuming `X` is non-empty.\nIf `X` is empty, this means `n-p=0` and `m-1=0`. So `p=n` and `m=1`.\nThis is exactly the string `0^n 1`.\nFor `0^n 1`, `V(0^n 1) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\nThis is the opposite of `(p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` when `p=n`.\nSo the cases `p=n` (which implies `m=1`) and `p<n` (which means `X` is non-empty) must be handled separately for `0^p 1 X`.\n\nLet's try Example 2 (`n=2, m=2, g=0`) again with the fully refined logic:\n`m > 0`. `g=0`.\n1. Strings starting with `1`: `C(2+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`. `ans = 3`.\n2. Strings starting with `0`. `p` from `0` to `n=2`.\n   `p=n=2`:\n     Is `m=1`? No, `m=2`. So this `0^n 1` case is not applicable.\n   `p < n`: `p` from `0` to `1`.\n     `g=0` requires `p` to be even. So `p=0`.\n     Add `C(n-p+m-1, m-1)` for `p=0`.\n     `C(2-0+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\n     `ans = (3+3)%MOD = 6`.\n\nThe actual strings for `n=2, m=2, g=0` are: `0011`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100`.\n`1001, 1010, 1100` are 3 strings starting with `1`. They are correctly counted.\n`0011` is the 4th string. `s_1=0`. `p=2`. `s_3=1`. `X=1`.\nHere `p=2` is even. My rule `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` implies `g=0`. So `0011` should be counted.\n`p=2` is `p<n` false. `p=n` true. My condition `p<n` is `p < 2`.\nSo `p=2` is not covered by `p<n`. It's covered by `p=n`.\nBut for `p=n`, it has to be `m=1`. Here `m=2`. So this case is not covered.\n\nThe logic `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` is valid if `X` is non-empty.\nWhen `X` is empty, it means `n-p=0` and `m-1=0`. This means `p=n` and `m=1`.\nSo `V(0^n 1) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\nThis is `g = (n % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0`.\n\nThe string `0011` is `0^p 1 X` where `p=2`, `s_{p+1}=s_3=1`, `X=s_4=1`.\nHere `X` is non-empty.\n`p=2` is even. The rule `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` means `g=0`.\nSo `0011` should be counted.\n\nThe logic `p` goes from `0` to `n-1` is for `s_{p+1}=1`.\nThe number of leading zeros `p` can be `n`. If `s_{n+1}=1`, then `m=1`.\nThe `0^p 1 X` covers `p` from `0` to `n-1`.\nIf `s_1=0`, and `s_2=0`, ..., `s_n=0`, then `s_{n+1}=1`. This means `p=n`.\nAnd `m` must be `1`. (String is `0^n 1`).\n\nLet's use `p` as the number of initial zeros. `s_1=...=s_p=0`, `s_{p+1}=1`.\n`p` can range from `0` to `n`.\nIf `p=n`, then `m=1`.

So they are not counted.\nThis means for `p=0` (even), 0 strings are added to `ans`.\n\nThe only string for `n=2, m=2, g=0` that starts with `0` is `0011`.\nFor `0011`, `p=2`. `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=1`. `X=s_4=1`.\n`p=2`. `p<n` is false. `p=n` is true. `m=1` is false.\nSo `0011` is not counted by my logic.\n\nThe problem is that my `V(0^p 1 X)` rule is for `X` non-empty.\nIf `X` is `1` (single char), `V(0^p 1 1)`.\n`V(11) = f(1,1) = 0`.\n`V(011) = f(0, V(11)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`V(0011) = f(0, V(011)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\nSo `V(0^p 11) = 1` if `p` is odd, `0` if `p` is even.\nThis is consistent with `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1`.\n\nThe rule is:\n`V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` if `X` is non-empty.\n`V(0^n 1) = (n % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0` if `m=1`.\n\nThis means for `n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n1. Strings starting with `1`: `C(3,1)=3`. `ans=3`.\n2. Strings starting with `0`.\n   `p` from `0` to `n=2`.\n   `p=0`: `p<n`. `X` is non-empty. `g=0` requires `p` to be even.\n     `p=0` is even. Count strings `0^0 1 X`. `X` has `n` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n     `X` has `2` zeros and `1` one. `C(2+1,1)=3`.\n     These are `01001`, `01010`, `01100`. (These are for `n=3, m=2`).\n     For `n=2, m=2`, `X` has `n-p=2` zeros and `m-1=1` one. This is wrong.\n     `X` has `n-p` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n     `n-p` can be `0` to `n-1`. `m-1` can be `0` to `m-1`.\n     `X` is `s_{p+2} ... s_k`.\n     `X` has `n-p` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n     For `p=0`, `X` has `n` zeros and `m-1` ones. `n=2, m=2`. So `X` has `2` zeros and `1` one.\n     These are strings like `01001`, `01010`, `01100`.\n     These strings are of length `1+1+3 = 5`. But `n+m=4`.\n     This means `n-p+m-1` must be the length of `X`.\n     `n-p+m-1 = (n+m) - (p+1)`. This is correct.\n\nAh, the issue is that `C(N,K)` is the number of ways to choose `K` items from `N`.\nThe string `0^p 1 X` has `p` zeros, `1` one, and `X` has `n-p` zeros and `m-1` ones.\nTotal zeros: `p + (n-p) = n`. Total ones: `1 + (m-1) = m`. This is correct.\nThe length of `X` is `(n-p) + (m-1)`.\nThe string `0011` has `p=2`. `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=1`. `X` is `s_4=1`.\n`n=2, m=2`.\n`p=2`. `n-p=0`. `m-1=1`.\nSo `X` has `0` zeros and `1` one. This is `X=\"1\"`.\n`C(0+1, 1) = C(1,1)=1`. This is `0011`.\nFor `p=2` (even), `g=0`. This string `0011` gives `g=0`. It should be counted.\n\nMy current logic for `n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n1. `ans = C(3,1) = 3`.\n2. `p` from `0` to `n=2`.\n   `p=0`: `p<n`. `p=0` is even. Add `C(n-p+m-1, m-1) = C(2-0+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`. `ans = (3+3)%MOD = 6`.\n   `p=1`: `p<n`. `p=1` is odd. Skip.\n   `p=2`: `p=n`. Is `m=1`? No (`m=2`). Skip.\nSo `0011` is not counted by this logic.\n\nThe problem is the condition `p<n` for `X` to be non-empty.\n`X` is non-empty if `(n-p) + (m-1) >= 1`.\nIf `m=1`, then `X` is non-empty if `n-p >= 1`. So `p < n`.\nIf `m > 1`, then `m-1 >= 1`, so `X` is always non-empty.\nSo `X` is empty only if `m=1` AND `p=n`. This is the `0^n 1` case.\n\nLet's use `p` as the number of initial zeros. `s_1=...=s_p=0`.\n`p` can range from `0` to `n`.\nIf `p=n`: All `n` zeros are at the beginning. The string is `0^n 1^m`.\n   `V(1^m) = 0` if `m \\ge 2`. `V(1) = 1` if `m=1`.\n   `V(0^n 1^m) = V(0^n (V(1^m)))`.\n   If `m=1`, `V(0^n 1) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\n   If `m \\ge 2`, `V(1^m) = 0`. So `V(0^n 0) = V(0^{n+1}) = 0` if `n+1` is odd, `1` if `n+1` is even.\n   So `V(0^n 1^m)` for `m \\ge 2` is `0` if `n` is even, `1` if `n` is odd.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let's use the property that `f(x,y)` is `0` if `x=1` or `y=1`.\nThe only way to get a `1` is `f(0,0)`.\nThis means the final `1` must be generated by `f(0,0)`.\nThis means the string must be of the form `0 R` where `R` reduces to `0`.\nAnd `R` must be of form `0 R'` where `R'` reduces to `0`.\nThis means `s_1=0, s_2=0, ..., s_k=0`. `0^k`.\nIf `g=1`, string must be `0^k` for `k` even and `k \\ge 2`. (This means `m=0`).\nThis is the `m=0` case.\n\nIf `m>0`, then there is at least one `1`.\nIf `g=1`, then every `1` must be eliminated and result in `0` at each step.\nExample: `0011`. `V=0`.\n`0101`. `V=1`.\n`0110`. `V=1`.\n`1001`. `V=0`.\n`1010`. `V=0`.\n`1100`. `V=0`.\n\nThe simple rule `g = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` for `0^p 1 X` (X non-empty) is correct.\nFor `n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n  Strings starting `1`: `C(3,1)=3`. (These are `1001, 1010, 1100`).\n  Strings starting `0`: (i.e. `s_1=0`).\n    `p` is number of leading zeros.\n    `p=0`: `s_1=0, s_2=1`. `X` contains `n-1` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n      `n-1=1, m-1=1`. So `X` is `01` or `10`.\n      Strings `0101`, `0110`.\n      `p=0` is even. Rule says `g=0`. But `V(\"0101\")=1`, `V(\"0110\")=1`.\n      So these are NOT counted.\n    `p=1`: `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=1`. `X` contains `n-2` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n      `n-2=0, m-1=1`. So `X` is `1`.\n      String `0011`.\n      `p=1` is odd. Rule says `g=1`. But `V(\"0011\")=0`.\n      So this is NOT counted.\n\nMy rules are inconsistent with the example.\nThe rules for `V(0^p 1 X)` are wrong.\n\nLet's re-examine `V(s_1 ... s_k)`.\n`V(s_1 ... s_k) = s_1 XOR s_2 XOR ... XOR s_k` when operation is XOR.\n`V(s_1 ... s_k) = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k (mod 2)` when operation is XOR.\n\nLet's try to map the operation to something simpler.\n`f(x,y) = NOT(x OR y)`.\n`f(x,y)` is `1` iff `x=0, y=0`.\nLet `s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\nFinal char `g`.\nIf `g=1`, then the last operation was `f(0,0)`.\nSo `s_1=0` and `V(s_2 ... s_L)=0`.\nIf `V(s_2 ... s_L)=0`, then `s_2=0` and `V(s_3 ... s_L)=0`.\nThis implies `s_1=0, s_2=0, ..., s_{L-1}=0` and `V(s_L)=0`.\nSo `s_L=0`.\nThis means the string must be `0^L`.\nBut `V(0^L) = 1` only if `L` is even and `L \\ge 2`.\nSo if `g=1`, then `m=0`, `n` is even and `n \\ge 2`. (1 string `0^n`).\n\nThis implies that if `m > 0`, `g` must be `0`.\nIf `m > 0` and `g=1`, then 0 strings.\nLet's check example `n=1, m=1, g=1`. Output is `0`. This matches.\nLet's check `n=2, m=2, g=0`. Output is `4`. This matches.\nMy logic `if m>0 and g=1 then 0 strings` is consistent with `n=1, m=1, g=1`.\n\nSo the problem is simplified: `m > 0` implies `g` must be `0`.\nIf `m > 0` and `g=1`, answer is `0`.\nIf `m > 0` and `g=0`:\n  All strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones are beautiful.\n  Total strings: `C(n+m, m)`.\n  Let's check this hypothesis with `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n  `C(2+2, 2) = C(4,2) = 6`.\n  But example output is `4`.\n  So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThe property `V(s_1 ... s_k) = 1` implies `s_1=...=s_k=0` is wrong.\n`V(\"010\") = 1`. `s_2=1`.\n`V(\"010\") = f(0, V(\"10\")) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n\nThe rule is `g = V(s_1 ... s_k)`.\n`g=1` means `s_1=0` and `V(s_2 ... s_k)=0`.\n`g=0` means `s_1=1` OR `V(s_2 ... s_k)=1`.\n\nLet `dp[k][zeros][ones][target]` be number of strings of length `k` with `zeros` and `ones` reducing to `target`. This is too complex.\n\nThe key must be related to `m`.\nIf `m=1`: `s = X 1 Y`.\n  `V(s) = V(X 1 Y)`.\n  If `Y` is empty, `s = X 1`.\n    `V(1) = 1`.\n    `V(01) = 0`.\n    `V(001) = 1`.\n    `V(0^p 1) = 1` if `p` is even, `0` if `p` is odd.\n    So if `m=1`, string is `0^p 1 0^q`. `p+q=n`.\n    `V(0^p 1 0^q) = V(0^p (1 0^q))`.\n    `V(1 0^q) = f(1, V(0^q)) = 0`. (If `q \\ge 0`).\n    Then `V(0^p 0) = V(0^{p+1}) = 0` if `p+1` is odd, `1` if `p+1` is even.\n    So `V(0^p 1 0^q) = 0` if `p` is even, `1` if `p` is odd.\n    This is for `m=1`.\n    Number of such strings: `C(n+m, m)` total strings.\n    For `m=1`, there are `n+1` positions for '1'.\n    `s_j=1`. `p=j-1` leading zeros. `q=n-(j-1)` trailing zeros.\n    `V(s) = 0` if `j-1` is even. `V(s) = 1` if `j-1` is odd.\n    `g=0`: `j-1` is even. `j` is odd.\n    `g=1`: `j-1` is odd. `j` is even.\n    Count number of strings where `j` is odd/even.\n    `j` from `1` to `n+1`.\n    If `n+1` is even, there are `(n+1)/2` odd `j`s and `(n+1)/2` even `j`s.\n    If `n+1` is odd, there are `(n+2)/2` odd `j`s and `(n)/2` even `j`s.\n    So for `m=1`:\n      If `g=0`: count `j` odd. `ceil((n+1)/2)`.\n      If `g=1`: count `j` even. `floor((n+1)/2)`.\n    Let's check `n=1, m=1, g=0`. `n+1=2`. `ceil(2/2)=1`. `j` odd: `j=1`.

My calculation `ceil((1+1)/2)=1` is wrong.\n    It's `j` (index of 1).\n    `j=1`: `10` `p=0` (even). `g=0`.\n    `j=2`: `01` `p=1` (odd). `g=1`.\n    So for `m=1`:\n      `g=0`: `p` even.

(1 string).\n    `j-1` odd means `j=2`. `01`. `g=1`. (0 strings).\n    Total for `g=0` is `1`. Example output is `2`. My formula is still wrong.\n\nThe example `n=1, m=1, g=0` strings are `01`, `10`. Both reduce to `0`.\nMy `V(0^p 1 0^q)` is `0` if `p` is even, `1` if `p` is odd.\nFor `01`, `p=1` (odd). `V=1`.\nFor `10`, `p=0` (even). `V=0`.\nSo `01` should reduce to `1`, `10` to `0`.\nThis contradicts the example.\n\nThe rule `V(1 0^q) = f(1, V(0^q)) = 0` is incorrect if `q=0`.\nIf `q=0`, `V(1) = 1`.\nLet's analyze `m=1`. String is `0^p 1 0^q`. `p+q=n`.\nIf `q=0`: string is `0^p 1`. `V(0^p 1) = 1` if `p` is even, `0` if `p` is odd.\nIf `q > 0`: string is `0^p 1 0^q`.\n  `V(1 0^q) = f(1, V(0^q)) = 0`. (Because `q > 0`, so `V(0^q)` is `0` or `1`).\n  `V(0^p 0) = V(0^{p+1}) = 0` if `p+1` is odd, `1` if `p+1` is even.\n  So `V(0^p 1 0^q) = 0` if `p` is even, `1` if `p` is odd. (For `q > 0`).\n\nSo for `m=1`:\n  If `g=0`:\n    1. String `0^p 1` (`q=0`): `p` must be odd. Number of ways: 1 (if `n` is odd).\n    2. String `0^p 1 0^q` (`q > 0`): `p` must be even. Number of ways: `n` (for `q>0`, `p` from `0` to `n-1`).\n       Number of even `p` in `[0, n-1]` is `ceil(n/2)`.\n    Total for `g=0`: `(n%2==1 ? 1 : 0) + ceil(n/2)`.\n  If `g=1`:\n    1. String `0^p 1` (`q=0`): `p` must be even. Number of ways: 1 (if `n` is even).\n    2. String `0^p 1 0^q` (`q > 0`): `p` must be odd.

(String \"01\").\n    2. `q>0` is impossible for `n=1`.\n  Total `1`. Still not 2.\n\nThe strings are `01`, `10`.\n`01`: `p=1, q=0`. `n=1`. `p` is odd. Rule says `g=0`.\n`10`: `p=0, q=1`. `n=1`. `p` is even. Rule says `g=0`.\nThis implies my `V(0^p 1 0^q)` rules are `g=0` if `p` is odd or `p` is even. This is always `g=0`.\nThis means for `m=1`, `g` is always `0`.\nIf `m=1` and `g=1`, answer is `0`.\nIf `m=1` and `g=0`, answer is `n+1`.\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`. Answer `1+1=2`. This matches example!\n\nSo `m=1` logic:\n  If `g=0`: `n+1` strings.\n  If `g=1`: `0` strings.\n\nNow, `m > 1`.\nIf `g=1`, `n=2, m=2, g=1`. Output `0`.\nIf `g=0`, `n=2, m=2, g=0`. Output `4`.\nMy logic `V(0^p 1 X) = (p % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1` (for `X` non-empty) is still not working for `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n`0011`: `p=2` (even). `X=\"1\"`. `g=0`. (Matches)\n`0101`: `p=0` (even). `X=\"01\"`. `g=0`. (My rule says `0`, but `V(\"0101\")=1`)\n`0110`: `p=0` (even). `X=\"10\"`. `g=0`. (My rule says `0`, but `V(\"0110\")=1`)\n\nThis means `V(0^p 1 X)` is not simply dependent on `p` when `X` is complex.\nThe only case where `V(1X)` is not `0` is when `X` is empty.\nIf `m > 1`, then `X` can never be empty.\nSo `V(s_j ... s_k)` where `s_j=1` is always `0`.\nThis means if any `1` is not `s_1`, then `V(s_j ... s_k)=0`.\nIf `s_1=1`, `g=0`.\nIf `s_1=0, s_j=1` for `j>1`.\n`V(s_j ... s_k) = 0`.\n`V(s_{j-1} ... s_k) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`V(s_{j-2} ... s_k) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n`V(s_1 ... s_k) = 1` if `j-1` is odd. `0` if `j-1` is even.\nSo `g=1` if `j` is even. `g=0` if `j` is odd.\nThis is for `s_1=...=s_{j-1}=0, s_j=1, m \\ge 1`.\n\nSo for `m > 1`:\n  If `g=0`:\n    1. Strings starting `1`: `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n    2. Strings starting `0`: `s_1=0, s_2=0, ..., s_{j-1}=0, s_j=1`. `j` must be odd.\n       `p = j-1` is number of leading zeros. `p` must be even.\n       `p` from `0` to `n-1`. (Because `s_j=1` implies `j \\le n+m-1`, and `j-1 \\le n-1` is required for `s_j=1`).\n       Sum `C(n-p+m-1, m-1)` for even `p` from `0` to `n-1`.\n  If `g=1`:\n    1. Strings starting `1`: `0`.\n    2.

My logic counts them as `g=0`, but they are `g=1`.\n`p=0` (even). `j=1` (odd). Rule: `g=0`.\n`V(\"0101\") = 1`. `V(\"0110\") = 1`.\nThis means the rule for `j` is wrong.\n\nThe rule `V(s_j ... s_k)=0` if `s_j=1` is only true if `k > j`.\nIf `k=j`, `s_j=1` is the last character. `V(s_j)=1`.\nSo `V(s_j ... s_k)` is `0` if `s_j=1` and `j < k`.\nAnd `1` if `s_j=1` and `j=k`.\n\nLet `j` be the index of the first `1`.\nIf `j=k` (the last char is `1`): `s_k=1`. String is `0^n 1`. `m=1`. This is handled by `m=1` case.\nIf `j < k`: `s_j=1` and there are characters after it. So `V(s_j ... s_k) = f(1, V(s_{j+1} ... s_k)) = 0`.\nSo my derivation `V(s_1 ... s_k) = (j % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0` is correct.\n\nSo for `m > 1`:\n  The first `1` at index `j`.\n  `j` runs from `1` to `n+m-1` (because `s_k` cannot be `1` if `m>1` and `j=k`).\n  If `s_1=1` (`j=1`): `g=0`.\n  If `s_1=0` (`j>1`): `g=1` if `j` is even, `g=0` if `j` is odd.\n  This is the logic for `m > 1`.\n\nExample `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n`m > 1`. `g=0`.\n1.
