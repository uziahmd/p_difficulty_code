    "thought": "**Here's my thought process for tackling this competitive programming problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to find the smallest number of nodes (`n`) needed to create a special type of directed graph, and then maximize the \"unidirectional pairs\" within that smallest graph.  Let's break down the definitions and constraints.\n\nFirst, this \"p-reachable\" thing: it means we need exactly `p` pairs of nodes where you can get from one to the other *and* back (they're in the same strongly connected component or SCC), and the first node's label is smaller.  Since we're counting pairs where u < v, each SCC contributes to this count. The number of such pairs within an SCC of size `k` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. The objective then becomes finding different SCC sizes that add up to `p`, while minimizing `n` (the total nodes).\n\nThe unidirectional pairs are the tricky part.  They're pairs of nodes where there's a path one way, but not the other, and they must be *in* different SCCs. To have the *most* unidirectional pairs, we want the SCCs to be as separated as possible, like a long chain. That way, most pairs of nodes *between* SCCs will have unidirectional paths. I need to figure out what arrangement of SCCs maximizes that count.\n\nSo, I need to do some dynamic programming, I think.  `dp[x]` will store the *minimum* number of nodes to get `x` \"p-reachable\" pairs. The core idea is \"unbounded knapsack\": trying different SCC sizes (`k`) and seeing if adding one contributes to a new solution. The DP step will be: `dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - f(k)] + k)`. I'll use `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.  I can precalculate a `MAX_K` for how large `k` can be.\n\nNow, I'll update the DP state to store `min(sum(k_i^2))` to calculate unidirectional pairs. My logic is, if the goal is to create as many unidirectional pairs as possible, with minimum nodes, the `( (sum k_i)^2 - sum(k_i^2) ) / 2` will be maximized, by making `k_i` to be \"even\" as possible.\n\nThe core algorithm then looks like this: DP to find `n_min` for `p`, and then calculating the maximum number of unidirectional pairs based on the optimal SCC decomposition, with an updated DP storing `sum(k_i^2)`.\n\nAfter this, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs can be found by `(n_min^2 - min_sum_k_sq) / 2`. The tricky part will be handling the `p=0` edge case, where the minimum graph can consist of one node, in which case `p` is 0, and the answer is `0 0` because there aren't *any* unidirectional pairs when you have no pairs.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a directed graph that has exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n2. Among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes `n`, the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there is no path from `v` to `u`.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n**1. `p`-reachable condition:**\nNodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, say `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k`, then every pair `(s_i, s_j)` with `i \\neq j` is mutually reachable. The number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` from this SCC where `u < v` is the number of unordered pairs, which is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. Let `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nThe total number of `p`-reachable pairs in a graph is the sum of `f(k_i)` for all SCCs `C_i` of size `k_i`.\nWe need `sum(f(k_i)) = p`.\nThe total number of nodes in the graph is `n = sum(k_i)`. We want to minimize this `n`.\nNote that `f(1) = 0`, so SCCs of size 1 do not contribute to `p`.\n\nThis is a classic dynamic programming problem, similar to the unbounded knapsack problem.\nLet `dp[x]` be a pair `(min_n, min_sum_k_sq)`:\n- `min_n`: the minimum total number of nodes `sum(k_i)` from SCCs of size `k_i >= 2` to achieve `x` `p`-reachable pairs.\n- `min_sum_k_sq`: the minimum `sum(k_i^2)` corresponding to `min_n`.\n\nWe initialize `dp[0] = (0, 0)` and `dp[x] = (infinity, infinity)` for `x > 0`.\nWe iterate `k` from 2 upwards. For each `k`, `f(k)` is the number of pairs contributed by an SCC of size `k`.\nThe maximum `k` we need to consider is when `f(k)` exceeds `p`. For `p = 2 \\cdot 10^5`, `k` is roughly `sqrt(2p * 2) = sqrt(8 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 894`. More precisely, `k(k-1)/2 <= 2 \\cdot 10^5` implies `k \\approx 632`.\n\nThe DP transition is:\nFor `k` from 2 up to `MAX_K` (where `f(MAX_K) <= p`):\n  Let `val_k = f(k)`.\n  For `x` from `val_k` to `p`:\n    If `dp[x - val_k]` is reachable (i.e., `dp[x - val_k][0] != infinity`):\n      Let `prev_n, prev_sum_k_sq = dp[x - val_k]`.\n      `current_n = prev_n + k`.\n      `current_sum_k_sq = prev_sum_k_sq + k*k`.\n      If `current_n < dp[x][0]`:\n        `dp[x] = (current_n, current_sum_k_sq)`.\n      Else if `current_n == dp[x][0]`:\n        `dp[x] = (current_n, min(dp[x][1], current_sum_k_sq))`.\n\nAfter filling the `dp` table, `n_min = dp[p][0]` and `min_sum_k_sq = dp[p][1]`.\n\n**Edge case `p=0`:**\nIf `p=0`, `dp[0]` remains `(0, 0)`. The problem example output for `p=0` is `0 0`. This implies that a graph with 0 nodes is considered valid, and it has 0 `p`-reachable pairs and 0 unidirectional pairs. This is consistent with `dp[0] = (0,0)`.\n\n**2. Maximizing unidirectional pairs:**\nLet the minimum total number of nodes be `n_min` (obtained from `dp[p][0]`). Let the corresponding `sum(k_i^2)` be `min_sum_k_sq` (from `dp[p][1]`).\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we arrange the SCCs `C_1, C_2, ..., C_m` (with sizes `k_1, ..., k_m`) in a linear order, forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where there's a path from `C_i` to `C_j` if and only if `i < j`. For example, connect `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_m`.\nIn such a construction, for any `u` in `C_i` and `v` in `C_j`:\n- If `i = j`: `u` and `v` are mutually reachable (within the same SCC). They do not form a unidirectional pair.\n- If `i < j`: `u` can reach `v`, but `v` cannot reach `u`. Thus, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair. There are `k_i * k_j` such pairs.\n- If `i > j`: `v` can reach `u`, but `u` cannot reach `v`. Thus, `(v, u)` is a unidirectional pair, but `(u, v)` is not.\n\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs `(u, v)` (where `u \\in C_i`, `v \\in C_j`, `i < j`) is `sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} (k_i * k_j)`.\nThis sum can be expressed as `( (sum k_i)^2 - sum(k_i^2) ) / 2`.\nSubstituting `n_min` for `sum(k_i)` and `min_sum_k_sq` for `sum(k_i^2)`:\nThe maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(n_min^2 - min_sum_k_sq) / 2`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read `p`.\n2. Calculate `MAX_K`: the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) // 2 <= p`.\n3. Initialize `dp` table: `dp = [(float('inf'), float('inf'))] * (p + 1)`. Set `dp[0] = (0, 0)`.\n4. Iterate `k` from 2 to `MAX_K + 1`:\n   Let `val_k = k * (k - 1) // 2`.\n   Iterate `x` from `val_k` to `p`:\n     If `dp[x - val_k][0]` is not `float('inf')`:\n       `prev_n, prev_sum_k_sq = dp[x - val_k]`\n       `current_n = prev_n + k`\n       `current_sum_k_sq = prev_sum_k_sq + k*k`\n       If `current_n < dp[x][0]`:\n         `dp[x] = (current_n, current_sum_k_sq)`\n       Else if `current_n == dp[x][0]`:\n         `dp[x] = (current_n, min(dp[x][1], current_sum_k_sq))`\n5. `n_min = dp[p][0]`.\n6. `min_sum_k_sq = dp[p][1]`.\n7. `max_unidirectional_pairs = (n_min * n_min - min_sum_k_sq) // 2`.\n8. Print `n_min` and `max_unidirectional_pairs`.\n\nThe time complexity will be `O(p * MAX_K)`. Given `p <= 2 \\cdot 10^5` and `MAX_K \\approx 632`, this is `2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 632 \\approx 1.2 \\cdot 10^8` operations, which is acceptable for typical time limits in competitive programming. For Python, it's closer to `1.2 \\cdot 10^7` iterations of the inner loop, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Calculate MAX_K: the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p\n    max_k_val = 1\n    # We need k*(k-1)/2 to be <= p\n    # For k=1, f(1)=0.
