Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down.** The problem looks like a fun little exercise in computational number theory. We're given a starting string of digits, and then a series of \"replacement\" rules – each rule saying, \"anytime you see *this* digit, swap it out for *that* string.\" After all the substitutions, we need to calculate the value of the resulting string, modulo a large prime.  A naive, brute-force approach, simply executing the string replacements directly, would be far too slow. The length of the string would balloon out of control. We need a more elegant method.\n\nMy intuition says we should avoid building the full string. I'm thinking we can calculate the contribution each digit makes to the final value without ever needing to explicitly create it. Let's see...\n\nI realized that we can represent the value of the final number as the sum of each digit's value * 10^(some power). The power is the number of digits following that digit.  If we know what a digit *eventually* becomes and how long it eventually becomes, then we can calculate this. This hints at processing the queries in reverse.\n\nLet's use some arrays to store the current and the \"final\" state of each digit. `val[d]` will represent the value of digit `d` after current substitutions, and `len[d]` will represent the length of the string that `d` transforms into.  We'll initialize `val[d]` to be the digit itself, and `len[d]` to 1.  When a query comes in, we'll update the `val` and `len` for the digit being replaced, by considering what the digits inside the replacement string are. Crucially, the key is to ensure the update incorporates the most current, or *final*, values of the digits inside the replacement string.\n\nThe reverse order seems to be correct. This way, as we process each substitution, we're building on top of the \"final\" state of the digits that come later, avoiding any issues where earlier queries get 'stuck' with intermediate states.\n\nHere's the algorithm:\n*   **Initialization**: `val[d] = d`, `len[d] = 1` for all digits.\n*   **Reverse Query Processing**: Go through the queries in reverse order. For each query `di -> ti`, update `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the current (which will be ultimately \"final\") `val` and `len` of the digits inside `ti`.\n*   **Final Calculation**: Process the initial string character by character. For each digit in the input string, get its corresponding `val` and `len` after *all* the substitutions, and calculate the final result using the familiar positional number system formula.\n\nKey points to take note of are the modular arithmetic and exponentiation. Since the numbers can get very large, modular operations are necessary throughout to prevent overflow. In particular, we will use the `pow` function and calculate all exponentiation modulo `MOD`. The lengths are added modulo `MOD-1` since it is used as an exponent. The formula `10^X mod MOD` requires `X mod (MOD-1)` (Fermat's Little Theorem)\n\nI think this approach of applying the substitutions in reverse while keeping track of the final values and lengths, and making sure to handle the modulo operations throughout, should do the trick. Now it's time to code this up and see if it works!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string substitutions on an initial string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The length of the string `s` and the number of queries `n` can be up to 10^5. The sum of lengths of replacement strings `ti` can also be up to 10^5. A naive string substitution approach would be too slow because string lengths can grow exponentially.\n\nWe need a more efficient way to track the value and length of the numbers represented by digits after substitutions.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe substitutions are cascading. For example, if `2 -> 00` and later `0 -> 7`, then an original `2` effectively becomes `77`. This means that when a digit `d_i` is replaced by `t_i`, the digits within `t_i` themselves might be subject to further substitutions. This suggests that the final state of each digit (0-9) depends on all subsequent queries.\n\nThis dependency structure is a classic indicator for processing queries in reverse order.\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`. Since `MOD` is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem for modular exponentiation: `a^b % MOD = a^(b % (MOD - 1)) % MOD` for `a != 0`. The lengths of the substituted strings can be very large, so we need to take them modulo `MOD - 1` when used as exponents for powers of 10.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    For each digit `d` from 0 to 9, initialize:\n    *   `current_val[d] = d`: The numerical value of the string that `d` eventually becomes.\n    *   `current_len[d] = 1`: The length of the string that `d` eventually becomes.\n    (These represent the state *after all queries have been applied*).\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse Order:**\n    Iterate through the `n` queries from the last query (`n-1`) down to the first query (`0`).\n    For each query `Q_i: di -> ti`:\n    *   Let `di_int = int(di)`.\n    *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` in the replacement string `ti`:\n        *   Let `c_int = int(c)`.\n        *   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, current_len[c_int], MOD) + current_val[c_int]) % MOD`\n            This step calculates the value of the concatenated string. `pow(10, current_len[c_int], MOD)` gives `10` raised to the power of the length of the string represented by `c`.\n        *   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[c_int]) % (MOD - 1)`\n            This step calculates the total length of the concatenated string. We take modulo `MOD - 1` because this length will be used as an exponent.\n    *   After processing all characters in `ti`, update `current_val[di_int] = new_val_di` and `current_len[di_int] = new_len_di`.\n    *   **Special Case: Empty `ti`**: If `ti` is an empty string, the loop for `c` in `ti` will not run. `new_val_di` will remain `0`, and `new_len_di` will remain `0`. This correctly reflects that `di` is replaced by nothing (value 0, length 0).\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Result from Initial String `s`:**\n    *   Initialize `final_result = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `s_j` in the original input string `s`:\n        *   Let `d_int = int(s_j)`.\n        *   `final_result = (final_result * pow(10, current_len[d_int], MOD) + current_val[d_int]) % MOD`\n            This is the standard way to calculate the value of a number from its digits, but instead of `10` and `d_int`, we use `pow(10, current_len[d_int], MOD)` and `current_val[d_int]` which represent the final transformed value and length of `d_int`.\n\n4.  **Handle Edge Cases (Implicitly Handled):**\n    *   **Leading Zeros:** The calculation `(A * 10^L + B) % MOD` naturally handles leading zeros. For example, if `s_j` becomes `0` (value 0, length 1), `final_result` will not change if it's currently 0. If `s = \"007\"`, the algorithm correctly yields `7`.\n    *   **Empty String:** If the final string `s` effectively becomes empty (e.g., all digits are replaced by empty strings), then `current_len[d]` will be 0 for all `d`s that appear in `s`. In this case, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is `1`. If `current_val[d]` is also 0 (which it would be for an empty string), `final_result` will remain `0`. This matches the problem statement that an empty string represents the number zero.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Initialization:** O(1) for 10 digits.\n*   **Processing Queries:** `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The sum of lengths of `ti` for all queries is `L_total <= 10^5`. So this step is O(`L_total`).\n*   **Processing Initial String:** Iterate through `s`. Length of `s` is `|s| <= 10^5`. So this step is O(`|s|`).\n*   `pow` operation: `pow(base, exp, mod)` takes `O(log(exp))` time. Here `exp` is `current_len[c_int]`, which can be up to `MOD-2`. So it's `O(log(MOD))`.\n*   Total time complexity: O(`L_total` * `log(MOD)` + `|s|` * `log(MOD)`). Given the constraints, this is efficient enough. `10^5 * log(10^9) approx 10^5 * 30`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_char, t))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 # For exponents in pow(10, L, MOD)\n\n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value of the string that digit d eventually becomes\n    # current_len[d] stores the length of the string that digit d eventually becomes\n    # These are initialized for the state *after all queries*\n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t = queries[i]\n        di_int = int(d_char)\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n\n        if not t: # If replacement string is empty\n            # Value remains 0, length remains 0\n            current_val[di_int] = 0\n            current_len[di_int] = 0\n            continue\n\n        # Calculate the value and length for di based on its replacement string t\n        # and the already computed final values/lengths of digits within t\n        for char_c in t:\n            c_int = int(char_c)\n            \n            # The value of the new string is (existing_value * 10^length_of_c + value_of_c) % MOD\n            # The length of the new string is (existing_length + length_of_c) % MOD_EXP\n            \n            # pow(10, current_len[c_int], MOD) calculates 10^(length of c's final string) % MOD\n            # current_len[c_int] is already modulo MOD_EXP\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, current_len[c_int], MOD) + current_val[c_int]) % MOD\n            new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[c_int]) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        current_val[di_int] = new_val_di\n        current_len[di_int] = new_len_di\n\n    # Calculate the final result from the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n    for char_s in s:\n        d_int = int(char_s)\n        # The final number is built by concatenating the transformed strings for each digit in s\n        # (existing_final_result * 10^length_of_d + value_of_d) % MOD\n        final_result = (final_result * pow(10, current_len[d_int], MOD) + current_val[d_int]) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
