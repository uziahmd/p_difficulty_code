A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's a classic resource constraint scenario. I see I'm given `n` friends, and some resources: bottles, limes, and salt. Each friend needs a specific amount of drink, lime, and salt for each toast. The goal is to maximize the number of toasts, *assuming everyone shares equally*.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down resource by resource.  I need to figure out how many toasts are *possible* based on each resource individually, and then determine the limiting factor.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total of each resource: total drink from bottles, total lime slices, and total salt. Then, I'll calculate the *individual* toasts I can make from each resource:\n\n*   **Drink:** Total drink available divided by the drink needed per friend for one toast, multiplied by the number of friends.\n*   **Limes:** Total lime slices available divided by the slices needed per friend for one toast, multiplied by the number of friends.\n*   **Salt:** Total salt available divided by the salt needed per friend for one toast, multiplied by the number of friends.\n\nI'm using integer division here because I can't have partial toasts.\n\nThe *minimum* number of toasts calculated from these three is the real constraint. I can't make more toasts than the *least* abundant resource allows. That gives me the `total_individual_toasts`.\n\nSince I want to maximize toasts *equally* among the friends, I'll divide the `total_individual_toasts` by the number of friends `n` to get the `toasts_per_friend`. That's the answer. I'm going to ensure that I am using integer division at the final step, too.\n\nI should also run the sample input to ensure that the code is working as expected.\n",
