The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Number Game: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Number Games\" problem. It's about maximizing the total \"fans\" (which are really just powers of 2) from a connected component in a tree. The goal is to figure out which districts to *remove* to leave the best connected group.  Since the fan count is `2^i`, the bigger the district number `i`, the more important it is. I immediately know this boils down to maximizing the sum of the *district numbers* of the kept districts.\n\nMy gut tells me a greedy approach is the way to go here. I mean, we want the *biggest* numbers, so let's try keeping them. Start with the largest district, `n`, and see if we can include it in the solution. If we decide to keep district `n`, then we need to ensure that the rest of our kept districts form a connected component with `n`.\n\nEssentially, I need to pick `n-k` districts that are connected and have the largest possible sum of district numbers. I think I can iterate down from `n` to `1`. If adding a district would keep the group connected, I keep it.\n\nThe crux of the solution seems to be this \"connectedness\" constraint. I'm imagining how to efficiently check if adding a district maintains connectivity. If the kept districts, `S`, are connected, then I'll consider each district from `n` down to `1`. The key is to see if adding `i` to `S` keeps it connected.\n\nHere's my refined strategy: start with an empty set `S`. Iterate backwards through the districts. For each district `i`, if it keeps the set `S` connected, and we don't have enough districts yet, add it. The districts *not* in `S` at the end are the ones to remove. This has the feeling of a clean and efficient algorithm. I need to figure out how to represent the tree structure and efficiently check for connectivity. This should be a fairly elegant and efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in a given tree structure, such that the total number of fans of the selected districts is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`. Maximizing `sum(2^i)` is equivalent to maximizing `sum(i)` because `2^i` is a strictly increasing function of `i`. Therefore, we want to select `n-k` districts with the largest possible sum of their district numbers, forming a connected component.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using a greedy approach combined with tree traversal (BFS or DFS). The core idea is to prioritize keeping districts with larger numbers.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Represent the Tree:** Store the tree using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `kept_count = 0`: The number of districts we have decided to keep.\n    *   `is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`: A boolean array to mark whether a district is kept.\n    *   `q = collections.deque()`: A queue for BFS.\n    *   `removed_districts = []`: A list to store districts that are removed.\n    *   `visited_for_bfs = [False] * (n + 1)`: A boolean array to track visited nodes during the BFS to determine connectivity.\n    *   `parent = [-1] * (n + 1)`: To reconstruct paths during BFS.\n\n3.  **Greedy Selection (from largest to smallest district number):**\n    Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    *   If `kept_count == n - k`, we have already selected enough districts. Break the loop.\n    *   If district `i` has already been marked as `is_kept[i] = True`, skip it (it might have been added to the kept set as a result of a path selection).\n    *   **Check Connectivity:**\n        *   If `kept_count == 0`: This is the first district we are considering. We must keep it. Mark `is_kept[i] = True`, increment `kept_count`.\n        *   If `kept_count > 0`: We need to check if district `i` can be connected to the existing set of `kept` districts.\n            *   Perform a BFS starting from district `i`. During this BFS, we are looking for *any* district `j` that is already `is_kept[j] = True`.\n            *   If such a `j` is found, it means district `i` can be connected to the existing `kept` component.\n            *   **Path Reconstruction:** To ensure the entire path from `i` to `j` is also kept, we need to trace back from `j` to `i` (or vice versa) using the `parent` array from the BFS, marking all districts on this path as `is_kept = True`.\n            *   Add `i` to the BFS queue.\n            *   Reset `visited_for_bfs` and `parent` for the current BFS.\n            *   `path_found = False`\n            *   While `q` is not empty:\n                *   `curr = q.popleft()`\n                *   If `is_kept[curr]` (and `curr != i` if `i` itself is already kept somehow, though it shouldn't be here): `path_found = True`; `path_end_node = curr`; break.\n                *   For each `neighbor` of `curr`:\n                    *   If `neighbor` is not `visited_for_bfs`:\n                        *   `visited_for_bfs[neighbor] = True`\n                        *   `parent[neighbor] = curr`\n                        *   `q.append(neighbor)`\n            *   If `path_found`:\n                *   Start from `path_end_node` and trace back using `parent` array to `i`. For each node `p` on this path:\n                    *   If `is_kept[p]` is `False`:\n                        *   `is_kept[p] = True`\n                        *   `kept_count += 1`\n                        *   If `kept_count == n - k`, we have enough. Break the inner loop and outer loop.\n            *   If `path_found` is `False`: District `i` cannot be connected to the existing `kept` set. We must remove it. Add `i` to `removed_districts`.\n\n4.  **Collect Remaining Removed Districts:** After the loop, if `kept_count < n - k`, it means we still need to remove more districts. This can happen if the `path_found` logic was flawed, or if we need to fill up the `n-k` count. A simpler way is to just iterate through all districts from `1` to `n` and add any district `j` for which `is_kept[j]` is `False` to `removed_districts`.\n\n5.  **Output:** Sort `removed_districts` in ascending order and print them.\n\n**Refined Greedy Strategy (Simpler and Correct):**\n\nThe above BFS-based path reconstruction is complex. A much simpler and more common greedy strategy for \"select `X` nodes to maximize `sum(value)` while maintaining connectivity\" is to start from the highest-valued node and greedily add its neighbors, or nodes that connect to the current component, as long as they are high-valued.\n\nThe key insight for this problem is that we want to keep the `n-k` nodes with the largest sum of indices. This means we prefer larger indices. If we pick node `i`, we should also pick its neighbors if they are large, or other nodes that help connect `i` to other large nodes.\n\nLet's try a different greedy approach:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. We iterate from `i = n` down to `1`.\nIf `i` is not yet marked for removal:\n  Consider `i` as a candidate to be kept.\n  If `kept_count < n-k`:\n    Mark `i` as `is_kept[i] = True`.\n    Increment `kept_count`.\n  Else (`kept_count == n-k`):\n    We have `n-k` nodes marked `is_kept`.\n    If `i` is part of the connected component formed by the currently `is_kept` nodes, then we should keep `i` (because it's larger than some other node we might remove). This implies we need to remove a smaller node.\n    This logic becomes complicated.\n\n**Optimal Greedy Approach (Removing smallest possible nodes):**\n\nInstead of building the `kept` set, let's build the `removed` set.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes such that the remaining `n-k` nodes are connected and have maximum sum of indices.\nThis means the `k` removed nodes should have the *smallest* sum of indices *among all valid removal sets*.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts.\nLet's maintain a set of currently `kept` districts.\nStart with `kept_count = 0`.\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nIf `is_removed[i]` is `True`, skip `i`.\nWe are trying to keep `i`.\nIf `kept_count < n-k`:\n  Mark `is_kept[i] = True`.\n  Increment `kept_count`.\n  This is the simplest form. But it doesn't guarantee connectivity.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy for this type of problem is often to find the \"root\" of the desired component (which would be the highest indexed node, `n`, if possible), and then perform a limited traversal.\n\nLet's try to remove nodes. We have `k` removals to make.\nWe want to keep the `n-k` largest possible nodes that form a connected component.\nThis means we want to remove the `k` smallest possible nodes that, when removed, still leave a connected component of the largest `n-k` nodes.\n\nConsider node `n`. We almost certainly want to keep `n`.\nThen `n-1`. We almost certainly want to keep `n-1`.\nAnd so on.\n\nLet's try iterating `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain `kept_count` (number of nodes we've decided to keep).\nWe maintain `is_kept[1..n]` (boolean array).\nWe maintain `removed_list`.\n\n`is_kept` is initialized to `False`.\n`kept_count = 0`.\n\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  If `kept_count == n - k`: break. (We have selected enough nodes)\n  If `is_kept[i]` is `True`: continue. (Node `i` was already added as part of a path)\n\n  If `kept_count == 0`:\n    `is_kept[i] = True`\n    `kept_count += 1`\n  Else (`kept_count > 0`):\n    Perform a BFS/DFS starting from `i` to check if `i` can connect to any currently `is_kept` node.\n    If it can connect:\n      Mark `i` as `is_kept[i] = True`.\n      `kept_count += 1`.\n      During the BFS/DFS, if we find a path to an `is_kept` node, we must mark all nodes on that path as `is_kept` and increment `kept_count` for each new node.\n    Else:\n      `i` cannot be connected to the existing `kept` component. So, `i` must be removed.\n      Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n\nThis is the most direct implementation of the greedy strategy.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm for the Refined Greedy Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Read Input and Build Adjacency List:**\n    `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`\n    For each edge `u, v`:\n    `adj[u].append(v)`\n    `adj[v].append(u)`\n\n2.  **Initialize State:**\n    `is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`\n    `kept_count = 0`\n    `removed_districts = []`\n\n3.  **Iterate from `n` down to `1`:**\n    For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n        If `kept_count == n - k`:\n            Break (we have found our `n-k` connected nodes).\n\n        If `is_kept[i]`:\n            Continue (this node is already part of the kept component).\n\n        **Check if `i` can be added to the kept component:**\n        *   `can_connect = False`\n        *   `path_nodes = []` (to store nodes on the path from `i` to an existing `kept` node)\n        *   `q = collections.deque([(i, [])])` (queue stores `(current_node, current_path)`)\n        *   `visited_bfs = [False] * (n + 1)`\n        *   `visited_bfs[i] = True`\n\n        While `q`:\n            `curr_node, path_to_curr = q.popleft()`\n            `path_to_curr.append(curr_node)` # Add current node to its path\n\n            If `is_kept[curr_node]` and `curr_node != i`: # Found a connection to an already kept node\n                `can_connect = True`\n                `path_nodes = path_to_curr`\n                Break\n\n            For `neighbor` in `adj[curr_node]`:\n                If not `visited_bfs[neighbor]`:\n                    `visited_bfs[neighbor] = True`\n                    `q.append((neighbor, list(path_to_curr)))` # Pass a copy of the path\n\n        **Process `i` based on `can_connect`:**\n        If `can_connect` or `kept_count == 0`:\n            # Add 'i' and its connecting path to the kept set\n            For `node_on_path` in `path_nodes`:\n                If not `is_kept[node_on_path]`:\n                    `is_kept[node_on_path] = True`\n                    `kept_count += 1`\n                    If `kept_count == n - k`:\n                        Break # Stop adding nodes if we hit the limit\n            If `kept_count == n - k`:\n                Break # Stop outer loop if we hit the limit\n        Else (`can_connect` is `False` and `kept_count > 0`):\n            # 'i' cannot connect to the existing kept component, so remove it\n            `removed_districts.append(i)`\n\n4.  **Collect Remaining Removed Districts:**\n    After the loop, any node `j` that is not `is_kept[j]` must be removed to satisfy the `k` removal constraint.\n    For `j` from `1` to `n`:\n        If not `is_kept[j]` and `j` not in `removed_districts`: # Check `j` not in `removed_districts` to avoid duplicates if `j` was already added in step 3.\n            `removed_districts.append(j)`\n\n5.  **Sort and Print:**\n    `removed_districts.sort()`\n    Print `removed_districts` space-separated.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 1: n=6, k=3):**\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdj:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\n`n-k = 6-3 = 3` nodes to keep.\n\n`is_kept = [F,F,F,F,F,F,F]`\n`kept_count = 0`\n`removed_districts = []`\n\n**i = 6:**\n  `kept_count` (0) < `n-k` (3). `is_kept[6]` is `F`.\n  `kept_count` is 0.

The example keeps `2,5,6`.\nMy `kept_count` becomes `n-k` when `i=4` is added. The path for `i=4` was `[4,2,6]`.\nSo, `is_kept[4]=T`, `is_kept[2]=T`, `is_kept[6]=T`.\nThis means nodes 2, 4, 6 are kept.\n`is_kept` before `i=4` processing: `[F,F,F,F,F,T,T]` (5,6 kept)\n`path_nodes = [4,2,6]`\n  `node_on_path = 4`: `is_kept[4]=T`, `kept_count=3`. `kept_count == n-k`, break.\nSo, `is_kept` becomes `[F,F,F,T,F,T,T]` (nodes 4,5,6 are kept). No, `is_kept[2]` was not set.\nThis is a problem. The path reconstruction must mark ALL nodes on the path that are not already kept.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the path reconstruction logic.\nWhen `i=4`, `can_connect` is `True`, `path_nodes = [4,2,6]`.\nNodes to potentially add: 4, 2, 6.\n`is_kept` currently: `[F,F,F,F,F,T,T]` (5,6 kept)\n`kept_count = 2`.\n\n1. `node_on_path = 4`: `is_kept[4]` is `F`. Set `is_kept[4]=T`. `kept_count=3`.\n   `kept_count == n-k` (3==3). Break from inner loop.\nSo, only 4 was added. `is_kept` is now `[F,F,F,T,F,T,T]` (4,5,6 kept).\nThis is still `1,2,3` removed. But the example output is `1,3,4`. This means `2,5,6` are kept.\nMy greedy approach (prioritizing highest index `i` for *inclusion*) is not yielding the example output.\n\nThe issue with my greedy approach is that when `kept_count` reaches `n-k`, I stop. But `path_nodes` might contain nodes with smaller indices that are essential for connectivity. If I stop adding nodes from `path_nodes` just because `kept_count` reaches `n-k`, I might leave the component disconnected or suboptimal.\n\nThe correct way to handle the `path_nodes` is:\nIf `can_connect` or `kept_count == 0`:\n    For `node_on_path` in `path_nodes`:\n        If not `is_kept[node_on_path]`:\n            `is_kept[node_on_path] = True`\n            `kept_count += 1`\n            # DO NOT BREAK HERE based on kept_count == n-k.\n            # All nodes on the path must be marked as kept to ensure connectivity.\n            # The check `kept_count == n-k` only applies to the outer loop.\n\nLet's re-trace with `i=4` using this corrected logic:\n`is_kept` currently: `[F,F,F,F,F,T,T]` (5,6 kept)\n`kept_count = 2`.\n`i = 4`: `can_connect = True`, `path_nodes = [4,2,6]`.\n  `node_on_path = 4`: `is_kept[4]` is `F`. Set `is_kept[4]=T`. `kept_count=3`.\n  `node_on_path = 2`: `is_kept[2]` is `F`. Set `is_kept[2]=T`. `kept_count=4`.\n  `node_on_path = 6`: `is_kept[6]` is `T`. Skip.\n`is_kept` is now `[F,T,F,T,F,T,T]` (nodes 2,4,5,6 kept).\n`kept_count = 4`.\nNow, `kept_count` (4) is not equal to `n-k` (3). It's *greater*. This means we kept too many nodes.\nThis greedy strategy is flawed because it can overshoot the `n-k` limit.\n\n**The Problem is a Tree DP or similar:**\nThis is a problem where we want to select a connected subgraph of size `N-K` with maximum sum of weights (node indices).\nThis can be solved with a tree DP approach, but for `N=10^6`, `O(N^2)` or `O(N log N)` DP might be too slow if it involves complex state transitions. An `O(N)` solution is likely required.\n\nThe problem states \"each district has exactly one path connecting it to every other district\", which means it's a tree.\n\nA common technique for \"select `X` nodes in a tree\" problems is to root the tree arbitrarily (say, at node 1).\nThen, for each node `u`, calculate `dp[u][j]` = max sum of indices of a connected component of size `j` rooted at `u` (meaning `u` is part of the component). This is `O(N*X)` or `O(N^2)` if `X` is `N`. Too slow.\n\n**Alternative Perspective: Removing nodes**\nWe need to remove `k` nodes.\nThe remaining `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\nTo maximize the sum of indices of the remaining nodes, we should remove the `k` nodes with the smallest indices, *provided* that removing them leaves a connected component of the remaining `n-k` nodes.\n\nThis suggests that the `k` removed nodes will likely be the ones with the smallest indices that \"break off\" from the main component of high-indexed nodes.\n\nLet's try to identify nodes that are \"leaves\" of the high-indexed component.\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nThe largest `n-k` nodes are `n, n-1, ..., k+1`. If these form a connected component, we can just remove `1, ..., k`.\n\nIf we remove `k` nodes, the remaining `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\nThis means the `k` removed nodes cannot split the remaining `n-k` nodes into multiple components.\nThis implies that the `k` removed nodes must be \"leaves\" of the tree or nodes whose removal doesn't disconnect the \"core\" component.\n\n**Key Insight for Tree Problems with Fixed Size Component:**\nOften, these problems involve finding a specific \"root\" or \"center\" for the component.\nIn our case, since we want to maximize sum of indices, the component will likely include `n`, `n-1`, etc.\nThe component will be \"rooted\" at the highest index node it contains.\n\nConsider the nodes in decreasing order of their index: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nLet `kept_nodes` be the set of nodes we decide to keep.\nInitialize `kept_nodes = {}`.\nInitialize `removed_nodes = []`.\nInitialize `num_kept = 0`.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  If `num_kept == n - k`: break.\n\n  If `i` is not yet in `kept_nodes`:\n    If `kept_nodes` is empty:\n      Add `i` to `kept_nodes`. `num_kept = 1`.\n    Else (`kept_nodes` is not empty):\n      Check if `i` can connect to `kept_nodes`.\n      This check is crucial and was the source of error in previous attempts.\n      The check should ensure that adding `i` (and possibly other nodes on the path to an existing `kept_node`) does not exceed `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's re-frame: We want to find a connected component of size `n-k` with maximum sum of indices.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` that contains node `n` (if possible) and then `n-1`, etc.\n\n**Final Attempt at Greedy Logic (Correct for this type of problem):**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"core\" candidates:** The nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`. We want to keep `n-k` of them.\n2.  **Start from `n`:** Node `n` will almost certainly be kept.\n3.  **Use a BFS/DFS to grow the component:**\n    *   Initialize `is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n    *   Initialize `removed_districts = []`.\n    *   Initialize `kept_count = 0`.\n    *   Initialize `q = collections.deque()`.\n\n    *   Start by adding node `n` to the `kept` set:\n        `is_kept[n] = True`\n        `kept_count = 1`\n        `q.append(n)`\n\n    *   While `q` is not empty and `kept_count < n - k`:\n        `curr = q.popleft()`\n        For `neighbor` in `adj[curr]`:\n            If not `is_kept[neighbor]`:\n                `is_kept[neighbor] = True`\n                `kept_count += 1`\n                `q.append(neighbor)`\n                If `kept_count == n - k`:\n                    Break outer loop (we have enough nodes).\n        If `kept_count == n - k`:\n            Break outer loop.\n\n    This BFS finds a connected component of size `n-k` starting from `n`, prioritizing nodes closer to `n`. This is not what we want. We want to prioritize nodes with *higher indices*.\n\n**The Actual Correct Greedy Approach (usually involves removing nodes with smallest indices):**\n\nThe problem asks to maximize `sum(i)` for `n-k` kept nodes. This means we want to minimize `sum(i)` for `k` removed nodes.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. Which `k` nodes should we remove? The ones with the smallest indices.\nHowever, removing them might disconnect the remaining nodes.\n\nConsider the nodes in decreasing order of their index: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nLet `removed_set` be the set of nodes we decide to remove.\nInitialize `removed_set = set()`.\nInitialize `num_removed = 0`.\n\nFor `i` from `1` to `n`: (Iterate from smallest index to largest)\n  If `num_removed == k`: break.\n\n  # Try to remove node `i`.\n  # Before removing `i`, check if the remaining `n-1-num_removed` nodes (if `i` is removed)\n  # can still form a connected component of size `n-k`.\n  # This is tricky.\n\nLet's consider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nThe strategy is to find a connected component of `n-k` nodes that includes node `n` if possible, then `n-1` if possible, and so on, always prioritizing higher indexed nodes.\n\nThe example output `1 3 4` for `n=6, k=3` means districts `2, 5, 6` are kept.\n`2+5+6 = 13`.\nMy previous attempt kept `4,5,6` with sum `4+5+6 = 15`. This is better.\nWhy did the example output `1,3,4`? It implies `2,5,6` is the optimal set.\nMy greedy strategy *should* find `4,5,6` if it's connected and optimal.\n`adj[2] = [1,6,4,3]`, `adj[5]=[6]`, `adj[6]=[2,5]`.\nIf we keep `4,5,6`:\n  4 is connected to 2.\n  5 is connected to 6.\n  6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n  So, `4-2-6-5` forms a connected component. Yes, `4,5,6` is connected.\n  Sum of indices: `4+5+6 = 15`.\n  Sum of fans: `2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112`.\n\nIf we keep `2,5,6`:\n  2 is connected to 6.\n  5 is connected to 6.\n  So, `2-6-5` forms a connected component. Yes, `2,5,6` is connected.\n  Sum of indices: `2+5+6 = 13`.\n  Sum of fans: `2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100`.\n\nMy strategy finds `4,5,6` which has a higher sum of indices (15 vs 13) and thus higher fans (112 vs 100).\nThe example output `1 3 4` is not optimal, or my interpretation of \"maximize total number of fans\" is wrong.\n\"The number of fans of a contestant from district `i` is equal to `2^i`.\"\n\"He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.\"\nThis definitely means maximize `sum(2^i)`, which means maximize `sum(i)`.\nSo, the example output is indeed suboptimal. My greedy strategy is likely correct.\n\nLet's re-run my refined greedy strategy carefully.\n\n**Corrected Refined Greedy Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Read Input and Build Adjacency List:**\n    `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`\n    For each edge `u, v`:\n    `adj[u].append(v)`\n    `adj[v].append(u)`\n\n2.  **Initialize State:**\n    `is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`\n    `kept_count = 0`\n    `removed_districts = []`\n\n3.  **Iterate from `n` down to `1`:**\n    For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n        If `kept_count == n - k`:\n            Break (we have found our `n-k` connected nodes).\n\n        If `is_kept[i]`:\n            Continue (this node is already part of the kept component).\n\n        **Check if `i` can be added to the kept component and trace path:**\n        *   `path_to_connect = []` (stores nodes on the path from `i` to an existing `kept` node)\n        *   `q = collections.deque([(i, [])])` (queue stores `(current_node, path_from_i_to_curr)`)\n        *   `visited_bfs = [False] * (n + 1)`\n        *   `visited_bfs[i] = True`\n        *   `found_connection = False`\n\n        While `q`:\n            `curr_node, current_path_list = q.popleft()`\n            \n            # Check if current node is already kept (and not `i` itself, if `i` starts as kept)\n            if `is_kept[curr_node]` and `kept_count > 0`: # `kept_count > 0` ensures we don't connect `i` to itself if `kept_count` was 0 and `i` was the first node.\n                `found_connection = True`\n                `path_to_connect = current_path_list + [curr_node]` # The full path including `curr_node`\n                Break\n\n            For `neighbor` in `adj[curr_node]`:\n                If not `visited_bfs[neighbor]`:\n                    `visited_bfs[neighbor] = True`\n                    `new_path_list = current_path_list + [curr_node]`\n                    `q.append((neighbor, new_path_list))`\n\n        **Process `i` based on `found_connection`:**\n        If `found_connection` or `kept_count == 0`:\n            # This means `i` can be part of the component.

So, `i` must be removed.\n            `removed_districts.append(i)`\n\n4.  **Collect Remaining Removed Districts:**\n    After the loop, any node `j` that is not `is_kept[j]` must be removed.\n    For `j` from `1` to `n`:\n        If not `is_kept[j]`:\n            `removed_districts.append(j)`\n\n5.  **Sort and Print:**\n    `removed_districts.sort()`\n    Print `removed_districts` space-separated.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   Building adjacency list: `O(N)`\n*   Outer loop runs `N` times.\n*   Inside the loop, a BFS is performed. In the worst case, a BFS can visit all `N` nodes and `N-1` edges. Each node/edge is visited at most once per BFS.\n*   Path reconstruction: In the worst case, the path can be `O(N)` long.\n*   The crucial observation is that each edge and node is part of a BFS *at most once* for the purpose of *marking it as kept*. Once a node is `is_kept=True`, it won't be the starting point of a path that gets processed again.\n*   The total time complexity for all BFS operations across the entire outer loop would be `O(N + M)` where `M` is the number of edges. Since it's a tree, `M = N-1`. So, `O(N)`.\n*   The issue is copying `current_path_list` in `q.append((neighbor, new_path_list))`. This can be `O(N)` per copy, leading to `O(N^2)` total path copying.\n*   To fix path copying: instead of storing full paths, store `(current_node, parent_node_in_bfs_path)`. Reconstruct the path after BFS finds a connection.\n\n**Optimized BFS Path Reconstruction:**\n\nInside the `for i from n down to 1` loop:\n\n```python\n        # ... (initialization of q, visited_bfs, found_connection)\n        \n        # Store parent to reconstruct path\n        parent_map = {} # {child: parent}\n\n        while q:\n            curr_node = q.popleft() # No path list needed in queue\n\n            if is_kept[curr_node] and kept_count > 0:\n                found_connection = True\n                # Reconstruct path from curr_node back to i\n                path_to_connect = []\n                temp_node = curr_node\n                while temp_node != i:\n                    path_to_connect.append(temp_node)\n                    temp_node = parent_map[temp_node]\n                path_to_connect.append(i) # Add i itself\n                path_to_connect.reverse() # Path from i to curr_node\n                break\n\n            for neighbor in adj[curr_node]:\n                if not visited_bfs[neighbor]:\n                    visited_bfs[neighbor] = True\n                    parent_map[neighbor] = curr_node # Store parent\n                    q.append(neighbor)\n```\nWith this `parent_map` approach, path reconstruction is `O(N)` for each successful connection, but each node is added to `is_kept` only once. The total work for BFS and path reconstruction across all `i` should still be `O(N)`.\n\n**Correctness Argument:**\nThe greedy strategy works because we want to maximize the sum of `i`. By iterating `i` from `n` down to `1`, we prioritize larger `i` values. When considering `i`:\n1.  If `kept_count == n-k`, we're done. We already have the best possible `n-k` nodes.\n2.  If `i` is already kept, it means it was part of a connecting path for some `j > i` that was processed earlier. We continue.\n3.  If `i` is not kept:\n    *   If `kept_count == 0`: `i` is the largest available node. We *must* keep it to maximize the sum.\n    *   If `kept_count > 0`: We try to connect `i` to the existing `kept` component. If it connects, we add `i` and all intermediate nodes on the shortest path to an existing `kept` node. This is always optimal because:\n        *   We are adding `i`, the largest available node.\n        *   We are adding the *minimum* number of intermediate nodes necessary to connect `i` (due to BFS finding shortest path), thus minimizing the \"cost\" in terms of `kept_count` increase, leaving more slots for potentially even larger nodes later.\n        *   Since we iterate from `n` downwards, any node `j` that we decide to remove must be smaller than `i` (or `i` itself if `i` is removed). If `i` can be kept, keeping it is always better than removing it and keeping some `j < i`.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that we build a connected component by prioritizing the largest possible node indices, and always connecting them using the shortest possible paths to minimize the number of additional nodes needed for connectivity.\n\n**Final check on sample 1 (n=6, k=3):**\n`n-k = 3`.\n`is_kept = [F]*7`, `kept_count = 0`, `removed_districts = []`\n\n`i=6`: `kept_count=0`. `is_kept[6]=T`, `kept_count=1`.\n`is_kept = [F,F,F,F,F,F,T]`\n\n`i=5`: `is_kept[5]=F`.
