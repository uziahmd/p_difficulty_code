Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Regular Polygon Angle Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the best angle within a regular n-gon that matches a target angle 'a'. It's all about finding three vertices, v1, v2, and v3, where the angle formed at v2 is as close as possible to 'a'.\n\nThe key here is understanding the geometry. All the vertices lie on a circle, and the angle we're interested in is an inscribed angle.  That means the angle is directly related to the arc it subtends.  Each side of this n-gon represents an arc, and all these arcs are equal.  So, the central angle for each arc is 360/n degrees, let's call that `theta_unit`.\n\nInitially, I thought about fixing v2 and then calculating arcs based on vertex numbering. But that got messy quickly.  Trying to account for whether i and j are on the same side or opposite sides of the fixed vertex got to be cumbersome.\n\nLet's simplify.  Fix vertex v2 as 1. Then we just need to find two other vertices, let's call them `i` and `j` (where `i < j`), to form the angle `i-1-j`. Since we're working with a regular n-gon, the central angle formed by going from i to j (not including 1) is simply the number of \"steps\" or edges between those vertices, call that `k = j - i`, multiplied by `theta_unit`. The angle `i-1-j` at v2 is half of that central angle. So, the angle is just `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * (180/n)`.\n\nNow, `k` represents the number of vertices we step over when moving from vertex `i` to `j` along the circle. Given that the vertices are distinct, and `v2` is 1, `k` can range from 1 to `n-2`.\nSo my possible angles become multiples of `180/n`. \nLet's call `180/n` our `base_angle`.\nThe possible angles are then `base_angle, 2 * base_angle, ... , (n-2) * base_angle`.\n\nNow it's a matter of finding which `k` gives an angle `k * base_angle` that's closest to the target angle 'a'. I just need to find the `k` that minimizes the absolute difference `|k * base_angle - a|`.  The vertices can be reconstructed from the `k`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed by them, with v2 as the vertex, is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertex indices.\n\nLet's analyze the possible angles in a regular n-gon.\nAll vertices of a regular n-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 (with v2 as the vertex) is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nLet's fix vertex v2 to be vertex 1. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\nThe other two vertices, v1 and v3, must be distinct from v2 and from each other.\nLet's choose v1 to be vertex 2.\nThen v3 can be any vertex from 3 to n.\nIf v3 is vertex `k` (where `3 <= k <= n`), the angle formed is `2-1-k`.\nThe arc subtended by this angle is the arc from vertex 2 to vertex `k` (not passing through vertex 1).\nThe number of edges in this arc is `k - 2`.\nEach edge of a regular n-gon subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nSo, an arc spanning `m` edges subtends a central angle of `m * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle is half of this central angle.\nTherefore, the angle `2-1-k` is `(k - 2) * (360/n) / 2 = (k - 2) * (180/n)`.\n\nLet `m = k - 2`. Since `3 <= k <= n`, `m` can range from `1` (when `k=3`) to `n-2` (when `k=n`).\nSo, the possible angles that can be formed by fixing v2=1 and v1=2 are `m * (180/n)` for `m = 1, 2, ..., n-2`.\nThese are all the possible distinct angle values that can be formed by any three vertices in a regular n-gon.\nFor any choice of v2, say vertex `i`, we can always rotate the polygon such that `i` becomes vertex 1. Then we can choose v1 to be `i+1` (or `(i % n) + 1`) and v3 to be `i+1+m` (or `((i+m) % n) + 1`), giving the angle `m * (180/n)`.\n\nOur goal is to find `m` (where `1 <= m <= n-2`) such that `|m * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `angle_unit = 180/n`. The possible angles are `m * angle_unit`.\nWe want to find `m` such that `m * angle_unit` is closest to `a`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `m` such that `m` is closest to `a / angle_unit`.\nLet `target_m_float = a / angle_unit`.\nThe integer `m` closest to `target_m_float` would be `round(target_m_float)`.\nHowever, `m` must be within the range `[1, n-2]`.\nSo, we calculate `m_candidate = round(target_m_float)`.\nThen we clamp `m_candidate` to the valid range:\n`m_optimal = max(1, min(n - 2, m_candidate))`.\n\nAfter finding this `m_optimal`, the angle formed will be `m_optimal * (180/n)`.\nThe vertices can be chosen as:\nv2 = 1\nv1 = 2\nv3 = 2 + `m_optimal`\n\nLet's check for edge cases and potential issues:\n1. `n=3`: A triangle. `n-2 = 1`. `m` must be 1. The only possible angle is `1 * (180/3) = 60` degrees.\n   `v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+1=3`. Output: `2 1 3`. This is correct.\n2. `n=4`: A square. `n-2 = 2`. `m` can be 1 or 2.\n   If `m=1`, angle is `1 * (180/4) = 45` degrees. Vertices: `2 1 3`.\n   If `m=2`, angle is `2 * (180/4) = 90` degrees. Vertices: `2 1 4`.\n   The algorithm will choose `m_optimal` based on `a`.\n   Example: `n=4, a=67`. `angle_unit = 45`. `target_m_float = 67/45 = 1.48...`. `round(1.48...) = 1`.\n   `m_optimal = max(1, min(2, 1)) = 1`. Angle: 45 degrees. Vertices: `2 1 3`. Output: `2 1 3`. This matches the example.\n   Example: `n=4, a=68`. `angle_unit = 45`. `target_m_float = 68/45 = 1.51...`. `round(1.51...) = 2`.\n   `m_optimal = max(1, min(2, 2)) = 2`. Angle: 90 degrees. Vertices: `2 1 4`. Output: `2 1 4`. This matches the example.\n\nThe approach seems robust. The `round()` function in Python rounds to the nearest even integer for exact halves (e.g., `round(2.5)` is 2, `round(3.5)` is 4). However, `target_m_float` will only be an exact half if `a / angle_unit` is `X.5`. In such cases, both `floor(X.5)` and `ceil(X.5)` are equally close. Either choice for `m_optimal` would be valid. The problem states \"If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\" So Python's default `round()` behavior is fine.\n\nThe maximum value for `n` is `10^5`. The calculations involve floating-point numbers. `180/n` will be small for large `n`, but standard double-precision floats should be sufficient for accuracy.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Read `n` and `a`.\n2. Calculate `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\n3. Calculate `target_m_float = a / angle_unit`.\n4. Calculate `m_candidate = round(target_m_float)`.\n5. Clamp `m_candidate` to the valid range: `m_optimal = int(max(1, min(n - 2, m_candidate)))`.\n6. Print `2 1 (2 + m_optimal)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # The unit angle for inscribed angles in a regular n-gon.\n    # An angle subtending an arc of 'm' edges will be m * angle_unit.\n    # The sum of angles in an n-gon is (n-2) * 180.\n    # Each interior angle is (n-2)*180 / n.
