            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that will convert a number from one base to another. The input will give me the original base (`a`), the target base (`b`), and the number itself (`c`). The target base can be either a regular integer or the character 'R', which means I need to convert to Roman numerals.\n\nI can break this problem down into smaller steps. First, I'll read the input: `a`, `b_str` (which might be 'R'), and `c_str`. Then, I'll convert `c_str` from base `a` to decimal (base 10). After that, I'll handle the conversion to the target base:\n\n*   If `b_str` is an integer, I'll convert the decimal number to that base.\n*   If `b_str` is 'R', I'll convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nFor the base conversion, I'll create two helper functions: `to_decimal(num_str, base)` and `from_decimal(num_dec, base)`. The `to_decimal` function will take a number string and its base and return its decimal value. It needs to handle digits from '0' to '9' and 'A' to 'Z' for bases greater than 10. The `from_decimal` function will take a decimal number and the target base and return the number's string representation in that base, also dealing with '0'-'9' and 'A'-'Z'.\n\nConverting to Roman numerals is a bit trickier. I'll need a `to_roman(num_dec)` function. I'll use a greedy approach, working from the largest Roman numeral value down. I'll define a mapping of Roman numerals and their values, including subtractive forms (like 'IV' for 4). I will have a mapping like `[(1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), ... , (1, 'I')]`. The problem states the number will be less than or equal to 3000 when using Roman numerals, and never be 0. However, for a general solution, the helper function will return an empty string or the correct output, depending on the requirements, as I need to be as versatile as possible.\n\nThe core of the solution will be in the main section: reading input, calling the helper functions, and printing the result. I will take in the input, convert from base a to decimal, and then based on if the user wants an output of a number with a base between 2 and 25 or in Roman Numerals, I will output the converted number.\n\nI need to make sure I handle edge cases: bases up to 36, leading zeros, and the special 'R' case. I should also test my code thoroughly with several examples. My code needs to be efficient and correct. I'll make sure to check all of these factors as I move forward.\n",
