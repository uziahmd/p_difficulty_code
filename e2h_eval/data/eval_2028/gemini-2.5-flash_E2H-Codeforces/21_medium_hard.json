    "thought": "**Solving the Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to maximize the number of chests I can open.  I've got `n` chests, each with a number `a_i`, and `m` keys, each with a number `b_j`. A key opens a chest if the sum of their numbers (`a_i + b_j`) is odd.  That means one has to be even and the other odd – the \"parity\" has to be different.\n\nFirst, I need to count.  I'll figure out how many chests are even versus odd (`chests_even`, `chests_odd`) and the same for keys (`keys_even`, `keys_odd`).  To maximize the openings, I have to match those different parities: even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. These are *independent* matching scenarios.\n\nThink about it:  I can open at most `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` chests by matching even chests with odd keys. Similarly, I can open at most `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` chests by matching odd chests with even keys.  Since I'm not reusing keys or chests, I can *add* those two results together.  That gives me the total maximum number of chests I can open.\n\nThe key to this is recognizing that the problem breaks down into two separate \"matchings\" based on parity.  Now I just need to write the code.  I'll read in the numbers, count the even and odd ones, and calculate the `min` values. Simple. The code is pretty straightforward: Read the inputs, count the evens and odds, and calculate.  No complex algorithms needed. It's really just about understanding the parity constraint. The most important step is carefully considering the problem to determine the parities.  There are a lot of ways to get tricked into implementing a complicated algorithm, so that is not the case here. My implementation efficiently avoids any excessive space or time complexities. Just be careful to use the *minimum* to not over count, and make sure that a chest or key is not used more than once. The final answer is simply a straightforward sum. It seems pretty straightforward for a \"hard\" rated problem, doesn't it? Let's get this code submitted.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe core condition is `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}`. This means that for the sum to be odd, one of `a_i` and `b_j` must be even and the other must be odd.\nThere are two possible scenarios for a successful pairing:\n1. An even-numbered chest (`a_i` is even) is paired with an odd-numbered key (`b_j` is odd).\n2. An odd-numbered chest (`a_i` is odd) is paired with an even-numbered key (`b_j` is even).\n\nNotice that these two scenarios are completely independent. An even chest can *only* be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can *only* be opened by an even key. This means we can count the maximum pairings for each scenario separately and sum them up to get the total maximum.\n\nLet's define:\n- `chests_even`: the count of chests with even numbers.\n- `chests_odd`: the count of chests with odd numbers.\n- `keys_even`: the count of keys with even numbers.\n- `keys_odd`: the count of keys with odd numbers.\n\nFor scenario 1 (even chests with odd keys):\nWe have `chests_even` available even chests and `keys_odd` available odd keys. Each successful pairing consumes one even chest and one odd key. To maximize the number of such pairings, we can form `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` pairs.\n\nFor scenario 2 (odd chests with even keys):\nWe have `chests_odd` available odd chests and `keys_even` available even keys. Each successful pairing consumes one odd chest and one even key. To maximize the number of such pairings, we can form `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` pairs.\n\nSince the chests and keys used in scenario 1 are distinct in parity from those used in scenario 2 (even chests are different from odd chests, and odd keys are different from even keys), the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum pairings from both scenarios.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `chests_even`; if odd, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `keys_even`; if odd, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=5, m=4`\nChests: `9, 14, 6, 2, 11`\nKeys: `8, 4, 7, 20`\n\n1. **Count chest parities:**\n   - `9` (odd)\n   - `14` (even)\n   - `6` (even)\n   - `2` (even)\n   - `11` (odd)\n   `chests_even = 3` (for 14, 6, 2)\n   `chests_odd = 2` (for 9, 11)\n\n2. **Count key parities:**\n   - `8` (even)\n   - `4` (even)\n   - `7` (odd)\n   - `20` (even)\n   `keys_even = 3` (for 8, 4, 20)\n   `keys_odd = 1` (for 7)\n\n3. **Calculate maximum pairings:**\n   - Even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n   - Odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`.\n\n4. **Total:** `1 + 2 = 3`.\n\nThis approach is efficient. Reading `N` and `M` integers takes `O(N+M)` time, and counting parities is a constant time operation per number. The constraints `N, M <= 10^5` mean `O(N+M)` is well within typical time limits. Memory usage is `O(1)` if numbers are processed as they are read, or `O(N+M)` if stored in lists, which is also acceptable for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize counters for chest parities\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    \n    # Read chest numbers and count their parities\n    # Using map(int, ...) creates an iterator, which is memory-efficient\n    for x in map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()):\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Initialize counters for key parities\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    \n    # Read key numbers and count their parities\n    for x in map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()):\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of chests opened\n    # 1.
