    "thought": "**My Approach to the Neko Does Maths Problem**\n\nAlright, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. My thought process is pretty straightforward, I break it down logically, and I'll lay it all out for you.\n\nFirst off, I need to get a handle on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `k` and the LCM. Since `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`, my main focus is on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a+k` and `b+k`.  Let's call `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`, and `g = gcd(x, y)`. Since `g` divides both `x` and `y`, it must also divide their difference, which is `b-a`.  This is a crucial insight:  `g` has to be a divisor of `|b-a|`.\n\nNow, without loss of generality, let's assume `a <= b` and call `d = b-a`.  This means `g`, my GCD, must be a divisor of `d`. This means I need to iterate through all divisors of `d`.\n\nFor each divisor `g` of `d`, I want to find the smallest `k` such that `a+k` and `b+k` are both multiples of `g`. And I've worked out a neat formula for this.  I need to find the smallest `k` where `(a+k) % g == 0`. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this is `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`. This also guarantees that `b+k` is a multiple of `g`, because `b-a` is a multiple of `g`.\n\nSo my strategy is:\n\n1.  Calculate `d = |b-a|`.\n2.  Find all the divisors of `d`.\n3.  For each divisor `g`, calculate the corresponding `k` using the formula `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n4.  Then, calculate the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k`.\n5.  Keep track of the smallest LCM I've found so far and the `k` that produced it. If I find an equal LCM, I choose the smaller `k`.\n\nI optimized this a bit. I don't actually need the GCD, I'm just after `k` and the final LCM. So I just compute `(a+k)`, `(b+k)` and use the `lcm` formula with the GCD calculation to avoid intermediate overflows.\n\nI also handled the edge case where `a == b` directly. In this situation, the optimal `k` is 0.\nThe entire solution relies on efficiently finding divisors. Thankfully, I can find all divisors of a number up to 10^9 pretty quickly using a loop up to the square root of that number.\nThe overall complexity is therefore O(sqrt(d) * log(max(a, b))) due to gcd which is efficient.\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nLooks good. With all these considerations, and after implementing the logic, I am confident in my solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we should choose the smallest such `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of GCD is that `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`.\nApplying this to our problem, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k)-(a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nThis means that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `|b-a|`. Let `d = |b-a|`.\n\nThis observation forms the basis of our solution:\n1.  **Handle the `a=b` case:** If `a` and `b` are equal, then `d=0`. In this case, `a+k` and `b+k` are always equal. `lcm(X, X) = X`. To minimize `X = a+k`, we should choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`. So, if `a=b`, the answer is `0`.\n\n2.  **General case `a != b`:**\n    *   First, without loss of generality, let's assume `a <= b`. If `a > b`, we can swap them. The value of `d = b-a` will be positive.\n    *   We know that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `d`. Let `g` be a divisor of `d`. We will iterate through all possible divisors `g` of `d`.\n    *   For each divisor `g`, we want to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\n        The smallest non-negative `k` that makes `a+k` a multiple of `g` is `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n        *   If `a % g == 0`, then `a` is already a multiple of `g`, so `k=0`. `(g - 0) % g = 0`.\n        *   If `a % g != 0`, then `k = g - (a % g)`. This `k` will be between `1` and `g-1`. For this `k`, `a+k = a + g - (a % g)`. Since `a - (a % g)` is a multiple of `g`, `a - (a % g) + g` is also a multiple of `g`.\n    *   Once we have this `k`, `a+k` is a multiple of `g`. Since `d = b-a` is also a multiple of `g` (by our choice of `g`), it follows that `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)` will also be a multiple of `g`.\n    *   Now, with this `k`, we calculate `val1 = a+k` and `val2 = b+k`.\n    *   We then compute their actual `gcd(val1, val2)` and `lcm(val1, val2)`.\n        `lcm(val1, val2) = (val1 // gcd(val1, val2)) * val2`. This form is preferred to `(val1 * val2) // gcd(val1, val2)` to prevent potential intermediate overflow if `val1 * val2` exceeds the maximum representable integer (though Python handles large integers automatically, it's good practice).\n    *   We keep track of the minimum `lcm` found so far and the corresponding `k`. If a new `lcm` is smaller, we update both. If a new `lcm` is equal to the current minimum `lcm`, we update `k` only if the new `k` is smaller (as per the problem statement).\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `a` and `b`.\n2.  If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3.  Ensure `a <= b` by swapping if necessary.\n4.  Calculate `d = b - a`.\n5.  Initialize `min_lcm_val = float('inf')` and `min_k_val = 0`.\n6.  Find all divisors of `d`: Iterate `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(d)`. If `i` divides `d`, then both `i` and `d // i` are divisors. Store them in a set to avoid duplicates.\n7.  For each divisor `g` in the set of divisors:\n    *   Calculate `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n    *   Calculate `val1 = a + k` and `val2 = b + k`.\n    *   Calculate `current_gcd = math.gcd(val1, val2)`.\n    *   Calculate `current_lcm = (val1 // current_gcd) * val2`.\n    *   If `current_lcm < min_lcm_val`:\n        `min_lcm_val = current_lcm`\n        `min_k_val = k`\n    *   Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm_val`:\n        `min_k_val = min(min_k_val, k)`\n8.  Print `min_k_val`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (a=6, b=10):**\n\n1.  `a=6, b=10`. Not equal.\n2.  `a=6, b=10`. Already `a <= b`.\n3.  `d = b-a = 10-6 = 4`.\n4.  `min_lcm_val = infinity`, `min_k_val = 0`.\n5.  Divisors of `d=4`: `1, 2, 4`.\n\n    *   **For `g=1`:**\n        *   `k = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = (1 - 0) % 1 = 0`.\n        *   `val1 = 6+0 = 6`, `val2 = 10+0 = 10`.\n        *   `current_gcd = gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n        *   `current_lcm = (6 // 2) * 10 = 3 * 10 = 30`.\n        *   `30 < infinity`, so `min_lcm_val = 30`, `min_k_val = 0`.\n\n    *   **For `g=2`:**\n        *   `k = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = (2 - 0) % 2 = 0`.\n        *   `val1 = 6+0 = 6`, `val2 = 10+0 = 10`.\n        *   `current_gcd = gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n        *   `current_lcm = (6 // 2) * 10 = 3 * 10 = 30`.\n        *   `30 == min_lcm_val`. `min_k_val = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n    *   **For `g=4`:**\n        *   `k = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2`.\n        *   `val1 = 6+2 = 8`, `val2 = 10+2 = 12`.\n        *   `current_gcd = gcd(8, 12) = 4`.\n        *   `current_lcm = (8 // 4) * 12 = 2 * 12 = 24`.\n        *   `24 < min_lcm_val (30)`. So `min_lcm_val = 24`, `min_k_val = 2`.\n\n6.  All divisors processed. Print `min_k_val = 2`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `d` can be up to `10^9`.\n*   Finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(d))` time, which is `O(sqrt(10^9)) approx 31622` operations.\n*   The number of divisors `tau(d)` for `d <= 10^9` is at most `1344` (for `735134400`).\n*   For each divisor, we do constant number of arithmetic operations and a `gcd` calculation, which is `O(log(max(a+k, b+k)))`. `a+k` can be up to `2*10^9`, so `log(2*10^9)` is small (around `log_2(2*10^9) approx 31`).\n*   Total complexity is `O(sqrt(d) + tau(d) * log(max(a,b)))`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # If a and b are equal, then a+k and b+k are always equal.\n    # lcm(X, X) = X.
