Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Amusing Joke\" challenge.  The core of the problem is determining if a pile of letters can be formed by combining two names, possibly shuffled.  Thinking about it, I see that I need to do a few key things.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three inputs: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.  Then, I need to combine the guest and host names into a single string.  The crux of the solution involves comparing the character frequencies.  The essential insight here is that the total count of each letter in the combined name *must* equal the count of that letter in the pile.  Order doesn't matter, just the letter counts.  This also means the lengths of the combined names and the pile must match.\n\nMy plan has two main approaches, one that's more elegant and one that's more manual.\n\nThe more Pythonic approach uses `collections.Counter`.  It's concise and efficient. I'll create a Counter for the combined name and another for the pile.  A simple equality check between the two Counters will give me my answer.\n\nIf I'm restricted or just want to roll my own, I can use frequency arrays. I'd initialize two arrays, each of size 26 (for A-Z), and populate them by iterating through the strings and incrementing the appropriate index for each character.  Then, I'd simply compare the two arrays.\n\nGiven the constraints, I know that the maximum string length is 100, which means the combined name length could reach 200, and the pile of letters is also 100 in maximum. So I won't have to worry about excessive memory usage.\n\nEither way, my script will read the input, calculate the character frequencies, and output \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the comparison. I'm leaning towards the `collections.Counter` method for its simplicity.\n",
