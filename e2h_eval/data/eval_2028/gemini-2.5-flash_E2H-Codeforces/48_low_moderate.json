He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Converting Between Number Bases and Roman Numerals**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this problem.  I need a Python script to handle base conversions, with the added twist of potentially converting to Roman numerals. Let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. This means reading in the source base `a`, the target base `b` (which might be an integer or the string \"R\"), and the number `c` as a string in base `a`.  I'll store these as `a`, `b_str`, and `c_str`.\n\nNext, I have to convert `c_str` from base `a` to a decimal integer.  This is a standard process. I'll need a function called `to_decimal(num_str, base)`.  Since bases can be higher than 10, the input digits might include letters A-Z (representing 10-35).  So I'll need a helper function, `digit_to_value(char_digit)`, to handle this mapping. It's a simple lookup: numbers 0-9 are easy, and for letters, it's `ord(char_digit) - ord('A') + 10`. The conversion itself can be done iteratively, either from left to right or right to left.  Iterating left to right makes calculations much simpler.\n\nNow comes the crucial part: converting from decimal to the target base `b`.  If `b_str` is an integer, I'll need a standard base conversion function. If `b_str` is \"R\", it means Roman numerals! So I'll have to create a separate Roman numeral conversion function.\n\nFinally, I need to output the result. I'll need to remember to remove any leading zeros, of course.\n\nThe input format will be two lines: the first line contains `a` and `b_str`, and the second contains `c_str`.  For example, \"10 2\\n1\" means base 10 to base 2, input is 1, and \"16 R\\n5\" means base 16 to Roman, with 5 as the input.\n\nThere's a note about potential input sizes. Apparently, even though the length of `c_str` is limited to 10^3, the resulting number, if in a base like 25, could be enormous.  Thankfully, the problem statement explicitly says the converted number won't exceed 10^1510. This gives me a bound to keep in mind when designing my number handling.\n",
    "response": "The problem requires converting a number `c` from an arbitrary base `a` to another base `b`. The target base `b` can either be an integer (2 to 25) or the special Roman numeral system, denoted by 'R'.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing**: Read `a` (integer) and `b_str` (string, which could be an integer or 'R'). Then read `c_str` (string representing the number in base `a`).\n\n2.  **Base `a` to Decimal Conversion**:\n    *   We need a function `to_decimal(num_str, base)` that converts a string `num_str` from a given `base` to its decimal (base 10) integer representation.\n    *   Digits '0'-'9' have their usual values. Digits 'A'-'Z' represent values 10-35. A helper function `char_to_val(char_digit)` can convert a character digit to its integer value.\n    *   The conversion logic is standard: `decimal_value = 0`; for each `digit_char` in `num_str`: `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + char_to_val(digit_char)`.\n\n3.  **Decimal to Base `b` Conversion**:\n    *   **Case 1: `b_str` is an integer (e.g., \"2\", \"16\")**:\n        *   Convert `b_str` to an integer `b`.\n        *   We need a function `from_decimal_to_base(decimal_num, target_base)` that converts a decimal number to a string representation in `target_base`.\n        *   A helper function `val_to_char(val)` converts an integer value (0-35) back to its character representation ('0'-'9', 'A'-'Z').\n        *   The conversion logic is standard: repeatedly take the modulo `target_base` for the least significant digit and divide by `target_base` for the next iteration, building the string in reverse. Handle the case of `decimal_num` being 0 separately.\n    *   **Case 2: `b_str` is 'R' (Roman Numerals)**:\n        *   We need a function `to_roman(decimal_num)`.\n        *   Roman numerals have specific symbols and rules (subtractive principle for 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, 900).\n        *   The most efficient way to implement this is to define a list of (value, symbol) pairs in descending order (e.g., `(1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), ...`).\n        *   Iterate through this list. For each `(value, symbol)` pair, repeatedly append `symbol` to the result string and subtract `value` from `decimal_num` as long as `decimal_num` is greater than or equal to `value`.\n        *   The problem statement guarantees that for Roman numerals, the number will be less than or equal to 3000. This simplifies the range of symbols needed.\n\n4.  **Output**: Print the resulting string. Leading zeros are omitted by the conversion logic for non-Roman bases, and Roman numerals inherently don't have leading zeros.\n\n**Helper Functions Detail:**\n\n*   `char_to_val(char_digit)`:\n    *   If `char_digit` is '0'-'9', `int(char_digit)`.\n    *   If `char_digit` is 'A'-'Z', `ord(char_digit) - ord('A') + 10`.\n\n*   `val_to_char(val)`:\n    *   If `val` is 0-9, `str(val)`.\n    *   If `val` is 10-35, `chr(ord('A') + val - 10)`.\n\n*   `to_decimal(num_str, base)`:\n    ```python\n    decimal_value = 0\n    for char_digit in num_str:\n        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + char_to_val(char_digit)\n    return decimal_value\n    ```\n\n*   `from_decimal_to_base(decimal_num, target_base)`:\n    ```python\n    if decimal_num == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    result = []\n    while decimal_num > 0:\n        remainder = decimal_num % target_base\n        result.append(val_to_char(remainder))\n        decimal_num //= target_base\n    return \"\".join(result[::-1]) # Reverse the list and join\n    ```\n\n*   `to_roman(decimal_num)`:\n    ```python\n    roman_map = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman_numeral = []\n    for value, symbol in roman_map:\n        while decimal_num >= value:\n            roman_numeral.append(symbol)\n            decimal_num -= value\n    return \"\".join(roman_numeral)\n    ```\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper function to convert a character digit to its integer value\ndef char_to_val(char_digit):\n    if '0' <= char_digit <= '9':\n        return int(char_digit)\n    else: # 'A' to 'Z'\n        return ord(char_digit) - ord('A') + 10\n\n# Helper function to convert an integer value to its character digit\ndef val_to_char(val):\n    if 0 <= val <= 9:\n        return str(val)\n    else: # 10 to 35\n        return chr(ord('A') + val - 10)\n\n# Function to convert a number from a given base to decimal (base 10)\ndef to_decimal(num_str, base):\n    decimal_value = 0\n    for char_digit in num_str:\n        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + char_to_val(char_digit)\n    return decimal_value\n\n# Function to convert a decimal number to a string in a target base\ndef from_decimal_to_base(decimal_num, target_base):\n    if decimal_num == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    result_chars = []\n    while decimal_num > 0:\n        remainder = decimal_num % target_base\n        result_chars.append(val_to_char(remainder))\n        decimal_num //= target_base\n    \n    return \"\".join(result_chars[::-1]) # Reverse the list and join\n\n# Function to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals\ndef to_roman(decimal_num):\n    if decimal_num == 0:\n        # Problem statement guarantees if Roman numerals included, number won't be 0.\n        # However, for completeness, Roman numerals don't have a symbol for zero.\n        return \"\" \n\n    roman_map = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    \n    roman_numeral = []\n    for value, symbol in roman_map:\n        while decimal_num >= value:\n            roman_numeral.append(symbol)\n            decimal_num -= value\n    \n    return \"\".join(roman_numeral)\n\ndef solve():\n    first_line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(first_line[0])\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    c_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Step 1: Convert c_str from base 'a' to decimal\n    decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\n    # Step 2: Convert decimal_val to target base 'b' or Roman numerals\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        result = to_roman(decimal_val)\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        result = from_decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
