Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Finalized Solution and Thought Process**\n\nAlright, here's my plan. We need to determine if a character grid forms a specific 'X' pattern.  The input is an odd number 'n', and an n x n grid filled with characters.  The rules are straightforward: characters on the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, and top-right to bottom-left) must all be the same, and characters *not* on the diagonals must also be the same. Crucially, the diagonal characters and the non-diagonal characters have to be *different*.\n\nI'll represent the grid as a 2D list. First, I'll read 'n' from the input, then read 'n' lines to fill the grid.  To tackle this, I'll initialize two variables: `diag_char` and `other_char`. I'll also use `None` initially, as their values won't be known yet.\n\nNow, I'll iterate through the grid using nested loops. For each cell, I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If it *is*, and `diag_char` is still `None`, I'll set `diag_char` to the cell's character. If `diag_char` *already* has a value, I'll immediately check if the current character matches it.  If it *doesn't*, I'll print \"NO\" and exit.  Same logic goes for the non-diagonal characters and the `other_char`.\n\nAfter iterating through the whole grid, I'll do a final check: `diag_char` and `other_char` *must* be different. If they are equal, it's \"NO\". Otherwise, it's \"YES\".\n\nI'm confident this approach is efficient because it requires only one pass through the grid, giving it an O(n^2) time complexity.  And since the largest grid size will be 299 x 299, the code will run quickly.\n\nI'll also keep in mind to handle the edge case where `n` could be 3, the smallest possible odd integer that adheres to the rules.\n\nHere's the Python code I've come up with:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    grid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n    diag_char = None\n    other_char = None\n\n    for r in range(n):\n        for c in range(n):\n            is_diagonal = (r == c) or (r + c == n - 1)\n\n            current_char = grid[r][c]\n\n            if is_diagonal:\n                if diag_char is None:\n                    diag_char = current_char\n                elif diag_char != current_char:\n                    sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n                    return\n            else:\n                if other_char is None:\n                    other_char = current_char\n                elif other_char != current_char:\n                    sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n                    return\n    \n    if diag_char == other_char:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"YES\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n",
