Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Verification**\n\nOkay, I need to design a Python script to validate if a given `n x n` grid of characters forms an 'X'. I'm working under the constraints where `n` is guaranteed to be an odd number between 3 and 299.\n\nMy approach will be straightforward:\n\n1.  **Input:** I'll read `n` and then the `n` lines of the grid into a suitable 2D data structure, likely a list of strings.\n\n2.  **Character Identification:**  I'll need to define what makes the grid an 'X'.  I know there are two distinct characters involved: one for the diagonals and one for everything else. I'll efficiently identify the characters on the two diagonals (main and anti-diagonal). Since the center element is part of both diagonals, I'll need to handle it.\n\n3.  **Character Distinction:** The problem specifies that the diagonals must all be the same character, and the non-diagonal elements must all be a *different* character. I'll extract the characters from the grid. Let's initialize `diag_char` with `grid[0][0]` and `other_char` with `grid[0][1]`. This sets up my baseline.\n\n4.  **Grid Traversal and Validation:** I'll then iterate through every cell `(i, j)` in the grid.  For each cell, I'll check its location:\n    *   If it's on a diagonal (`i == j` or `j == n - 1 - i`), I'll ensure its character matches `diag_char`.\n    *   If it's *not* on a diagonal, I'll make sure its character is equal to `other_char`.\n\n    If I encounter any mismatch during this iteration, I'll immediately print \"NO\" and exit, because the grid doesn't form a valid 'X'.\n\n5.  **Final Check:**  After I've checked every cell, I need to ensure that `diag_char` and `other_char` are actually different. If they're the same, it means the grid doesn't form an 'X', and I'll output \"NO.\"\n\n6.  **Success:** If I get through the entire grid and the final check without any issues, I can confidently conclude that the grid forms an 'X', so I'll output \"YES\".\n\nThis design seems efficient and clearly addresses all the requirements of the problem. It should be relatively easy to implement this algorithm in Python.\n",
